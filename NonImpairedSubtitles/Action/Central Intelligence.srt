1
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,819
And now, it's time for a breakdown.

2
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:40,851
Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah...

3
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,878
Man, I told you Robbie
Wheirdicht showers here

4
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,355
during first period.

5
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,316
Why doesn't he just shower at
home like a normal person?

6
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,219
Look at him. Does anything
about that look normal to you?

7
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,791
You know, he's actually
a pretty good dancer.

8
00:01:58,694 --> 00:01:59,703
Let's wreck him.

9
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,473
Hey, Weird Dick!

10
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:04,275
Come on.

11
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,934
Finally, young ladies
and young gentlemen,

12
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,946
it is my pleasure to
announce that the winner

13
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:13,384
of the National High School
Student of the Year Award

14
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,176
is none other than your very own

15
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,012
two-time student
body president,

16
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,624
the captain of Central High's
All Valley track team,

17
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,451
president of the drama club

18
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,929
and the senior voted
"Most Likely to Succeed."

19
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:28,924
I gotta tell you folks, after
40 years as an educator,

20
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,235
he is my favorite student.

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,569
I wish he were my son

22
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,996
if I were medically able
to have children.

23
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:39,476
He's everybody's
favorite all-around guy...

24
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,837
Calvin "The Golden Jet"
Joyner! Come on!

25
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:07,438
Golden Jet!
Golden Jet! Golden Jet!

26
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,297
Oh, my goodness.

27
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,708
Wow. Wow, guys.

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,003
Hey! How about a hand
for Principal Kent, huh?

29
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,780
Huh?

30
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,874
Honestly, if my mom was into
white guys, it would be you.

31
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,076
I know it would, okay?

32
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:25,656
Well, as we all know,
this is our last assembly

33
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,650
which means this is the last
time, in front of you guys

34
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,993
that I'll be able to tell

35
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:31,853
the most beautiful girl in the world...

36
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,022
I'm talking about you, Maggie Johnson,

37
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,701
that I love you.
I love you, baby. I do.

38
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:40,404
I'm gonna put it in my pocket.

39
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,179
I'll save it.

40
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:46,743
All right, guys.
We're seniors now.

41
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,945
And once we get those diplomas,

42
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,549
the decisions that we make
after that are all up to us.

43
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:55,185
I don't know what path
life is gonna take me on.

44
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,845
But I can promise you all this...

45
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,714
That I, for one, will push myself

46
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,716
at every stage, at every step.

47
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,527
So, I got one question to ask.

48
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:07,122
I got one question for the
graduating class of 1996

49
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,333
and that's "Will you..."

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,135
Check out my Weird Dick!

51
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:39,496
Hey. Here, here man.

52
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:41,221
Thank you.

53
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,442
Well, there's no coming back from that.

54
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,344
Calvin Joyner, everybody,

55
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,989
voted "Most Likely
to Succeed."

56
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:10,018
Golden Jet!
Golden Jet! Golden Jet!

57
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,710
Hey. Check it.

58
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:01,378
What is the matter with you? What?

59
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:02,613
What do you mean, "What"?

60
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,047
Why do you think I wanna see that?

61
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:05,549
Well, no, I'm working on
a new sexting app.

62
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:06,842
Okay. It's kind of like
Instagram, right?

63
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,076
But, instead of filters,

64
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,811
it just makes your junk look huge.

65
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,748
Like, three to six inches
bigger. It's amazing.

66
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,126
It's called "Junk Mail."
Clever, right?

67
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,662
You know, right now, this
little walk right here?

68
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:20,421
I kinda want to just take
it away from my life.

69
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,891
Why are you all cranky-pants
this morning, huh?

70
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,537
Oh. It's because Ethan got
promoted instead of you?

71
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:27,804
Ethan got promoted?

72
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,130
Youngest senior associate

73
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,331
in the history of the firm.

74
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,933
Corner office, the whole deal.

75
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,411
Didn't he used to be your assistant?

76
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:36,847
Who cares! Hey, you should
come to lunch with us.

77
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:38,607
We're gonna be
celebrating his pro-mosh!

78
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,242
It'll probably be good for
you to kiss the ring a bit.

79
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,686
"Kiss the ring a bit"?

80
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,146
Hey, you play your chessboard
however you like, okay?

81
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,416
Me, lunch today? I'm gonna
French kiss that thing.

82
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,126
Aah...

83
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:53,296
I can't. I'm taking my wife
to lunch today, so...

84
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:54,756
All right.
Bummer for you.

85
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,958
* 'Cause we gonna get hyphy!

86
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,027
* We gonna get hyphy!

87
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,752
Right?

88
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,299
Can you just get out of my face?

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,024
♪Blessed.

90
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,414
To a guy I not only
consider my coworker,

91
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,149
but my personal friend.

92
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,283
To Ethan!

93
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,008
Cheers!

94
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,656
Do you wanna move tables?
I know this kind of sucks.

95
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,500
No, no. It doesn't suck.

96
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,859
Hey, if I wanted to get
one of those ice teas

97
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,160
but I want most of it to be bourbon...

98
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,228
What is that called?

99
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,606
Okay. How about
we change the topic

100
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,198
to something a little more fun?

101
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,942
Anything else, please.

102
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,176
Oh, how about...

103
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:43,271
This is the dress that I'm
thinking about wearing.

104
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,414
Oh!

105
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:45,641
Honey, I want every single girl

106
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,884
to be jealous tomorrow night.

107
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,952
Oh.

108
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:49,953
What?

109
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,622
I just...
I just don't want to go.

110
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:53,615
Calvin, it's our 20-year
high school reunion.

111
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,950
I'm not gonna go without you.

112
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,385
We agreed we were going.
I RSVP'd for us.

113
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,155
I just changed my mind.
That's all.

114
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,532
Okay. I see.

115
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:04,059
You're disappointed about the promotion.
I get it.

116
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,136
This is not about the promotion.

117
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:08,939
Okay, this has to do with me not
wanting to spend my Friday night

118
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,941
answering the "What are
you doing now?" question.

119
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,433
That's what I'll get
all night. "Hey, Calvin,

120
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,202
"what are you doing now?"
"I'm an accountant."

121
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,370
"An accountant? Really?

122
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,413
"I thought you would
be the governor, man.

123
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,474
"Wait a minute. Didn't you get
voted "'Most Likely to Succeed'?

124
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,951
"I guess we
missed that one."

125
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:22,619
Is this why you've been
so weird and moody, lately?

126
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:23,945
'Cause you're freaking out
about the reunion?

127
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,288
No.
And what's the matter

128
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:26,848
with being an accountant?
You love your job.

129
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,324
No, you love your job.

130
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,351
I'm good at my job.
It's not the same thing.

131
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,519
Honey, that's not fair.

132
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,121
You're a partner at your firm.

133
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,632
I work in a building with a giant,

134
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:37,400
inflatable gorilla out in front of it.

135
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,194
Look, I don't want to be the
guy that peaked in high school

136
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,669
and, after he peaked,
his life went like this...

137
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,676
I don't know the sound
that that thing makes,

138
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,968
but you know what I'm trying to do.

139
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,336
I'm the guy that went down, okay?

140
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,512
Yeah.
Then my life

141
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:50,906
down here became a disappointment.

142
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,373
That's what I'll be.

143
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,417
Wow.

144
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,686
What?

145
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,245
I had no idea that your life with me

146
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,614
was such a soundless,
crashing disappointment!

147
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,224
Don't do that.

148
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,259
That's not... Don't do that.
That's the sound.

149
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:05,020
You want to know the sound
I'm about to make right now?

150
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,487
The sound of me not going.

151
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,212
That's the sound I'm making.

152
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,890
I'm not going.

153
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:14,894
Yeah.

154
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:24,773
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

155
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,323
No.

156
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,726
Not going to that.

157
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,791
Bob Stone?

158
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,747
Okay.

159
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:07,157
Hello?

160
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:09,893
Hey.
Girl, you scared me.

161
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:13,529
I did? Yes. I thought that you were...

162
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,066
I just... On the...

163
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,035
Never mind.
Hey, I'm glad you called.

164
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,229
I'm sorry about lunch today.

165
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:23,707
I'm an idiot, babe.

166
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,033
I don't even know what's
going on with me right now.

167
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,802
I really don't.
Yeah?

168
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,879
Actually, honey,

169
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,239
that's what I was calling
to talk to you about.

170
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,251
Look, honey, I think
that we should see someone.

171
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:38,679
What do you mean, "Someone"?
What do you mean?

172
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,957
See someone, like a therapist.

173
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:43,927
Uh, honey, black people
don't go to therapy.

174
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:45,361
We go to barbershops.

175
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:47,188
That's where we talk out our problems.

176
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,700
Or we watch the movie Barbershop.
One or the other.

177
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:51,326
Look, my parents were really unhappy

178
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,428
for a long time
before they got divorced.

179
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:57,307
And maybe if they saw someone sooner,
they would still be married.

180
00:10:57,432 --> 00:11:00,376
I just want to nip this thing
in the bud, whatever it is.

181
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,046
I don't want to end up like my parents.

182
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:04,605
Wassup?

183
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,330
Wassup?

184
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:14,613
Please, just do it
for me, if not for you.

185
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,761
All right. Uh...

186
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,421
When... When do you
want to do it?

187
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,631
Really?

188
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,624
The doctor said
he could see us at 6:00 p.m.

189
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:24,701
Um...

190
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,227
6:00 p.m., when? Tonight?

191
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,229
Yeah. Yeah,
is that a problem?

192
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,067
Holy shit!
Robbie Wheirdicht.

193
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,904
Calvin, honey? Hello?

194
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,313
Um, yeah.

195
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:40,583
I can't. I already made plans
for tonight, baby.

196
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,776
Plans with who?

197
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,253
With Bob Stone.

198
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:45,380
Who's Bob Stone? That
sounds like a fake name.

199
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,850
No, no. Do you remember Robbie
Wheirdicht, from high school?

200
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,560
No.

201
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:51,853
The guy who got beaten up by
Trisha Demarco at homecoming?

202
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,830
No.

203
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:55,723
The kid that tried to rap along to
Coolio's "1,2,3,4" at the talent show

204
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,667
but then he kinda lost
his way, midway through

205
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,327
so he just started bopping his
head, and he stood there?

206
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,804
No. Nothing.

207
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:01,997
The guy who got thrown out the gym,

208
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,364
butt-ass-naked,
senior year?

209
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,299
Oh, my God, yeah!

210
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,176
Why wouldn't you start with that?

211
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:07,978
Because I thought that was kind of mean.
I don't know.

212
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,604
He never came back
to school after that, right?

213
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,772
Like, not for finals
or graduation or anything.

214
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,075
I'm not sure. I don't
know if he did or not,

215
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,419
but he changed his name to "Bob Stone"

216
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:18,822
and apparently he's in town
for the high school reunion.

217
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,148
He wants to go to dinner tonight,

218
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,391
and I kinda
already said "yes."

219
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:22,550
Okay.
If you want me to cancel,

220
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,860
I will. You know?

221
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:25,695
If that's what you want, I don't mind.

222
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,123
Mmm-mmm. I mean, it's a
little weird, but whatever.

223
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,591
I'll just see if the doctor
can fit us in tomorrow.

224
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,069
How about at lunch time?
Okay. All right, fine.

225
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:34,329
Okay, good. I love you.

226
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,464
I love you, too,
babe. I do.

227
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,337
- Oh, my...
- What is that?

228
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,480
Okay.
Calvin? Are you...

229
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,205
Love you. Bye-bye.

230
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:49,986
No!

231
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:51,721
Stop, stop!

232
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:53,081
Hey, man. I...

233
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,491
Hey! What's up, guys?

234
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:58,494
Congratulations on that promotion, man.

235
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:00,030
It's quite the thing.

236
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,099
Thank you. Hey, that's
not work appropriate.

237
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:04,000
Yup.

238
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,027
Not cool, man. Not cool.

239
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,132
Dude, forward that to me.

240
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,343
For real man, seriously?

241
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,379
Yeah. Watch it, punk.

242
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:28,347
Excuse you, too.

243
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:51,547
My man!

244
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:52,673
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

245
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,398
Calvin. It's me, Bob.

246
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:58,855
Sorry, what?
Do I know you?

247
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,181
Do you know...

248
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,094
Robbie Wheirdicht from high school!

249
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,229
Are you kidding? What?

250
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,722
Wait, you're Robbie Wheirdicht?

251
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,499
Yeah!

252
00:14:09,624 --> 00:14:12,368
God, man, look at you! You've
lost, like, 200 pounds!

253
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,195
I see you gained it back in muscle.

254
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,072
Oh, my God!
You look great!

255
00:14:16,197 --> 00:14:17,807
No, you look great!
Stop it.

256
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:20,601
No, you haven't changed
since high school, dude!

257
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,779
No, you're just sexy as dick right now.

258
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,207
You don't look somebody
in the eyes and say that.

259
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,483
Hey, let's get hammered.

260
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:29,877
I got an early day at work,
so I'll probably...

261
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,346
No, come on, I'm buying!

262
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,680
Oh, shit.

263
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,024
Mmm.

264
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,893
I'm sorry, man.
I am blown away right now.

265
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,828
Dude, you used to be Fat Robbie.

266
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:39,963
Look at you!

267
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,322
This is like a total transformation.

268
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,233
You look like Hercules or somebody.

269
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,959
What did you do?
Come on, give it to me.

270
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,237
I didn't do much, really.
Stop it.

271
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:49,739
All right. Well, I just did one thing.

272
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:51,132
Come on, I need to know.

273
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,409
I worked out
six hours a day, every day,

274
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,270
for the last 20 years straight.

275
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,972
I mean, anybody can do it, right?

276
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,183
Yeah.

277
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:04,687
Yeah. You know,
I've gotten into hot yoga.

278
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,515
I started doing some sessions.

279
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,792
Uh-huh.

280
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,152
Nice unicorn, man.

281
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,688
Oh, yeah,
I'm big-time into 'corns.

282
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,198
So magical, right?

283
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:17,625
You know, they're the most
lethal animal on the planet.

284
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,726
Here you go.

285
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,603
Guys, my name's Lexi.

286
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:22,397
Just let me know if you need anything.

287
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,506
Okay.

288
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,710
I mean, like, anything at all.

289
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,345
Okie-dokie.

290
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,148
You're funny. Do you
ever, like, Snapchat?

291
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:33,341
Oh, no. You know...

292
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,451
I wasn't talking to you.

293
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:37,387
No, no, no.
I don't do that.

294
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:40,014
I'm just catching up with an
old friend from high school.

295
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,350
Aw. You're so sweet.

296
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:45,253
I think unicorns are sexy, too.

297
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,490
That must happen to you
all the time, right?

298
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,101
Ah, nah.

299
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,128
I mean, all that
meaningless sex is just...

300
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,962
It's not my bag anymore, CJ.

301
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,639
Oh.

302
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:58,433
No, now, I'm looking for more
of an emotional connection.

303
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,734
The next woman I lay with,

304
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,569
she's gonna be beautiful on the inside,

305
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,147
just as much as she is on the outside.

306
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:05,415
Hey, wait.
Whatever happened

307
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,142
to that girl that you liked
in high school?

308
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,519
Oh, God, man.
The "Doogie Howser" girl.

309
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,746
She was 14, but somehow
she was a senior.

310
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,356
She wore a cape.

311
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:15,891
Darla McGuckian.
Darla McGuckian.

312
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,727
"Yucky Gucky."

313
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,687
Didn't she have
a lazy eye or something?

314
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,821
Two of 'em.

315
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,298
Right.

316
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:23,358
Hey, but listen, I don't
wanna talk about me.

317
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,834
I wanna talk about you.

318
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,303
I heard that you and
Maggie Johnson got hitched.

319
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:29,205
Yeah, man, right after college.

320
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,132
Wow! The prettiest girl
in school,

321
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,900
and the coolest guy in school!

322
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,310
Oh, man, I got lucky.

323
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:35,670
I mean, you guys are like
a power couple, dude!

324
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,113
No, no.
Yes!

325
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:38,381
You're like Taylor Swift

326
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:40,175
and whoever she's dating right now.

327
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,484
Power.

328
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:42,852
Uh... Thanks!

329
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:44,612
Yeah. You guys got kids?

330
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,988
No. No kids yet.

331
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:47,915
We planned on it after college,

332
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,085
but Maggie went to law school,
I kept changing jobs.

333
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,664
You know, having kids just
isn't in our cards right now.

334
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,090
Not at this point, that's all.

335
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,267
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

336
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,093
Oh, I got an idea.
Let's do shots!

337
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,536
No!

338
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:02,205
I'm sorry for saying
it like that, but no.

339
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,831
I haven't had shots
in almost 10 years, man.

340
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,143
What? Come on, we have to!
We're celebrating!

341
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:09,011
Celebrating what?

342
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:10,638
Celebrating that I'm hanging with
the coolest kid in high school.

343
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,040
Oh, stop it.
Calvin Joyner!

344
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,086
The Golden Jet.

345
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:19,680
You got to be
shitting me. Wow!

346
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,691
I haven't... God!

347
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:24,094
It's been forever
since I heard that, man!

348
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:25,220
I'll do one.
All right!

349
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,496
One shot.
Shots!

350
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:27,497
No. One shot.

351
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:29,865
Just one, okay?
Bob, it's been a while.

352
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,327
Oh, shit! You remember this?

353
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,070
This was the jammy-jam!

354
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:36,231
What's that?
Is that a fanny pack, Bob?

355
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,965
Hell, yeah!
Dude, you want one?

356
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,342
No, it's okay.

357
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,068
I got two at home.
I'll hook you up.

358
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,538
Leather pack for The Jet.

359
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,705
Fanny!

360
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,382
Shit.

361
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:49,009
What the hell did I get myself into?

362
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,753
Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

363
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:53,823
Whoa! Hey, sir, somebody's
actually sitting there.

364
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:54,949
Yeah, someone was.

365
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,292
No! Hey, man!

366
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:57,927
Hey, you don't see
the sweatshirt right here?

367
00:17:58,052 --> 00:17:59,053
Man, somebody's sitting here.
Move your meat,

368
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,396
lose your seat.

369
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:01,722
Dude, you don't have
to be a dick about it.

370
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,358
Somebody's sitting in the chair.

371
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:06,636
Bro, are you seriously
gonna go there, bro?

372
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,963
'Cause there's only one way back, bro.

373
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,332
Through intensive care, bro.

374
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,709
Was that the last "bro"?

375
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,169
'Cause if it was, then I'll talk.

376
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,671
That supposed to be funny?

377
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,014
Hey, now!

378
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,416
What's the rumpus?

379
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,742
You know...
There's no problem, man.

380
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,110
Let's just go to another table.

381
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,320
Get your jacket.
Let's go.

382
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:25,580
No, we're not gonna go anywhere.

383
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,022
Listen to your pussy friend.

384
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,816
Those gym muscles
aren't scaring anybody, pal.

385
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,859
Oh, these?

386
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,218
Let's just go. It's okay.

387
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,529
No, we're not gonna go.
This man insulted you.

388
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,690
And we're not gonna leave
until he apologizes.

389
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:36,566
It's okay.

390
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,000
Hey, we got a problem here?

391
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,827
No, no. Yeah, we got a big problem.

392
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,838
Your friend, here,
really insulted my friend

393
00:18:42,963 --> 00:18:44,031
and he needs to apologize.

394
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,165
I don't think he does.

395
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,267
He doesn't.

396
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,278
Whoa! You know what, man?

397
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:49,545
I think this whole situation's

398
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,705
getting a little out of control.

399
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,206
I can fix this whole thing.

400
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,509
I'll order some nachos.
The "Explosions."

401
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,086
It's got four cheeses!
Let's eat 'em together.

402
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,346
You know what?
You take them.

403
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,522
Let's go.

404
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:00,848
Nah. We're not
going anywhere, Jet.

405
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,383
This whole thing
will be over in a jiff.

406
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,093
Hey, how about this?

407
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:05,320
Why don't you and your boyfriend

408
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,729
apologize to Big Rick here

409
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,123
and then go jerk each other
in the parking lot?

410
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,233
That's a lot...

411
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,401
Yeah. You're right, CJ.

412
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,660
That's a lot of homophobia

413
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,370
coming out of a very angry man.

414
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:16,831
You need to go get that looked
at by a trained professional.

415
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,309
But, since you have
escalated this whole scenario

416
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:20,835
by bringing what I can only assume

417
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,213
is an unlicensed firearm
into this public place,

418
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,740
endangering the lives of
all these innocent people,

419
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,651
I can no longer, in good
conscience, walk away

420
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,645
and jerk anyone off in the parking lot.

421
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,788
I'm afraid we ain't going anywhere.

422
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:34,315
It's time for you
to get out of here, pal.

423
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,492
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

424
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:39,219
There's four of us, tough guy.

425
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,130
Yeah. I got that.

426
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:42,857
All right. Well, before
this whole thing goes down,

427
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,359
you should know one thing about me.

428
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,084
What's that?

429
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:51,307
I don't like bullies.

430
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,119
Let's go, Jet.

431
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,689
Yes.

432
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:09,792
Oh, my God!
I hope he's Catholic.

433
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,096
Oh, my God!

434
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,865
What the hell was that?

435
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,658
Bob, that was amazing! I've
never seen anything like that!

436
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,469
You took the one guy,
you hit him like this.

437
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,795
He couldn't breathe.

438
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,405
I sat there, I'm looking at him...

439
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,039
You talkin' to him like,
"I don't like bullies."

440
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:25,600
I was like, "That's not a
good line." But it was!

441
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,901
I didn't even know you could fight!

442
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,436
You had a unicorn shirt, a fanny pack,

443
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,712
and it totally worked!

444
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,972
You were like Jason Bourne,
man, but with jorts!

445
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,575
How did you do that? Where'd
you learn that stuff?

446
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,519
I took a couple classes at work.

447
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:37,887
I hope I didn't go too far.

448
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:39,814
I'm sorry about ruining the night, Jet.

449
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,417
Ruin my night? No! It was the
coolest thing ever, man!

450
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,826
Really?
Yes!

451
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,252
To see my boy go in and whoop ass

452
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,454
on those idiots back there.

453
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,988
Dude, that was amazing!

454
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,300
Wait, we're boys?

455
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:52,025
Yeah, we boys.

456
00:20:53,227 --> 00:20:54,827
Wow. I...

457
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:57,763
Never had a boy.

458
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,968
That's awesome! Come here!

459
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,712
Oh, wait.

460
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,639
Stop. What's going on, man?

461
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,550
I'm a hugger!
What're you doing?

462
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:10,911
Hey! I got an idea.
Let's roll. Here's my bike.

463
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,247
Wait. That's your bike?

464
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,090
Yeah. Kawasaki 800!

465
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:16,592
I know what the bike is.

466
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:18,553
I had the same bike
in high school, man.

467
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,330
You still ride?
No, man.

468
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:21,522
I haven't ridden a bike in years!

469
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,933
Oh, come on, let's roll.

470
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,762
Where?
Where you trying to go?

471
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:31,407
I know the perfect spot.
Come on, Jet.

472
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,200
You know, why not?
Why not?

473
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,811
After this... Yeah, okay!

474
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,536
Let's roll.

475
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, Bob!
Slow, slow, slow!

476
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,235
Bob, hey, hey!

477
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:52,862
God, this is so crazy, man.

478
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:55,055
This brings back so many memories.

479
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,467
I don't know, CJ.

480
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:58,926
I mean, high school
wasn't easy for me, man.

481
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,436
I don't know if you know this,

482
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:02,405
but I didn't have
many friends back then.

483
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,073
What?

484
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,708
Really?
No.

485
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,134
I don't know why I thought...

486
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,911
True story.
Oh.

487
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,506
Man, I thought high school was
gonna be like Sixteen Candles

488
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,215
and I was gonna be like Molly Ringwald.

489
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,609
Sure, things were
difficult in the beginning,

490
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,151
but then, by the end,

491
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:17,487
everything worked out.

492
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,914
And Jake Ryan picked her up
in that red Porsche.

493
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,090
What-what?

494
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,292
You ever see that movie?

495
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,495
I'm black, so I don't know the...

496
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,187
Oh. You gotta
see it, dude.

497
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,466
Total classic. It's my
favorite all-time movie.

498
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:31,792
Then I realized high school

499
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,737
was nothing like Sixteen Candles.

500
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,931
And I'll never be like Molly Ringwald.

501
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,635
Yeah, well, depends on who you ask.

502
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,537
That's the thing.
For me, I...

503
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:46,048
What's going on?

504
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:49,018
Oh, wow.

505
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:50,978
Hey, man, I just wanna say
that I'm really sorry

506
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,753
about what Trevor and those
guys did to you back then.

507
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:03,599
No biggie. I don't even
think about it anymore. No.

508
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:05,100
Okay, good.

509
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:07,061
Yeah. Here's the secret.
You know what I did, Jet?

510
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,496
I took all that stuff and
I balled it up real tight

511
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,475
and then I shoved it way down deep.

512
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,869
And I just pretty much ignore it.

513
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:18,047
You know, that sounds
really unhealthy, Bob.

514
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:19,214
Hey, I gotta tell you.

515
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:21,375
You were the only one
who helped me out that day.

516
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,943
In the gym?
Remember that?

517
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,521
And you gave me your lettermans jacket!

518
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:26,881
Hey, not for nothing,

519
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,183
but I never got that jacket back, man.

520
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,118
Huh! Really?

521
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,062
Strange.

522
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:34,488
Hey, but, listen,
I just wanna thank you

523
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,723
for what you did for me that day.

524
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,391
That was really cool of you, Jet.

525
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,703
Stop, man. It was the right
thing to do, you know?

526
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,029
You wanna hear something weird?

527
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,105
What?

528
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,265
I have not been naked since that day.

529
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,101
I mean, not in front of anyone.

530
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,410
Never.

531
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,137
So, you're telling me
that for the last 20 years,

532
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,939
you've never been seen
in your birthday suit?

533
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,373
What about when you have sex?

534
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,610
I keep it pitch-black,
just like Vin Diesel.

535
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:58,779
Hey, Bob, look, if you
ever wanna talk, I'm here.

536
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,890
So I don't mind, you know?

537
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:02,316
I don't mind at all, if you wanna...

538
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,041
What?

539
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:09,565
Whoa. This is all our stuff
from our year!

540
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,891
Yeah. Must be getting ready

541
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,568
for the reunion tomorrow night.

542
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:13,994
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

543
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,096
What? No! "Get out..."
Look, you're all over this!

544
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,900
Look at this. Basketball,
baseball, cross country.

545
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,176
Hamlet.

546
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:22,311
Prom King.

547
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:23,913
There's Darla McGuckian.

548
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:26,248
Synchronized swimming, that's so sexy.

549
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:27,817
This is like the Guinness Book

550
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:30,144
of Golden Jet Records right there.

551
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,321
I see that.

552
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:35,558
To be honest with you, I don't
even recognize this guy anymore.

553
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,184
This guy, here, he was gonna...

554
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,353
He was gonna conquer the world.

555
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:42,356
If 18-year-old me
could see me now,

556
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,591
he'd probably think
I was a total loser.

557
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,336
What? That's crazy talk!

558
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:49,163
You're The Golden Jet, dude! Stop.

559
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:52,808
Stop, Bob. Spare me
with The Golden Jet shit.

560
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,269
I'm not The Golden Jet, man.
I'm an accountant.

561
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,994
That's my reality.

562
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:03,018
I just thought I was
meant for more, you know?

563
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:05,379
My life would be something special.

564
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:08,215
You know how they say every man

565
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,826
is the hero of his own story?

566
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:12,662
Was that in Twilight?

567
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:15,297
No, I don't think
that's where it's from.

568
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:17,667
But those books are cool,
right? Vampires!

569
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,660
Oh, and there's a wolf-boy.

570
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:24,774
I'm not... I'm not talking
about Twilight, Bob, okay?

571
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,133
I'm talking about the fact
that I don't feel like

572
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,977
I'm the hero
of my own story. That's...

573
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:29,870
How are you not the hero
of your own story?

574
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,280
No one else can be!

575
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,215
Yo, CJ, I gotta be
honest with you, man.

576
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,042
I mean, all this talk
about Calvin Joyner

577
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,543
not feeling like he's a hero...

578
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,578
That's crazy talk, man.

579
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,122
No. No, it's not.

580
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,449
You were the best thing
about high school.

581
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,984
I'll always believe in you.

582
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,862
Yo, do you remember those
backflips you used to do?

583
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:48,756
The crowd would go crazy!
I was there, too.

584
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,891
I was, like,
"What? How's he do that?"

585
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,616
How did you do that?

586
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:56,138
I don't know.
I just did it, man.

587
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,406
Exactly.

588
00:25:57,531 --> 00:25:59,308
So, do it now.

589
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,511
No, no. You're crazy! No.

590
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:03,813
What's that?

591
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,139
What're you talking about?
What's what?

592
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,707
Golden Jet!
No, stop it.

593
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,642
Golden Jet!
Okay, stop it!

594
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,410
Golden Jet!
All right.

595
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,754
Golden Jet!

596
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:15,049
I'm not gonna stop until
you do The Golden Jet flip!

597
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,258
Golden Jet!

598
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:18,252
All right, everybody,
settle down. Settle down!

599
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,963
If the crowd wants a Golden Jet flip,

600
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:23,123
then they gonna get a Golden Jet flip.

601
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,848
You go, girl!

602
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:30,205
Oh, God!

603
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,099
That was so close, Jet.

604
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,144
Here, buddy. Come on.

605
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,219
They must have just waxed these floors.

606
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,141
That was definitely a first, man.

607
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,319
Oh, man, I am beat.

608
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:46,044
Oh.

609
00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:48,624
Hey, Jet!

610
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:52,286
Man, I had a great time tonight.

611
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,729
Whoa.

612
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,865
You know what? I had a
good time, too, man.

613
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,591
I feel like I needed this, you know?

614
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,302
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too!

615
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:01,470
Thank you.

616
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:03,739
My pleasure, amigo.
Anytime.

617
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:07,634
Hey, if there's ever anything I can
do for you, just say the word.

618
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,612
Wow. You really mean that?

619
00:27:10,737 --> 00:27:12,081
Yeah.

620
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:14,750
I wasn't gonna bring it up,
but I might as well.

621
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,043
Lately, I've been having this problem

622
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,654
with my payroll account.
And, um...

623
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,522
It's all screwed up, somehow.

624
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:23,617
You know, I was overseas working
for a while before I got fired.

625
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,727
So, it's kinda like

626
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,486
a forensic international account thingy

627
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:30,124
which, I think, is kind
of your specialty, right?

628
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,601
Um...

629
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:36,138
Yeah, no, it is. I'll take
a look at that for you.

630
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,664
You would?
You would do that for me?

631
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,774
I've got the login info,

632
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:40,434
if you wanna crack open your computer,

633
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,144
we can do this!

634
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,713
Oh, you mean now?

635
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:46,006
That's awesome! Yeah!
Okay.

636
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,075
Look at this!
Hey, Bob...

637
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,084
Whoa!

638
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,544
Bob, you gotta keep your voice down!

639
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,022
Maggie's sleeping.

640
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:54,223
Wow.

641
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:55,950
This is a pretty serious international

642
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,760
account dossier you've got here.

643
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,419
Right? I just want
to make sure

644
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,521
everything was hunky-dory.

645
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:07,194
Going to your router.

646
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,997
Now you're talking to me.

647
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,399
Bingo.

648
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,743
I'm in.

649
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:16,303
Oh. That's great, Jet.
Thank you, man!

650
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,884
I mean, just looking
at it first-hand,

651
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:23,143
it kinda looks like it's a bunch

652
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,254
of off-shore
escrow accounts.

653
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:28,858
These have been backwashed
into a series of domestic

654
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:30,525
dummy accounts for some reason.

655
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,695
I mean, the logs are all crazy, too.
You have China,

656
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,098
Syria, Iran.

657
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,823
This is an auction site, Bob!

658
00:28:39,293 --> 00:28:40,970
These are bids.
All of these.

659
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,773
This is hundreds of millions of
dollars in bids, right here.

660
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:45,240
And judging by this clock, here,

661
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:46,800
it says it's all gonna end tomorrow.

662
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,311
Whoa! What the hell?

663
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,345
Why?

664
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,280
What did...

665
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:53,007
Oh! I'm sorry, Jet!
Bob!

666
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,818
Jet, I'm so sorry!
Oh, man.

667
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,019
I'm all thumbs.

668
00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:58,245
It's my computer!

669
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,955
I'm sorry.
No! Please, Bob.

670
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,315
I'm sorry, Jet.
Leave it. I got it.

671
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,951
It's fine, Bob.
It's fine. Just leave it.

672
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,485
The worst!

673
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,896
God!

674
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:09,331
Hey! What the hell
was that on that site?

675
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,491
That didn't have anything
to do with payroll.

676
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,827
I don't know. I've never
seen that before.

677
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:14,904
That was crazy.

678
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:16,305
Let's figure it out tomorrow

679
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,797
when we're bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

680
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,309
What do you say, CJ?
I am beat.

681
00:29:20,434 --> 00:29:22,644
Hey, do you mind if I crash here?

682
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,546
Um...

683
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:26,271
No.

684
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:29,609
Let me go grab some blankets.

685
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:36,883
Hey, thanks for the jammies, Jet.

686
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:40,429
Okay, well, you can keep those.

687
00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:42,589
Those are...
Those are officially yours.

688
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:46,035
Yeah.

689
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,838
All right.
Oh.

690
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:50,164
You gonna sleep with your fanny pack.

691
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,533
Golden Jet!
Yeah, it's my baby.

692
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:08,348
You, uh, need anything else?
You're okay?

693
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:11,418
I can't believe I'm having a sleepover

694
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,520
at Calvin Joyner's house right now.

695
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,691
This is blowing my mind!

696
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,101
Okay.

697
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:21,103
Uh, good night, Bob.

698
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:22,828
Good night, Jet.

699
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,850
Me?

700
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,575
Yeah, you.

701
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,734
What the hell?

702
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:56,729
One second.

703
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,993
Hold on.

704
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:08,050
Uh, may I help you?

705
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:09,509
Mr. Joyner,
my name is Pamela Harris,

706
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,079
I'm with the Central
Intelligence Agency.

707
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,756
Have you had any contact with this man?

708
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:17,792
Uh, yeah, he's on my...
He's on my couch sleeping.

709
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,985
Target's in the house.

710
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,288
What's going on? Hey!

711
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,124
Excuse me. Excuse me!

712
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:29,438
Target's fled.

713
00:31:29,563 --> 00:31:30,639
Shit.

714
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,865
Target's on the move.

715
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,590
Excuse me! What...

716
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,048
Hello, hey! Excuse me!

717
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,240
And voice chatter in the vicinity.

718
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,951
Hello! Excuse me!

719
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:43,577
If he's in the wind again, it's
gonna be your ass. Go now.

720
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,046
Hello! Alert Langley,
asset uncontained.

721
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,322
Excuse me!

722
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,091
Can I help you?
Hello!

723
00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:50,784
It's my house.
Is something going on?

724
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,061
Well, Mr. Joyner,

725
00:31:52,186 --> 00:31:53,387
your sleepover buddy, Robert Wheirdicht

726
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,464
is wanted for murder and treason

727
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:56,898
and is presently in possession

728
00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:58,358
of highly classified state secrets

729
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,127
which he intends to sell
to our enemies.

730
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,271
You mind?

731
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:05,407
Creamer's in the fridge.
What?

732
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:06,942
I don't need it.

733
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,002
What I do need is information.

734
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,947
I need you to tell me
everything and anything

735
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:14,683
about your contact with Agent Stone.

736
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:15,750
Agent Stone?

737
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,311
Bob, your friend Bob.

738
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,155
Come on.
Stay with me, please.

739
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,482
Okay, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

740
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,693
No. No, he is not
my friend.

741
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,886
Then why did he list you
as his emergency contact

742
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,155
in all his personnel forms?

743
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,398
I'm sorry... He what?

744
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:30,957
Bob Stone has no siblings, or parents,

745
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,192
or family of any kind.

746
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,460
You are the only person

747
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,895
he listed in his personal references.

748
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,372
Oh...

749
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,674
That's crazy, all right?
I barely even know the guy.

750
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,310
Then, why was he sleeping
on your couch?

751
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:42,936
Because we went out
and had drinks last night.

752
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,580
Oh, so you went out drinking
with your non-friend?

753
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:47,116
Okay.

754
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:49,042
All right, let's...
You're not...

755
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,185
Time out.

756
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,711
I'm pressing the time out button.

757
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,114
Okay? You guys barged
in my house.

758
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,390
I pay my taxes.

759
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,750
So you're not gonna come here

760
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,860
and treat me like I'm the enemy, okay?

761
00:32:58,985 --> 00:33:00,129
That's the first thing.

762
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:01,255
Now, if you want to get into facts...

763
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,897
You wanna talk about facts?

764
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,191
This is Facebook's fault.

765
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,792
He sent me a friend request.

766
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,794
That's how this whole thing started.

767
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,271
And you accepted?

768
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:11,064
Don't do that.
Don't do that to me.

769
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,609
You give me a second. Okay?
Don't fire back like that.

770
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:17,103
First of all, fuck Mark
Zuckerberg, all right?

771
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,448
Now, I accepted
because it was Facebook.

772
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:20,915
And it's rude when you don't accept it

773
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,209
and I don't know if
the person on the other end

774
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,618
can see me not accept it.

775
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:24,611
That's why I accepted.

776
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,680
Are you nervous,
Mr. Joyner?

777
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:27,822
Is it hot?

778
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:29,683
Are you getting hot?
Because I'm getting hot.

779
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,251
I'm not gonna take off my jacket

780
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,086
because that makes me look guilty.

781
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,789
And that's what
you guys look for. Hmm?

782
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,425
Is this what a guilty man would do?

783
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,702
Look how comfortable I am.

784
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:42,771
Mr. Joyner,
your friend Bob Stone

785
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,039
is a dangerous psychotic.

786
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:45,232
You're lucky to be alive.

787
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,366
Okay, listen to me.

788
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,303
This man is not, I repeat to you,

789
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:53,106
he is not, not, my friend!

790
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,617
Zero allegiance.

791
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,920
All right, Mr. Joyner.
Prove it.

792
00:33:59,045 --> 00:34:00,647
Yeah, well, I need a second.

793
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,583
You gotta step outside.
I gotta take a shit.

794
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,718
This is a lot.

795
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,721
I got to go.
Just give me a second, man!

796
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,156
I'll be waiting.
Jesus Christ!

797
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,343
All teams be advised,

798
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:22,911
we're Oscar Mike with the bait.

799
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:24,871
I'm sorry, did you just
call me "the bait"?

800
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,181
No.

801
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:27,207
Yeah, you did.
She just called me the bait.

802
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:28,550
Why am I the bait?

803
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,210
No, that doesn't sound like
something I'd ever say.

804
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,287
You just said it.
What's going on here?

805
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:34,147
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step aside.

806
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,491
This is a matter of national security.

807
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,826
Yeah, right!
I love it.

808
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,419
What is this?
Like a strippergram thing

809
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,562
to suck up to Ethan?

810
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,188
Gotta love strippers.
So dirty.

811
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,291
Show us your tits!
Show us your tits!

812
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,102
Hey, let's see some titty!

813
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,274
This you?
Yeah, right here.

814
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,200
You did this to yourself.

815
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,582
Small.

816
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:03,017
Yeah.

817
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,319
Calvin Joyner, Accounting.

818
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,166
Hello? Calvin Joyner,
Accounting.

819
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,891
Calvin?

820
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:23,872
It's Bob! It's Bob!

821
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,231
Act natural.

822
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,467
Calvin. Is that you?

823
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,311
Are you there?

824
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:32,614
Well, hey. Well, yeah.

825
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,150
Yeah, wassup?

826
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:37,919
What up, Bobby-o?

827
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:40,222
Are you quite well?

828
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,556
I'm in big trouble.

829
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,817
Oh, God! I screwed up.
I screwed up big time.

830
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,195
We gotta talk.
Can you meet me?

831
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,396
Sure. Yeah. Where?

832
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,298
Where do you want me to meet you?

833
00:35:49,423 --> 00:35:51,090
I'm in the stairwell of your
building, two flights down.

834
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,168
Stairwell?
Hurry!

835
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:55,962
He's in the stairwell, two flights down!
Move, move!

836
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,272
Alert Charlie team.

837
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:59,040
Hold on. What's going on?
Am I safe here?

838
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:01,234
As long as Bob Stone is in
the building, no one's safe.

839
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,370
Get back in your office now!

840
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:08,850
Okay!

841
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:11,378
Good news is we heard her, guys.

842
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,414
So, everybody,
let's all just stay calm.

843
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,050
As long as...
As long... Shit!

844
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,121
What the hell is going on?

845
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,565
Relax.
Hey.

846
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,258
Great job at getting
them out of here, Jet.

847
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,601
Oh, Bob!
That's teamwork!

848
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,428
Wait! How did you...
What did you just do?

849
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,996
It's a tradecraft, buddy.

850
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,398
Spoiler alert...

851
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,799
I'm in the CIA.

852
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,042
Oh, no shit!

853
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:35,810
Hey, hey! What're you
doing with my phone?

854
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,437
You about to turn my phone
into a bomb, aren't you?

855
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,706
I've seen Homeland.
So I know what they do.

856
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,409
Homeland? No,
I'm ordering us an Uber.

857
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,886
Six minutes.
That's kinda tight.

858
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:47,256
I'm gonna need your tie.

859
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:48,557
You're gonna... No!

860
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:49,958
Your necktie, take it off. No,

861
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,618
I'm not taking my tie off!
Come on, Jet!

862
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,295
Don't do that. Don't do that.

863
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,588
That's good.
Save it, save it, save it.

864
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,989
Save it, Jet.
Fine, take it, take it.

865
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,824
There we go, just right over here.

866
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,626
You can have it.
Okay, that...

867
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,127
Listen to me. Listen.

868
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,371
Stop. Stop!

869
00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:04,431
I need to know what is
happening, right now.

870
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,566
Okay, okay. You know what?
Moving too fast.

871
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,479
Bottom line, are you in or you out?

872
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,038
What are you...
In or out of what?

873
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,541
Mmm-mmm. No time for
questions, just action.

874
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,051
In or out? Okay, well, then I'm out.

875
00:37:17,176 --> 00:37:19,446
I'm sorry, Jet.
Actually you're already in.

876
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,889
Then why would you ask me?

877
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:22,857
Because I thought
you would go, "I'm in, Bob!"

878
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:24,451
And we would've
had a really cool moment,

879
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,119
but you kinda ruined the whole thing.

880
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,195
I ruined...

881
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,397
Okay, okay, okay.

882
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:29,864
Listen to me right now.

883
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,725
Bob, I don't know what it is
that you're into

884
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,393
but what I do know is that

885
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:34,961
I am really, really

886
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,372
100% out!

887
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,565
Do you understand that?

888
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,933
God, you are good!

889
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,042
What?

890
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:42,669
Calvin Joyner, president
of the Drama Club

891
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:43,812
for a reason, folks!

892
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:45,439
You're like
a snack-size Denzel.

893
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,582
Okay. Stop it,
stop it, stop it.

894
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:49,250
This is not a game.

895
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,386
I'm being serious right now.

896
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,111
I'm out!

897
00:37:55,348 --> 00:37:56,525
Okay. Okay.

898
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,294
I can't say I'm not disappointed, Jet,

899
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,920
but if you're out, you're out.

900
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,697
Thank you! I'm out!

901
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,058
Well, I'm just happy
that we can communicate

902
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,635
openly and honestly.

903
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,338
I think it says a lot
about our relationship.

904
00:38:09,463 --> 00:38:12,341
Wait, hold up, wait. What're you doing?
Oh, my God!

905
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:13,675
Here's the thing, though.

906
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,301
There's only one way
for you to get out.

907
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,478
What's that?

908
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:18,037
You gotta get in first.

909
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,381
What is it that...

910
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,807
What-what!
Take my gun, Jet,

911
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,517
we may have to kill some people.

912
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:23,643
Come on, it's not gonna bite you.

913
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,953
I will do no such thing.

914
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:26,045
I think you'll like it.

915
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,381
I will not!
You're gonna need it.

916
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:31,184
You're gonna need it!
He's in here!

917
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,293
Jet.

918
00:38:32,418 --> 00:38:34,821
He's in there!
Bob's in there!

919
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,832
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!

920
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:41,703
Down, down, get down!
Move, move, move!

921
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:43,229
All right. I'm gonna need
your improv skills.

922
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,305
What?

923
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,965
Hostage role-play,
you ready?

924
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,908
No!

925
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,835
Sweet, let's go.
No, I said no!

926
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,044
I said no!

927
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:52,414
He's got a hostage!

928
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,548
No!

929
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:55,742
No! Stop it,
you gonna get me killed!

930
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,810
Don't shoot!

931
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,435
There we go, Jet!

932
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,836
Hang tight, Jet! No, I'm
not doing anything!

933
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,804
Stop including me in your stuff!

934
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,007
Get him, Agent!
Hit him with the stick!

935
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,380
He got a coffee pot!

936
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,199
He got a banana!

937
00:39:58,504 --> 00:40:01,082
Oh! Oh!

938
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,807
Freeze!

939
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:15,454
Jet, help!

940
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,398
What?

941
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:19,668
Golden Jet, help.

942
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,393
No, man, I'm not helping you!

943
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,440
Oh, shit.

944
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:26,866
Give me the gun!
Stop it!

945
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,602
Stop resisting!
No, let me go!

946
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:34,207
Let me go! I'm trying
to give it to you!

947
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:38,453
Oh, shit!

948
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:39,813
That was an accident!
Don't move!

949
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,538
No, stop! Listen to me!

950
00:40:44,017 --> 00:40:45,560
Let's go.

951
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:47,662
Wait, wait! Oh, come on!
What are you... Ah!

952
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:49,163
Come on, man!

953
00:40:49,288 --> 00:40:51,257
This has gotta stop! Okay?

954
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:54,792
Shit!

955
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,775
Don't shoot!

956
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,777
Oh, God!
Show us your hands!

957
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:04,671
Drop your weapon!
Do it now!

958
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:14,923
Ow.

959
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:16,057
Sorry, Jet.

960
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,259
It's over, Bob. Give up.

961
00:41:18,384 --> 00:41:19,919
You know I can't do that, Pam.

962
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,488
There's nowhere to run, Agent Stone.

963
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,298
Just like Caracas.

964
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:25,692
Uh, Caracas would've worked

965
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,394
if you trusted me
like Calvin trusts me.

966
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,638
No. No.

967
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:31,540
That is not true.
I do not trust him!

968
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:32,732
I do not trust him at all.

969
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,175
As a matter of fact,

970
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,744
this is a perfect time
for us to clear this up

971
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:36,770
especially in the middle
of this standoff.

972
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:37,704
I shouldn't be here!

973
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,013
So I feel like me being

974
00:41:39,138 --> 00:41:40,339
in the middle of this throws me in it.

975
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,741
So let me exclude myself.

976
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,384
Hey, stay down!
Don't move!

977
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:46,045
Okay, all right.
I'll stay in. I'll stay in.

978
00:41:47,747 --> 00:41:49,357
I got a plan.

979
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:50,825
Might get us both killed

980
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,551
but if it works, it'll be
a totally boss story.

981
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,628
Cool?

982
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:55,697
No! No, it's not cool!
Cool.

983
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:57,023
No, I said it's not cool.

984
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,958
I said it's not cool!

985
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,602
Time's up.

986
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,503
You're right, Pam.

987
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:03,730
My time is up.

988
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,775
In three, two,

989
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,210
one.

990
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:17,686
Bob, Bob, Bob!

991
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,055
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

992
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,591
Oh, shit!

993
00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:24,316
Whoo-hoo!

994
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:40,809
Whoo!

995
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,802
Wow! Did you
feel that, Jet?

996
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,604
That was the balls right there!

997
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,320
Get it off!

998
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,045
You guys order an Uber?

999
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,892
What are you doing?

1000
00:42:58,017 --> 00:42:59,552
You better get your tuchus in the car.

1001
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,686
You're gonna get shot!

1002
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:01,988
Don't shoot me! Shoot him!

1003
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,432
Shoot him! I'm out!
I'm out! I'm out!

1004
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:07,060
Let me in! Let me in!
Let me in! Go, Bob!

1005
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:14,008
Put the word out to all assets.

1006
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,969
I'm doubling the price on Bob's head.

1007
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,212
Hey, what the shit, honey...

1008
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:21,040
Get Larry on it.

1009
00:43:26,245 --> 00:43:27,588
Car, car, car!

1010
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:29,323
All right, well,
here's the dilly-o, Jet.

1011
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:31,217
About three weeks ago,
an enemy of the state

1012
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,227
codenamed "The Black Badger"

1013
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:35,822
stole the encryption keys to the
entire US spy satellite program

1014
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,331
which he's gonna sell to a buyer

1015
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:39,192
from that auction site
on your computer last night.

1016
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,201
Bob...

1017
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,903
If we lose control of our satellites,

1018
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:44,238
we're completely vulnerable
to any terrorist attacks.

1019
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:46,365
That's why I had to go back to
your office and get you, Jet.

1020
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,242
I need your super sweet
accounting skills

1021
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:50,369
to help me figure out the
last piece of this puzzle

1022
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,906
which is the transaction
number from the winning bid.

1023
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:55,231
That'll tell us where
the deal is going down.

1024
00:43:56,776 --> 00:43:59,187
That way, we can get The Black Badger.

1025
00:43:59,312 --> 00:44:00,646
I can't do it without you, Jet.

1026
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,956
Stop the car.

1027
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:03,917
You stop the car right now!
Stop the car!

1028
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:05,952
Okay, okay.
That's a great idea, Jet.

1029
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,987
We should get off the grid right now.

1030
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,622
Whoa!

1031
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,997
All right. We're clear.

1032
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,079
Okay.

1033
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,606
Okay. Let's just take
some deep breaths.

1034
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,918
Okay? Deep breaths.

1035
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,486
All you gotta do is get out of this car

1036
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:34,914
and have a rational
conversation with Bob

1037
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,639
and he'll understand.

1038
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:48,027
Robert, I would like to
go home now, please.

1039
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,670
Buddy, you and me both.

1040
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:52,173
But until we clear our names,
there's no going home.

1041
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:54,675
I'm sorry, can you clarify
that last sentence for me?

1042
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,102
Yeah, well, now that you're in...

1043
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:58,504
Let me stop you
right there. I'm not in.

1044
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,114
I never said that I was in.

1045
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,084
In fact, I expressly remember
saying that I was out!

1046
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:04,844
I know, but they think you're in.

1047
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,220
I am...

1048
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:08,289
I'm freaking out!
I'm out!

1049
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,124
What's left to tell?
Hey, no, I get it.

1050
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,784
I'm not in! I'm just saying
they think you're in.

1051
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,653
I'm not in! I am not in!
I get it.

1052
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,564
I'm not in! I'm out!

1053
00:45:16,689 --> 00:45:19,758
One sec, Jet, just
gotta disable the GPS.

1054
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,069
Where did you...

1055
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:22,862
You wanna go under...
That's fine!

1056
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:24,072
Wait a minute.

1057
00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:26,299
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

1058
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,868
This whole thing was done on purpose.

1059
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:30,636
This is your plan!

1060
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,280
You tricked me!

1061
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:34,849
It's fine, but I know you tricked me.

1062
00:45:34,974 --> 00:45:36,575
Trick you? You tricked... Hey, boy!

1063
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,643
What?

1064
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:38,987
What'd you just...

1065
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,413
I didn't trick you,
you offered to help me.

1066
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,048
You know what's funny?
Harris told me.

1067
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:43,457
She told me everything, man.

1068
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:45,093
She told me that you stole the codes.

1069
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:46,319
Let me tell you something about Harris.

1070
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:48,262
You can't trust her, all right?

1071
00:45:48,387 --> 00:45:49,956
She's already trying to frame
me for my partner's murder!

1072
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,800
You killed your partner?
No.

1073
00:45:51,925 --> 00:45:52,934
I would never do that.

1074
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,235
The Black Badger killed my partner.

1075
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,628
Let me explain to you something, dude.

1076
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,671
This is what happened.

1077
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,266
After The Black Badger stole the
satellite encryption codes,

1078
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:04,070
my partner Phil and I tracked
him to a penthouse in Kiev.

1079
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:05,814
Hey, Phil.
Yeah.

1080
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:08,216
I'll see you on the other side.

1081
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:10,143
See you on the other side.

1082
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,821
All right.

1083
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:14,388
God, I love that guy.

1084
00:46:14,513 --> 00:46:16,049
He knew we were coming,
so he set a trap.

1085
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,384
Hey, Bob! Bob!

1086
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,527
No!

1087
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,763
Phil was my partner, my teammate

1088
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:23,957
and I couldn't save him.

1089
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,682
No!

1090
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,003
It was awful, Cal.

1091
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:30,978
It was a setup,
right from the get-go.

1092
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:33,707
Damn, man.

1093
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,301
The Black Badger was never there.

1094
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,836
I should've been the one
on that elevator, not Phil.

1095
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,980
God.

1096
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:41,415
Okay. Bob, please...

1097
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,010
I'm begging you, man. Can
you just let me go home?

1098
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,486
CJ, I totally understand.

1099
00:46:45,611 --> 00:46:47,513
But right now, Agent
Harris and her taskforce

1100
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,357
has that place surveilled
up the yin-yang.

1101
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:51,217
She's got contract killers
looking for us.

1102
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:52,751
Your place isn't safe.

1103
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,428
Oh, my God. Maggie.

1104
00:46:54,553 --> 00:46:57,253
Maggie! What the hell am I
supposed to do about Maggie?

1105
00:46:59,225 --> 00:47:00,825
Get down, Jet!

1106
00:47:09,802 --> 00:47:11,980
Shit! Oh!

1107
00:47:12,105 --> 00:47:13,705
Look out, Bob!

1108
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:27,820
Who the hell is that?
Who is that? Bob?

1109
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,545
Oh, shit.

1110
00:47:34,493 --> 00:47:36,093
Larry.

1111
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,865
Thought you retired.

1112
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,442
I did.

1113
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,545
But you're worth a lot of
money, Bob, dead or alive.

1114
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,305
Well, tough luck,
because I've got back up.

1115
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,030
Ain't that right, Jet?

1116
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:52,186
Jet!

1117
00:48:07,993 --> 00:48:09,593
Okay.

1118
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:16,177
Hey, baby. I know.
I'm sorry I'm late.

1119
00:48:16,302 --> 00:48:18,346
The stupid Koplin deposition ran long.

1120
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:20,539
I'm leaving right now.
I'll meet you at the house.

1121
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,983
No, no, no!
Don't go home!

1122
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,676
Don't go home!
Why? What's going on?

1123
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,554
Nothing! Nothing.
I'm just running late, too.

1124
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:30,258
So I was gonna say let's just
meet at Dr. Dan's office.

1125
00:48:30,383 --> 00:48:32,651
Yeah. Okay.
Is everything all right?

1126
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,963
Yeah! Yeah. Why?

1127
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:36,998
Everything's fine.

1128
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,857
Uh, because you kind of sound like
Ray Liotta at the end of Goodfellas.

1129
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,202
What?

1130
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:43,496
That's so funny, babe.
That's such a good reference.

1131
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,464
That's classic Mags right there.

1132
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,376
So, okay. So you're not
gonna go home, right?

1133
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:49,810
Okay, fine.
I won't go home.

1134
00:48:49,935 --> 00:48:51,604
I'll meet you at Dr. Dan's.
See you soon.

1135
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:52,838
Okay. All right, bye.

1136
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,563
All right, bye.

1137
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:18,462
Get in.

1138
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:38,050
I'm gonna address the elephant

1139
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,185
in the room.

1140
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,530
Okay, first of all, you...

1141
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,533
You guys, I want to say sorry to.

1142
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:49,528
Because what you're probably
thinking is not what happened.

1143
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,871
Accidents!

1144
00:49:50,996 --> 00:49:52,306
I know you're like,

1145
00:49:52,431 --> 00:49:53,666
"How can you accidentally
pistol-whip somebody

1146
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:54,767
"and shoot somebody?"

1147
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:56,202
Well, it can happen.

1148
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,513
Okay? Today is proof
that it can happen. So...

1149
00:49:59,638 --> 00:50:01,982
I'm glad I got to
get that off my chest.

1150
00:50:02,107 --> 00:50:03,942
Relax, Mr. Joyner.
I believe you.

1151
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,719
Okay, thank you.

1152
00:50:05,844 --> 00:50:08,614
Trust me, I know a scared-shitless
civilian when I see one.

1153
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,115
You don't have to convince me.

1154
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,993
You got him over here.
That is me.

1155
00:50:13,118 --> 00:50:15,053
Right now, I'm not comfortable.

1156
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,755
Okay, I am scared, okay?

1157
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,333
I don't have no shit in my system.

1158
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,694
If I sat down on a toilet,
nothing's coming out.

1159
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,419
Farts or just air.

1160
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:30,669
It'd sound like lasers.

1161
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,613
Thank you for that description.

1162
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,607
Mr. Joyner,
let me explain something.

1163
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:36,175
Bob's last forced psych eval

1164
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,187
show a person rapidly
losing his grip on reality.

1165
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:41,189
Bob became obsessed with a ghost,

1166
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:42,581
a figment of his imagination,

1167
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,383
he started calling,
"The Black Badger."

1168
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,485
This obsession led to an instability,

1169
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,355
first reported by his partner,
Phil, three weeks ago.

1170
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,066
Just before Phil
was killed in the field.

1171
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:53,634
Do you know how Phil died?

1172
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,529
Yeah, uh, Bob told me that
The Black Badger killed him.

1173
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,510
What?

1174
00:51:02,635 --> 00:51:03,677
What?

1175
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:07,748
Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone
is The Black Badger.

1176
00:51:07,873 --> 00:51:10,684
Phil was Bob's partner of six years.

1177
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:11,785
His best friend.

1178
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:12,878
See you on the other side.

1179
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,055
See you on the other side.

1180
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,657
Hey, Bob!

1181
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,184
After he stole
the satellite encryption codes

1182
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,653
Bob betrayed Phil.

1183
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,230
No!

1184
00:51:22,355 --> 00:51:25,258
He killed him to cover his tracks.

1185
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:32,206
And, after that, Bob went rogue.

1186
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:34,300
This is all that's left of Phil.

1187
00:51:37,836 --> 00:51:41,014
Um, this is PornHub.

1188
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,818
Oh, shit, shit,
shit. Sorry.

1189
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:46,279
There you go.

1190
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,356
Oh! Oh, God!

1191
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,082
Oh, I didn't see that coming.

1192
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,807
Oh, man!

1193
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,219
It's a hell of a way to go.

1194
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,096
Okay, wait a minute.

1195
00:51:56,221 --> 00:51:57,923
Why wouldn't Bob just go sell the
satellite encryption codes himself?

1196
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,725
Because in a black market,
blind-bidding situation

1197
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,594
the buyer and the seller,
they don't know each other.

1198
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:02,970
They need the auction site

1199
00:52:03,095 --> 00:52:04,196
to tell them exactly where to meet up

1200
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,039
and when to make the exchange.

1201
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,167
The transaction number from the
auction site gives them that,

1202
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,213
which means Bob still needs you.

1203
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,606
Which is why we find ourselves

1204
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,741
in a little catch-and-release
scenario.

1205
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,552
You are the only one Bob trusts.

1206
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,245
That's why we're
putting you in the field.

1207
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,123
The next time you're with Bob,

1208
00:52:23,248 --> 00:52:24,992
press this button.

1209
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:26,717
We're going to have him cold.

1210
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:34,527
Now, go take care of your marriage.

1211
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,730
Oh, one more thing.
Don't tell your wife shit.

1212
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,464
All right.

1213
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:43,235
I just don't know what's wrong.

1214
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,803
I mean, the man that I married,

1215
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,972
the person I knew in high school,

1216
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:51,352
he was filled with
drive and desire. I mean...

1217
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:52,778
We used to sneak off every lunch hour

1218
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,480
and make out under the gym bleachers.

1219
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,524
Like, that guy, back then,

1220
00:52:56,649 --> 00:52:57,950
he wanted things, you know?

1221
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,560
Hmm.

1222
00:52:59,685 --> 00:53:01,219
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I
couldn't find the parking.

1223
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,389
Hi, no, no, it's okay.
We got started without you.

1224
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,766
Babe, Calvin,
this is Dr. Dan.

1225
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,934
Hello, Calvin.

1226
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,002
Oh, shit! Oh, jeez. What's the matter?

1227
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:11,597
Holy shit! Get behind me!
Honey... Calvin, what?

1228
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,907
It's okay, Maggie.
It's okay. Just relax.

1229
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:16,535
This is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process.

1230
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,611
It is?
What?

1231
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,146
It is.
It absolutely is.

1232
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:21,949
Calvin, this is a very safe place.
Please, sit down.

1233
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,976
This is not a safe place! No, no, no.
Honey, it's a...

1234
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,711
No, this is most definitely
not a safe place!

1235
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:27,680
Me and my wife
are leaving. Let's go.

1236
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,782
No, no, no! You are
going to sit down...

1237
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:32,885
And we are going to go through
this therapeutic process...

1238
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,396
Yes...together, as a couple.

1239
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:37,398
Um... Fine, fine, fine.

1240
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:39,157
Sit down. Thank you.

1241
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,401
Fine.

1242
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:41,960
Okay, guys.
Why don't we start off

1243
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,262
with a little bit of word association?

1244
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,373
Okay.

1245
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:46,840
This is exciting.

1246
00:53:46,965 --> 00:53:49,402
I've heard this can really
open a couple up.

1247
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:52,713
Uh, Maggie, I'm going to
offer you a word,

1248
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:55,908
and you respond however you're moved to

1249
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,009
from here.

1250
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:58,085
Okay.

1251
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,512
Black.
White.

1252
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:01,154
Water.
Ocean.

1253
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,381
Sunshine.

1254
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:03,857
Happy.

1255
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:06,794
I'm very impressed, Maggie.
Really?

1256
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:08,521
You're very in tune.

1257
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:10,155
I'm very in tune.

1258
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,300
Calvin, you're next.

1259
00:54:12,425 --> 00:54:14,302
I do not want to do this.

1260
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:17,095
Relax, Calvin.
There are no wrong answers.

1261
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,820
Up.

1262
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:21,275
Down.

1263
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,010
Mmm.

1264
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,545
"Mmm." What is that?

1265
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,046
What're you writing in your book?

1266
00:54:26,171 --> 00:54:27,748
It's fine. Don't freak out.
Nobody's freaking out.

1267
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:29,241
I just don't understand
the rules to the game.

1268
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,551
Freaking out.

1269
00:54:30,676 --> 00:54:32,244
Let's switch gears for a second, okay?

1270
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:36,014
Why don't we try a simple
role-playing exercise?

1271
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,016
Calvin, you be Calvin

1272
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,486
and I will become Maggie.

1273
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,763
Mmm.

1274
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:44,488
I'm confused.

1275
00:54:48,694 --> 00:54:50,563
It's called "soul gazing."

1276
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:54,775
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

1277
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,810
Maggie, this...
Hey. Shh.

1278
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:59,271
There's no talking,
and don't look away.

1279
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,173
Stare into my soul.

1280
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,316
You are not my...

1281
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:03,809
Shh. There's no talking.

1282
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,753
Babe, I'm not staring...

1283
00:55:05,878 --> 00:55:08,889
Me and you.
Stay with me. I'm your wife.

1284
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,883
You are not my wife.

1285
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,195
How could you hit your wife?

1286
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,589
How can I...
How can I what?

1287
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:18,332
You hit your wife!
No...

1288
00:55:18,457 --> 00:55:19,492
He hit me!
Okay.

1289
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:20,859
He hit you!
Okay.

1290
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,584
You hit us!

1291
00:55:26,632 --> 00:55:28,467
I'm swaddling you.
I know what you're doing.

1292
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:30,202
I'm swaddling you.
I know what you're...

1293
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,537
Come here.

1294
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,238
Oh, my God!

1295
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,082
You...

1296
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,276
You know what?
We're leaving! Let's go!

1297
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,053
This is not real.

1298
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:41,622
It's real to me.

1299
00:55:41,747 --> 00:55:42,956
You know what, Calvin?

1300
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:45,417
If you can't commit
to working on our marriage,

1301
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,252
then you need to let me know.

1302
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,287
Maggie, you...

1303
00:55:50,823 --> 00:55:52,533
What!
Oh, my God!

1304
00:55:52,658 --> 00:55:53,992
You're...
Something's not right.

1305
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,904
Come on, Jet, listen.
Come on, come on, Jet!

1306
00:55:57,029 --> 00:55:59,131
Now, I know things got a
little rough there at the end.

1307
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:00,566
But the truth is, with all the heat

1308
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,934
that you have coming down on you,

1309
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:04,344
Maggie is definitely safer without you.

1310
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,880
And, trust me, when this
whole thing is said and done

1311
00:56:07,005 --> 00:56:08,649
and you basically save
the entire free world,

1312
00:56:08,774 --> 00:56:09,808
she's going to forgive you.

1313
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,376
It'll all work itself out.

1314
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,286
It'll all work itself out?

1315
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,614
Okay, Bob, you know, I'm sick
of playing games with you.

1316
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,625
Where's the real Dr. Dan?

1317
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,226
What-what?

1318
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:21,962
Oh, my... Dr. Dan, I had
nothing to do with this.

1319
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,556
He's fine. I'll get you
some water in a little bit.

1320
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,657
Thanks, doc.

1321
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,191
You know...

1322
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,260
That's it. That is it.

1323
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,062
That is it.

1324
00:56:31,463 --> 00:56:32,840
All right, Jet.

1325
00:56:32,965 --> 00:56:35,175
I see that Harris has
given you a button to push.

1326
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,036
Relax, I would've taken the same
deal, too, if I was in your shoes.

1327
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,639
Otherwise, she wouldn't let
you out of her sight, right?

1328
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,083
It makes perfect sense.

1329
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:46,119
But you're not going to
press the button, right?

1330
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:49,047
You got the top-secret
satellite codes?

1331
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,323
Yes or no?

1332
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,350
This ain't the time to bullshit me.

1333
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:53,994
Okay, my ass is sweating.

1334
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,588
I'm nervous.
Don't bullshit me!

1335
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,731
Of course not, dude.
Hey, hey, come on!

1336
00:56:57,856 --> 00:56:59,166
Of course, I don't have the codes.

1337
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,893
Why would I go through
all this trouble, then?

1338
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,703
I need your skill set, Jet,

1339
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:05,631
to help me get the bank transaction
numbers to the winning bid.

1340
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,441
We already know it's going down tonight

1341
00:57:07,566 --> 00:57:08,934
from the countdown on your computer.

1342
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,811
Now, all we need is
the "where."

1343
00:57:10,936 --> 00:57:12,170
And the bank transaction numbers

1344
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:13,338
will give us the "where."

1345
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:14,582
That's why I need you.

1346
00:57:14,707 --> 00:57:16,041
Your job gives you access to

1347
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,918
exactly that kind of information.

1348
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:20,378
Then we can get The Badger,
we can get the buyer

1349
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,580
in one fell swoop.

1350
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,515
And it'll all be over tonight.

1351
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,817
Please, I swear.

1352
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,652
You gotta believe me.

1353
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,405
Can't you just get us
the transaction number?

1354
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,774
Not when the money originates
from an offshore account.

1355
00:57:40,899 --> 00:57:43,535
When that happens, then only a certified
international banking official

1356
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,678
can access it.

1357
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:46,680
But, it shouldn't be a problem.

1358
00:57:46,805 --> 00:57:48,774
We just give this guy the offshore
account numbers that you gave me,

1359
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:50,375
then he can give us
the transaction number

1360
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,745
without knowing that he's
committing treason when he does it.

1361
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,246
Sound familiar?

1362
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:56,156
Ouch! Low blow, CJ.

1363
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:58,483
Hey, besides, it's only
treason if we're wrong.

1364
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,208
Who's this mystery man?

1365
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:03,030
It's Trevor.

1366
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:08,692
Trevor.

1367
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:12,631
This week just keeps getting better.

1368
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,474
You know, I mean...

1369
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,670
Robbie Wheirdicht and Calvin "The
Golden Jet" Joyner in my office.

1370
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,772
Who would've thunk it?
Not me.

1371
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:21,715
This is great, huh?

1372
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,909
Talk about caterpillar
to the butterfly...

1373
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,978
What is this? P-90-X?

1374
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:29,214
More like
"P-1,000,000-X," huh?

1375
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,958
Congratulations.

1376
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:32,660
Hey, I, um...

1377
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:34,261
I really appreciate the help, Trevor.

1378
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,722
My client's all on me to get
this stuff handled right away.

1379
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,231
So, you know, if we could...

1380
00:58:38,356 --> 00:58:40,033
Say no more. It's my pleasure.
I've been there.

1381
00:58:40,158 --> 00:58:41,794
These international accounts
can be very, very tricky

1382
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,195
if you don't have the right clearances.

1383
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,297
You can get a bunch of
digital red tape.

1384
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,399
I'm happy to help, you know?

1385
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,576
Robbie.

1386
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:50,277
You're such a blast
from the past, buddy.

1387
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,770
How long has it been since I saw you?

1388
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,947
Was it high school?

1389
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,484
What's that?

1390
00:58:57,609 --> 00:58:59,519
Um... How we doing
with those account access codes?

1391
00:58:59,644 --> 00:59:00,713
- Are they coming?
- It's coming.

1392
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:02,823
Everything's good?
It's coming.

1393
00:59:02,948 --> 00:59:04,683
I'm going as fast as I can. I know you
guys are in a rush. I'm so sorry.

1394
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,760
Anything for a couple of
fellow Centaurs.

1395
00:59:06,885 --> 00:59:08,120
Speaking of which, you guys are going

1396
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:09,888
to the reunion tonight, right?

1397
00:59:11,556 --> 00:59:13,300
No, I don't think so.

1398
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,768
You're both going.

1399
00:59:14,893 --> 00:59:16,528
Here it is. Here's your
transaction number.

1400
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,405
You're both going because
you want to know what?

1401
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,465
They're going to vote on
homecoming king and queen again.

1402
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,334
Maybe you and Maggie
can make it two for two.

1403
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:24,837
Now, before you go,
stay seated one second.

1404
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:27,280
Give me two minutes, sit down.

1405
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:29,382
Men,

1406
00:59:29,507 --> 00:59:30,976
a few years ago...

1407
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,854
I found the Lord Almighty.

1408
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:35,180
And, ever since then,

1409
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,025
my life has been
completely different. Okay?

1410
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,652
He's got a plan for each
and every one of us

1411
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,721
and, in his infinite wisdom,

1412
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,498
he makes no mistakes. Hmm?

1413
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,867
You're right about that.

1414
00:59:46,992 --> 00:59:48,293
I think the Lord put you here because

1415
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,862
he wants me to get
something off my chest.

1416
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:51,229
He wants me to clear my conscience

1417
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,198
and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.

1418
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,507
Robert.

1419
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,869
What I did to you at that
rally in senior year

1420
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:58,311
was a cowardly act.

1421
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:00,973
It's something that I've
regretted every single day.

1422
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,109
Yeah. I mean, bullying
is a national crisis.

1423
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:09,156
It can leave people
with a lifetime of pain.

1424
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:10,881
So...

1425
01:00:13,952 --> 01:00:18,131
I just want to say how truly sorry I am

1426
01:00:18,256 --> 01:00:20,868
for what happened, you know.

1427
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,535
Or for what I did.

1428
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,129
It didn't just happen.
I did it.

1429
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:27,199
I did it, and I wish to God
that I had not done it.

1430
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:30,502
So, I'm hoping that you
can find it in your heart

1431
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:33,839
to forgive me.

1432
01:00:35,207 --> 01:00:37,517
I wasn't expecting this at all.

1433
01:00:37,642 --> 01:00:39,377
Don't I know it.
I know it.

1434
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:42,923
I'm just so happy.

1435
01:00:43,048 --> 01:00:45,450
Uh, I don't know what to say.

1436
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,219
How about you say...

1437
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,757
"The Oscar goes
to Trevor Olson."

1438
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,030
What do you mean?

1439
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,147
Weird Dick!

1440
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:08,782
You stupid ass!

1441
01:01:08,907 --> 01:01:10,617
Good God, you're dumb!

1442
01:01:10,742 --> 01:01:12,744
Dumber than ever, I guess!

1443
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,454
And you, too, Calvin!

1444
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:17,315
Look at that stupid look
on those two faces.

1445
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,318
"The Lord taught me to care."
Unbelievable.

1446
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:28,800
I'm a Scientologist.
Okay, that's "A."

1447
01:01:28,925 --> 01:01:31,368
And thetan-free since 2003.

1448
01:01:31,493 --> 01:01:32,603
Clear as shit.

1449
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:34,030
And I'm sorry for what I did?

1450
01:01:34,155 --> 01:01:35,940
Let me tell you what I'm sorry about.

1451
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:37,800
I'm sorry I didn't toss your naked
ass out there three more times.

1452
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:39,201
It was the best senior prank ever.

1453
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:40,903
I still get emails about it.

1454
01:01:41,028 --> 01:01:42,814
Know what?

1455
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:44,740
You're going to regret you ever opened
your mouth. You hear me, Trevor?

1456
01:01:44,865 --> 01:01:46,250
Oh, yeah?
How come, Calvin?

1457
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,244
Oh, because he's about to
whoop your ass, that's why.

1458
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:49,153
Who is?

1459
01:01:49,278 --> 01:01:50,888
Bob, get up and whoop his ass.

1460
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:52,748
Oh, here she comes!
Let me tell you something...

1461
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:55,551
Weird Dick can't chug a bunch
of steroids and elk urine

1462
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:56,986
and miraculously be able

1463
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,355
to kick my ass all of a sudden, okay?

1464
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,823
It ain't gonna happen.

1465
01:02:00,948 --> 01:02:02,191
'Cause here's why.

1466
01:02:02,316 --> 01:02:06,403
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.

1467
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:07,638
Huh? Prove me wrong.

1468
01:02:07,763 --> 01:02:09,763
Bob, come on.
Do what you did in the bar.

1469
01:02:20,109 --> 01:02:22,219
Come on, hit me!

1470
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:25,114
And I'll sue your ass, and
take your fanny pack away.

1471
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:28,350
What's the matter with you?
I just want to go.

1472
01:02:28,475 --> 01:02:30,086
She wants to go.

1473
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:32,730
Go ahead. There you go.

1474
01:02:32,855 --> 01:02:33,965
No, it's a push.

1475
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,233
Boy, 50-50 shot.
You missed that.

1476
01:02:36,358 --> 01:02:37,894
At least you found the handle.

1477
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:40,304
Boy, he's still a scared little bitch.

1478
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:41,964
You know, you're still an asshole.

1479
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:44,776
Yeah, well, you're still
shorter than my cat.

1480
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:46,502
Here's your transaction number.

1481
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:48,227
Hit it, Ant-Man.

1482
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:51,140
Thank you, Trevor.

1483
01:02:51,265 --> 01:02:52,249
Yup.

1484
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:54,410
Glad to see you haven't changed a bit.

1485
01:02:54,535 --> 01:02:55,386
Bye-bye now.

1486
01:02:55,511 --> 01:02:57,254
Was it push or pull?
Clean push.

1487
01:02:57,379 --> 01:02:58,647
Which one is it? You want
me to do it for you?

1488
01:02:58,772 --> 01:03:00,792
Which one is it?

1489
01:03:00,917 --> 01:03:03,619
Hey, hey, hey!
Goddamn it, Joyner!

1490
01:03:03,744 --> 01:03:05,029
Jenny!

1491
01:03:05,154 --> 01:03:07,924
Jenny, get the Windex!
And security for this one.

1492
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:10,392
Get your asshole
off my door! That's it!

1493
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:13,905
Bob! Bob!

1494
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,098
Bob! Bob! Bob!

1495
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:25,207
Mr. Joyner. Guess who
we're about to arrest

1496
01:03:25,332 --> 01:03:27,443
for conspiracy to commit treason.

1497
01:03:30,046 --> 01:03:32,456
That's right.
Your lovely wife.

1498
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:34,458
So, here's what you're going to do.

1499
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,994
You're going to tell us exactly
where you and Bob are.

1500
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,821
And then you're going to go outside
and you're going to keep Bob on-site

1501
01:03:39,946 --> 01:03:40,957
until we arrive.

1502
01:03:41,082 --> 01:03:44,026
And if he leaves, you lose.

1503
01:03:44,151 --> 01:03:45,928
Is that clear?

1504
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:52,176
Oh, hey.

1505
01:03:52,301 --> 01:03:53,769
I don't know what happened in there,

1506
01:03:53,894 --> 01:03:55,037
and I just froze up.

1507
01:03:55,162 --> 01:03:57,348
I locked up. I'm sorry.

1508
01:03:57,473 --> 01:03:58,515
Look, Bob, I, uh...

1509
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,751
No, I gotta tell you
something, CJ, listen.

1510
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:02,954
You're the only one
who's ever been nice to me,

1511
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:04,846
the only one who's never laughed at me.

1512
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:08,225
And you're the only one in
this whole world that I trust.

1513
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,519
And I know you have a lot of friends...

1514
01:04:12,955 --> 01:04:14,555
but I don't.

1515
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:17,593
You're my only friend, Calvin.

1516
01:04:17,718 --> 01:04:20,562
And I will never let you
down again, I promise.

1517
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:24,000
I'm sorry, man.

1518
01:04:27,536 --> 01:04:28,504
Sorry for what?

1519
01:04:28,629 --> 01:04:31,215
I told Harris where we are.

1520
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,075
They were going to hurt Maggie.

1521
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,644
I had to.
I didn't have a choice.

1522
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:37,369
I'm sorry.

1523
01:04:41,883 --> 01:04:43,885
Freeze, Bob!
Hands on your head!

1524
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,610
Do it now!

1525
01:05:15,384 --> 01:05:17,028
I know you know how this goes,

1526
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:18,820
so I'll spare you the dramatics.

1527
01:05:18,945 --> 01:05:20,965
I'll ask you just once.

1528
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,459
Where are the satellite
encryption codes?

1529
01:05:25,994 --> 01:05:28,097
Aw. What's the matter, Bob?

1530
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:31,808
Are you upset that
your friend turned you in?

1531
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:33,477
I don't have any friends.

1532
01:05:33,602 --> 01:05:35,404
Okay, I don't want to watch this, guys.

1533
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:37,039
Don't worry, it'll be over quick.

1534
01:05:37,164 --> 01:05:38,582
She always gets them to break.

1535
01:05:38,707 --> 01:05:39,975
Okay.

1536
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,277
You have it your way.

1537
01:05:41,402 --> 01:05:43,212
We're going to
do this old-school.

1538
01:05:51,053 --> 01:05:53,189
Get the extraction tools.

1539
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,733
The extraction tools?

1540
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:59,736
If you don't have the
stomach for it, you can go.

1541
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:01,461
Come on.

1542
01:06:03,965 --> 01:06:05,565
Stop recording.

1543
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:16,220
Why am I coming here?

1544
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:17,413
I was told I'd be able to leave.

1545
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:18,355
You can leave,

1546
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,082
when Agent Harris says you can leave,

1547
01:06:20,207 --> 01:06:21,517
which might be never.

1548
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:23,242
I gotta watch this.

1549
01:06:31,218 --> 01:06:33,095
I'm sorry, Bob.

1550
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,820
I'm sorry, man.

1551
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:49,401
Oh, Jesus!

1552
01:06:56,718 --> 01:06:59,030
What the hell?

1553
01:06:59,155 --> 01:07:01,089
Hey! Hey!

1554
01:07:02,558 --> 01:07:03,734
Don't move!

1555
01:07:03,859 --> 01:07:05,894
You get your hands off!
Get them off the keyboard!

1556
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:08,330
What are you doing, Calvin?
Give me your keycard!

1557
01:07:08,455 --> 01:07:10,541
Give me your keycard!

1558
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:11,908
Give it to me.

1559
01:07:12,033 --> 01:07:13,135
Okay...
Go sit down.

1560
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,878
Okay. Yeah.

1561
01:07:15,003 --> 01:07:16,280
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1562
01:07:16,405 --> 01:07:18,407
Sit down! Sit down!
Okay, okay, okay.

1563
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:22,353
You know, Bob?

1564
01:07:22,478 --> 01:07:24,513
This is actually my
favorite part of the job.

1565
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:26,790
Thank you for being so uncooperative.

1566
01:07:26,915 --> 01:07:28,550
What do you think
your little buddy, Joyner,

1567
01:07:28,675 --> 01:07:30,486
would say if he could
see you like this?

1568
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:31,687
Two words.

1569
01:07:31,812 --> 01:07:33,697
I'm in.

1570
01:07:33,822 --> 01:07:35,632
What-what?

1571
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:38,294
You're making
a big mistake, Mr. Joyner.

1572
01:07:38,419 --> 01:07:40,496
That's only if I'm wrong.

1573
01:07:42,164 --> 01:07:43,699
Come on, Bob. Let's go!

1574
01:07:43,824 --> 01:07:45,901
What're you doing?
Come on, man!

1575
01:07:47,169 --> 01:07:49,346
Okay, listen to me.
Bob, I'm sorry.

1576
01:07:49,471 --> 01:07:51,507
I'm sorry I double-crossed you.
You hear me?

1577
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:52,749
I should've believed you,

1578
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:53,909
I should've trusted you, and I didn't.

1579
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:55,519
I'm sorry for that.

1580
01:07:55,644 --> 01:07:57,613
Listen to me. Bob, we don't
have time for this, man!

1581
01:07:57,738 --> 01:07:59,790
I need you to tap into
that super-spy stuff

1582
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:01,717
and I need you to get us the
hell out of here right now.

1583
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:02,726
Do you hear me?

1584
01:08:02,851 --> 01:08:04,453
Now, come on, man.
We boys?

1585
01:08:06,222 --> 01:08:08,299
We're boys.
Oh!

1586
01:08:08,424 --> 01:08:10,459
Sorry, Jet.

1587
01:08:10,584 --> 01:08:12,103
Oh, God!

1588
01:08:12,228 --> 01:08:13,904
Oh, God!

1589
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:15,697
See? Good as new.

1590
01:08:16,898 --> 01:08:18,775
Wow. Sorry, man.

1591
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:23,580
Go, go!

1592
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:25,173
Get me out!

1593
01:08:25,298 --> 01:08:27,543
He got the jump on us.
Give me the key.

1594
01:08:30,512 --> 01:08:32,856
Look out, Bob!

1595
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:35,150
Here, Jet! Get him!

1596
01:08:35,275 --> 01:08:36,875
Watch out!

1597
01:08:45,327 --> 01:08:46,662
Did you see that, Bob?

1598
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:49,064
I did the thing!
I did the thing, Bob!

1599
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:50,165
Yeah!

1600
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,243
Yeah! Yeah!

1601
01:08:52,368 --> 01:08:53,735
Come on! Follow me!
Let's do it!

1602
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,538
No! What am I doing?
Here! You go! You bigger.

1603
01:08:56,663 --> 01:08:58,474
Okay, okay.
I'm behind you.

1604
01:09:00,108 --> 01:09:01,418
Roger that, base.

1605
01:09:01,543 --> 01:09:02,844
Confirming there's been
a security breach.

1606
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:04,788
Oh, my God.
There's two of them.

1607
01:09:04,913 --> 01:09:07,516
Yeah, I'll distract them
and you open the door, okay?

1608
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:09,184
What? No!
Let's roll.

1609
01:09:09,309 --> 01:09:10,909
No, no.

1610
01:09:12,254 --> 01:09:14,131
Go, go!

1611
01:09:14,256 --> 01:09:15,324
Close in!

1612
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:16,800
Moving out!

1613
01:09:16,925 --> 01:09:18,925
Freeze, Bob! BOB: Sorry
about this, guys.

1614
01:09:21,597 --> 01:09:23,499
Nope, come here.

1615
01:09:33,309 --> 01:09:34,518
Come on.

1616
01:09:34,643 --> 01:09:37,245
Wrong keycard, pal.
Turn around.

1617
01:09:39,114 --> 01:09:40,316
You needed this one.

1618
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:41,558
On the ground, now.

1619
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:43,184
Can I say something first?

1620
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:45,028
What?
This is going to hurt.

1621
01:09:47,656 --> 01:09:48,857
Hey, get the keycard!
Let's roll.

1622
01:09:48,982 --> 01:09:50,582
All right, all right.

1623
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:54,161
Which car are we taking?

1624
01:09:56,031 --> 01:09:57,098
Not that one.

1625
01:09:57,223 --> 01:09:59,176
Oh. Oh, my God.

1626
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:02,112
Oh, God. Oh, sh...

1627
01:10:02,237 --> 01:10:03,214
Oh.

1628
01:10:03,339 --> 01:10:04,939
Here we go, Jet.

1629
01:10:06,608 --> 01:10:07,843
Bob, they are shooting at us!

1630
01:10:07,968 --> 01:10:09,244
It's okay, it's bulletproof.

1631
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:10,969
Drive, drive!

1632
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:24,000
Here you go, Jet.

1633
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,202
What's this?

1634
01:10:25,327 --> 01:10:27,137
Bug-out bag,
courtesy of the CIA.

1635
01:10:27,262 --> 01:10:28,997
Go ahead and grab that
encrypted phone in there.

1636
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:30,274
For what?

1637
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,376
You still have
the bank transaction code?

1638
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:34,603
How are transaction numbers gonna help
us find out where the bad guys are?

1639
01:10:34,728 --> 01:10:37,539
Well, it's not bank transaction
numbers or codes, it's actually...

1640
01:10:37,664 --> 01:10:39,883
Longitude and latitude.

1641
01:10:40,008 --> 01:10:42,911
Look at the spy brain on the Jet!

1642
01:10:43,036 --> 01:10:44,488
What-what!

1643
01:10:44,613 --> 01:10:46,815
You're like a chocolate Google.

1644
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,149
Bob, don't do that.
Stop it.

1645
01:10:48,274 --> 01:10:49,159
Stop it.

1646
01:10:49,284 --> 01:10:50,994
You're getting good at this, man.

1647
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:53,121
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
It's longitude and latitude.

1648
01:10:53,246 --> 01:10:55,891
All you gotta do is plug those
digits into the GPS, and boom!

1649
01:10:56,016 --> 01:10:58,916
We're gonna catch the buyer and
The Badger, just like that.

1650
01:11:01,788 --> 01:11:03,388
Boston.

1651
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:07,836
We're gonna need a plane.

1652
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:22,393
You ever steal a plane before?

1653
01:11:22,518 --> 01:11:24,119
I stole some Starbursts one time.

1654
01:11:24,244 --> 01:11:25,596
Mmm-hmm.

1655
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:27,456
So I don't know if that
compares or anything,

1656
01:11:27,581 --> 01:11:28,890
but I wasn't successful with that.

1657
01:11:29,015 --> 01:11:30,367
On the way out, I dropped 'em.

1658
01:11:30,492 --> 01:11:31,868
Dropped the whole bag.
The guy caught me.

1659
01:11:31,993 --> 01:11:33,462
"What's that?"
I just said, "A Starburst."

1660
01:11:33,587 --> 01:11:35,731
Told him myself.
It was a mess.

1661
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,902
Check it out.
The universe provides.

1662
01:11:43,138 --> 01:11:44,738
Oh.

1663
01:11:46,408 --> 01:11:47,351
Golden Jet.

1664
01:11:47,476 --> 01:11:49,076
Golden Jet.
Golden Jet.

1665
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:54,650
It's just one guard in there.
All right.

1666
01:11:54,775 --> 01:11:56,427
90% of spy work is distraction.

1667
01:11:56,552 --> 01:11:57,653
You get in there
and distract that guard,

1668
01:11:57,778 --> 01:11:59,630
I'm gonna get us a plane.

1669
01:11:59,755 --> 01:12:02,165
What?

1670
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,290
I don't know what the hell you expect...

1671
01:12:06,428 --> 01:12:08,639
Bob!

1672
01:12:08,764 --> 01:12:10,173
Bob!

1673
01:12:10,298 --> 01:12:11,898
Bob!

1674
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:14,501
Damn it!

1675
01:12:22,077 --> 01:12:24,154
Hey, uh, I need a plane.

1676
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:27,257
Sir, you cannot be in here.
This is a private airfield.

1677
01:12:27,382 --> 01:12:30,051
I understand that but I have an
organ in this cooler right now

1678
01:12:30,176 --> 01:12:32,996
that needs to get transported ASAP.

1679
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:34,531
Really?

1680
01:12:34,656 --> 01:12:37,092
Because my sister-in-law had
a heart transplant last year

1681
01:12:37,217 --> 01:12:40,295
and they did not bring it
in a Playmate lunch cooler.

1682
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,263
Well, I hate to break it to you,

1683
01:12:42,388 --> 01:12:44,099
but this is not a, uh...

1684
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:46,343
This is not a heart.

1685
01:12:46,468 --> 01:12:47,536
Oh, it's not a heart?

1686
01:12:47,661 --> 01:12:48,645
No, it's not.

1687
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:51,081
Hmm. What is it then?

1688
01:12:51,206 --> 01:12:52,273
It's a dick.

1689
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:54,651
Okay.

1690
01:12:54,776 --> 01:12:56,687
I am made of questions right now.

1691
01:12:56,812 --> 01:12:58,113
Well, you don't have to ask.

1692
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:00,223
Last night, lady got
into it with a man.

1693
01:13:00,348 --> 01:13:01,950
She ended up cutting his pecker off.

1694
01:13:02,075 --> 01:13:03,985
She left with it, got in a car, drove,

1695
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,162
got on 95, threw it out the window.

1696
01:13:06,287 --> 01:13:09,165
The second largest penis
hunt in the state history.

1697
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,826
The man was Korean,
so you better believe

1698
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:12,669
it took a long time to find.

1699
01:13:12,794 --> 01:13:14,963
You're stereotyping Korean dicks.

1700
01:13:15,088 --> 01:13:16,006
That's racist.

1701
01:13:16,131 --> 01:13:17,774
I've seen Korean dicks bigger than you.

1702
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:20,035
Okay, sir, we don't need
to demean each other here.

1703
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,237
I don't believe a word you're saying.

1704
01:13:22,362 --> 01:13:23,914
Let me see it.

1705
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:25,907
I have no problem showing you this.

1706
01:13:26,032 --> 01:13:28,944
So if you wanna see it
then get ready to see.

1707
01:13:29,069 --> 01:13:30,078
Here I go.

1708
01:13:30,203 --> 01:13:31,888
Go for it.

1709
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:34,714
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1710
01:13:35,951 --> 01:13:37,786
I'm just kidding.
This is my friend.

1711
01:13:37,911 --> 01:13:38,895
Oh!

1712
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,665
It's my buddy.
His name's Snake Gyllenhaal.

1713
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:43,992
He guards my lunch.
Okay, that's enough.

1714
01:14:07,549 --> 01:14:09,149
It's gotta be Harris, right?

1715
01:14:10,318 --> 01:14:11,528
What do you mean?

1716
01:14:11,653 --> 01:14:13,021
I mean, she's gotta be
The Black Badger.

1717
01:14:13,146 --> 01:14:14,631
It's the only thing that makes sense.

1718
01:14:14,756 --> 01:14:16,600
I mean, she's had access
to the encryption codes

1719
01:14:16,725 --> 01:14:19,227
and she's so hot and bothered about
pinning this whole thing on you.

1720
01:14:19,352 --> 01:14:20,370
It's gotta be her!

1721
01:14:20,495 --> 01:14:21,972
I don't know, Jet.

1722
01:14:22,097 --> 01:14:23,974
I'm pretty sure she thinks
I'm The Black Badger.

1723
01:14:24,099 --> 01:14:26,109
She worked me over pretty good
in that interrogation room.

1724
01:14:26,234 --> 01:14:27,435
Hold on, wait, wait...

1725
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,845
What's going on?

1726
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,238
What's that? Whoa. Whoa.

1727
01:14:30,363 --> 01:14:31,807
What's going on right now, Bob?

1728
01:14:31,932 --> 01:14:33,909
No biggie.
We're completely outta gas.

1729
01:14:34,034 --> 01:14:36,119
Oh, my... Oh!

1730
01:14:37,512 --> 01:14:39,648
We're going down, Jet!
There's nothing I can do!

1731
01:14:39,773 --> 01:14:41,324
Oh, shit!

1732
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:42,826
Really quickly...

1733
01:14:42,951 --> 01:14:46,029
What's the one thing you wish
you'd done in your life?

1734
01:14:46,154 --> 01:14:47,464
The one thing I wish I hadn't done

1735
01:14:47,589 --> 01:14:48,790
is not get in a plane with a guy

1736
01:14:48,915 --> 01:14:50,734
who didn't check the goddamned fuel!

1737
01:14:50,859 --> 01:14:52,527
Why wouldn't you check the fuel?

1738
01:14:52,652 --> 01:14:54,070
No, something that's real.

1739
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:56,531
What's the one thing you
regret not doing for you?

1740
01:14:56,656 --> 01:14:58,934
Oh, my God!
I think we're gonna die!

1741
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:05,782
Not having a kid, man!

1742
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:07,308
Not being a father!

1743
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:09,686
I regret not being a father!

1744
01:15:09,811 --> 01:15:11,813
Maggie, I should've gave you a kid!

1745
01:15:11,938 --> 01:15:14,482
I should've gave you my seed, Maggie!

1746
01:15:14,607 --> 01:15:16,092
I should've!

1747
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:17,817
I'm so selfish!

1748
01:15:18,887 --> 01:15:20,989
I'm sorry, Maggie!

1749
01:15:24,926 --> 01:15:27,370
That wasn't so hard, right? What?

1750
01:15:27,495 --> 01:15:29,130
Hey, just for the record,

1751
01:15:29,255 --> 01:15:31,508
I think you'd make a great dad.

1752
01:15:31,633 --> 01:15:34,110
Did you just fake this whole thing?

1753
01:15:34,235 --> 01:15:35,145
Yeah, kinda.

1754
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:37,172
Oh, you gotta be shitting me glory!

1755
01:15:37,297 --> 01:15:38,649
No, not at all.

1756
01:15:38,774 --> 01:15:40,842
I just thought that maybe
facing your own death situation

1757
01:15:40,967 --> 01:15:42,385
might help motivate you

1758
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:44,045
to clarify some of your goals in life.

1759
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,989
And, hey, between me and you,

1760
01:15:46,114 --> 01:15:48,149
I know you've been
struggling a little bit.

1761
01:15:48,274 --> 01:15:50,652
You know what I'm struggling
with right now, Bob?

1762
01:15:50,777 --> 01:15:52,295
Not whooping your ass.

1763
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,597
Okay, Jet.

1764
01:15:53,722 --> 01:15:54,589
Hey, you're really cute when you cry.

1765
01:15:54,714 --> 01:15:56,758
Stop it! Enough!

1766
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:11,281
I don't get it.

1767
01:16:11,406 --> 01:16:12,974
I mean, if these
coordinates are correct,

1768
01:16:13,099 --> 01:16:14,810
we should be standing
right on top of it.

1769
01:16:14,935 --> 01:16:17,913
Well, the deal doesn't go down
for another 30 minutes, Jet,

1770
01:16:18,038 --> 01:16:19,347
so we're kinda early.

1771
01:16:19,472 --> 01:16:20,724
No!

1772
01:16:20,849 --> 01:16:22,083
Why would you do it
out in the open like this?

1773
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:23,885
Why would you take that risk?

1774
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:25,887
Just doesn't make any sense, man.

1775
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:29,024
Shit! Come on.

1776
01:16:30,692 --> 01:16:33,136
Wait.

1777
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:35,363
Oh, wait. It's not happening up here.

1778
01:16:36,998 --> 01:16:38,767
No, it's not. It's...

1779
01:16:41,236 --> 01:16:43,939
Oh, it's happening
beneath us. Look.

1780
01:16:44,064 --> 01:16:46,717
It's an underground parking garage.

1781
01:16:46,842 --> 01:16:48,518
Yeah, that's a good eye, Jet.

1782
01:16:48,643 --> 01:16:51,021
Why don't you stay up here?
Keep overwatch.

1783
01:16:51,146 --> 01:16:52,781
I'll go down there
and check things out.

1784
01:16:52,906 --> 01:16:54,725
Wait, what?
No, I'm going with you.

1785
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:56,017
Well, you can't go with me.

1786
01:16:56,142 --> 01:16:57,719
The smarter play is if we split up.

1787
01:16:57,844 --> 01:16:59,162
Smarter play for who?

1788
01:16:59,287 --> 01:17:01,289
Do you know what happens
when people split up, Bob?

1789
01:17:01,414 --> 01:17:02,298
Somebody dies!

1790
01:17:02,423 --> 01:17:03,867
I'd be the one to die.
You know why?

1791
01:17:03,992 --> 01:17:05,426
Because I don't have a bulletproof vest

1792
01:17:05,551 --> 01:17:06,770
and I don't have a gun!

1793
01:17:06,895 --> 01:17:08,772
Which means that you
are my bulletproof vest!

1794
01:17:08,897 --> 01:17:10,866
My little black ass is gonna stay
behind you, you're not leaving me!

1795
01:17:10,991 --> 01:17:12,734
That's exactly why
you should stay up here.

1796
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:15,536
Look, if you went down in that
garage and you got shot to death

1797
01:17:15,661 --> 01:17:16,847
you know how hurt I would be?

1798
01:17:16,972 --> 01:17:18,606
I'd be super bummed out!
I don't want that.

1799
01:17:18,731 --> 01:17:20,350
It's safer for you up here.

1800
01:17:20,475 --> 01:17:22,210
If something happened up here,
what am I supposed to do, Bob?

1801
01:17:22,335 --> 01:17:24,612
How do I get your attention?
Make a bird call?

1802
01:17:26,882 --> 01:17:28,925
Does that sound like
a bird to you? Huh?

1803
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:31,219
That's my biggest weakness!
I can't make bird noises.

1804
01:17:31,344 --> 01:17:32,495
I never could.

1805
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:34,322
So if that's what I gotta
depend on to live,

1806
01:17:34,447 --> 01:17:35,423
it means I'm gonna die!

1807
01:17:35,548 --> 01:17:37,125
I'mma die up here, by myself

1808
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,161
sounding like
a dead-ass pigeon.

1809
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:42,630
I have no idea what a pigeon...

1810
01:17:42,755 --> 01:17:43,940
Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet!

1811
01:17:44,065 --> 01:17:45,809
You don't have to make bird noises.

1812
01:17:45,934 --> 01:17:47,302
You don't have to sound like a pigeon.

1813
01:17:47,427 --> 01:17:50,005
All you gotta do is call
me on the encrypted phone

1814
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:52,140
that's in your hand.

1815
01:17:56,644 --> 01:17:58,188
Okay?
Okay, yeah.

1816
01:17:58,313 --> 01:17:59,848
I'll be right back Okay.

1817
01:17:59,973 --> 01:18:01,382
All right?

1818
01:18:01,507 --> 01:18:03,927
Oh, Jet.

1819
01:18:04,052 --> 01:18:06,529
I'll see you on the other side.

1820
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:07,998
Yeah.

1821
01:18:08,123 --> 01:18:09,723
Yeah.

1822
01:18:35,016 --> 01:18:36,727
You're early.

1823
01:18:36,852 --> 01:18:38,553
So are you.

1824
01:18:41,022 --> 01:18:42,622
Come on.

1825
01:18:53,101 --> 01:18:54,701
Oh, my God!

1826
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:00,851
Oh, my God.

1827
01:19:00,976 --> 01:19:02,352
I knew it.

1828
01:19:02,477 --> 01:19:04,645
I knew it. I knew she
was The Black Badger!

1829
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,723
Oh, my God!

1830
01:19:06,848 --> 01:19:09,250
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.

1831
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:10,251
Yello?

1832
01:19:10,376 --> 01:19:13,188
Bob, Harris is The Black Badger!

1833
01:19:13,313 --> 01:19:14,464
Hello?

1834
01:19:14,589 --> 01:19:15,957
Harris is The Black Badger!

1835
01:19:16,082 --> 01:19:17,125
I can't hear you.

1836
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,260
Harris is The Black Badger!

1837
01:19:20,795 --> 01:19:22,806
Just kidding! I'm not here.
Leave a message at the beep.

1838
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:24,665
What? ("WANNABE" BY SPICE

1839
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:36,077
Oh. Harris is
The Black Badger!

1840
01:19:36,202 --> 01:19:37,678
Harris is The Black Badger!

1841
01:19:37,803 --> 01:19:40,415
I knew it. I knew it.
Harris is The Black Badger!

1842
01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:43,794
Bob! Harris is The...

1843
01:19:45,311 --> 01:19:46,496
Who is he?

1844
01:19:46,621 --> 01:19:48,221
That's my partner.

1845
01:20:01,302 --> 01:20:03,138
I don't like splitting my fees.

1846
01:20:04,705 --> 01:20:08,819
The package. Please.

1847
01:20:08,944 --> 01:20:10,778
Thought you'd never ask.

1848
01:20:10,903 --> 01:20:14,382
Wait! You're making a mistake.

1849
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:17,585
Hello, Bob.

1850
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,797
But you're dead.

1851
01:20:20,922 --> 01:20:23,633
Not as much as people think.

1852
01:20:23,758 --> 01:20:27,203
Look, he's not The Black Badger...

1853
01:20:27,328 --> 01:20:28,304
I am.

1854
01:20:28,429 --> 01:20:30,631
And those aren't the encryption codes,

1855
01:20:30,756 --> 01:20:31,975
these are.

1856
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,234
He's lying to you.

1857
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:35,078
This man is a CIA agent,

1858
01:20:35,203 --> 01:20:37,153
and he's trying
to sell you bogus plans.

1859
01:20:44,337 --> 01:20:45,937
Damn.

1860
01:20:47,448 --> 01:20:49,048
Ow, ow.

1861
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,620
He shot me.

1862
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:59,903
These are the real codes

1863
01:21:00,028 --> 01:21:01,696
and I am the real Black Badger.

1864
01:21:05,466 --> 01:21:07,268
Bob is The Black Badger.

1865
01:21:08,636 --> 01:21:10,038
Bob is The Black Badger.

1866
01:21:10,163 --> 01:21:12,540
I am The Black Badger.

1867
01:21:12,665 --> 01:21:14,951
Phil?

1868
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:17,620
No, I'm The Black Badger.

1869
01:21:17,745 --> 01:21:20,715
I'm starting to think
I might be The Black Badger.

1870
01:21:23,051 --> 01:21:24,660
Here's the thing.

1871
01:21:24,785 --> 01:21:28,865
I have no idea who is
the real Black Badger.

1872
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,733
And I don't care.

1873
01:21:30,858 --> 01:21:32,160
'Cause I'm The Honey Badger.

1874
01:21:32,285 --> 01:21:34,629
And The Honey Badger
doesn't give a shit.

1875
01:21:34,754 --> 01:21:36,164
The Honey Badger's nasty.

1876
01:21:36,289 --> 01:21:38,909
He's so nasty, he'll take them both.

1877
01:21:39,034 --> 01:21:40,935
Hand them over.

1878
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:43,179
Phil, when this thing is over,

1879
01:21:43,304 --> 01:21:44,605
I'm going to rip your throat out

1880
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:47,317
like Patrick Swayze in Road House.

1881
01:21:47,442 --> 01:21:49,044
Oh, my God.
You and Road House.

1882
01:21:49,169 --> 01:21:50,245
Get over that movie.

1883
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:52,013
It sucked then, it sucks now.

1884
01:21:52,138 --> 01:21:55,959
The only movie that sucks
more is Sixteen Candles.

1885
01:21:56,084 --> 01:21:57,684
How dare you!

1886
01:22:02,557 --> 01:22:04,192
Drop your weapons!

1887
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:11,774
Oh! Oh, shit!

1888
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,520
The codes.

1889
01:22:24,645 --> 01:22:26,389
Don't do it.

1890
01:22:26,514 --> 01:22:28,114
Stupid.

1891
01:22:29,917 --> 01:22:31,394
Okay.

1892
01:22:31,519 --> 01:22:33,429
One,

1893
01:22:33,554 --> 01:22:35,731
two,

1894
01:22:35,856 --> 01:22:37,456
three! Shit!

1895
01:22:42,097 --> 01:22:44,565
Uh-oh! Oh!

1896
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:45,741
No!

1897
01:22:45,866 --> 01:22:47,535
He's got the codes!

1898
01:23:21,936 --> 01:23:23,179
Whoo!

1899
01:23:23,304 --> 01:23:25,048
I mean, this is crazy, right?

1900
01:23:25,173 --> 01:23:26,741
You stay the hell away from me, Bob!

1901
01:23:26,866 --> 01:23:28,609
You shot me in the neck!

1902
01:23:31,045 --> 01:23:32,645
Jet!

1903
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:55,101
Okay.

1904
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,176
Golden Jet for the win!

1905
01:24:02,677 --> 01:24:04,120
No. Shit!

1906
01:24:04,245 --> 01:24:05,845
Drop your weapon, Bob.

1907
01:24:06,914 --> 01:24:07,923
Oh, shit!

1908
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:10,026
Get behind me,
Mr. Joyner.

1909
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:11,452
Oh, you don't wanna do that, Jet.

1910
01:24:11,577 --> 01:24:12,762
It's obvious he's the bad guy.

1911
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:14,489
I'm the good guy.
You wanna get behind me.

1912
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:16,432
Agent Harris had me go dark

1913
01:24:16,557 --> 01:24:19,669
to get Bob to reveal himself
as The Black Badger.

1914
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:21,562
You don't seriously
believe this guy, do you?

1915
01:24:21,687 --> 01:24:22,997
You wanna get behind me, Jet.

1916
01:24:23,122 --> 01:24:25,065
You betrayed your nation, Bob.

1917
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,502
You betrayed your partner, Phil.

1918
01:24:27,627 --> 01:24:31,105
Okay, no, wait!
Everybody just stop!

1919
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:32,482
Cut the shit!

1920
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:34,609
I'mma cut the line right now!

1921
01:24:34,734 --> 01:24:35,851
I cut the shit!

1922
01:24:35,976 --> 01:24:38,020
Hear me? Now I don't
care who betrayed who.

1923
01:24:38,145 --> 01:24:39,722
Okay? I just don't
wanna get hurt!

1924
01:24:39,847 --> 01:24:41,547
So there ain't
gonna be no... Shit!

1925
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:52,968
Come on.

1926
01:25:08,643 --> 01:25:10,243
Shi...

1927
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:15,614
Shit.

1928
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:35,678
Smart move,
Mr. Joyner.

1929
01:25:35,803 --> 01:25:38,273
You've done your country
a great service.

1930
01:25:38,398 --> 01:25:40,450
Now, hand me the firearm

1931
01:25:40,575 --> 01:25:44,354
and we'll turn over the
satellite codes together.

1932
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:47,923
Stay right there, man.
Don't you take another step.

1933
01:25:48,048 --> 01:25:50,718
Just because I shot him
does not mean I trust you.

1934
01:25:50,843 --> 01:25:52,320
We don't have time for this.

1935
01:25:52,445 --> 01:25:54,045
Stop! I said, "Stop."

1936
01:25:55,956 --> 01:25:57,692
Aw, whoopsie.

1937
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:04,073
Nice throw, bitch.

1938
01:26:08,469 --> 01:26:10,680
You wanna know why your pal Bob

1939
01:26:10,805 --> 01:26:14,083
could never have been The Black Badger?

1940
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:16,452
It's because he's too weak.

1941
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:18,779
And if I had to hear
another goddamned story

1942
01:26:18,904 --> 01:26:22,192
about Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner

1943
01:26:22,317 --> 01:26:24,485
and how awesome you were in high school

1944
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:27,322
and how you were this
big idiot's best friend...

1945
01:26:27,447 --> 01:26:29,957
I was just gonna lose it.

1946
01:26:30,082 --> 01:26:33,561
Looking at you right now,
you don't seem so cool.

1947
01:26:33,686 --> 01:26:37,465
You just seem like a regular guy.

1948
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:39,675
An everyday Joe.

1949
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,879
You know, faking my own
death was the easy part.

1950
01:26:44,004 --> 01:26:46,407
But dealing with Bob, day after day,

1951
01:26:46,532 --> 01:26:47,942
was the hard part.

1952
01:26:48,067 --> 01:26:49,009
Hey, Phil.

1953
01:26:49,134 --> 01:26:50,753
What, Bob?

1954
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:53,323
I'll see you on the other side.

1955
01:26:53,448 --> 01:26:56,016
No, I hope
we don't. All right?

1956
01:26:56,141 --> 01:26:57,785
Just no. Bye, bye, bye.

1957
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,094
Just go.

1958
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:01,564
I made up the Black Badger,
rigged up a blood bag

1959
01:27:01,689 --> 01:27:02,957
and that big dummy bought it.

1960
01:27:03,082 --> 01:27:04,191
Bob!

1961
01:27:04,316 --> 01:27:06,702
No, no!
Hang on, buddy.

1962
01:27:06,827 --> 01:27:08,429
No, there's some sort of bomb in here.

1963
01:27:08,554 --> 01:27:10,465
You're pushing it closed, I think.

1964
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:11,566
No, no, no. Sorry.

1965
01:27:11,691 --> 01:27:12,967
No, don't give up!

1966
01:27:13,092 --> 01:27:14,644
Bye, Bob.

1967
01:27:14,769 --> 01:27:17,071
I'm getting away with
a half a billion dollars.

1968
01:27:17,196 --> 01:27:20,975
And Boy Scout Bob is gonna
spend his life in prison.

1969
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,253
Ain't America great?

1970
01:27:23,378 --> 01:27:25,488
So now you're gonna be

1971
01:27:25,613 --> 01:27:28,015
the second partner of Bob's to die.

1972
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,116
Just relax.

1973
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:32,019
On your knees, Golden Jet.

1974
01:27:41,596 --> 01:27:43,398
What the hell was that?

1975
01:27:44,532 --> 01:27:46,509
Golden Jet flip.

1976
01:27:46,634 --> 01:27:49,870
Yeah? Well, you
really suck at it.

1977
01:27:49,995 --> 01:27:51,113
I know.

1978
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:53,107
Then why'd you do it?

1979
01:27:53,232 --> 01:27:54,832
Distraction.

1980
01:27:57,978 --> 01:27:59,728
Oh, you just pulled his throat out!

1981
01:28:01,816 --> 01:28:03,851
I'll see you on the other side.

1982
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:10,425
Oh, Jet, come here. Give
me your hand, old buddy.

1983
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:12,326
Oh, shit! Get that
away from me!

1984
01:28:12,451 --> 01:28:14,270
Sorry, Jet.

1985
01:28:14,395 --> 01:28:17,064
Come here, Jet. That was a trachea.

1986
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:18,541
Great distraction, man!

1987
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:20,100
Sorry I had to shoot you, Jet.

1988
01:28:20,225 --> 01:28:22,445
It was the only way
I could save your life.

1989
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:23,771
But when you shot me
to get Phil to confess

1990
01:28:23,896 --> 01:28:25,473
that he was The Black Badger

1991
01:28:25,598 --> 01:28:27,975
that was some
next-level-type shit!

1992
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,887
Yeah, no. I'm glad you
see it the way I saw it.

1993
01:28:32,012 --> 01:28:33,956
That was my plan
the whole time. So...

1994
01:28:34,081 --> 01:28:35,891
You are a natural
for this line of work.

1995
01:28:36,016 --> 01:28:37,351
I mean, you're smart,
you got the skill set,

1996
01:28:37,476 --> 01:28:38,728
you're a people person

1997
01:28:38,853 --> 01:28:40,455
and you already got
a dope-ass code name,

1998
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:42,197
"The Golden Jet!" What?

1999
01:28:42,322 --> 01:28:44,024
But in the meantime, we gotta
get those encryption codes

2000
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:46,060
over to Harris right away
or we're gonna be late.

2001
01:28:46,185 --> 01:28:48,796
What are you talking about?
Late for what?

2002
01:28:50,364 --> 01:28:55,736
The reunion, dude. What-what!
This shit's on!

2003
01:28:57,505 --> 01:29:00,416
Bob.
Damn it.

2004
01:29:23,163 --> 01:29:24,139
Bob!

2005
01:29:24,264 --> 01:29:25,475
One more thing.

2006
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,101
Thanks for securing
the satellite codes.

2007
01:29:27,226 --> 01:29:28,636
You really saved my ass.

2008
01:29:28,761 --> 01:29:30,270
Your country thanks you.

2009
01:29:30,395 --> 01:29:31,414
Just doing my job.

2010
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:32,840
I'm really sorry about your hand.

2011
01:29:32,965 --> 01:29:34,475
I hope you know that wasn't personal.

2012
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,486
Oh, no hard feelings at all, Pam.

2013
01:29:36,611 --> 01:29:38,145
Besides, everybody makes mistakes.

2014
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:40,990
Calvin, here, thought
you were The Black Badger.

2015
01:29:42,082 --> 01:29:43,393
I don't...
No, I don't think...

2016
01:29:43,518 --> 01:29:44,560
When we were in the plane,

2017
01:29:44,685 --> 01:29:45,886
you said, "Hey, Harris
is the Black..."

2018
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:47,611
I think you should...
Maybe I...

2019
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,958
Mr. Joyner, it was a
pleasure working with you.

2020
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:52,560
If you ever want a career change,

2021
01:29:52,685 --> 01:29:54,437
you give me a call.

2022
01:29:54,562 --> 01:29:55,671
If I were to give you a call,

2023
01:29:55,796 --> 01:29:57,064
how would I get in touch with you?

2024
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:58,733
Just pick up any phone in your house.

2025
01:29:58,858 --> 01:30:00,535
They're all bugged.

2026
01:30:01,802 --> 01:30:04,447
You're crazy.
Hey, you're crazy!

2027
01:30:04,572 --> 01:30:05,940
That's a good one.

2028
01:30:06,065 --> 01:30:06,949
Calvin!

2029
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:08,408
I got your text and came right over.

2030
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:09,744
Where the hell have you been?

2031
01:30:09,869 --> 01:30:12,246
Why did you get out of a helicopter?

2032
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:14,048
Hey, uh, Maggie.

2033
01:30:14,173 --> 01:30:14,990
Uh, hi!

2034
01:30:15,115 --> 01:30:17,451
Babe, why
is Dr. Dan with you?

2035
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:18,928
Well... Uh...

2036
01:30:19,053 --> 01:30:20,463
That's not Dr. Dan.

2037
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:22,823
Allow me to properly introduce myself.

2038
01:30:22,948 --> 01:30:24,333
My name is Bob Stone,

2039
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:27,394
the artist formerly known
as Robbie Wheirdicht.

2040
01:30:27,519 --> 01:30:29,104
I work for the CIA.

2041
01:30:29,229 --> 01:30:31,165
I roped your husband into helping
me track down a traitor,

2042
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:33,701
who was gonna sell military
state secrets to a terrorist.

2043
01:30:33,826 --> 01:30:35,269
We did all that, we stopped them,

2044
01:30:35,394 --> 01:30:37,605
we saved the free world,
and here we are.

2045
01:30:39,506 --> 01:30:40,808
What the hell is going on?

2046
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:42,652
Okay, listen, listen.

2047
01:30:42,777 --> 01:30:44,754
I've been a fool.
All right?

2048
01:30:44,879 --> 01:30:46,889
I thought that my life was a failure.

2049
01:30:47,014 --> 01:30:48,348
I thought that it wasn't special.

2050
01:30:48,473 --> 01:30:49,592
But it is special.

2051
01:30:49,717 --> 01:30:51,418
It's special because I have you in it.

2052
01:30:51,543 --> 01:30:55,297
You are my world. You are
what makes me special!

2053
01:30:55,422 --> 01:30:57,625
You're everything to me, Mags.

2054
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,535
I love you.

2055
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,260
I love you.

2056
01:31:05,532 --> 01:31:07,510
Okay.

2057
01:31:07,635 --> 01:31:09,512
Here come the waterworks.

2058
01:31:09,637 --> 01:31:11,939
I promised myself I wouldn't do this.

2059
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,611
Come on, come on. Okay.

2060
01:31:19,013 --> 01:31:21,015
That's Robbie Wheirdicht? Yeah.

2061
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:44,446
Hi, Brian.
Hi, Gail.

2062
01:31:44,571 --> 01:31:46,774
Guys, this isn't a good idea.
You know what?

2063
01:31:46,899 --> 01:31:49,309
I'll just meet you later.
I shouldn't have come.

2064
01:31:49,434 --> 01:31:50,577
Wait, wait, wait.

2065
01:31:50,702 --> 01:31:53,355
Bob, calm down, okay?
Listen to me.

2066
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,250
Tonight is not gonna be how high
school was for you 20 years ago.

2067
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:57,527
I promise.

2068
01:31:57,652 --> 01:32:00,287
Attention, por favor.

2069
01:32:00,412 --> 01:32:01,697
And now,

2070
01:32:01,822 --> 01:32:04,191
for the moment you've all
been waiting for,

2071
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:08,904
tonight's vote for the reunion
homecoming king and queen!

2072
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:11,265
We'll announce the queen in one moment.

2073
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:13,734
But first, without further ado...

2074
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:15,511
The new homecoming king

2075
01:32:15,636 --> 01:32:19,715
for the Central High School
Centaurs, Class of 1996 is...

2076
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,308
I really gotta pee, Jet.

2077
01:32:21,433 --> 01:32:23,033
Bob Stone!

2078
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:26,881
Do we have a Bob Stone?

2079
01:32:27,006 --> 01:32:29,859
Here he is, Bob Stone, huh!

2080
01:32:29,984 --> 01:32:31,894
Yeah!

2081
01:32:32,019 --> 01:32:35,130
Go on, get your
rock-hard ass up there.

2082
01:32:35,255 --> 01:32:36,198
For reals?

2083
01:32:36,323 --> 01:32:38,959
For reals, for reals.
Go ahead, man.

2084
01:32:39,084 --> 01:32:40,235
Whoo!

2085
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,396
You did it, big guy!

2086
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:50,946
How did Bob Stone win homecoming king?

2087
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:53,482
I hacked into the votes
on the flight in.

2088
01:32:53,607 --> 01:32:55,575
Calvin Joyner, forensic accountant,

2089
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,577
at your service.

2090
01:32:57,702 --> 01:33:00,522
I had no idea you could do that.

2091
01:33:00,647 --> 01:33:04,526
There's a lot of things that you
don't know about me, Maggie.

2092
01:33:04,651 --> 01:33:05,928
No, scratch that I said that.

2093
01:33:06,053 --> 01:33:07,563
It was supposed to
come out cool. It didn't.

2094
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:09,289
It was something I thought
of, it was like a...

2095
01:33:09,414 --> 01:33:11,166
Forget it.

2096
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:13,260
Well, well, let's hear it for him!

2097
01:33:13,385 --> 01:33:15,204
Fat Robbie made good.

2098
01:33:15,329 --> 01:33:17,206
King Robbie Weird Dick,

2099
01:33:17,331 --> 01:33:18,540
our naked mascot.

2100
01:33:18,665 --> 01:33:20,267
Still a scared little bitch.

2101
01:33:24,404 --> 01:33:26,004
I don't like bullies.

2102
01:33:29,209 --> 01:33:31,611
And the name is Bob Stone, bitch!

2103
01:33:31,736 --> 01:33:33,422
Whoo-whoo!

2104
01:33:33,547 --> 01:33:35,147
Come on, baby.
Step over.

2105
01:33:38,652 --> 01:33:40,730
Hi, everybody!

2106
01:33:40,855 --> 01:33:45,200
Most of you knew me back
in high school as, um...

2107
01:33:45,325 --> 01:33:46,836
Robbie Wheirdicht.

2108
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:48,195
That's Robbie Wheirdicht?

2109
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,271
No way!

2110
01:33:49,396 --> 01:33:51,732
I wore prescription pants every day.

2111
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,578
20 years ago, in this gym,

2112
01:33:56,703 --> 01:33:59,481
I stood in front of you all

2113
01:33:59,606 --> 01:34:01,283
naked

2114
01:34:01,408 --> 01:34:03,653
and embarrassed.

2115
01:34:03,778 --> 01:34:06,722
Some of you might remember that day.

2116
01:34:06,847 --> 01:34:09,825
A lot of you probably even laughed.

2117
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:12,294
But that's okay.

2118
01:34:12,419 --> 01:34:15,522
Tonight's gonna be different because

2119
01:34:15,647 --> 01:34:18,826
my best friend is here with me.

2120
01:34:20,694 --> 01:34:22,763
And he taught me what it means

2121
01:34:22,888 --> 01:34:26,834
to be the hero of your own story.

2122
01:34:28,135 --> 01:34:30,204
Would you hold this for me, please?

2123
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:33,573
Being the hero of your own story

2124
01:34:33,698 --> 01:34:38,120
isn't about stopping bad guys
or climbing mountains.

2125
01:34:38,245 --> 01:34:41,348
It's about overcoming
bullies in your life,

2126
01:34:41,473 --> 01:34:45,194
whatever or whomever they may be.

2127
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:48,831
It's about putting it all out there

2128
01:34:48,956 --> 01:34:51,066
for everyone

2129
01:34:51,191 --> 01:34:52,935
to see.

2130
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:55,129
And it's realizing that, in life,

2131
01:34:55,254 --> 01:34:58,473
the most important thing
that you can be...

2132
01:34:58,598 --> 01:35:00,509
is yourself.

2133
01:35:00,634 --> 01:35:02,436
So, Central High,

2134
01:35:02,561 --> 01:35:05,748
Class of 1996,

2135
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:07,249
this is me,

2136
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:09,109
Robbie Wheirdicht.

2137
01:35:19,954 --> 01:35:22,923
Oh, my God! Bob just went commando!

2138
01:35:24,558 --> 01:35:26,836
Yes! Yes!

2139
01:35:30,597 --> 01:35:33,042
Way to go, Bob!

2140
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:34,176
Be you!

2141
01:35:34,301 --> 01:35:36,837
Robbie!
Robbie! Robbie!

2142
01:35:36,962 --> 01:35:40,307
Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!

2143
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:46,555
Hey, man!

2144
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,016
Dude, this is amazing!
I'm so happy for you!

2145
01:35:49,141 --> 01:35:50,918
Thank you, Jet!
I feel so free!

2146
01:35:51,043 --> 01:35:52,227
Come here.

2147
01:35:52,352 --> 01:35:54,654
No, no, no. Your junk is out. Huh?

2148
01:35:54,779 --> 01:35:56,190
Oh. Sorry, Jet.

2149
01:35:56,315 --> 01:35:57,915
Excuse me.

2150
01:35:59,793 --> 01:36:01,771
Hi, Robbie.

2151
01:36:01,896 --> 01:36:03,297
You probably don't remember me.

2152
01:36:03,422 --> 01:36:05,174
Darla.

2153
01:36:05,299 --> 01:36:07,701
Is that Darla McGuckian? Yeah.

2154
01:36:07,826 --> 01:36:09,979
Wow! She looks great!

2155
01:36:10,104 --> 01:36:11,838
Didn't she used to have a lazy eye?

2156
01:36:11,963 --> 01:36:13,182
Two of them.
Wow.

2157
01:36:13,307 --> 01:36:15,542
I can't believe you remember me.

2158
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:17,086
Remember you?

2159
01:36:17,211 --> 01:36:19,154
How could I forget you?

2160
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:22,016
You still have the same sweet smile,

2161
01:36:22,141 --> 01:36:23,725
the same sweet face.

2162
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:25,219
But your hair's changed.

2163
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,288
You used to wear it curlier.
I like it though.

2164
01:36:28,413 --> 01:36:30,357
You haven't changed at all.

2165
01:36:30,482 --> 01:36:32,082
Oh, I don't know.

2166
01:36:38,065 --> 01:36:40,167
You're still as beautiful as ever.

2167
01:36:40,292 --> 01:36:41,892
Oh.

2168
01:36:50,344 --> 01:36:53,288
Yeah, Bob!
Go, Bob!

2169
01:36:53,413 --> 01:36:55,490
No, no, no.

2170
01:37:02,022 --> 01:37:04,333
Oh, I got spinny.

2171
01:37:04,458 --> 01:37:06,260
Super spinny.

2172
01:37:08,762 --> 01:37:10,539
Yeah, that's nice.

2173
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:13,909
That's my jam!

2174
01:37:14,034 --> 01:37:15,135
Go show them what you got.

2175
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,860
All right, Darla.

2176
01:37:20,765 --> 01:37:21,908
Good going, Bob!

2177
01:37:22,033 --> 01:37:23,633
Come on, Bob!

2178
01:37:38,925 --> 01:37:40,569
All right, babe.
Good luck!

2179
01:37:40,694 --> 01:37:41,871
Love you.
I love you.

2180
01:37:41,996 --> 01:37:43,897
I love you, too, little Golden Jet!

2181
01:37:46,633 --> 01:37:47,609
Mmm...

2182
01:37:47,734 --> 01:37:49,544
Okay. Uh...

2183
01:37:49,669 --> 01:37:52,047
How long do you think he's been there?

2184
01:37:52,172 --> 01:37:54,383
Hmm, probably since last night.

2185
01:37:54,508 --> 01:37:56,110
All right, babe, I'll see you later.

2186
01:37:56,235 --> 01:37:58,178
Have fun with your friend!

2187
01:38:03,617 --> 01:38:04,684
Who, me?

2188
01:38:04,809 --> 01:38:06,409
Yes, you.

2189
01:38:15,029 --> 01:38:16,538
Wow, Jet!

2190
01:38:16,663 --> 01:38:18,240
You look amazing!

2191
01:38:18,365 --> 01:38:20,109
Do you think?
Oh, what? Yes!

2192
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:23,237
I just didn't know the kind of look to
go for on my first day at the agency.

2193
01:38:23,362 --> 01:38:25,414
You look like a black
Will Smith, or something.

2194
01:38:25,539 --> 01:38:28,808
Okay, I'm not sure if that's racist or
not, but I'll take it as a compliment.

2195
01:38:28,933 --> 01:38:30,510
All right, cool.
Yeah, come on!

2196
01:38:30,635 --> 01:38:32,087
Okay.

2197
01:38:32,212 --> 01:38:33,555
All right.
Don't be nervous.

2198
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,582
You are gonna do great.
They're gonna love you!

2199
01:38:35,707 --> 01:38:36,992
Oh, Jet, Jet, Jet!

2200
01:38:37,117 --> 01:38:38,717
Um, before we go, man, uh...

2201
01:38:39,786 --> 01:38:41,931
I got a surprise for you.

2202
01:38:42,056 --> 01:38:44,033
Okay.
What's the surprise?

2203
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:47,194
Well, you gotta close your eyes first.

2204
01:38:48,595 --> 01:38:49,896
Eyes are closed.

2205
01:38:50,021 --> 01:38:51,621
No peeking.

2206
01:38:56,503 --> 01:38:58,103
Open your eyes.

2207
01:39:01,641 --> 01:39:04,444
Is that my...
Is that my jacket?

2208
01:39:04,569 --> 01:39:05,354
Yes!

2209
01:39:05,479 --> 01:39:07,481
Bob, is that my jacket? Yes!

2210
01:39:07,606 --> 01:39:09,483
No, wait a minute.
Yes!

2211
01:39:09,608 --> 01:39:11,160
Oh, my God!

2212
01:39:11,285 --> 01:39:12,552
Dude, where'd you get this from?

2213
01:39:12,677 --> 01:39:13,987
Well, I sleep in it most nights,

2214
01:39:14,112 --> 01:39:16,223
but it's clean now,
totally good. Yeah!

2215
01:39:16,348 --> 01:39:19,068
Man! You are
the man! Yes!

2216
01:39:19,193 --> 01:39:20,660
Family hug! What?

2217
01:39:20,785 --> 01:39:22,385
Ooh. Okay.

2218
01:39:23,963 --> 01:39:25,299
All right, let's go!

2219
01:39:25,424 --> 01:39:27,242
Okay.
All right.

2220
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:43,392
You still ride?

2221
01:39:43,517 --> 01:39:46,086
Cut!
The fire department's here.

2222
01:39:46,211 --> 01:39:49,264
All right.
That's our cue, guys!

2223
01:39:49,389 --> 01:39:51,291
Here we are
shooting Central Intelligence.

2224
01:39:51,416 --> 01:39:53,368
They shut us down.
The fire trucks are out here.

2225
01:39:53,493 --> 01:39:55,237
Shut the up! Get
the out my video!

2226
01:39:55,362 --> 01:39:56,563
I'mma slap the dogshit out of you.

2227
01:39:56,688 --> 01:39:58,173
Why do you do your video behind me?

2228
01:39:58,298 --> 01:39:59,633
I'm trying to do my video!
This is my video!

2229
01:39:59,758 --> 01:40:01,435
You're in my video!
I'm pissed off.

2230
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,079
Watch your mouth, I'll slap
the out of you.

2231
01:40:04,204 --> 01:40:05,614
Okay.

2232
01:40:05,739 --> 01:40:07,716
You have it your way.

2233
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:09,809
You leave me no choice.

2234
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:13,155
Pam...

2235
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,489
Tickler! Tickler!

2236
01:40:14,614 --> 01:40:17,993
Where are the codes?
Where are the codes?

2237
01:40:18,118 --> 01:40:19,719
It's just nice.

2238
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:22,731
In here

2239
01:40:22,856 --> 01:40:24,991
and it's kind of all...

2240
01:40:25,116 --> 01:40:26,160
Oh, my God.

2241
01:40:26,285 --> 01:40:27,969
Sorry.

2242
01:40:31,265 --> 01:40:32,674
Can you do both?
Yeah.

2243
01:40:32,799 --> 01:40:34,399
Oh, my God!

2244
01:40:37,137 --> 01:40:38,972
It's called
"soul gazing."

2245
01:40:39,097 --> 01:40:42,917
Stare into my soul,
and I'll stare into yours.

2246
01:40:43,042 --> 01:40:44,978
Come in.
You're not my wife!

2247
01:40:45,103 --> 01:40:46,721
Oh, that's it.

2248
01:40:48,006 --> 01:40:50,292
Bob, I'm gonna...
Shh.

2249
01:40:50,417 --> 01:40:52,017
I promise you'll never...

2250
01:40:53,153 --> 01:40:54,763
Let's keep on, keep on.

2251
01:40:54,888 --> 01:40:56,856
Okay, for real this time.

2252
01:40:56,981 --> 01:40:59,459
It's for real. This is
for real, guys, yeah.

2253
01:40:59,584 --> 01:41:00,802
That's it!
Oh.

2254
01:41:00,927 --> 01:41:02,437
One more. Come on.

2255
01:41:02,562 --> 01:41:03,697
I can't do this, I'm not... Shh.

2256
01:41:03,822 --> 01:41:06,508
- Oh, my God.
- I had it.

2257
01:41:06,633 --> 01:41:07,676
Lock it!
We're professionals.

2258
01:41:07,801 --> 01:41:08,968
This is what we do.
Come on, baby!

2259
01:41:09,093 --> 01:41:10,079
You ready?

2260
01:41:10,204 --> 01:41:11,871
I'm gonna hit you.
I told you!

2261
01:41:14,974 --> 01:41:16,085
Are you not a super tool?

2262
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,177
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.

2263
01:41:17,302 --> 01:41:18,487
You're Bob Stone!

2264
01:41:18,612 --> 01:41:20,113
I made that name up.

2265
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:21,623
So what?
It's not real.

2266
01:41:21,748 --> 01:41:22,682
What does that mean?

2267
01:41:22,807 --> 01:41:25,719
What, you think Mr. T

2268
01:41:25,844 --> 01:41:26,795
and Sting

2269
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:27,896
and The Rock...

2270
01:41:28,021 --> 01:41:29,356
You think those guys are real?

2271
01:41:29,481 --> 01:41:30,965
That's a bunch of dumbass nicknames

2272
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:32,690
by a bunch of dumbass people.

2273
01:47:17,637 --> 01:47:19,237
Fanny!
