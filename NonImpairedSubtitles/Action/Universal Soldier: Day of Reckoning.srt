1
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:03,371
Hey.

2
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,145
Daddy?

3
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,646
Daddy!

4
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,381
Okay, sweetie, I'm here.

5
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:26,220
There's monsters in the house.

6
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,955
There's no monsters
in the house, sweetie.

7
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:34,327
There's monsters, I heard them.

8
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:38,764
Oh, okay.
I'm up, I'm up.

9
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:46,075
Why don't you get into bed
with mommy, okay?

10
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:53,179
Good girl.

11
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:22,408
Okay, I'm gonna check it out.

12
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:26,911
All right.
I'm in the hallway,

13
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:31,048
no monsters.
What about the bedroom? Okay.

14
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,351
- - No monsters
in the bedroom, sweetie.

15
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:37,722
Daddy, look in the kitchen.

16
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:39,925
Okay.

17
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,966
I'm walking down the hallway.

18
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,300
What do we have?

19
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:51,901
No.

20
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:54,037
No monsters in the office.

21
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:57,240
- Daddy.
- Okay, I'm going to the kitchen now.

22
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,145
Here we go.

23
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:09,389
What the hell...

24
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:18,856
No! Oh my God, no!

25
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:22,226
Oh my God, no!
Oh my God! Oh God!

26
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:29,439
Oh oh.

27
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,174
Oh God.
Kathryn.

28
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,512
Oh oh oh.

29
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:43,179
No.

30
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,884
Oh my God.

31
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,556
Christ.

32
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:55,391
Oh God.

33
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:58,429
Oh, please.

34
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,397
Who are you?

35
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:01,538
Who the fuck...

36
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:13,042
What the...

37
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:16,050
what the...
what do you want?

38
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,987
What do you want?

39
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,322
What is this?

40
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:27,459
Oh, don't hurt them.

41
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:31,028
Please don't.
Please.

42
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,097
I'm begging you.
Oh fuck.

43
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:36,366
No. Oh God.

44
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:39,003
If you hurt them,
I swear to God...

45
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:41,905
no!

46
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:45,446
God.

47
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:51,948
You fucking fuck!

48
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,318
Oh! Oh!
Please, not my baby.

49
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,153
Oh God.
My baby, please.

50
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:59,190
No!

51
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:06,966
Reflexes positive, at 2+.

52
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,302
How's our respiratory rate?

53
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,040
Respiratory's at 20
and holding.

54
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,574
Pulse?

55
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:26,985
Check pupil size.

56
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:31,423
Looks like 2mm.

57
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,996
Excellent.

58
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,601
Responding to blood pressure.

59
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,685
Very good.

60
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:03,386
You were thirsty.

61
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:07,031
Now how about a bite of food?

62
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,765
Look.

63
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,202
Mmm.

64
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,504
Delicious.

65
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:22,180
Now you.

66
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,452
Perfect.

67
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:37,087
How we doing today?

68
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:38,789
We're doing great, aren't we?

69
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,494
We're eating our food.

70
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:43,499
Good.

71
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,567
Good.

72
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,469
John?

73
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,304
John?

74
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,806
I'm Dr. Timothy Brady.
I've been, uh,

75
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,478
treating you
since you were admitted.

76
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,145
Though I feel like

77
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,682
we're meeting each other
for the first time.

78
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:08,288
You've been comatose
for the past nine months.

79
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:13,489
This is agent gorman
with the f.B.I.

80
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,292
He has some questions for you.

81
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,163
John.

82
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,841
I'm gonna go
over there now, okay?

83
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,709
Given that you're the sole
eyewitness to the crime,

84
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,178
it's imperative that
we get your testimony

85
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,816
while it's fresh in your mind.

86
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,692
Do you remember the incident?

87
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:51,365
Everything?

88
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,808
Your wife and daughter
didn't survive the attack.

89
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:07,377
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:09,613
Do you...

91
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:13,120
Do you remember anything
before the incident?

92
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Memory loss is to be expected.

93
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:19,322
But with proper therapy

94
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,858
it's likely you'll recover

95
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,798
a large portion of your
memories over time.

96
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:30,840
Have you ever seen this man?

97
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,145
Was he the man who murdered
your wife and daughter?

98
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,715
Yeah.

99
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,416
His name is Luc deveraux.

100
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,687
His prints were all over
the crime scene.

101
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,755
Who is he?

102
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,527
Once a highly-decorated
serviceman,

103
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:58,799
but now he's best
classified as a deserter.

104
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,634
Why did...

105
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:07,307
why did he kill my family?

106
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,812
Can you think of a reason?

107
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,883
I think that's enough for now.

108
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:21,452
Okay.

109
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:24,456
Try to get some rest.

110
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:29,360
Call me if you
remember anything,

111
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,432
no matter how trivial.

112
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:50,417
Put the plumber to work.

113
00:11:06,563 --> 00:11:10,004
The last guy they sent out
charged me 150 bucks.

114
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,705
And it's still leaking.

115
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:18,575
And it's still leaking.

116
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:20,576
It's still leaking,
still leaking.

117
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:22,713
So I called 'em back
and I said,

118
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:26,884
"I already paid once.
I'm not gonna do it again."

119
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:37,864
Hey, are you okay?

120
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:42,533
Oh Jesus.

121
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,806
Hey hey.
Where are you going?

122
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,846
Just sign here

123
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,452
and here.

124
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,966
And these are your things.

125
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,639
Do you like it?

126
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,408
- I love it.
- Because I made it.

127
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,913
I know you did.

128
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,782
Thank you, sweetie.
Thank you so much.

129
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,104
You're welcome.

130
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:57,904
Daddy?

131
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:15,706
Daddy.

132
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,928
There's monsters in the house.

133
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:39,332
Daddy...

134
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,804
Daddy!

135
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,883
Come on in, darling.

136
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:41,057
Double up special this evening.

137
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,250
Give it to me, give it to me.

138
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:18,190
Harder harder harder.

139
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,036
Come on.

140
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:34,897
Oh oh.

141
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:57,824
You came here to kill me.

142
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:02,494
Yet I'm prepared to give you
his greatest gift.

143
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,362
You will be freed.

144
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:08,897
You will serve him.

145
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:11,269
Ah.

146
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,344
From this moment on,

147
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:24,450
you're no longer a slave
to the government.

148
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,550
From this moment on,

149
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:30,323
your mind is your own.

150
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:34,190
You're no longer a slave.

151
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:36,628
From this moment on...
from this moment on...

152
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:43,035
You will seek vengeance
on your oppressors.

153
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:47,136
Freedom is yours.

154
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:29,912
We are brothers.

155
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,949
We are one.

156
00:23:55,265 --> 00:23:57,634
- Hello?
- John.

157
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:03,439
Who's this?

158
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,346
It's Isaac, man.
Is that you?

159
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:10,515
- Yeah, it's me.
- Jesus Christ, man.

160
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:14,383
Where have you been? Has
everything b-been all right?

161
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,652
Everything's fine.

162
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:18,488
Oh man.
I thought you were...

163
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:21,089
you should have called me, man.

164
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,226
- Where are you?
- I'm home now.

165
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:25,627
I can't leave,
you know. They...

166
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:29,065
they've been calling. I don't
know what it's about, man.

167
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,601
I haven't picked up the phone.

168
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:34,237
That's good.

169
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:36,471
Anyways he's not
making it easy, man.

170
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:39,374
Everything's here.
It's loaded.

171
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,710
It's waiting to be
picked up, man.

172
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,712
But I don't know what to do.

173
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:46,048
You need to come over,
man, please.

174
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,351
- What's the address?
- Oh, you know.

175
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:51,354
- It's in my house.
- Tell me again.

176
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:54,556
I don't understand, man.
I'm worried.

177
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:58,060
I think they're watching me, man.
I don't think I'm safe.

178
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:00,729
Okay, give me the address
and I'll come.

179
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,701
Man, it's... you know I'm
at woodland commons, 9c, man.

180
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:09,238
Same as before, man. I'm sorry,
but it's just too much, man.

181
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,174
You got to get here.

182
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,661
Isaac kiakov, 3-26,

183
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:28,364
significant progress
reducing gestation period

184
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,700
from phase ii of
universal soldier program.

185
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:32,977
We'll know in a few weeks
if everything looks good.

186
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:43,679
Conversion rate
on embryos is way up.

187
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,681
Incubation period dropping
below nine months.

188
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:49,352
Dr. su plans on adding
somatic stem cells

189
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:52,020
to the injection to make
the inhibitors more effective.

190
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:55,758
Still, I'm skeptical if we could
achieve a complete override.

191
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,913
As for implants, still a
struggle at the moment.

192
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,040
All right. How about a big round
of applause for fantasia?

193
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,477
Now put your hands together

194
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:59,048
for the lovely,
the luxurious raven.

195
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,826
Do you know me? Wait wait,
I wanna talk to you.

196
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,028
You really shouldn't be here.

197
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:15,968
Why is that?

198
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:20,134
You don't know?

199
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:23,639
- I'm working.
- I'll pay for your time.

200
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,641
- But I don't have time.
- Isaac kiakov.

201
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:27,978
- Get your hands off me.
- Do you know Isaac kiakov?

202
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,979
Hey, sweet tits.
How about a dance for Larry?

203
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,681
Yeah okay, Larry. I got time...
get your fucking hands off me.

204
00:32:33,682 --> 00:32:35,183
Get your fucking hands off her!

205
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:36,684
- Larry.
- Faggot!

206
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:37,854
Come on.
We got to dance.

207
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,694
What the fuck?

208
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:04,818
Your mind is not your own.

209
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,986
Your mind

210
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:20,034
is not your own.

211
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,869
Mommy!

212
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,975
Get him.

213
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:41,248
Hey!

214
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:47,860
Stay the fuck out.

215
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,067
Calm down.

216
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:41,837
Calm the fuck down!

217
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,473
Or I'm gonna hurt you.

218
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:46,442
Shh.

219
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,911
- No.
- Calm down or I'm gonna hurt you.

220
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:54,423
Calm down.

221
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:03,927
Why did you come back?

222
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:34,827
John!

223
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:39,936
Jesus Christ.

224
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:23,273
Back, John!

225
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,907
My brothers.

226
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,443
Let's not forget
the moment of sickness.

227
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:04,046
Our thoughts interrupted by

228
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:07,384
unfamiliar worships.

229
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,585
We were merely arms and legs

230
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:13,555
moving to the directive
of another mind.

231
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:17,058
But in an instant
the veil has lifted.

232
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,530
And today, brothers,
I stand here to declare

233
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,398
your minds are now your own.

234
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:30,638
Each and every one of us
bred into slavery,

235
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,908
superior to our creators.

236
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:36,979
They gave us nothing...
nothing inside

237
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,448
but the void in our soul,

238
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:41,582
the curse

239
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,554
that binds us
together, my brothers.

240
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:48,323
But then he came along.

241
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:51,560
He turned the curse

242
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:54,562
into a blessing.

243
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:57,131
He is the inspiration.

244
00:38:57,132 --> 00:38:59,034
He is the light
that set us free.

245
00:39:01,503 --> 00:39:03,138
We are his eyes and ears

246
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:06,140
and soon we shall multiply 10,

247
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:09,481
20, a hundredfold!

248
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:15,917
We pioneers will spawn
the first generation

249
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,220
blessed with free will,

250
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:20,589
taking vengeance upon
those whose arrogance

251
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,991
once assumed our servitude.

252
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:26,962
With each passing day,

253
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:29,564
we grow stronger,

254
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:32,301
digging deeper
into the outside world.

255
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:35,337
Unnoticed, we live
among them like ghosts,

256
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:38,239
biding our time,
waiting for the moment

257
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,542
when our oppressors shall
be forced to kneel before us

258
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:42,713
and pay for their sins!

259
00:39:44,713 --> 00:39:47,157
The day of reckoning!

260
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:31,326
In the club,

261
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:34,067
you looked at me
like you didn't know me.

262
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:40,539
Do you know me, John?

263
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,207
Yes.

264
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,514
What's my name?

265
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:54,554
Fantasia.

266
00:40:59,554 --> 00:41:02,063
You don't remember
anything, do you?

267
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:09,333
No.

268
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,572
Something happened to me.

269
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:20,159
You really should go
to the hospital for this.

270
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,560
You remember where I worked?

271
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:42,730
Where I spent my days?

272
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:45,369
You drove a truck.

273
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:51,105
Picked things up down by
the dock near the club.

274
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:54,210
Some of my customers
work over there.

275
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,178
The last time
we saw each other,

276
00:41:57,179 --> 00:41:59,751
tell me how you remember it.

277
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:05,722
We spent the night before
at your place.

278
00:42:07,722 --> 00:42:09,624
You've been to my house?

279
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:12,828
It's not exactly a house.

280
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,497
More like a shack

281
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:18,133
out on the river.

282
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:20,602
Do you remember
how to get there?

283
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:22,770
I think so.

284
00:42:22,771 --> 00:42:25,339
Anybody else know
about this place?

285
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,811
I don't know.

286
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:31,279
Okay, finish the story.

287
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,550
You came by the club,

288
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,453
sat in the corner
and watched me.

289
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:41,156
Same as always.

290
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:44,460
Drinking whiskey.

291
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,530
After my shift, I go to change.

292
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,698
And on my way outside,

293
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,737
I hear yelling coming
from the parking lot.

294
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:59,573
By the time I make it outside, you
were already into it with some guy.

295
00:42:59,574 --> 00:43:02,209
It all happened really quick.

296
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,413
I scream your name,
but you wouldn't stop.

297
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:07,485
You were just
pounding this guy.

298
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:12,821
He couldn't fight back

299
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:16,197
and still you don't stop.

300
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:24,869
Even the bouncers were
afraid to get involved.

301
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:29,405
I scream your name.

302
00:43:30,405 --> 00:43:32,806
Finally you stop.

303
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:35,947
You go to your car
and you take off.

304
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:40,288
The guy wasn't moving.

305
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,461
This is the last time
I saw you.

306
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:54,702
Why do you think I did that?

307
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:02,889
Because he looked at me.

308
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:12,610
Come here.

309
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,980
- Come here.
- Agh!

310
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,684
Come here.

311
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:25,389
Daddy?

312
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:30,325
I can't sleep.

313
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:31,876
There's monsters.

314
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:49,512
No-ooo!

315
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:41,830
Are you alone?

316
00:46:41,831 --> 00:46:43,835
Yeah.

317
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:49,110
What happened?

318
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,748
Are you in trouble, John?

319
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:01,049
My head injury,

320
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,920
it's not getting any better.

321
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,122
In fact, it feels
like it's getting worse.

322
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:09,424
I can't remember anything.

323
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:12,393
You heard what Brady said.
That's gonna take some time.

324
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,000
No, it's more than that.

325
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,704
I'm seeing things.

326
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:23,738
I'm seeing things
that aren't even there.

327
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:24,742
What are you seeing?

328
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:28,884
Him.

329
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:36,822
Deveraux?

330
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:41,893
How many of these
visions have you had?

331
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:47,032
I guess two.

332
00:47:51,032 --> 00:47:53,834
Over the past three years,
a number of our agents

333
00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:55,873
have disappeared off the grid.

334
00:47:57,873 --> 00:48:01,077
Now, we assumed that they have
been kidnapped or killed.

335
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:04,712
And then in June,

336
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:06,747
one of those agents was spotted

337
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:09,052
on a surveillance tape
taken at the docks.

338
00:48:11,052 --> 00:48:13,921
He was with a man that we
believe to be deveraux.

339
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:16,825
The prevailing theory
is that deveraux

340
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:18,959
had brainwashed him,
among others,

341
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,930
and he's... he's forming some
sort of separatist group

342
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:24,232
that's operating
out of these parts.

343
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,834
What's that got to do with me?

344
00:48:26,835 --> 00:48:29,505
We heard that the individuals that
have had contact with deveraux

345
00:48:30,505 --> 00:48:32,509
are experiencing
similar visions.

346
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:37,645
He may be using some kind
of mind-control technique

347
00:48:37,646 --> 00:48:40,085
in an attempt
to access your psyche.

348
00:48:44,085 --> 00:48:47,023
I can feel him watching me.

349
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:50,158
Look, he may be.

350
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:52,727
And if he is,

351
00:48:52,728 --> 00:48:54,668
we will find him.

352
00:48:59,668 --> 00:49:01,876
Thanks for talking to me.

353
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:09,682
John.

354
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:16,584
If you go looking for deveraux,

355
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:18,911
he'll find you first.

356
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:27,996
Get him, come on, get him!

357
00:52:58,273 --> 00:53:00,308
This is it.

358
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:01,510
You wait here.

359
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,882
- I'll be back 10 minutes.
- And what if you're not?

360
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:08,317
Wait another 10.

361
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:30,270
Your buddy kept calling,

362
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:32,540
asking if you'd picked up
your shit or not.

363
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:35,276
Kept calling and calling.

364
00:53:35,277 --> 00:53:37,812
But I guess he won't be
calling any more.

365
00:53:37,813 --> 00:53:39,379
Where is my shit?

366
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,316
Where do you think?
Bring your truck around.

367
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:44,951
I don't have the truck.

368
00:53:44,952 --> 00:53:47,489
- But I wanna take a look.
- It's all there.

369
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:50,457
Yeah, I wanna take a look.

370
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,806
Take a look.
I don't give a fuck.

371
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:07,008
Where'd I take
the last container?

372
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:09,009
Why are you asking me?

373
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,445
Just tell me where it went.

374
00:54:10,446 --> 00:54:11,979
I don't know...

375
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,018
down river, up river.
It's not my problem.

376
00:54:17,018 --> 00:54:20,254
Hey, man, look, this is between
you and Mr. castellano.

377
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:23,156
I just work here.

378
00:54:23,157 --> 00:54:24,991
And where is
Mr. castellano?

379
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:27,294
Where he always is.

380
00:54:27,295 --> 00:54:29,096
He's in his office.

381
00:54:29,097 --> 00:54:31,566
And he would know
where the shipments go?

382
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:35,335
Nothing goes up the river
unless Ron castellano says so.

383
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:37,141
Good. I want
to talk to him.

384
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:42,042
I don't think right now is a good time.
I don't...

385
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:44,114
I don't know if...
you know what I'm saying?

386
00:54:47,114 --> 00:54:48,619
Okay.

387
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:19,014
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

388
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:42,371
How you've been, John?

389
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:45,239
Make yourself at home.

390
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:56,184
You make him scared too, John.

391
00:55:57,184 --> 00:55:59,222
That's when
he's most dangerous.

392
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:02,924
Yeah, I'm more careful now.

393
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:04,461
You can see that.

394
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:09,998
I keep an eye on things.

395
00:56:10,998 --> 00:56:12,633
My shipment,

396
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:15,304
where's it going?

397
00:56:16,304 --> 00:56:19,205
If I knew I wouldn't tell you,

398
00:56:19,206 --> 00:56:20,644
but I don't.

399
00:56:23,644 --> 00:56:26,014
I never did, John.

400
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:28,619
You made sure of that.

401
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:33,354
I let you take
your containers up my river.

402
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:36,189
I didn't ask you where
you were going.

403
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,295
I learned my lesson.

404
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:42,567
You don't know anything,
do you?

405
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,702
You're like him.

406
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:51,439
If someone leaves
the room for 20 minutes,

407
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,112
you'll forget they exist.

408
00:56:58,112 --> 00:57:00,180
This man.

409
00:57:00,181 --> 00:57:03,149
- You know him?
- Go fuck yourself.

410
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,460
Take it easy.

411
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,194
What difference
does it make, yeah?

412
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:16,363
What more can you take from me?

413
00:57:16,364 --> 00:57:18,698
You tell me who he is.

414
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:20,667
Why don't you tell me?

415
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:23,780
He's your fucking boss,
not mine.

416
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:38,585
Your container was
sitting there collecting dust.

417
00:57:38,586 --> 00:57:40,791
It made us wonder.

418
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,563
So we took a look at your buddy
Isaac, that little worm.

419
00:57:48,563 --> 00:57:50,497
But we kept an eye on him.

420
00:57:50,498 --> 00:57:53,279
Hey, I got all the time
in the world.

421
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:06,781
Every morning

422
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:09,683
when they're emptying
my piss bag,

423
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:13,257
I think about eating
the barrel of a shotgun.

424
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:17,424
But a gun,

425
00:58:17,425 --> 00:58:19,660
it don't allow these

426
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:21,539
little moments of bliss...

427
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:33,384
To get you through your day.

428
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:48,532
You're fucked.

429
00:58:57,532 --> 00:58:59,802
You're fucked, John.

430
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:03,574
You're fucked!

431
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:30,163
It's not safe here.
We need to find that cabin.

432
00:59:30,164 --> 00:59:32,134
- You remember where it is, right?
- I think so.

433
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:35,201
It's on highway 15 west...

434
00:59:35,202 --> 00:59:39,375
fuck, no, wait.
Is it 15 or is it...

435
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:10,271
Get down!

436
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,389
Hold on.

437
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:37,282
Oh my God.

438
01:02:09,356 --> 01:02:10,543
He's right there!
What the fuck are you doing?

439
01:03:01,543 --> 01:03:02,746
Ah!

440
01:03:46,086 --> 01:03:47,791
Come on.

441
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:51,658
Get back.

442
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:54,065
Look out!

443
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:48,836
You guys all right?

444
01:06:49,836 --> 01:06:51,887
Hey. Hey!

445
01:10:12,372 --> 01:10:14,182
John.

446
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:50,550
I was trying to remember
what you looked like.

447
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,050
It started off...

448
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:00,353
Better, but...

449
01:11:00,354 --> 01:11:02,560
I don't know.

450
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,462
After a while...

451
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:10,402
It got harder.

452
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:17,405
I can remember now.

453
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:21,376
So what are you?
My brother?

454
01:11:22,376 --> 01:11:26,050
No, we're kind of like
the same sort of thing.

455
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:31,417
But maybe they made you better.

456
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:33,320
You mean Isaac?

457
01:11:35,021 --> 01:11:37,890
Yeah, I think that's his name.

458
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:40,059
So you killed him.

459
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,127
It was you?

460
01:11:42,128 --> 01:11:44,432
Everything?

461
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:47,533
Yeah, I killed him.

462
01:11:47,534 --> 01:11:50,042
I had to.

463
01:11:56,042 --> 01:11:58,380
Do you work for him?

464
01:12:03,516 --> 01:12:07,021
I get up every morning,

465
01:12:08,021 --> 01:12:10,391
I go to work.

466
01:12:14,427 --> 01:12:17,330
I come home, I go to sleep.

467
01:12:17,331 --> 01:12:20,069
The next day... repeat.

468
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:25,908
Feels like a life,
but I'm not sure.

469
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:29,309
Something feels strange.

470
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:32,480
Then one day I got sick.

471
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,616
I can hear this voice
in my head

472
01:12:36,617 --> 01:12:40,353
telling me
that I gotta find him.

473
01:12:40,354 --> 01:12:43,594
Telling me that
I gotta kill him.

474
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:49,395
So I go.

475
01:12:49,396 --> 01:12:52,465
And I find him

476
01:12:52,466 --> 01:12:55,371
and then he shows me the truth.

477
01:12:57,371 --> 01:12:58,942
And my thoughts?

478
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:03,045
They're not my own.

479
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:06,278
He shows me where they live...

480
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:08,516
In here,

481
01:13:09,516 --> 01:13:11,287
tracking me.

482
01:13:14,287 --> 01:13:15,692
And then he sets me free.

483
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:20,559
So now I'm with him.

484
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,099
He tells me I gotta find...

485
01:13:25,099 --> 01:13:27,533
- Isaac.
- ...Isaac.

486
01:13:27,534 --> 01:13:29,635
Yeah.

487
01:13:29,636 --> 01:13:34,174
I gotta get some
container from him,

488
01:13:34,175 --> 01:13:37,176
take it to the docks,
send it upriver.

489
01:13:37,177 --> 01:13:40,048
So I do as I'm told.

490
01:13:42,048 --> 01:13:43,689
I always do.

491
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:51,056
Then I met you.

492
01:13:51,057 --> 01:13:53,660
And that's when I realize

493
01:13:53,661 --> 01:13:56,161
I'm not free

494
01:13:56,162 --> 01:13:58,665
and that I'm just
a slave to him.

495
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:02,204
So I leave him.

496
01:14:04,204 --> 01:14:07,077
I don't think I was
supposed to meet you.

497
01:14:10,077 --> 01:14:11,745
No.

498
01:14:11,746 --> 01:14:14,484
I'm different than you.

499
01:14:16,484 --> 01:14:18,283
I had a family...

500
01:14:18,284 --> 01:14:20,219
a wife,

501
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,121
a daughter.

502
01:14:22,122 --> 01:14:25,092
I can remember.

503
01:14:26,092 --> 01:14:27,697
The memories...

504
01:14:29,697 --> 01:14:31,663
It hurts,

505
01:14:31,664 --> 01:14:33,767
doesn't it?

506
01:14:33,768 --> 01:14:36,135
Yes.

507
01:14:36,136 --> 01:14:38,670
Go to him.

508
01:14:38,671 --> 01:14:40,710
He'll help you forget.

509
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,778
Go to the river.

510
01:14:44,779 --> 01:14:48,309
They'll come for you.

511
01:15:15,309 --> 01:15:16,757
I knew you'd come back.

512
01:15:30,757 --> 01:15:32,662
Now I can make it go away.

513
01:15:34,662 --> 01:15:36,395
John?

514
01:15:36,396 --> 01:15:38,466
John.

515
01:15:39,466 --> 01:15:40,716
John, stop it!

516
01:15:56,716 --> 01:15:59,490
You're just like me.

517
01:16:07,494 --> 01:16:10,198
It's okay.

518
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:13,878
It's okay.

519
01:16:24,878 --> 01:16:27,481
Take it out.

520
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:30,416
T-take what out?

521
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:32,453
You'll know when you find it.

522
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:46,751
Ahh.

523
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:18,417
Now you're free.

524
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:36,251
Hello, John.
Nice to finally meet.

525
01:22:37,251 --> 01:22:39,657
Please tilt your head
and open your mouth.

526
01:22:43,657 --> 01:22:46,692
You're just a baby.

527
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:50,034
You couldn't be more
than three weeks old.

528
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:57,238
Are you feeling any discomfort?

529
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:00,206
Yes.

530
01:23:00,207 --> 01:23:02,144
Where?

531
01:23:04,144 --> 01:23:05,680
In my head.

532
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,581
Your resistance...

533
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:12,218
that's what
gives you discomfort.

534
01:23:12,219 --> 01:23:14,122
Do you understand?

535
01:23:16,122 --> 01:23:18,256
Yes.

536
01:23:18,257 --> 01:23:21,197
Can you release it?

537
01:23:24,197 --> 01:23:25,637
Why not?

538
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:33,743
What do you remember?

539
01:23:36,743 --> 01:23:38,344
My wife.

540
01:23:38,345 --> 01:23:40,585
Anything else?

541
01:23:44,585 --> 01:23:46,756
My daughter.

542
01:23:50,756 --> 01:23:53,125
What happened to them?

543
01:23:53,126 --> 01:23:54,926
He killed them.

544
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:57,166
Who killed them?

545
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:01,000
Him.

546
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:04,372
You never had a family, John.

547
01:24:06,372 --> 01:24:09,144
Your memories are artificial.

548
01:24:11,144 --> 01:24:13,144
You were produced
in a government lab

549
01:24:13,145 --> 01:24:14,813
where I used to work.

550
01:24:14,814 --> 01:24:16,983
Created to kill,

551
01:24:16,984 --> 01:24:20,185
motivated by a memory implant

552
01:24:20,186 --> 01:24:21,987
that I developed

553
01:24:21,988 --> 01:24:25,191
that stimulates
the sensation of free will.

554
01:24:25,192 --> 01:24:28,126
They created the memory

555
01:24:28,127 --> 01:24:31,029
of your wife and daughter.

556
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:34,371
They never really existed.

557
01:24:37,371 --> 01:24:39,738
You're a newborn...

558
01:24:39,739 --> 01:24:42,011
born a grown man.

559
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:46,411
Your memories, John,

560
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:49,281
they give you pain.

561
01:24:49,282 --> 01:24:51,951
But I can release you
from them.

562
01:24:51,952 --> 01:24:55,024
I can release you
from your pain.

563
01:24:57,024 --> 01:24:59,229
Would you like
to be free from pain?

564
01:25:02,229 --> 01:25:04,113
Yes.

565
01:25:20,113 --> 01:25:23,216
The one before you was
gonna bring the container.

566
01:25:24,216 --> 01:25:27,356
The container holds
the missing pieces, John.

567
01:25:30,356 --> 01:25:33,363
So we can finish this lab.

568
01:25:36,363 --> 01:25:39,331
So we can replicate

569
01:25:39,332 --> 01:25:42,055
just like everyone else.

570
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,220
You're doing great, John.

571
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:09,788
Daddy, it's raining.

572
01:27:09,789 --> 01:27:11,091
I got it.

573
01:27:12,091 --> 01:27:13,393
Come on.

574
01:27:22,402 --> 01:27:24,841
I want a story.

575
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:29,474
Right here.

576
01:27:29,475 --> 01:27:32,479
How'd it get so deep?

577
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:12,627
Hello, soldier.

578
01:34:09,309 --> 01:34:10,975
That's the spirit soldier.

579
01:34:10,976 --> 01:34:13,315
Ahhhh!

580
01:35:19,945 --> 01:35:22,916
You still believe the lies?

581
01:35:23,916 --> 01:35:25,716
You don't realize

582
01:35:25,717 --> 01:35:27,689
this is your home?

583
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,301
You killed them.

584
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:44,972
If you believe I did...

585
01:35:46,972 --> 01:35:50,090
Then I did.

586
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:06,726
You're only killing
your own father.

587
01:39:46,112 --> 01:39:48,917
There is no end.

588
01:39:50,917 --> 01:39:52,951
Always

589
01:39:52,952 --> 01:39:54,771
another John.

590
01:42:27,006 --> 01:42:29,109
How did you know I'd find him?

591
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:33,377
You always find each other.

592
01:42:33,378 --> 01:42:34,748
You're like dogs that way.

593
01:42:36,748 --> 01:42:38,920
You know, I suppose
I should be grateful, but...

594
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,956
I can't help but feel proud.

595
01:42:43,956 --> 01:42:45,956
How's that?

596
01:42:45,957 --> 01:42:48,895
Because we were
right this time.

597
01:42:50,895 --> 01:42:53,297
Your memories triggered
emotional responses

598
01:42:53,298 --> 01:42:55,366
that made you resistant.

599
01:42:55,367 --> 01:42:58,404
You acted on your own
behest, not ours.

600
01:42:59,404 --> 01:43:02,439
You were designed
with selfish motivations...

601
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:05,145
loyalty to family, not country.

602
01:43:07,145 --> 01:43:09,214
The John that came before you?

603
01:43:09,215 --> 01:43:11,750
Sent on the same exact mission.

604
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:15,420
And he came the closest,
but he disappeared.

605
01:43:15,421 --> 01:43:17,988
We made the necessary
adjustments,

606
01:43:17,989 --> 01:43:21,362
knowing that you'd pick up
right where he left off.

607
01:43:23,362 --> 01:43:25,362
You know where he is?

608
01:43:25,363 --> 01:43:27,866
Mmmm.
We'll find him though.

609
01:43:27,867 --> 01:43:30,270
We always do.

610
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:35,038
What about me?

611
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:38,242
We'll take you in,
erase some memories

612
01:43:38,243 --> 01:43:40,444
and then you'll be...

613
01:43:40,445 --> 01:43:43,247
then you'll be free.

614
01:43:43,248 --> 01:43:45,349
Truly free.

615
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:48,055
You seem disappointed.

616
01:43:51,055 --> 01:43:54,125
Come on, I know you, John,
like a father knows his child.

617
01:43:54,126 --> 01:43:56,461
You might not know me
as well as you think.

618
01:43:56,462 --> 01:43:58,363
I know that if you
didn't stop them,

619
01:43:58,364 --> 01:44:00,564
they would've
reproduced by now.

620
01:44:00,565 --> 01:44:03,073
Once that door is open...

621
01:44:08,073 --> 01:44:10,575
That's how much
you mean to me...

622
01:44:10,576 --> 01:44:13,283
everybody.

623
01:44:17,283 --> 01:44:19,584
So you created me

624
01:44:19,585 --> 01:44:22,420
to find the one
who killed my family

625
01:44:22,421 --> 01:44:25,055
and put them to death.

626
01:44:25,056 --> 01:44:28,429
That is correct.

627
01:44:30,429 --> 01:44:31,865
You killed my family.

628
01:44:33,865 --> 01:44:35,502
See? That's what
makes you so special.

629
01:44:36,502 --> 01:44:38,903
You feel so intensely.

630
01:44:38,904 --> 01:44:40,871
You killed my family.

631
01:44:40,872 --> 01:44:43,510
No no, quite the contrary.
I created them...

632
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:48,182
For you. I created them
to fill your void.

633
01:44:51,182 --> 01:44:53,251
And then you killed them.

634
01:44:53,252 --> 01:44:55,055
I didn't kill them, John.

635
01:44:57,055 --> 01:44:58,525
Luc deveraux did.

636
01:45:00,525 --> 01:45:01,962
Maybe.

637
01:45:03,962 --> 01:45:05,532
But you put him up to it.
