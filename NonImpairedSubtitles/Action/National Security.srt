1
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,625
How long does it take to make a taco?

2
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,431
Two minutes. But it takes 20
to convince them l'm not lmmigration...

3
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,063
...to get the cook up
from the basement. Here.

4
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,232
Call it.

5
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,335
-Ex-con.
-No way.

6
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:21,980
-What?
-Wannabe cop.

7
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,345
-He's got ''academy reject'' all over him.
-Hey, pal.

8
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,678
Hey, buddy.

9
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,377
-Try ''dude.''
-Hey, dude!

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,390
-You did time in Chino, right?
-No, Lompoc.

11
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,720
l told you. Only job the
poor bastards can get. Thanks.

12
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,097
Thirteen-A-six-seven, a 4-59...

13
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,129
...silent alarm. Centurion
Storage, Alvarado and Marathon.

14
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,138
A-six-seven, roger.

15
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,206
Thirteen-A-six-seven,
cancel that alarm.

16
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,643
-Must've been a power glitch.
-Want to take a peek?

17
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,250
Why is it that on these quiet
nights you get restless?

18
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,355
This is a great opportunity for us
to connect, you know?

19
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:08,593
We can open up with one another
and really talk. You need a hug?

20
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,752
Shut up.

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,964
You called it.

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,370
A-six-seven, door open,
Centurion Storage...

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,316
-...Alameda and 22nd. Request backup.
-Roger.

24
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,644
-Let's go.
-Three-one en route.

25
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,352
Hey, Charlie, you ever hear
of that word ''stealth''?

26
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,257
Shut up.

27
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:48,758
At least they don't know we're here.
The element of surprise.

28
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,061
-Ready?
-Yeah, l'm ready.

29
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,499
-Go on.
-You're unbelievable.

30
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,357
-Let's split up.
-Okay.

31
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,917
Hank!

32
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:49,027
A-six-seven, shots fired!
Shots fired! Officer needs help!

33
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,633
Hank, taking fire, four to five
suspects on my side.

34
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,600
Hank!

35
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,922
Come in! Where you at?

36
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,427
l'm in the big room, off the office.

37
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,165
-Hank!
-l got you!

38
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,697
-Hank!
-lt's bulletproof! l'm coming in!

39
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,445
Charlie! Your six!

40
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,642
What?

41
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,350
Your six!

42
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,058
A-six-seven, my partner's down!

43
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,098
Request paramedics.
l have four suspects, armed!

44
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,705
My partner has been hit!

45
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,877
All units, all units, all L.A. units.
Officer down. Officer down.

46
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,604
lmpressive, Montgomery.

47
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,266
You realize, though, you missed
the target in the middle.

48
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,705
Who, the brother?
l wasn't shooting at him.

49
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,474
-Mind telling me why not?
-He don't look suspicious.

50
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:58,581
Look at him. One brother, surrounded
by four white guys with guns.

51
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,391
The man is terrified.

52
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,460
You want him to tap-dance?

53
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,893
lt's all right, brother.
Okay? l got you.

54
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,932
Don't be afraid to call 91 1 .

55
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,401
l keeps it clean, when
Montgomery's on the scene.

56
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,497
What the problem is?

57
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,815
On behalf of the citizens
of Los Angeles...

58
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,719
...l present to you our nation's flag.

59
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,158
McDuff.

60
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,325
Sorry. He was a good man.

61
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,662
l want in on the investigation.

62
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:48,000
l think it's best if we let McDuff
handle this. lt's complicated.

63
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,705
What's complicated?

64
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,470
My partner's dead. l want the
son of a bitch who did it.

65
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,411
There was $800,000 of
stolen computer chips there...

66
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,049
...and a warrant to seize it.

67
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,447
Last night, somebody cleared it out.

68
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,349
l don't care about computer chips.
l want the guy who killed Charlie.

69
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,391
You're not a detective.
Stick to your job.

70
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,355
-Fine.
-lnterfere with an investigation...

71
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,725
-...you won't have a job.
-Fine.

72
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,493
-They're gonna find him.
-Yeah.

73
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:19,331
When chasing a suspect,
maintain visual contact...

74
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:23,271
...until a backup force can
arrive to assist in the arrest.

75
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,440
Time!

76
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,307
Nice job, Taylor.

77
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,417
Say something, Montgomery?

78
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,913
You said, ''Nice job, Taylor,''
and l just said:

79
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,684
-Think you can do it better?
-Let me think.

80
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,661
Check me out.

81
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,990
Hey, Taylor, you think he ready?

82
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,032
-l'll take this.
-All yours.

83
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,728
Show this boy how it's done.

84
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,572
So you the suspect, man?
What you do?

85
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,909
Doesn't matter.

86
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,212
You could've robbed a bank,
mugged an old lady...

87
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,185
...said something about my mama?

88
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,255
Just chase me, smartmouth.

89
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,190
Okay, Mr. White Bank Robber.

90
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,476
You're insane!

91
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,781
And you're resisting arrest.

92
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,360
Don't you run from me.
Don't you run from me.

93
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,765
l'm insane? l'm insane when it
comes to old-lady muggers, huh?

94
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,130
You like robbing banks, huh?
You said something about my mama?

95
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,239
And l heard you call me ''boy.''

96
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,837
That's cowboy to you.

97
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,446
Time!

98
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,652
l see how this works.

99
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,888
The system can't tolerate a black man
with superior skills.

100
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,291
l'm the future, and it scares you...

101
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,093
...because you'll be out of work!

102
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,361
l remember when the
NBA was all white.

103
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,497
That's all right. That's all right. l'm cool.

104
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:14,010
Because y'all losing somebody good.
l'm a one-man, kung-fu SWAT team.

105
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,209
That's all right.

106
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,180
l got skills!

107
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,751
You bitches!

108
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,317
Hank.

109
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,429
-You don't have to get out there so soon.
-No, l'm better off.

110
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,624
-Want somebody to ride with you?
-Nope. lt's okay.

111
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,801
Need some help?

112
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,182
You asking me if l need help,
or if l'm stealing this car?

113
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,179
Okay, fine.

114
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,184
Are you stealing this car?

115
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,115
Does it look like l'm stealing this car?

116
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,920
-Little bit.
-Why? Because l'm black?

117
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,163
White man has his hand in the car...

118
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,525
...you give him a Good
Samaritan award.

119
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,396
Figure he's going around
turning off people's lights.

120
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,533
All right, license and
registration, please.

121
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,608
l ain't showing you a
damn thing, you Nazi.

122
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,271
-Excuse me?
-Hey, man!

123
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,346
This here? This is my car.

124
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,913
l ain't done nothing wrong.

125
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,608
The way l see it...

126
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,583
-...you owe me an apology.
-What did you call me?

127
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:06,316
You ain't listening, baby.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.

128
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,757
Unless it starts
with you saying, ''l'm sorry.''

129
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,828
You're on dangerous grounds.

130
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,430
Be careful what comes
out of your mouth next.

131
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,163
Wanna hear what comes
out of my mouth next?

132
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,598
You're...

133
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,505
...a...

134
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,197
...fucking...

135
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,399
...pig.

136
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,236
-You're under arrest.
-Oh, no.

137
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,577
l ain't under arrest. You are.
l'm arresting your ass.

138
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,278
Citizen's arrest. You're under
arrest for false arrest.

139
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,682
Hands up on the car!
Give me those cuffs.

140
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,688
Back off! l'm warning you.

141
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,260
You're warning me? You
have the right to shut up.

142
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,363
That's it, get up against the car!

143
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,328
Don't make me add ''resisting arrest.''

144
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,967
Now! Up against the car!

145
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:54,368
-Watch my car, l just had it detailed.
-Settle down! Understand?

146
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,303
This is police brutality!

147
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,676
You ain't doing nothing but
compounding problems.

148
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,474
-l've had enough crap!
-l'm telling you, man. Get off me.

149
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,205
Whoa!

150
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,651
-What?
-A big-ass bumblebee behind you!

151
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,855
You don't think l'll fall for that, do you?

152
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,424
l'm allergic. lf l get stung...

153
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,854
...l'm gonna seize up and die.

154
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,790
What? Just ignore him
and he won't touch you.

155
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,331
-Yeah. All right.
-Look! Right there.

156
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,330
l'm gonna--

157
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,668
Help! He's trying to kill me!

158
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,576
-Help! Help! He's trying to kill me!
-Get down! l got him!

159
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,005
Don't kill me!

160
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,543
l got him!

161
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,018
He's trying to kill me!

162
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,250
-You are seeing video...
-Check this out.

163
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,921
...taken earlier today, showing
Los Angeles officer, Hank Rafferty...

164
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,000
...brutally beating an
unidentified black male.

165
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,602
Police are withholding his name...

166
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,239
...but we have obtained
this photograph...

167
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:07,141
...taken after the beating, his face
grotesquely bruised and swollen.

168
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,513
lt was a bumblebee.

169
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,117
Officer Rafferty's vicious
beating of a black suspect...

170
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,883
...has sparked a swift and angry
response from the black community.

171
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,425
Detective McDuff had this reaction:

172
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:27,760
The police and the district attorney's
office are treating this very seriously.

173
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,864
I urge the people of this city...

174
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,095
...to please be patient and
trust us to do our jobs.

175
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,706
Clearly, this is an isolated incident.

176
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,742
-lt was a bee.
-Get the hell out of here.

177
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,614
Mr. Montgomery, this
is Detective McDuff...

178
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,793
...Lieutenant Washington and
District Attorney Robert Barton.

179
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,557
-Morning.
-Good morning. Call me.

180
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,190
l'm serious.
Giggler. All right.

181
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:08,131
Weren't you on TV last night?
Oh, snap, that is you.

182
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,105
-What's up, man?
-What happened to your face?

183
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,446
l was attacked by one of your officers.
What do you think?

184
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,138
l mean, what happened to the
swelling and bruises?

185
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,841
Oh, that. That ain't nothing
but allergies. Bee stings.

186
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:21,975
Come again?

187
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,246
Y'all mind if l have a seat? Cool.

188
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,155
Y'all gonna ask a brother questions,
don't even offer me a seat.

189
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,159
What's happening?

190
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,388
All right.

191
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,295
While l was being slammed into the car,
having billy clubs jammed in my neck...

192
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,131
...that psychotic storm trooper
y'all call a cop...

193
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:44,743
...also allowed this big-ass bumblebee
to nearly sting me to death.

194
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,641
You know what? l'm not even sure
that bee wasn't one of his own.

195
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:54,218
Like some anti-Africanized attack
bee, trained to hate black people.

196
00:15:54,653 --> 00:16:00,649
That's the sort of thing y'all gonna
uncover in your investigation...

197
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,326
...so l ain't tripping.

198
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:06,122
-Would you excuse us for a moment?
-Do your thing, man.

199
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,663
Thank you.

200
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,403
We can't put this guy on the stand.

201
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:18,939
-He's unstable. Not to mention that he--
-Yo.

202
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,680
Who's the Planet-of-the Apes-looking
lady in the dress?

203
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,379
That's my father.

204
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,679
Handsome man.

205
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,920
l don't believe this.

206
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,524
l'm calling this off. This is crazy--

207
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,985
Like it or not, Rafferty violated his rights.

208
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,062
People won't look the other way.

209
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,028
We can't go through this again.

210
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,227
Drop the prosecution and l guarantee
you got a riot on your hands.

211
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,637
Earl, do you work?

212
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,709
Do you have a steady job?

213
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,742
Yes, l work. l work in security, man.

214
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,576
-Ah.
-Until l get back in the academy.

215
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,912
-l see.
-You know what?

216
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,419
-Y'all need to investigate them--
-Mr. Montgomery...

217
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:09,493
...all allergies aside,
did Officer Rafferty assault you or not?

218
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,459
How many times l gotta say it?

219
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,394
All right. Let's get down to business.

220
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:21,036
Superior Court is now in session.
Please be seated.

221
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,871
The state of California
versus Henry Rafferty.

222
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:29,071
Case CV-34259.
Honorable Marsha Gailey presiding.

223
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:35,783
At this time the bee appeared.
Right here. There it is. lt's coming in.

224
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,182
You can't--

225
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,227
You can't really see
it on the tape, but it's there.

226
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,319
Okay.

227
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,795
l'm swatting it with my stick.

228
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:53,565
There l am, stomping on it,
with the heel of my boot.

229
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,796
Kept missing it.

230
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,874
lt's not a good angle.

231
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,777
Are you claiming there was no
bumblebee at the time of the incident?

232
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,448
No, l'm not.

233
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,882
-There was a bumblebee present, man.
-Oh, good.

234
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,052
And there were birds chirping.

235
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,122
There were dogs barking.

236
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:19,128
For all l know there was a chipmunk
in the bushes, humping a turtle.

237
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,027
You gotta be careful with them
chipmunks. They'll hump anything.

238
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,041
This is no laughing matter,
Mr. Montgomery.

239
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,271
Look, man, l came here for justice.
Okay, that man right there?

240
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,675
That man harassed and choked me.

241
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,883
He used excessive violence...

242
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:44,011
...way before there was or
was not a bumblebee, sir.

243
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,085
l know the score.

244
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,626
lt's not the first time l been
pulled over for DWB.

245
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,493
-DWB?
-Driving While Black.

246
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,227
-Move to strike!
-Kiss my ass.

247
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,100
Will the defendant please rise?

248
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,578
The jury has found you
guilty as charged.

249
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:16,478
You are hereby sentenced to serve
six months in a state penitentiary.

250
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,214
Murphy. Okay, move along.

251
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,019
Keep it moving.

252
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,129
You must be that white cop, huh?
Beat up the black guy.

253
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,101
-What makes you say that?
-Them.

254
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,369
Oh, man.

255
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,083
Hey, ese.

256
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,625
Save your strength.
You're gonna need it.

257
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,688
-You look cute, baby.
-Get going.

258
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,965
Look, don't mess with me or l'll
throw your ass in solitary.

259
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,577
All right, let's go.
You're out of the hole.

260
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,955
-Hey, how long have l been in here?
-Three months.

261
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,271
Congratulations.

262
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,068
You are the graduating class
of this third week of August.

263
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,967
Many people don't make it through
both days of intense training.

264
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,105
You are the elite.

265
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,245
Wherever you go, you'll be
part of this special fraternity.

266
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,355
You're equipped with everything
you'll need to do your job:

267
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,954
Flashlight.

268
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,948
Pepper spray.

269
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,986
And if things get really nasty...

270
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,132
...a coin holster full of quarters,
so you can call the police.

271
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,301
Congratulations.

272
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,508
What do you mean, you got nothing?

273
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,044
You had a crime scene,
physical evidence.

274
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,012
-l gave you a goddamn tattoo.
-Which was a ghost.

275
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:29,176
-We couldn't find it in the database.
-Look, these things take time, Hank.

276
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,119
-Oh, please--
-Holy cow, check it out. Hank Rafferty...

277
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,725
...a security guard.

278
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,556
Nobody throw gum on the ground,
okay? We'd get, like, a warning.

279
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,368
District 2 1 units, additional
on the ADW in progress.

280
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,445
Suspect, male white,
blue jacket, brown pants.

281
00:21:55,681 --> 00:22:00,345
Male black, green shirt, brown pants.
Fled eastbound on foot.

282
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,963
Excuse me. You ever see that?

283
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:26,267
Four-59. Silent alarm, A and L
Beverages, 1 8th and Main.

284
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,140
Cancel that. Must have
been a power glitch.

285
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,605
Gotcha.

286
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,338
Where's security?

287
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,015
Freeze!

288
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,878
What are you doing?

289
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,988
The lights went out,
and l couldn't find a switch.

290
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,956
So l was filing in the dark.

291
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,219
That's why l called you here.

292
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,258
Lola...

293
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:24,458
...filing in the dark is a serious offense.
You're in a lot of trouble.

294
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,894
Get up against that wall.

295
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,800
What are you gonna do to me?

296
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:33,374
Search you. Make sure you
ain't carrying any concealed weapons.

297
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,247
You finding anything?

298
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,283
-ls this a thong?
-What?

299
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,387
ls this a thong?!

300
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,493
Are you gonna strip-search me?

301
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,990
No.

302
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,392
l'm gonna put on some music.

303
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,592
You gonna strip-search yourself.

304
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:07,007
Whoa, whoa, slow it up for me.
Nice and easy. Yeah.

305
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,752
Can't get enough of your love, babe!

306
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,113
Yo, pass those two.

307
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,013
-Get the motherboard.
-Check those boxes, man.

308
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,857
Got it. Load them up.
Get them out of here.

309
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,859
We have to check the load.

310
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:31,035
-Yeah, Earl.
-No. Don't call me Earl. Call me ''officer.''

311
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,233
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

312
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:38,839
Are you gonna give it to
me now, officer?

313
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,406
Hell, yeah.

314
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,974
l'm gonna incarcerate you.

315
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:50,614
You know my style. l like it wild.

316
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,586
-All right, pass that over.
-No, l got it.

317
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,551
Freeze!

318
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,422
Hands up!

319
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,099
What was that?

320
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,676
l said, freeze!

321
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,879
You, behind there!

322
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,046
Wait here. Might get
a little dangerous.

323
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,981
You really playing this thing
out, aren't you, baby?

324
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:22,320
Talk to me about a hit six
months ago, Centurion Storage!

325
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,312
Talk to me about a hit six
months ago, Centurion Storage!

326
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,085
-Go to hell.
-We wondered where security was.

327
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,056
Drop the weapon.

328
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,701
You should have run when
you had the chance.

329
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,169
Now you got no chance.

330
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,233
Over there! There he is! Get him!

331
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,914
Somebody shoot them!

332
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,486
-Thanks.
-No sweat.

333
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,195
-What are you doing here?
-l work here! What are you doing here?

334
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,927
l spent six months in prison
because of you!

335
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,230
Six months? That's all they
gave you, six months?

336
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,416
Damn it, Earl! This
ain't turning me on!

337
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,544
-What the hell is that?
-Earl Junior.

338
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,816
Likes to hang out with Daddy.
Precious, ain't it?

339
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,991
Get the goods! Load them up!

340
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,791
-Cover me!
-Hey, man, you ain't my boss.

341
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,831
We work for the same company.

342
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,028
Since l got seniority, you cover me.

343
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,503
-Okay, l cover you.
-Go!

344
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,302
No! My car!

345
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,809
No, not my car!

346
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,138
Somebody shoot that monkey!

347
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,545
What did you call me?

348
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,251
Let's go, now!

349
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,232
Get them in here!

350
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,204
Go, go, go!

351
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,867
-Get out of my car!
-Because l'm a black man?

352
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,499
This has nothing to do
with you. lt's personal!

353
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,374
Damn right it's personal. White boy
back there called me ''monkey.'' Drive!

354
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,649
-Get out, now!
-Look, man.

355
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,946
l been waiting my whole life
for shit like this to go down.

356
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:47,023
lf you're gonna shoot me, shoot me.
That's the only way l'm getting out.

357
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,796
They getting away, man!
Come on! Go!

358
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,228
Earl?

359
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:08,774
Man, this slow-ass,
damn Flintstone car, man.

360
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,541
We might as well be
peddling with our damn feet.

361
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,651
-What's wrong with this piece of junk?
-l don't know.

362
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,253
l was gonna take it for
a regular maintenance...

363
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,220
...but for the past six months
l've been in prison!

364
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,858
You should've got more time.

365
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,518
Pushing me into cars and putting
me in satanic chokeholds.

366
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,929
You were resisting arrest! l was
authorized to use any force--

367
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,866
We could go back and
forth on this all night long, man.

368
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,665
Fortunately, there are courts
to handle this matter.

369
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,205
According to the courts...

370
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:42,438
...you were assaulting and battering
me like a hillbilly on his wife.

371
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,443
Yo, yo, yo!

372
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:59,296
Oh, shit. This is how l'm
gonna conceal the weapon.

373
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,298
Pull over! Pull over!

374
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,562
Get the van!

375
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,242
-You pull over, buddy!
-No, get the van!

376
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,513
-Drop the gun!
-Get the van!

377
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,205
-Drop it!
-Get the v--

378
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,676
Damn!

379
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,548
lf l would've gotten out with
a wallet in my hand...

380
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,713
...l'd have bullets all in my ass!

381
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,553
That's some bullshit, man.

382
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,593
Security guard, huh, Hank?

383
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,127
That's a shame.

384
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,238
-Hey, Washington, how you doing?
-Better than you.

385
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,432
-You okay, man?
-You know how it is, my brother.

386
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,509
Just a little shaken up, that's all.

387
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,676
Let me see if l got this figured out.

388
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,647
You get out of prison,
pissed with your life...

389
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:57,515
...you decide to pay your buddy Earl
a visit. Things got out of hand...

390
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:02,285
...shots are fired, police respond just
in time to catch Hank trying to get...

391
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,396
...away with you in his car, probably
holding you at gunpoint. Am l correct?

392
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:11,467
Amazing. You are very, very good.

393
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:15,470
Wait a second. This is crazy.
l wasn't out for revenge.

394
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,270
Shut the hell up! Just shut the hell up.
l'm tired of your goddamn lies.

395
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:24,939
l got a restraining order saying you can't
get within 1 00 feet of this guy.

396
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,984
So l don't really give a damn what
you have to say. All l need from you...

397
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:34,022
...is your testimony and his ass
goes back to prison. Tomorrow.

398
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:41,356
Nothing would make me happier than
to see this man go back to prison.

399
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,399
Good.

400
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,298
For the heartache...

401
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,564
...and the trauma.

402
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,868
One time he took the club
and he switched it around...

403
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,740
...with the handle sticking out
and bop, right there.

404
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,941
Can you see that little cut,
right there? Anyway....

405
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:05,078
What happens is it makes
me start saying incoherent....

406
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:10,159
You know, l'm liable to spurt that out.
Just incoherent shit. Bitch!

407
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,762
l apologize.

408
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,765
My doctor said l'm not getting
proper oxygen up through here.

409
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,371
They said pump it and breathe.

410
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,065
And it's sort of like that sneaker.

411
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,533
lt's a weird exercise.

412
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,545
Anyway, nothing would make me
happier than to see him go to prison.

413
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,013
-Wait a second here!
-Get back, bitch!

414
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:38,622
-Shut the hell up, Hank, and l mean it!
-You-- The violence.

415
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,191
Let me calm myself.

416
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,696
Unfortunately, certain details
of your story are slightly skewed.

417
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,161
What do you mean, skewed?

418
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,398
Hank...

419
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,031
...did not come back for revenge.

420
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,567
-Thank you.
-He came back to apologize.

421
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,114
-What?
-You went there to apologize?

422
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,743
The man's talking to you.

423
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:11,984
Yep.

424
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:16,182
-And you were saying?
-l was...

425
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,494
...saying l was sorry.

426
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:24,524
-For what?
-Beating you.

427
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:32,842
Yeah, my dog.
That's what l'm talking about, man.

428
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:39,814
Hank was right in the middle
of this very touching apology...

429
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,079
...when l discovered
that my warehouse was being robbed.

430
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:47,453
So Hank and l, we banded together
to apprehend these outlaws.

431
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:51,823
And we would've had them,
had not your boys come along.

432
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,453
Excuse me?

433
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,431
Deputy Droop-a-long.
Man, they stopped the wrong car.

434
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,637
-You better watch your mouth.
-What you gonna do?

435
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,673
Beat the hell out of me?
Probably blame it on a damn spider.

436
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,810
-What you got?
-The updated report.

437
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:11,506
We got a 4-59 at the warehouse, but
nothing on a van. Coroner has two bodies.

438
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,776
DA says self-defense.
So we kick them loose.

439
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,649
-The C and L warehouse on 1 8th?
-Yeah.

440
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,217
Not a cop anymore, Hank,
so stop acting like one.

441
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:28,822
l'm all too happy to find any reason
to lock your ass up. You understand?

442
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:32,525
Go find McDuff, tell him
l want to see him right away.

443
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:37,933
Yeah, we also encountered a naked girl
upstairs, handcuffed to a light fixture.

444
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,073
Lola.

445
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:45,506
Do you think you could hook a brother
up with another restraining order?

446
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,411
Right there, because l recognize them.
Great.

447
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,749
All my stuff should be in here too.

448
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,123
What's up?

449
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:58,955
Right.

450
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,995
l don't believe this. Where's my bullets?

451
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,694
We don't return live ammunition.

452
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,035
Well, if you're gonna keep the bullets,
just keep the gun.

453
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,939
-All right.
-Give me my gun, man.

454
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,006
Where's my car?

455
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:21,580
lmpound lot. Twenty blocks up,
seven blocks over.

456
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,620
You expect that man to walk....

457
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,849
Y'all got a shuttle bus?
You know what?

458
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:32,394
You upset my partner.
l should set it off up in this....

459
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,327
But you got your boys.

460
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,532
Hank, you believe his attitude, man?

461
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:44,004
Man, they probably gonna give you
your car back with no tires.

462
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,302
l like the way you played it
back there.

463
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,344
Yeah, not letting them in on our case.
That was smooth.

464
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,176
-This is our bust, right?
-Get the hell away from me!

465
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,341
Hey, Hank! You know what?

466
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,580
Sooner or later, your hostility is officially
gonna start affecting our work.

467
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,190
Now, look, man.
All you got to do is kind of--

468
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,725
What is you running for?
l'm trying to talk to you.

469
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,955
Look! l am trying to remain calm...

470
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:10,225
...because if l hit you,
l will never see the light of day.

471
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:13,564
Which right now seems
almost worth it. So don't push it!

472
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:19,675
-You threatening me?
-Yeah! Yeah, l'm threatening you!

473
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,309
Well, bring it on.

474
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,675
Bring it on, Hank.
l could have went pro.

475
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,215
l drop bombs on them,
drop bombs on them.

476
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:31,515
-What? Here, slip, move, slide, duck.
-Can't redial without a signal.

477
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,723
Oh, bang them out of there.

478
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,951
Hey, where you going, man?

479
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,028
-Shut up!
-Big Red Truck and Trailer.

480
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,655
Truck and trailer. Yeah, look,
you guys got a call...

481
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,825
...yesterday, l think, regarding
a white van that you rented out.

482
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,301
We only rent big rigs.

483
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:52,499
Yeah, well, maybe you can help out.
l'm trying to find a couple of my buddies.

484
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,771
l think they rented a truck
from you yesterday.

485
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,541
-What name is it under?
-No, l don't know their names.

486
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,049
-Listen, pal, we get a lot of people here.
-No--

487
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,848
-You listen.
-Give me the phone.

488
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,419
-Where are you located?
-Downtown, on Normandie.

489
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,187
South Central? These were white folks.

490
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,024
They just left.
They bought extra insurance for Baja.

491
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,631
-Heading to Mexico?
-I guess.

492
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,859
Thank you.

493
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,060
You're welcome.

494
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,332
The way l see it,
they got a 20-minute head start.

495
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,476
They're probably heading down the 405.

496
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,373
What are you doing?

497
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,276
Stop the car! National Security!

498
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,015
Stop the damn car!

499
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,818
National Security,
l'm commandeering this vehicle.

500
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:44,724
-What did l do?
-Oh, student driver, huh?

501
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:50,834
Well, lesson 1 2: Man with gun,
get your ass up out the car.

502
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,663
-Go!
-Okay, okay, don't shoot.

503
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,237
And do your homework!

504
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,508
What the problem is?

505
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,841
Hey, man, do l got to solve
this crime by myself?

506
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,480
Unbelievable.

507
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:26,263
Big, red truck.
lt's gonna be easy to find.

508
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:30,396
lt's probably gonna say ''Big Red''
all along the side of the truck...

509
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,735
...in big, red letters.

510
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,107
Hey, Hank, you know that file
back at Washington's office?

511
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,876
Well, l used my acute peripheral vision
to get a upside-down read.

512
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,646
-Wanna know what l saw?
-What?

513
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:48,019
On one of them papers
it said, ''ClA heist.''

514
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,250
And?

515
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,521
-That's all l saw, ''ClA.''
-That's it?

516
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:57,562
Hey, look, man, l said l got peripheral
vision, not X-ray vision, man. All right?

517
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,363
Now, apparently, we are caught up
in some real live...

518
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,939
...complex-ass, espionage shit.

519
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,168
This is great, man, isn't it?

520
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:12,112
Me and you, man, we're security guards
out here acting like real cops.

521
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,443
-l was a real cop, Earl.
-Well, you must've loved it, huh?

522
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,349
l can't believe you gave that up.

523
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,127
Yeah. There's Route 1 .

524
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,988
Stay on the freeway,
it's a lot faster.

525
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,962
They wanna keep a low profile.
They're gonna go Route 1 .

526
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,535
Stay on the freeway.
No, on the freeway, come on.

527
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,036
-Don't!
-Oh, shit!

528
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,703
-Hey, come on!
-Freeway traffic, man.

529
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,471
-Stay on the freeway.
-We're in the middle of the street.

530
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,772
What are you doing?!

531
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,249
-Let go of the wheel!
-Freeway!

532
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,387
What are you doing, Hank?!

533
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,886
Oh, shit!

534
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,805
-God! Are you okay?
-Yeah.

535
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,171
-Shit.
-Hey!

536
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,508
Sorry.

537
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,385
-Somebody was right about the freeway.
-What?

538
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,079
Look at that. You can't tell me
that ain't a big, red truck.

539
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,349
Yeah, yeah.

540
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,032
Gun under the seat.

541
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,968
Hank! Hank!

542
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,806
Hank!

543
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,039
Get off me!

544
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,336
-Hey!
-Shoot her, Hank.

545
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,913
Shoot this big bitch.
Hank's about to shoot you.

546
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,642
No, l ain't gonna shoot anybody.
Put him down...

547
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,287
...in a minute or two. No hurry.

548
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,548
l don't like nobody messing with my rig.

549
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,157
Don't be a pussy, Hank. Shoot her!

550
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:11,466
You oversized, big-boot,
thick-ass, Jerry Springer-reject ass--

551
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,166
-Earl, come on. Let's go.
-No, man.

552
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,535
Shaq here owes me an apology.

553
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,740
But then again...

554
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,037
...what your name is?

555
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,638
Brittany.

556
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,645
Yeah?

557
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,749
Got a ring on every finger
except that lock down one, huh?

558
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:37,690
You like to wrestle?
Because that's my thing. l like to wrestle.

559
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:48,204
Earl. Earl, come on, let's go.

560
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,802
Why don't you give me your number?

561
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:55,742
And if you're nice, l'll show you
what a real big rig looks like.

562
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,975
Earl, come on!

563
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,550
-l'll call you.
-Let's go! The truck's leaving.

564
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,518
-l'm with you. Hold on, hold on.
-Come on!

565
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,531
-Think these are our guys?
-How the hell am l supposed to know?

566
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,303
No, wait. Wait. No.

567
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,303
Sorry.

568
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,539
Earl!

569
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,835
Earl, come on!

570
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,444
Come on, come on!

571
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,880
Swing around!

572
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,711
Oh, my knee!

573
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,121
Oh, shit.

574
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,491
Hey, come on!
Come on, come on.

575
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,939
-You did that on purpose.
-Look.

576
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,511
So that's why the cops
couldn't find the van.

577
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,015
Hey, do you know how
to hot-wire a car?

578
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:13,782
Oh, because l'm black, l automatically
know how to hot-wire a car?

579
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,791
-Do you know how or don't you?
-Yeah.

580
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,522
-But not because l'm black.
-Do it then.

581
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,024
-Move your leg, man. Close your legs.
-Get in there.

582
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,996
-See that?
-All right, go, go, go.

583
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,504
Okay.

584
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,234
See that spark when one of them
bumped into each other?

585
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,573
That's because that red wire
is what gives off all that energy.

586
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,477
-l don't care.
-See how that's sparking there?

587
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,878
Got it?

588
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:45,454
-How's that? What's that doing?
-Earl, the windshield wipers are on.

589
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,820
Must be a '94.
l touched the wrong one.

590
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,624
How's that?

591
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,225
-What's that?
-What the hell?

592
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,296
-Turn it off. Turn it off!
-Oh, come on.

593
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,371
Somebody's back in that trailer.
Let's take a look.

594
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,017
Eddie, look out!

595
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,933
-Do it. Come on, come on, come on.
-Yeah.

596
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,502
Go!

597
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,661
Oh, shit!

598
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,075
Thanks, Hank.

599
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:24,585
That's the second time in 20 minutes
you landed us in some shit.

600
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,991
Hey, you messing with Earl and Hank!

601
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,559
What the problem is?

602
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,026
Let's find out what the hell
is in these boxes.

603
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,100
Oh, Hank!

604
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,394
Oh, it stinks.

605
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,439
-Oh, damn!
-Sorry.

606
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,473
Damn, it looks like Christmas.

607
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:56,341
Except for these fish guts
and orange peels.

608
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,648
Please be guns. Please be guns.

609
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,984
What the hell is that?

610
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,961
This is a beer keg.

611
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:09,796
lt doesn't make any sense.

612
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,595
lt makes sense
when you put together the pieces.

613
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,203
What pieces?

614
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,867
lt's obvious.

615
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,031
The ClA, they're smuggling alcohol...

616
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:22,940
...into the inner city in an effort
to further subjugate the black man.

617
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,846
Hey, do you actually believe the crap
that comes out of your mouth?

618
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:32,250
Oh, l'm never really sure
until l'm finished talking.

619
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,491
Think they all kegs?

620
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:42,796
Yeah. Nash. We got a problem.

621
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,694
Well, what we have here
appears to be...

622
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:49,600
...your average, garden-variety,
$22-deposit beer keg...

623
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,434
...but it's way too light.

624
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,372
-lt must be light beer.
-Yeah, way too light.

625
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:58,311
Couldn't be a pound and a half.
Let's take a peek inside, huh?

626
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,651
Yeah, she's empty all right.

627
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:07,151
You think there's a double wall?
Something stashed in between?

628
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,019
Happy to take a look.

629
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,991
Put on the glasses, boys,
or you will go blind.

630
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:23,268
This torch burns
at 4000 degrees Fahrenheit...

631
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,876
...so let's slice open this can of peaches.

632
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,805
lncredible.

633
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,471
She's cold as ice.

634
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,582
Gorgeous.

635
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,947
Why don't you and the keg get a room?

636
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,251
Gentlemen, what we have here...

637
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,625
...is an Area 51 , high-tech,
aerospace alloy.

638
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:51,097
lt weighs next to nothing,
disperses heat instantaneously...

639
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,431
...and is resistant to almost
any force in man or nature.

640
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,266
Well, is it worth anything?

641
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,536
Yeah, millions!

642
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,234
Which is exactly why...

643
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:06,212
...l want you two to take this thing
and get the hell out of my shop.

644
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,580
Personally, l don't feel
like dying right now...

645
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,586
...and this is exactly the kind of shit
people get killed over.

646
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,551
Thanks.

647
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,532
We'll stash the van here
until we find out what's what.

648
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,802
-Whose garage is this?
-This guy l know. lt doesn't matter.

649
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:39,312
No, no. This ain't no guy garage.
There ain't a power tool in here.

650
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,780
Let's go.

651
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,852
Hank, this box up here
got your name on it.

652
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,818
This wouldn't be
your girlfriend's house?

653
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,350
Could you do me a favor?
Could you stay out of my business?

654
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:54,589
Oh, well, lookie, lookie, lookie.
Looks like somebody got dissed, huh?

655
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,063
All right, let me guess, Hank.

656
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,434
Your girl left because you
beat the shit out of her.

657
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,568
No. lronically, she left me...

658
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,608
...because l was convicted
of beating the shit out of somebody else.

659
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,975
Oh, me?

660
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:13,708
Man, go ahead with that, man.
Look, Hank, l'm just saying, man...

661
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,315
...l suppose that's what your attitude
is all about? Huh?

662
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,455
Hanky ain't getting no loving.

663
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,386
l'll be happy to go back in there...

664
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,287
...and straighten this
whole mess out.

665
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,487
-No, thanks, you've done enough.
-No, serious, Hank. l wanna do it, man.

666
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,997
Earl Montgomery is a love-maker,
not a love-taker.

667
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,659
Wait a second.
Let me get this straight.

668
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,397
You're telling me you'd go in there
and tell Denise...

669
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,406
...l never harassed you,
and l went to jail for no reason?

670
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,644
Absolutely.

671
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,748
But you and l both know
you got exactly what you deserve.

672
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,378
Denise.

673
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,817
l hope they don't think we're breaking in.

674
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,848
She's not home.

675
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,926
Damn. Denise got one fine-looking maid.

676
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,726
-Excuse me?
-Earl...

677
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,428
...that is Denise. Hey.

678
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,367
-What do you want, Hank?
-l only wanna talk.

679
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,804
-Oh, you wanna talk?
-Yeah.

680
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,844
Or you wanna lie?
Because there's a difference, you know.

681
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,278
-l've always been honest with you.
-Of course.

682
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:23,180
You just forgot to tell me you were
beating up black men on your lunch.

683
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,844
Oh, snap. She's witty.

684
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,253
Yeah. She most definitely
got the upper hand.

685
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,485
Hey, could you be quiet
for a minute? Thanks.

686
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,562
-Look, l told you how--
-Yeah, l know, the bumblebee did it.

687
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,631
-Yeah.
-You lied to me, Henry.

688
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,429
Lies, lies. Lies just compound lies.

689
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:43,368
You know? But you saying
the same thing. Do your thing.

690
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,771
l didn't beat anybody, okay?
And l can prove it.

691
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:52,643
This is the man that l was accused
of assaulting. Okay, Earl.

692
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,785
-Hi.
-You got something you wanna say?

693
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,318
Oh, yeah.

694
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,616
She's black.
You never told me she was black.

695
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:05,558
Did l or did l not assault you?

696
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,924
Oh, he beat the hell out of me, ma'am.

697
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,089
-What?
-l'm not gonna lie to the sister.

698
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,896
No, you're-- You son of a bitch!
l'm not gonna take this!

699
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,505
Hey! Get your hands off him.
Stop it. Get out.

700
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,265
-Get out!
-Get out! Just get out!

701
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,706
-Henry, get out!
-You too. Get out! Get!

702
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,072
-But--
-Get!

703
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,113
l think the violence
might kick off out there.

704
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,308
Get out.

705
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:33,287
Listen, man. Wait.
Why you all salty at me, man?

706
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:38,451
Look, Hank, kill that noise, man.
Listen, it's not my fault. Okay?

707
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,721
-You told me she was white.
-l did not.

708
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,956
Well, you didn't tell me she was black.

709
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,499
-What difference does it make?
-A big difference.

710
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,729
Look, if l had lied and told her
that you didn't beat me up...

711
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,396
...l'd be condoning
interracial relationships.

712
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,475
Which is something
l do not condone.

713
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,874
Okay, that's it. lf you're not out of
my face in three seconds--

714
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,675
Now, you don't wanna be
threatening your partner.

715
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,985
l am not your partner!

716
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,281
l had a partner!
l would have taken a bullet for him!

717
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,822
You, l'm having a hard time
not shooting!

718
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:12,723
All right, hold on! Now, that's it.
Now l'm upset.

719
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:16,059
lf you leave, l'm gonna put
your ass under citizen's arrest.

720
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,168
Okay? And you and l both
know you are in direct violation...

721
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,327
...of a legal, binding restraining order.

722
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,372
-You have something in your teeth.
-Where? Here, or here?

723
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,940
Now you can tell people l hit you.

724
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,958
-Hi.
-Hi, '7 8 Plymouth Volare, tan.

725
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,466
-Can l have your driver's license?
-Yep.

726
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,772
Are you kidding me?

727
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,782
l got something in my teeth?

728
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,386
l'll tell you what it was, Hank.
Trust. And now it's gone.

729
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,045
Earl, what do l have to do?

730
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:17,182
l just came to get Earl Jr.
l don't go nowhere without my baby.

731
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,557
So why don't you get your jalopy,
and we go our separate ways.

732
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:24,096
That's my car right over there.
Could l have the keys?

733
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,735
We're just trying to locate
your paperwork, sir.

734
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:30,464
Lookie, lookie, lookie.
What do we have here?

735
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,835
How you doing, Miss Dolly?

736
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,706
-Fine.
-Oh, yes, you are.

737
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,381
You got a pair of handcuffs
l can borrow?

738
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,609
-You hitting on her?
-Yeah.

739
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:46,381
What was all that crap
about interracial couples?

740
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:56,127
l am firmly and belligerently
against any interracial coupling...

741
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,899
...when the man is white.

742
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,302
Darling...

743
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,567
...can l interest you
in a stick of gum?

744
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:12,705
You know, they say five out of five
dentists recommend this shit.

745
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,673
Thanks.

746
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:21,051
Get your stuff out of my car
and get the hell out of here!

747
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:31,930
Miss Darling, what do l have to do
to get my car out of here?!

748
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,265
Would you please just be patient?

749
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,204
Patient.

750
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:49,814
-Freeze!
-On the ground, now!

751
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,154
Goddamn it. God.

752
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,154
Yeah, yeah, yeah. l gave up!

753
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,456
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

754
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,190
No, don't give up. Get in.

755
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,861
-Hank, freeze!
-Get in the back.

756
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,114
-Know what l'm doing?
-Stealing a police car.

757
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:23,480
l'm saving your ass yet again
despite the fact that you struck me...

758
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,189
-...yet again.
-Okay. Sorry. Thank you.

759
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,881
God!

760
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,756
-Apology accepted.
-Okay, we're even. Go, go, go!

761
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,224
-Don't hit me no damn more.
-Go, go, go!

762
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,929
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Car!

763
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,873
Forklift. Forklift, my side.

764
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,610
Forklift!

765
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:49,767
l got it!

766
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,313
Yep...

767
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,881
-...you got it.
-Watch out!

768
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,184
Watch out!

769
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,052
Dead end! Dead end, dead end!

770
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,890
-Hey!
-l see it.

771
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,707
Come to think of it,
you hit me and l didn't kill you?

772
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,842
l'm letting you live, saving your ass.

773
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,107
-Oh, l'm going straight to heaven.
-Fence!

774
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,375
Chill, Hank. l'm blessed.

775
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,620
What'd you do this time, Hank?

776
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,399
l don't know. l'll find out.

777
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,092
For a cop, you sure get in
a hell of a lot of trouble.

778
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,295
Yeah, yeah.

779
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,099
Turn here. Turn, turn, turn!

780
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,346
Hey, chopper. Turn here, turn here!

781
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,506
Turn!

782
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,819
Always loved the car wash, man.

783
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:12,690
White, foamy water over you.
Brushes waving in the breeze.

784
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:17,295
When you a kid in the ghetto,
that's like going to Hawaii.

785
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,163
-They got an APB out on both of us.
-Both of us? What the hell did l do?

786
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:24,500
We're wanted for the shootout
on the Vincent Thomas Bridge.

787
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,472
-Yeah, well, that's fair.
-No, it doesn't make any sense.

788
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,268
How'd the cops know
we were on the bridge?

789
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,974
Only the guys in the truck could lD us,
and they wouldn't call it in.

790
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,616
Maybe someone on the inside
put out a APB to locate us.

791
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,551
Now we're talking about dirty cops.

792
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:48,027
-What you doing?
-Running the numbers on the van.

793
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,530
No, plates are phony. Damn it!

794
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,600
-Check the VlN.
-What?

795
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,602
-l thought they were all scratched off.
-Not underneath.

796
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,741
l pulled it when l was wiring the van.

797
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:03,207
-All units, 5-0-3, stolen police vehicle.
-Bingo. Address. Okay.

798
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,075
-Car wash at Venice and Crenshaw.
-They tracked us.

799
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,877
Let's ditch the car!

800
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,190
-We need a car.
-Yeah, yeah.

801
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,695
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

802
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,100
Hey, could you pull over here?

803
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,863
-God!
-Use the badge.

804
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,733
-What?
-Use the badge.

805
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:33,340
Stop! National Security!

806
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,609
-l'm commandeering this car!
-Let's see the badge.

807
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,882
-Just step out of the car, ma'am.
-Don't you raise your voice at me.

808
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,518
Get out of the damn car!

809
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,845
Didn't your mama
teach you any manners?

810
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,322
At least you could ask me nicely.

811
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,489
You call this commandeering a car?

812
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:59,396
-You wanna shut the hell up?
-Don't be using that language in my car.

813
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,696
Sorry.

814
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,663
Now, l got no problem
giving you boys a ride.

815
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,708
But l don't take kindly to being told
to get out of my car.

816
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,607
No, sir. l surely do not.

817
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,612
Warrant.

818
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,807
A warrant.

819
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:17,612
They must've had a warrant
to raid the warehouse.

820
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,152
The dirty cop had to have access to it
to send his boys in first.

821
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,815
Same thing must've happened
at the storage place.

822
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,961
-So who's the leak?
-l don't know.

823
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,893
APB's go through watch commander.

824
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,556
Washington?
Ain't that how it always is?

825
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,100
-What?
-You have nothing to go on...

826
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,170
...and already
you blaming the black man.

827
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:40,333
-l'm just throwing names out.
-l'll tell you how to find a dirty cop.

828
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,978
Pick up the phone
and call the police station.

829
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,341
Don't really matter who answers.

830
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,259
What you gonna say?

831
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,795
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

832
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:06,334
-Okay, you boys behave now.
-No question.

833
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:10,202
-Take care.
-Should l have gotten her number?

834
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:13,274
-Definitely. She's very nice.
-l thought so too.

835
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,703
ls this the place?

836
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,507
Stay cool.

837
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,082
Can you pick this?

838
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:29,748
What? ''Just because l'm
a black man.... What?''

839
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,759
You were doing good.
But why you said like this:

840
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:36,296
All black people don't do that.
Look, man. Just let it flow--

841
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,696
Can you pick the lock or not?

842
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:44,538
-Not without my tools.
-Hey, hey. Come on.

843
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:49,334
This is great. A real stakeout.

844
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,810
My whole life, man,
l wanted to be a cop.

845
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,677
Ever since l was a kid,
watching Quincy on TV.

846
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,842
Quincy was a medical examiner.

847
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,719
Oh. l guess in the projects
we didn't get real good reception.

848
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:10,424
Hey, man. This is boring.
How long we been here?

849
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:17,338
-Coming up on 1 2 minutes.
-Where the hell are these people?

850
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,238
Earl, this is a stakeout.
We could be sitting here for hours.

851
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,039
No wonder cops are so fat.

852
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,678
Shoot.

853
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,045
Hey, whatever happened to Charlie?

854
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:40,192
lf you don't mind, l'd just--
l'd rather not talk about it.

855
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,194
You sure?

856
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,790
Yeah.

857
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,872
You know, they shot him
right in front of me, man.

858
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,986
l couldn't do a damn thing about it.

859
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:11,320
l'm sorry to hear that, man.
Who did it?

860
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:14,289
The guys we're looking for.

861
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,264
So that's why this is personal.

862
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:24,201
Let me get this straight.
Your partner got killed...

863
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:30,005
...you lost your job, you got thrown
in jail, your girlfriend walked...

864
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:35,947
...and now you're a security guard
making 1 82 dollars a week?

865
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,212
Know what you are, Hank?

866
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,685
You're a black man.

867
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,493
Now, though, you gotta
think about it though, right?

868
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,091
Glad to see you laugh, man.

869
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,701
-Now how long have we been here?
-Oh, come on.

870
01:02:56,873 --> 01:03:02,038
-Coming up on 1 3 minutes.
-l got to get something to eat, man.

871
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,897
Earl.

872
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:30,061
Hey, Earl.

873
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,102
What are you doing?

874
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,448
No! Earl!

875
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:46,811
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

876
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,322
Earl, hey. Earl.

877
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,770
We're always early. He's always late.

878
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,913
Damn it!

879
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:24,352
Call me back. They were spotted
at the police impound yard.

880
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:28,957
Get down and get the goods.

881
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,263
Pain in the ass!

882
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,394
Are you okay?

883
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,940
Hell, no, l ain't okay, man.
l been shot!

884
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,874
Shit.

885
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,811
-lt's him!
-How do you know?

886
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,677
Tattoo!

887
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,343
Son of a bitch!

888
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,386
Partner.

889
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:30,958
Go get him.

890
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,439
-Hank.
-Yeah?

891
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,842
You get him?

892
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,212
No.

893
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,355
-Come on.
-l ain't gonna make it, Hank.

894
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:04,892
l'm cold, man. l'm cold all over.

895
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,726
l'm starting to see white light.

896
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:11,056
Damn. Even the light is white.

897
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:14,669
Come on. You got hit
in the leg, Sally. Let's go!

898
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,829
-Don't bounce. Don't bounce!
-You gotta help me a little.

899
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,033
-You're bouncing!
-Your other leg.

900
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:29,115
Denise! Denise! lt's Hank. Hank.

901
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,685
-l thought l told you. lt's over.
-l been shot!

902
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,311
You shot him now?

903
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,649
-No.
-What happened?

904
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,191
You gotta trust us. We didn't
do anything wrong or illegal.

905
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,589
Then take him to a hospital.

906
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,526
No, no! We can't, 'cause
the cops are looking for us.

907
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,865
-What?
-lt's complicated!

908
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:47,161
Look, Denise, l understand
you're a nurse.

909
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,032
l'm bleeding out here.
Y'all can bicker later. Come on.

910
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,640
-Please, please.
-Let me come in?

911
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,003
-All right.
-Yeah, go.

912
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,769
-Hey.
-Sorry.

913
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,683
-Take off your pants.
-Huh?

914
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,716
Take off your pants.

915
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,257
Earl? You're not wearing
any underwear.

916
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:14,459
l don't like to wear drawers, okay?
Makes me feel constricted.

917
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,155
So does dying. Now, hurry up,
Hank! Come on!

918
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:20,234
-l'll get you a towel.
-Better make it a beach towel.

919
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,236
-lt's not that big.
-lt ain't small.

920
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:26,432
Thank you, Denise.
That was very sweet of you.

921
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:31,637
All right, l'm gonna need you
to keep pressure on the wound.

922
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:35,113
Right. Okay, bend over the chair
and hike up the towel.

923
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:38,515
-What? l'm not like that, man!
-Do it!

924
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,178
Oh, oh. Well, just say that, Hank.

925
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:44,383
l thought you was trying
to get a free ass shot.

926
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,653
Come on, Denise.
Now, tell me the truth.

927
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,059
Earl, there's no bullet in you.

928
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,089
lt went through the bone,
out the other side?

929
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:55,760
lt barely touched you. lt's a scratch.

930
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,699
-Denise, am l gonna need stitches?
-Yes.

931
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,843
l knew it.

932
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:08,306
-Well, just--
-Oh! Whoa. You know what?

933
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,349
-What?
-l'll let it heal naturally.

934
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:13,750
-Oh--
-Yeah, yeah, that's right.

935
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,550
Oh, no!

936
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,089
-lt's a bee--
-Calm down!

937
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,092
-A bumblebee! No!
-Don't move. Don't move!

938
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:24,130
Death from above! No! Swish it out.

939
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:28,826
Death from above, man.

940
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,605
-ls it safe?
-Not for you it ain't!

941
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,405
l can't believe your girl
can go off like that.

942
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:44,451
-She hits harder than you do.
-Yeah, this is it.

943
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,451
Marina Yacht Club.
This is where the call came from.

944
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,181
How we gonna get in?

945
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:06,202
-Split up.
-Excuse me, l want the big fat one.

946
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:13,579
Oh, that looks interesting. What is it?

947
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:17,378
l don't know, but it smells like ass.

948
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:23,919
You recognize anyone?

949
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:28,086
Man, it's so damn white in here,
my pupils haven't adjusted yet.

950
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,732
Hey. Hey, look.

951
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,961
-That's him.
-Son of a bitch.

952
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,936
What do you know?
lt's the white guy.

953
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:48,581
A sad day in Caucasian history.

954
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:14,007
-Where the hell the two of you been?
-Jimmy Buffet's in town. Come on.

955
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,506
You got five minutes. lt better be good.

956
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,343
-Can l get a chip?
-No.

957
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,576
You've got a leak
and we know who it is.

958
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:26,016
-Now can l get a chip?
-No.

959
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,621
lt's McDuff.

960
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,959
-l assume you have some proof.
-Yeah.

961
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,652
We tracked them knuckleheads
who hit my warehouse.

962
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:37,924
-The same guys who killed Charlie.
-Led us right to McDuff.

963
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,967
That's all very interesting,
but do you have actual evidence?

964
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:43,468
-No.
-No. But we got what he wants.

965
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,631
-And what's that?
-The goods from the ClA heist.

966
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:51,610
-You got the ClA goods?
-Wait a minute. lt was really ClA?

967
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,941
Crupps lnternational Aerospace.

968
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,618
What ClA did you think
l was talking about?

969
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:59,583
Would you tell him, please?

970
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:05,990
A year ago, over $ 7 million in atomic
alloy was stolen out of Crupps.

971
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:10,029
To smuggle it out, they had to melt it
down and recast it as beer kegs.

972
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,827
Feds tipped us off.
Our leak beat us to the punch.

973
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:17,371
That's right. McDuff. Offer to sell
him back his stuff. Oh, he'll bite.

974
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:20,337
-lf he's dirty.
-Oh, he's dirty.

975
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:22,840
Now, give the man a chip.

976
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,945
l appreciate you trying
to get me a chip.

977
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,252
But thinking that l was
talking about the actual ClA....

978
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,194
Yeah. l don't know what l was thinking.

979
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,764
Hey, McDuff.
lt's your buddies, Hank and Earl.

980
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,902
-What's up, Duff?
-We got something you want.

981
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,061
I don't know what
you're talking about.

982
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:53,339
We're talking beer kegs, bitch!

983
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:57,138
-You two are wanted felons.
-Frank, save it. We know you're dirty.

984
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,281
-Listen to me--
-No, you listen to me.

985
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,973
l don't know who
you're selling these things to.

986
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,448
All we want is a piece of the pie.
Say, $ 1 million worth.

987
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:09,989
-We're talking six zeros, chump.
-So, what's your plan?

988
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:15,358
Meet us tomorrow morning, 7 a.m.
The old fort, Luna Point.

989
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,450
How'd you find this place?

990
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:40,987
l did a couple nights of security
watching some construction equipment.

991
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,251
-lt's perfect for us, though.
-How many boys Washington got?

992
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:51,263
l don't know. l see five or so.

993
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,674
-l'm starting to feel all tingly.
-Yeah.

994
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:11,811
l thought l shot you once already.
You're a tough little monkey, aren't you?

995
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,882
You into monkey jokes?

996
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,118
Didn't your mama teach you manners
when you were humping her?

997
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,596
-You bring the metal, Hank?
-You bring the money, Frank?

998
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,825
We'll see about that
when l see the kegs.

999
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:29,937
Let's just forget about the money.
We already got what we came for.

1000
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:41,405
l don't think you'll find them
as helpful as you thought they'd be.

1001
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:45,880
You see, my men aren't actually
members of the L.A. SWAT team.

1002
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,851
-Where's Washington?
-l don't know.

1003
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,014
Excellent question.

1004
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,032
-Shit.
-Oh, man.

1005
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,998
The brother's in on it?

1006
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,169
He must've grew up
in a white neighborhood.

1007
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,504
Gun. Scratch that.

1008
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:11,539
He's a real brother, getting messed over
just like the rest of us.

1009
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,180
Guns, gentlemen.

1010
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,219
Look, l-- No. Look!

1011
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:27,522
Sorry. No, no. Look, look.
No, no, no, no! Go!

1012
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:40,667
Washington, get over here!

1013
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,915
Get in! Get in! Get in!

1014
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,850
l know a way out!

1015
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,180
There's a tunnel at the other end.

1016
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:58,955
Down! Down!
What the hell happened?

1017
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,459
l don't know.
They grabbed me after we talked.

1018
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,825
Take a right! Come on!

1019
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,905
Get through the other end!

1020
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,055
Earl!

1021
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:35,923
Come on! The tunnel!

1022
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,066
Go, go!

1023
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:48,900
Hank, come on!

1024
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:10,155
Earl.

1025
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,128
What? Where's Hank?

1026
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:16,066
-l don't know.
-Hank!

1027
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:20,202
Hank! Shit. l gotta go find him.

1028
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:24,141
-Okay, go ahead. My foot's busted up.
-You gonna be okay?

1029
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,774
l'll be fine. Go!

1030
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,551
Damn it!

1031
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,807
Earl!

1032
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:30,871
No!

1033
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,955
Busted!

1034
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,564
Son of a bitch.

1035
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:25,096
Yeah!

1036
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,624
Hey, Nash! Catch!

1037
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:05,434
Yeah!

1038
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,438
Who's a monkey now? Monkey!

1039
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:18,784
-Shit. Hank!
-Hold on!

1040
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,419
Whoops! Sorry!

1041
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,826
-Hank!
-Hold on!

1042
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:36,531
Good, good, good, good!

1043
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:51,241
Whoa!

1044
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,788
-Yes!
-Yeah!

1045
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:02,957
-You the man!
-No, you are the man!

1046
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:07,028
-You the man!
-Okay, l am the man!

1047
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:12,201
Yeah, yeah!

1048
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,171
Six months ago,
these two men were locked...

1049
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,676
...in a conflict that shook our city.

1050
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:21,475
Today they stand together as heroes.

1051
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:25,780
Gentlemen, thank you for your bravery
and your selflessness.

1052
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:30,784
Hank, welcome back to the force.

1053
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,660
Thanks.

1054
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:50,310
-Earl, welcome to the L.A.P.D.
-You serious?

1055
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:55,510
-Congratulations, Earl.
-Yeah. Thank you.

1056
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:08,584
-Earl! That's enough.
-Oh.

1057
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,699
Hey, check it out, 1 0:00.

1058
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,059
Pull over.

1059
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,541
-Excuse me.
-You wanna step away from the vehicle?

1060
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,737
Hank. Please, man.

1061
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:29,907
Let me show you how this type
of situation is properly handled.

1062
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,679
Excuse me, Mr. Civilian,
who has rights.

1063
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,288
Did you perhaps lock your keys
in your vehicle?

1064
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:38,392
Yeah, l do it all the time.
They're right there in the visor.

1065
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,222
Yeah, yeah. Right there in the visor.

1066
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,262
For my partner's peace of mind...

1067
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,833
...would you tell us
the numbers on your plate?

1068
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:51,495
-Sure, 2CQN654.
-ls he right?

1069
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,132
Yeah.

1070
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:57,973
Allow me to assist you...

1071
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:01,206
...instead of beat you senseless,
like some cops would.

1072
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,111
-Thank you, officer
-You're welcome.

1073
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,655
-Have a good day, all right?
-l will. Thanks.

1074
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:12,224
Not everyone's a criminal.
Remember that.

1075
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,828
My car! No, wait! That's my car!

1076
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,627
-Always good to have a backup plan.
