1
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:58,482
Are you sure you want to
be on that side of the wall?

2
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:01,314
They begin to tear down the
walls on Monday.

3
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:04,258
The police, the post office
and the schools all open next month.

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,028
C'mon, will you smile?
You look so down.

5
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:09,907
I hope things don't get messed up
on the way, and that they keep their promises.

6
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:12,896
Listen, it's the law and the law is always
Looking for an asshole like me ...

7
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:15,468
... to make sure
these things are fulfilled.

8
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:20,752
Three years later,
the government has changed.

9
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,641
... the rest ...

10
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:38,726
Sector 13 Ultimatum

11
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:10,326
Stop!

12
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,836
Stop!

13
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,765
Keep up! Keep up!

14
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:01,260
There he is! There he is!

15
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,192
What?

16
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:37,255
Over here.

17
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,352
Hey, man.
Now you bring cops?

18
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:48,090
Sorry.

19
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:51,535
I am not enough.
Do you think im a musketeer?

20
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:53,696
- Yes, I am Dartagnan.
- Are you teasing?

21
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:55,329
Dudu, leave.

22
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,718
Dudu, I never understand.
Why dont you know anything?

23
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,695
- Say, you look like a child.
- I am a child.

24
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:07,552
You Take care of others.
come.

25
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:27,611
Sit back,
What did you do now?

26
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,418
- This city is not a hotel.
- Sorry.

27
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:34,422
- I got tired.
- Not in the same situation.

28
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:38,128
You're free, this 
whole city just for you.

29
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,391
They treat us like animals.

30
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,156
And so since we were born.

31
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:45,076
Three years ago
we were promised change.

32
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:48,408
A government that fails to meet
their promises? That's weird.

33
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:52,702
If we dont do something,
we will be ignored.

34
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:54,366
Yet we do nothing

35
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,231
Not your culture, dude.
To us this wall protects us ...

36
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:04,338
... as a fortress.

37
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:08,044
And those who come to disturb us
of our society, mean nothing.

38
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,954
We have our own.

39
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:11,895
And that is fine
the way it is.

40
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:14,715
And frankly, I prefer to be
the king of this small kingdom ...

41
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:16,754
... than a pawn out there.

42
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:18,814
Therefore, will you be polite and stop bombing the wall

43
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,492
... if not, we Will be beat or shoot you

44
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:23,383
Do you understand?

45
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,172
This is good.

46
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,663
Take this.
A gift.

47
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:51,014
Yeah, boss?

48
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:54,690
Yes, boss.

49
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:56,517
Come on.

50
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,847
Leave!

51
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:43,123
Come on.

52
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:46,238
Come on!

53
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:46,337
Your merchandise arrived.
Do I send the first client?

54
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:49,194
So Rude, let me enjoy
a while.

55
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:51,870
Get him out, at least that.

56
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:57,031
Everybody out!

57
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,492
Not you.

58
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:02,411
Go see the boss.

59
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,985
Come on, dance a little.

60
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,802
Mr. Ou will see you now.

61
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:23,097
My ass hurts sitting out here waiting!

62
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:24,900
Tell yourself, sir.

63
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,293
Come on, get on you knees.

64
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:32,228
If you want more money 
you should be more inclined.

65
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,073
get on your knees, my man.
And hands on his head.

66
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:41,366
- Thief?
- Worse.

67
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:41,884
Police.

68
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,608
Your under arrest,
be silent ...

69
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:45,800
... until your presented to
the judge ...

70
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:47,476
If you think that I a. ..

71
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:49,949
In French it means
shut up, okay?

72
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:03,968
No, it's a Ming vase
the twelfth century.

73
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:07,808
Do not worry, it is false,
the real one is in a museum.

74
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,222
And the rest?
Are all fake?

75
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,156
Almost. Except for the Van Gogh.

76
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:22,256
Central, I have the soap.
Again, I have soap.

77
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,240
Understood,
precise location.

78
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:30,079
- I am the soap?
- I feel more of a shampoo.

79
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:33,898
- Since I am going fishing
- What do you mean you're
Going fishing?

80
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:36,678
Do not worry.
You do not have to understand.

81
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:47,185
Mr Calma.
Health monitor.

82
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,889
We would like to see the boss.

83
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,857
Lord, there are officers
at the door.

84
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:03,077
Two police officers for sure,
there are more hidden.

85
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,520
Here is one. Dale.

86
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:10,876
Dale.

87
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:17,052
- You bastard!
- You see, already beginning to fall.

88
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:19,979
You'll never leave here, this building
is monitored by all parties.

89
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,122
If it were that easy,
They wouldnt have sent me.

90
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:23,636
What is that?

91
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,649
It's simple, if you talk
your cheeks explode.

92
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,638
Want to try?
Okay.

93
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:30,500
I'll report
you are cooperative.

94
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,855
Central, I'm going fishing.

95
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:48,745
Mr Ou awaits.

96
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:57,601
Only you

97
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,457
Stay here
okay.

98
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,769
Mr Ou,
It gives me pleasure to see you.

99
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,772
Do not move.Lift your hands
Forward

100
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,771
Walk.

101
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:26,684
Gentlemen, after you.

102
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,470
I go last or what?

103
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,395
Them first.

104
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,323
- Hugo.
- How did you know?

105
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,390
Yes, I have photos of yourself
all over my room.

106
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,529
Shit!

107
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,148
Come on.

108
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:51,196
Raise the head.

109
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,960
- What is that?
- You should know, it was you who invented it.

110
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:01,542
Gentlemen, follow me.

111
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,439
He is thumbing his nose at me.

112
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,870
And let it gives the same.

113
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,509
A week ago!
that fat ...!

114
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:17,796
Come on, calm down.
Drink a margarita, and relax.

115
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:24,232
the fuck with your margarita!

116
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:26,701
I'm sick of these guys!

117
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,266
Outside, start
to enter.

118
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,776
Mr. Sam, just went looking for you.

119
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,822
Now I go?
You Do this to your best customer?

120
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:48,294
Since when am
I left last?

121
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:49,984
Always leave the shit
for last.

122
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:51,662
Open arms.

123
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,116
What are you doing?

124
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,303
Fucking ugly?

125
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,985
And this shit?

126
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:09,710
Did it not do anything?

127
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:14,479
I used that shit 
all the time as a kid.

128
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,425
We'll fix it.

129
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:28,015
It's nothing,
he fell.

130
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:34,583
Central fishing is done.
Send in the others.

131
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,241
I already did.

132
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:44,197
- Nobody move!
- ¡Todos al piso!

133
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,215
Hands on your head!

134
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,373
- Come on, come on!
- Leaving!

135
00:15:57,671 --> 00:15:59,493
Come on!

136
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,083
We'll never come out of here alive, you dirty
Police, there is no way out

137
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,883
You don't have a
Chance!

138
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:21,603
Are you sure?

139
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,644
Let me go! Let me go!

140
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:31,573
- I guess I need the code.
- Fuck you.

141
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,673
No matter, I have the key.

142
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,006
Move!

143
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:06,826
- I'm heading south.
- South?

144
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,477
Send the rest.

145
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,384
Watch your feet!

146
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:29,854
Push!

147
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:32,674
Turn it off!

148
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:35,253
Get out! Shit, get out!

149
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:39,255
They found it!

150
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:44,309
I told them I was cheating
everywhere.

151
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:57,563
What happened?
I will kill you.

152
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:02,996
Open up!

153
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:22,577
Crap.

154
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:32,140
- You okay?
- Yes, but they're here.

155
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,865
Don't move.

156
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,690
This picture is worth
200 million euros.

157
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,567
It's a Van Gogh.

158
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,717
A stray bullet, a scratch
and no longer worth anything.

159
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,307
Die motherfucker!

160
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,600
There he is! There he is!

161
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:23,596
Okay, I see the keyboard.

162
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,516
hello?

163
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,117
Nice to meet you.

164
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:42,532
Central, there is a bomb.

165
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:45,320
- A bomb?
- Any idea?

166
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,353
- Where is it?
- In the kitchen in the basement.

167
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:04,174
It's good,
we will send you whats necessary.

168
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:21,336
On guard!

169
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,482
we sent it.

170
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:25,083
Fantastic!

171
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:09,407
Nice to see you.
Welcome.

172
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:20,231
- Do you have scratches?
- No, I do not think so.

173
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,947
- I wasn't referring to you, Damian.
- It's fine, Commander, thank you.

174
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:24,972
Anyway,
not just these.

175
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:26,972
Go rest,
make the report tomorrow.

176
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,650
I prefer to continue working
in what I have in my head.

177
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,809
Tomorrow I'll go early,
If you do not mind.

178
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,537
No, I will see you in my office
at noon. Is an order.

179
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,381
Thank you.

180
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:43,838
- Good work.
- Thanks.

181
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,204
Everything is fine.

182
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:24,413
All clear.

183
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,086
Bring them.

184
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:35,733
Gentlemen.

185
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:50,230
- How goes the work?
- Superb.

186
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,860
How long does it take build
a tower like this?

187
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,826
That depends on the location

188
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:59,193
But more or less
eight years.

189
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:02,912
Good.

190
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,038
Yes

191
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:07,262
Get him out.

192
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,353
As in the neighborhood
Chantier of ...

193
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:20,275
... twice now, if we give the
guarantee that the constructed.

194
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:22,180
The operation will begin
tonight.

195
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,677
Perfect.

196
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:46,954
- Well, thank you, until tomorrow.
- Goodbye, Damien.

197
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:53,109
Crap.

198
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,100
Damian?

199
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:36,922
Have you forgotten me?

200
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,351
No.

201
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,302
They gave me time
to rest.

202
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:46,087
For eight hours I'm
resting, and I'm fantastic!

203
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:50,150
Wait.
Soft, soft.

204
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,295
My whole body hurts.

205
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:54,556
your whole body?

206
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:58,592
Almost.

207
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,674
Is that makeup?

208
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:03,013
Yes, it's for work.

209
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:04,994
It is the work.

210
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,721
You told me you spend
the day looking for pictures.

211
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,818
I say it's my job.

212
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,227
Well, you better show me
that the wait was worth it.

213
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:17,166
Speaking.

214
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:26,759
The suspect is
in the next seven.

215
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:29,901
What good music.

216
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,086
Excuse me.

217
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:43,179
Again, auto blue ...

218
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:46,102
54, we are close.

219
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:48,109
Well, received 54.

220
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,344
So, Salim
Is not it?

221
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:57,647
- Yes, yes!
- Listen!

222
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:00,556
Yes, hi.
Are you at home?

223
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,465
No, I'm in a palace
overlooking the Eiffel Tower.

224
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:08,923
- And where is your palace?
- On the Champs Elysees.

225
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:12,056
Beautiful view.

226
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:14,712
Well, your listening,
What do you want?

227
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:16,659
Yes, it is Sofia.

228
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:20,288
Well, "Push the Air"
is for her.

229
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:24,115
Well, you know,
Coordinator ...

230
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,864
- No!
- Shit!

231
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:38,716
What?

232
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,238
Everything will be fine.

233
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,409
- Sami.
- What?

234
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:48,285
The police.

235
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:55,297
- Downloaded music?.
- It's our music.

236
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:57,981
- It's nothing bad.
- I decide that.

237
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,903
Come on, ID,
both of you.

238
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:02,029
- Come on, here.
- Grab.

239
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:06,486
- Who owns the car?
- my father.

240
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:08,137
Driving license?

241
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:10,295
I have not, take it away.

242
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:11,493
What about your license?

243
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:13,208
I'm 17 years,
I have no license!

244
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,154
We're not doing anything,
Only music!

245
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,129
Since when is prohibited to
listen to music?

246
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:18,933
We're not bothering
anyone.

247
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,831
- Come out of that car.
- No.

248
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:22,379
Hurry.

249
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,603
Shit! Again.

250
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:42,322
Go see what happened.

251
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:45,637
Okay.

252
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:53,326
- And what is this?
- I don't know, I don't know.

253
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:55,561
Shoot, Shoot.

254
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,187
- What is it, officer?
- A routine check.

255
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,203
Some girls who listen
music isnt so dangerous.

256
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:27,375
Why not search? Are
the girls carrying ...

257
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,163
... drugs in this neighborhood.

258
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:31,863
We'll give you a vote of
confidence tonight.

259
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,763
- Can you drive?
- Yes

260
00:30:33,763 --> 00:30:35,144
- Get out.
- But I have no license.

261
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:36,614
Get out!

262
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,512
Shit, they left.
But she has no license.

263
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:46,521
What do we do?
Do we continue?

264
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:48,202
- Come on.
- No, stay.

265
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:49,573
- You keep shooting.
- I am.

266
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:52,177
What service
are you exactly?

267
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:54,140
Secret Service.

268
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,525
Get in your car.

269
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:07,632
Shit!

270
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,401
Do not move,
still filming!

271
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,002
- And what is this?
- You keep shooting.

272
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:21,306
And what is this?

273
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:25,778
The license, zoom in.

274
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:27,608
I got it.

275
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:29,674
Shit, Ive never 
seen that before.

276
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:32,076
Give me here, and I do.

277
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:34,502
- Samir.
- What?

278
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,367
Policemen killed
police, is a bomb.

279
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,997
Precisely, rather than see it explode
lets hear the official report.

280
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:43,871
That will do.

281
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,208
What?

282
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,817
- police here?
- What are you talking about?

283
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:22,933
Are you crazy?

284
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,000
What are you doing?

285
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:27,777
Somethinsg wrong, I assure you.

286
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:30,017
Hey, you,
Have you lost your way?

287
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:32,858
- This is not a parking lot.
- That you can be sure.

288
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,457
- Do you have framed?
- Yes

289
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,392
Perfect.

290
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,117
They're shooting!

291
00:32:44,402 --> 00:32:45,798
Fire!

292
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:53,206
Come on, normal
excercise.

293
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:58,663
- The bomb is well placed?
- Yes

294
00:32:58,663 --> 00:33:01,407
Dale, collects and
we go home.

295
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,257
Diss.

296
00:33:45,862 --> 00:33:47,019
Where are you going?

297
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:50,618
Go back to sleep, I'm going to see a
film. Don't worry.

298
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:04,941
Get down, hands behind!

299
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,125
- I'm police!
- Get down!

300
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:09,857
Damien!

301
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:12,040
What?

302
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:15,568
Who is responsible for
your unit? I want answers.

303
00:34:16,544 --> 00:34:18,179
I am.

304
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,389
I think you have the wrong
person.

305
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,156
Damien Tomaso, captain
the armed forces 31 years.

306
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:32,876
What is the reason
for this arrest?

307
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:35,660
Captain, we founnd
this in the kitchen.

308
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:39,693
Well here is why.
Come to collect a few things ...

309
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:41,911
... we go.

310
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:01,734
It is unbearable.

311
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:04,519
Georges, explain.

312
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,310
Six months ago we
gave good results.

313
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,197
Mr. President, we do not have the means to
Observe any of the crossroads, or any position of the vehicle

314
00:35:11,197 --> 00:35:13,878
Ahórreme story
the means, please.

315
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:16,905
We have set aside five hundred million slum

316
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:19,730
So something had to
have improved.

317
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:22,744
Then Explain to me how they managed
To carry out a massacre like this

318
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:26,489
This does not detract from ongoing efforts
Made so far, believe me

319
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:30,311
- What is it then?
- Well this is ...

320
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:33,145
... an isolated case.
No more.

321
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:34,899
I hope so.

322
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:38,166
Until then, the appointed person cost
This issue. serious and effective

323
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:41,060
That Damien, for example.

324
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,877
Isnt his type of mission, huh?

325
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:45,769
I thought of him but was arrested this
morning for drug trafficking.

326
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:48,680
Was he? Are you sure?

327
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,400
Unfortunately.

328
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,660
I would climb
next week.

329
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:58,307
I thought Gazmán, the head of Diss.
They are well informed about the industry.

330
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:02,751
Yes, very well. Okay.

331
00:36:16,617 --> 00:36:18,527
Sir.

332
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:20,755
What? Already?

333
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,413
I guess they are
ahead of the situation.

334
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:26,204
I had the time
to inform you, Chairman.

335
00:36:26,204 --> 00:36:27,115
Well.

336
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:29,904
If the tape is broadcasted,chaos will prevail in the country


337
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:32,734
There will be a whole and the possibility of a civil war

338
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,352
We have 48 hours.

339
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:40,426
It is exactly the time they have
to resolve this matter.

340
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:41,956
- Under the utmost discretion.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:44,085
We will, Mr. President.

342
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:57,912
Take the video you posted on
The Internet to spread chaos

343
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,680
Special Feature:
Last night in District 13 ...

344
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:06,321
... an altercation between a banda
and law enforcement ...

345
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,198
- Wow!
- Look, it's an inner chamber.

346
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:38,155
That's bullshit!
That was not by chance!

347
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,839
Yes?
Why are you here?

348
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,834
I was in wrong place,
as the whole world.

349
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:48,590
Is no reason to
be here.

350
00:37:49,638 --> 00:37:52,058
You did so well,
so get out!

351
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:55,369
I have rights!

352
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:09,812
Come on, go get your
colleagues and tell them to take care.

353
00:38:18,491 --> 00:38:19,868
Come on!

354
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:23,302
- What district?
- 13.

355
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:24,981
Perfect.

356
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:27,487
Boss, can I show you something?

357
00:38:30,964 --> 00:38:33,151
They Sent us this.

358
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,402
Its the chamber that
passed yesterday.

359
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:46,346
But look at this.

360
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:51,927
Probably some boys who
attempting to get some girls.

361
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:56,926
When I saw
I did a zoom ...

362
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:02,167
... and saw this.

363
00:39:03,313 --> 00:39:05,900
Shit, it was filmed.

364
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,363
Yes

365
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:09,300
Investigate that license number 
right away.

366
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,563
- I'm on it.
- Perfect.

367
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:28,278
Letto.

368
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:32,423
- I filmed everything and now I need you.
- What are you talking about?

369
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:34,312
Car on television.

370
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:36,080
Shit!

371
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,910
There!

372
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:43,882
Stop!

373
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:04,931
- This is Samir.
- Stop!

374
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:06,984
¡Suéltenlo! ¡Suéltenlo!

375
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:09,009
Let go of my friend!

376
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,526
Estate calm
or we'll take you too.

377
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:14,223
Let go of my friend!

378
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:27,869
Open the door 14.

379
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:31,368
Come on.

380
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,545
- Can I borrow you cell phone?
- What else you want?

381
00:40:41,294 --> 00:40:43,179
Your cell phone.

382
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:47,564
Thank you.

383
00:40:51,322 --> 00:40:53,274
Pick up.

384
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,719
Letto, It's Damien, I'm fucked up,
partner, I need a hand ...

385
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,497
I am not at home.

386
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,876
... if you need to talk to me ...

387
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,210
... leave a message.

388
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,384
You gotta help me.
I'm Damien.

389
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:08,923
I'm in the basement of the
Central Police Station.

390
00:41:09,194 --> 00:41:10,667
I'll lay a trap.

391
00:41:10,995 --> 00:41:12,931
I need to get out of here.

392
00:41:13,662 --> 00:41:15,808
I know I can count on you.

393
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:21,311
Drop the phone!

394
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:33,395
Hey, guys!

395
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:38,514
The police are
everywhere, are you crazy?

396
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:39,966
Yes, I know.

397
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:41,191
They Are everywhere.

398
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:42,811
Okay.

399
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:51,387
Leave for a minute.

400
00:41:55,486 --> 00:41:56,566
Yes?

401
00:41:56,904 --> 00:41:58,703
We have carried out a telephone conversation before he was arrested --

402
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:02,033
- Who called?
- A one bed.

403
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:03,593
Located in sector 13.

404
00:42:03,593 --> 00:42:05,963
- Is anyone aware of before this?
- Yes, they were comrades.

405
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,350
Tráiganme in that bed,
we do not risk it.

406
00:42:46,121 --> 00:42:48,083
"You have nine new messages".

407
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:54,827
Letto, I am calling
but your never home. Okay, bye.

408
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:13,004
Do not move!

409
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:24,844
- Do not pass.
- We ask you to think.

410
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:27,802
Think well.

411
00:43:31,157 --> 00:43:32,767
Let's talk seriously.

412
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:35,598
Some must die.
You will be some.

413
00:43:38,796 --> 00:43:40,812
Up! Up!

414
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:50,244
Shit, they left.
But she has no license.

415
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:52,298
And what do?
Do we continue?

416
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:53,907
- Come on.
- No, stay.

417
00:43:53,907 --> 00:43:56,168
- You keep shooting.
- I am.

418
00:43:56,168 --> 00:43:59,106
- What are they filming?
- Shoot, shoot.

419
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:03,918
Shit!

420
00:44:03,918 --> 00:44:05,815
Do not move,
keep filming!

421
00:44:05,815 --> 00:44:08,463
- And what is this?
- keep shooting.

422
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,593
And what is this?

423
00:44:10,593 --> 00:44:13,290
The license, zoom in on it.

424
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,729
Got it.

425
00:44:14,729 --> 00:44:17,338
Crap,
never seen that.

426
00:44:28,764 --> 00:44:29,947
Come on.

427
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:43,686
You gotta help me.
It's Damian.

428
00:44:44,106 --> 00:44:47,298
I'm in the basement
Central Police Station.

429
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:49,725
I'll lay a trap.

430
00:44:49,926 --> 00:44:51,644
I need to get out of here.

431
00:44:51,644 --> 00:44:53,639
I know I can on
count on you.

432
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,046
You gotta help me.
I'm Damien.

433
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:11,007
I'm in the basement
Central Police Station.

434
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:24,330
I'll lay a trap.

435
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,302
I need to get out of here.

436
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:53,302
I know I can count on
you.

437
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:29,645
What are you doing there?
Hurry!

438
00:46:34,532 --> 00:46:37,350
He disappeared.
I'll keep look.

439
00:46:57,492 --> 00:46:59,083
Hurry! Hurry!

440
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,522
Over here!

441
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:44,044
There he goes!

442
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:04,364
We have to get to the other side!

443
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,981
Wait! Wait!

444
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,974
Come on! Come on!

445
00:49:00,385 --> 00:49:03,329
Come on, shit! There he is!
Hurry!

446
00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:11,600
Shit!

447
00:49:14,787 --> 00:49:16,635
Were you shopping?

448
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:18,717
- No, sir.
- Are you unable to catch ...

449
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:20,423
... a guy with three
drives you?

450
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:22,423
The individual is very clever, sir
I had never seen anything like this.

451
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:24,713
Next time, ask
for lessons.

452
00:49:25,033 --> 00:49:27,381
Back to base, I will go
to see Mr. President.

453
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,241
Yes, sir.

454
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:29,630
And how are
things over there?

455
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,540
I do not think it takes
to react.

456
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:49,295
Do not kill the boy on purpose
I guarantee it.

457
00:49:49,295 --> 00:49:52,023
Tried to leave alone.
What is going to happen?

458
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:55,270
Explain to his mother.

459
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,689
Move!

460
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:11,284
Right in the middle!

461
00:50:13,382 --> 00:50:15,694
Go, go!

462
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:41,960
Can I help you?

463
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:44,449
Can I see the head,
please?

464
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:47,811
Head, a young man who wants
talk to the manager.

465
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,267
- Do come.
- Come on, come on.

466
00:50:53,327 --> 00:50:55,816
- What is it?
- It is a room, please.

467
00:50:56,536 --> 00:50:58,304
Are you teasing?
This is not a hotel.

468
00:50:58,754 --> 00:51:00,809
Outside says
"hotel of the police."

469
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:03,090
Get out before they
bother me.

470
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,677
Go, go!

471
00:51:04,677 --> 00:51:07,271
Listen, you better be
locked up because I am a criminal ...

472
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:11,161
in power ... and if I stay outside,
I do some nonsense.

473
00:51:11,161 --> 00:51:13,439
Have you committed any crime?

474
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:14,617
No.

475
00:51:14,617 --> 00:51:17,675
Well, you know what? Return to us
when you've committed one.

476
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:20,287
I'll give you a good cell
Okay?

477
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,634
Okay.

478
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:24,500
Get down! Get down!

479
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,825
Do not move!
Do not move!

480
00:51:28,023 --> 00:51:29,824
Open the door 14.

481
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,031
You're lucky, only
a room.

482
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:37,847
- But there is no cover or food.
- What?

483
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:39,959
What did you expect?

484
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,103
Drop him!

485
00:51:49,342 --> 00:51:51,189
I said drop him!

486
00:52:00,092 --> 00:52:02,074
Security.

487
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:04,426
Security doors
are blocked.

488
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:12,778
You take your time.

489
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,002
Want me to return later
when you're in a good mood?

490
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:17,674
No, okay.

491
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:20,891
- Good to see you.
- you too.

492
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:23,804
Out there is shit,
Are you sure you want to leave?

493
00:52:23,804 --> 00:52:25,739
Yes, I have accounts
to fix.

494
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:27,071
Come on, do you have a plan?

495
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:28,686
Why not have a plan?

496
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:31,497
I thought we had come in
so easy, you'll have one.

497
00:52:33,804 --> 00:52:35,335
Sign was not so hard.

498
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:38,973
Exit will be a little more
complicated.

499
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:48,810
You are well trained.

500
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,474
Yes, more or less.

501
00:52:50,474 --> 00:52:52,677
Come on, I know a shortcut.

502
00:52:59,531 --> 00:53:01,588
Is this your shortcut?

503
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:15,424
Run! Run!

504
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:30,224
Tomaso escaped
 his cell.

505
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:31,947
gone?

506
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:33,916
No, he is still
on the inside.

507
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,686
- Find it.
- Yes

508
00:53:36,686 --> 00:53:38,066
And fast.

509
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:40,539
... in the 13 ...

510
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:42,563
Gentlemen.

511
00:53:42,563 --> 00:53:44,453
Already started?

512
00:53:44,877 --> 00:53:46,476
... of law enforcement ...

513
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:49,159
and incidents ...
multiply.

514
00:53:50,276 --> 00:53:53,047
Among the wounded are
many officers.

515
00:53:55,022 --> 00:53:57,840
Well, commander,
How can we?

516
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,406
Sector 13
is out of control.

517
00:54:00,406 --> 00:54:03,524
And the risk in the next few hours is that
Nearby areas join him.

518
00:54:03,524 --> 00:54:06,590
The entire country may be
alarm in 24 hours.

519
00:54:06,948 --> 00:54:11,274
Overall, how a military intervention is
still advisable as a preventive measure?

520
00:54:11,274 --> 00:54:13,224
Yet. But the army ...

521
00:54:13,224 --> 00:54:16,014
... is not ready to dp
an internal invasion yet.

522
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:19,898
Unfortunately, time
is a luxury not available.

523
00:54:22,835 --> 00:54:25,580
Mr. Gazmán,
its recommendation.

524
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:28,629
When the gangrene spreads,
it need to be cut.

525
00:54:28,629 --> 00:54:34,357
Well, I was not elected because
my tolerance for metaphors.

526
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,176
When I request a recommendation
I want a recommendation.

527
00:54:37,176 --> 00:54:39,244
Well, Mr. President,
I will be more direct.

528
00:54:39,244 --> 00:54:41,974
Evacuate area 13
in twelve hours.

529
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:45,507
Tomorrow morning we fly across
the place and nobody can go back there.

530
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:47,829
And there are more advantages.

531
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:49,630
This will create new jobs.

532
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:52,018
Building a new
neighborhood full of middle class ...

533
00:54:52,018 --> 00:54:54,458
... which will probably vote
for you in the upcoming elections.

534
00:54:56,489 --> 00:54:59,046
Could not be clearer.

535
00:54:59,439 --> 00:55:00,757
Gentlemen.

536
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:03,306
That inspires them something?

537
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:06,753
Politically, such a solution
would be extremely serious.

538
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:09,242
What is your solution?

539
00:55:14,372 --> 00:55:15,734
Well.

540
00:55:16,408 --> 00:55:19,677
I note that none of you
have any specific proposal ...

541
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:21,599
do to defend ...
our democracy.

542
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,848
Very interesting.

543
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:25,374
I remember that our function
first is to protect the French ...

544
00:55:25,374 --> 00:55:26,967
... and look after their interests.

545
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:30,039
And so do the values of
freedom, equality, and fraternity ...

546
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:33,623
... is still respected
in this country.

547
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:37,474
Is somewhat, how do I say?
The foundation of our republic.

548
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:41,718
And the only proposal that I made
is to exploit the site, a nasty.

549
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:43,519
Thank you.

550
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:45,947
Mr. President,
the idea is appalling ...

551
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:48,227
... but we have priorities.

552
00:55:48,227 --> 00:55:51,788
Perhaps in two hours
the situation becomes uncontrollable.

553
00:55:51,788 --> 00:55:55,982
Perhaps not the best idea,
but believe me ...

554
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,063
... is the least worst.

555
00:55:58,392 --> 00:55:59,862
General ...

556
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,152
... Is that we can evacuate one million
civilians in less than twelve hours?

557
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:05,288
If you give the order now,
it may be possible.

558
00:56:05,288 --> 00:56:08,878
I suppose that some heads of clans
not so easily be evacuated.

559
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:11,006
Who will mourn?

560
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:24,392
General.

561
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:27,349
Proceed to the evacuation.

562
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:30,989
We will plan
tomorrow morning.

563
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:36,737
Mr. Gazmán, I demand that all
the inhabitants of that neighborhood ...

564
00:56:36,737 --> 00:56:39,924
... are treated with respect
and dignity, and that means ...

565
00:56:39,924 --> 00:56:41,364
... all.

566
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,396
I will give the order personally,
Sir.

567
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:46,063
Now go.

568
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,125
Go there!

569
00:56:57,284 --> 00:56:59,035
Keep looking!

570
00:57:08,476 --> 00:57:10,473
Here we are.

571
00:57:12,828 --> 00:57:17,070
- I thought you were a cop?
- They found drugs in my kitchen.

572
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:19,606
Di not know you knew to save your stuff?

573
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:22,483
It was not mine.
It was planted.

574
00:57:23,025 --> 00:57:24,184
A classic.

575
00:57:24,184 --> 00:57:26,215
Police want to fuck
other policemen.

576
00:57:26,215 --> 00:57:27,312
It is not common.

577
00:57:27,312 --> 00:57:28,933
Above all,
I wonder why.

578
00:57:28,933 --> 00:57:31,269
Sure to impedirte
you went somewhere.

579
00:57:31,269 --> 00:57:31,933
You are very sociable.

580
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:32,909
I do not know.

581
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:35,114
Surely something is up
they do not want you around.

582
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:37,766
Super police
are not good for everything.

583
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:40,000
I had been given a holiday
or I would have thought.

584
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:41,707
You would go on vacation?

585
00:57:43,184 --> 00:57:44,832
No, of course not.

586
00:57:49,918 --> 00:57:51,630
You know what happens
out there?

587
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,052
What's out there?

588
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,990
There is a recording that offers a
banda sector shot 13 ...

589
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,310
... a patrol.

590
00:57:58,387 --> 00:58:00,726
But there is one in which
Moreover banda police ...

591
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:03,592
... is what you shoot
the patrol.

592
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:06,267
And what was in the 13?

593
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:08,156
May have carried.

594
00:58:08,405 --> 00:58:09,324
And then?

595
00:58:09,324 --> 00:58:12,723
After I gave the second
operates a portion of the building.

596
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,992
It was the police.

597
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:20,563
But I managed to escape before.

598
00:58:23,727 --> 00:58:25,497
They are not policemen.

599
00:58:25,497 --> 00:58:27,864
They must be criminals
posing as policemen.

600
00:58:27,864 --> 00:58:30,176
Why?
For pleasure?

601
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:32,546
It is a strategy for
end the sector 13.

602
00:58:32,936 --> 00:58:34,704
And then build on it.

603
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:42,638
Remember tuition?

604
00:58:44,768 --> 00:58:47,136
All have the same
Registration No: DISS.

605
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,481
DISS dont think so.

606
00:58:51,481 --> 00:58:52,982
What is it?

607
00:58:53,522 --> 00:58:56,135
Internal Division Secret
Security.

608
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:57,721
Well, that is.

609
00:58:57,721 --> 00:59:01,274
Receive direct orders
President of the Republic.

610
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,098
The head of the DISS
Gazmán is fine.

611
00:59:05,098 --> 00:59:07,874
- Did you know?
- No, not really.

612
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,508
No, I wanted to move there
six months ago and I got refused.

613
00:59:11,508 --> 00:59:14,657
Well, there it is. Have mobile
crime and the offender.

614
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,975
Before we need
evidence.

615
00:59:19,284 --> 00:59:21,171
How about this?

616
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,127
The images are not
sufficient.

617
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:30,992
Something is necessary
the mind.

618
00:59:37,126 --> 00:59:39,135
- What are you doing?
- Reflecting.

619
00:59:39,434 --> 00:59:41,714
I do not like it when your
thinking.

620
00:59:41,923 --> 00:59:45,236
- We must go to the office of Walter.
- I feared that.

621
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:48,160
- Where is it?
- First floor, room 17.

622
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:52,511
Do we do the former?

623
00:59:52,511 --> 00:59:54,592
Okay, the old one.

624
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,774
Can you not be discreet
like me?

625
01:00:17,774 --> 01:00:20,448
You do not mind being discreet.

626
01:00:23,474 --> 01:00:25,224
And now what are you doing?

627
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:27,643
I'm thinking.

628
01:00:27,643 --> 01:00:29,243
There they are!

629
01:00:29,243 --> 01:00:31,491
I said that I do not like thinking.

630
01:00:57,371 --> 01:00:59,081
Do you have any idea?

631
01:00:59,953 --> 01:01:02,907
I will entertain and you
go to the office of Walter.

632
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:04,988
Remember, first floor
in room 17.

633
01:01:04,988 --> 01:01:06,880
Bring anything
that can serve as evidence.

634
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:08,676
Are we seeing again?

635
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:12,160
I do not think I will be
far from here, quick, go!

636
01:01:27,954 --> 01:01:29,542
Now you'll see!

637
01:02:06,127 --> 01:02:09,159
If you stay well, without saying anything,
nothing will happen.

638
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:10,936
You have my word, okay?

639
01:02:12,944 --> 01:02:14,892
What is the computer
Mr. Garzo?

640
01:02:18,356 --> 01:02:19,783
know the
password?

641
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,184
Good morning, did some of you
have a computer ...

642
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:34,386
... that moved?

643
01:02:34,386 --> 01:02:35,885
Yes, me.

644
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,961
Service, im installing the new
server

645
01:02:41,823 --> 01:02:43,743
I regret causing inconvenience.

646
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,880
I found it.

647
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,832
Thanks, gentlemen.

648
01:03:32,473 --> 01:03:33,702
Damian

649
01:03:35,069 --> 01:03:38,440
It is more reasonable and let
justice address your problem.

650
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:45,756
I did nothing,
and you know it.

651
01:03:46,896 --> 01:03:50,126
Yes, I know. Prisons are
full of innocent people.

652
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:54,216
However, the morgues.

653
01:03:56,149 --> 01:03:57,872
hey, lets go?

654
01:04:13,885 --> 01:04:15,071
What I do for you.

655
01:04:15,071 --> 01:04:16,465
I already pay.

656
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:19,679
Do not run!

657
01:04:23,494 --> 01:04:25,410
Shit!

658
01:04:26,306 --> 01:04:27,804
We can still walk, no?

659
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:30,353
Put the belt.

660
01:04:49,417 --> 01:04:52,205
- What are you doing?
- going forward.

661
01:05:08,768 --> 01:05:10,150
Sorry.

662
01:05:14,348 --> 01:05:15,305
listen.

663
01:05:15,504 --> 01:05:17,226
- Damian escaped.
- How did he escape?

664
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:19,072
Letto came.

665
01:05:19,072 --> 01:05:20,945
He came to look for Damian
and they escaped.

666
01:05:20,945 --> 01:05:23,402
Can you explain
how they escaped?

667
01:05:23,911 --> 01:05:25,682
Go to your office.

668
01:05:25,911 --> 01:05:27,861
What do we do?
Do we pursue?

669
01:05:27,861 --> 01:05:30,570
No, too, the military
are everywhere.

670
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,714
More attentive
anyway.

671
01:05:32,714 --> 01:05:34,319
Understood.

672
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:43,613
Follow the instructions
that were given.

673
01:05:51,653 --> 01:05:53,780
And where you lead us?

674
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,409
There is always something
about the law.

675
01:06:25,409 --> 01:06:27,427
Yes, that I was promised change?

676
01:06:27,427 --> 01:06:29,826
There will always be a fool
like you to apply.

677
01:06:29,826 --> 01:06:32,127
There are laws which are bad,
and people that deliver them.

678
01:06:32,127 --> 01:06:34,654
Yeah, like religion.
Incidentally, what's yours?

679
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,861
I was baptized when I was a boy,
but my only goal ...

680
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:39,862
now ...
is the civil code.

681
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,361
What?

682
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:43,702
My only goal now
is the civil code.

683
01:06:43,702 --> 01:06:45,592
You're worse than a Mormon.

684
01:06:48,347 --> 01:06:50,532
Well, do we or do we
were to give us?

685
01:06:50,532 --> 01:06:52,037
We're going.

686
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,307
- What do you want?
- Talk with Tao.

687
01:07:13,307 --> 01:07:14,499
About what?

688
01:07:14,499 --> 01:07:16,639
About the sector
and its inhabitants.

689
01:07:17,209 --> 01:07:19,868
Are you kidding.
Business.

690
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:36,401
Let them pass.

691
01:07:54,963 --> 01:07:56,332
What are you doing here?

692
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:01,310
We have brought a disk from the internal security
All the contents of this disk is classified state secrets

693
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,998
Are we good.

694
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:06,026
Well?

695
01:08:06,026 --> 01:08:09,136
They will, provided we
get some things that interest us.

696
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,115
And what is this?

697
01:08:11,115 --> 01:08:12,804
A little catechism.

698
01:08:13,687 --> 01:08:15,864
You've always lived here
in sector 13.

699
01:08:15,864 --> 01:08:17,861
Where do you think will live
when they destroy it?

700
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:19,975
We must avoid that.

701
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,405
ANIEL, get that.

702
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,969
That's it.
Its open.

703
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:57,021
- They are everywhere.
- Everywhere.

704
01:08:57,021 --> 01:08:58,865
Where did you learn that?

705
01:08:59,321 --> 01:09:00,970
Well, in books.

706
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,797
Come on, do it.

707
01:09:08,543 --> 01:09:10,760
This interests me.

708
01:09:11,302 --> 01:09:14,110
- We are now on Iran.
- I too am interested.

709
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,233
Here it is, sector 13.

710
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:18,168
These are the goals,
five towers.

711
01:09:18,168 --> 01:09:20,300
There must be something else.

712
01:09:20,943 --> 01:09:23,700
Walter manages to
is angry with you.

713
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,815
The President ordered their destruction
and build everything new.

714
01:09:25,815 --> 01:09:27,644
- As in Iraq.
- Yes

715
01:09:27,644 --> 01:09:29,645
But now
the French.

716
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:32,067
And how will they destroy the
towers?

717
01:09:35,082 --> 01:09:36,852
In position.

718
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,011
Three helicopters.
They are up there.

719
01:10:06,139 --> 01:10:08,099
Shoot them with lasers.

720
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,972
They sent the missiles.

721
01:10:14,691 --> 01:10:15,831
How?

722
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:18,319
Probably 
from a command post.

723
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:20,528
Only the President can
have given an order like that.

724
01:10:20,528 --> 01:10:22,447
And what do what
to prevent it?

725
01:10:22,447 --> 01:10:25,112
Go read the manual.
Because your head ...

726
01:10:25,112 --> 01:10:27,964
... starts to sweat
a little.

727
01:10:27,964 --> 01:10:31,019
Bothers you because I do some
Ambivilent, is it?

728
01:10:33,105 --> 01:10:34,681
I apologize.

729
01:10:35,989 --> 01:10:38,508
If you call "lechuguita"
do you prefer?

730
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:41,657
- What if you call me by my name?
- Okay.

731
01:10:42,289 --> 01:10:43,646
What is your name?

732
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:46,498
Damien Tomaso, commander
French army.

733
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:50,666
A police
if preferred.

734
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:55,820
Now I believe I should
forget prejudices ...

735
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,837
... and let us hand.

736
01:11:09,668 --> 01:11:12,585
Tao delighted.

737
01:11:12,585 --> 01:11:14,254
Alike.

738
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:20,098
Now, what is your plan,
lechuguita?

739
01:11:42,986 --> 01:11:44,877
- Thanks for coming.
- What is it?

740
01:11:45,805 --> 01:11:47,484
I'll explain.

741
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:04,507
Hello.

742
01:12:07,965 --> 01:12:10,304
In there.

743
01:12:25,376 --> 01:12:27,444
Alika, guns.

744
01:12:29,046 --> 01:12:32,126
March specialist
in machetes.

745
01:12:33,786 --> 01:12:36,844
Carlos Skin,
specialist cars.

746
01:12:38,512 --> 01:12:41,433
Montana pumps.

747
01:12:42,602 --> 01:12:44,057
Sorry.

748
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:49,197
Think you can
take place?

749
01:12:49,392 --> 01:12:51,986
Yes, not to lose the opportunity
to show their skills.

750
01:12:57,777 --> 01:12:59,438
Gentlemen.

751
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,236
Thanks to all
who come.

752
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:05,781
For 19 hours,
Sector 13 was evacuated.

753
01:13:06,351 --> 01:13:08,408
Their intention is to destroy everything.

754
01:13:08,408 --> 01:13:11,179
If you are in need,
I have everything you need.

755
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,273
The idea is to avoid it.

756
01:13:17,019 --> 01:13:18,995
Who is in favor?

757
01:13:29,741 --> 01:13:32,532
Well, you pass the word a. ..

758
01:13:33,235 --> 01:13:36,239
Damien who ...
will explain his plan.

759
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:45,925
We all have to agree
in the five hours we have left.

760
01:13:46,864 --> 01:13:49,864
Then I need
of about thirty men.

761
01:13:50,575 --> 01:13:52,710
Trained in combat,
and care nothing about weapons.

762
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:54,120
We will not hunt.

763
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,355
We broke in silence
the neutralized ...

764
01:13:56,355 --> 01:13:59,121
... and let live
center operations.

765
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:01,668
Questions?

766
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:04,557
Where is
the command post?

767
01:14:05,626 --> 01:14:10,360
Here, in the Paris.

768
01:14:24,289 --> 01:14:26,761
Over here, Mr. President.

769
01:14:33,945 --> 01:14:36,823
Strengthen security
around the building.

770
01:14:39,425 --> 01:14:41,413
Go to the signal.

771
01:14:49,104 --> 01:14:51,696
Remain in the air,
Over and out.

772
01:14:54,897 --> 01:14:57,567
Good morning, gentlemen.
Sit down.

773
01:14:59,553 --> 01:15:01,736
So, General,
Where are we?

774
01:15:01,736 --> 01:15:04,595
The order is Jaguards
flying over the targets.

775
01:15:04,595 --> 01:15:07,533
Talked about the evacuation,
rather than destruction.

776
01:15:08,251 --> 01:15:10,334
It is a priority, right?

777
01:15:10,724 --> 01:15:12,015
Yes, sir.

778
01:15:12,269 --> 01:15:13,828
Sir.

779
01:15:14,237 --> 01:15:17,639
We evacuated 1087310
people in less than two hours ...

780
01:15:17,982 --> 01:15:20,268
... but there are people who
We have not been approached.

781
01:15:20,268 --> 01:15:22,975
Its all
located here.

782
01:15:22,975 --> 01:15:24,831
We have tried
and there is already injured.

783
01:15:24,831 --> 01:15:27,320
This could be delayed.

784
01:15:28,669 --> 01:15:31,173
How many people 
have not been evacuated yet?

785
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:33,277
Long time no
a census is done in that neighborhood ...

786
01:15:33,277 --> 01:15:35,461
... but I think
a few thousand.

787
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:38,953
Those few, are many.
Continue the evacuation.

788
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:46,975
- We are sent here.
- To us too!

789
01:15:58,232 --> 01:16:00,361
Okay.

790
01:16:09,974 --> 01:16:12,564
Turn both keys
at once.

791
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:15,622
Five missiles, all 
at the same time.

792
01:17:00,743 --> 01:17:03,099
To tell you the truth,
Gentlemen ...

793
01:17:03,461 --> 01:17:06,225
... I do not feel very well
with all this.

794
01:17:06,225 --> 01:17:08,901
- Can I give you some advice?
- Please.

795
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:12,021
I know that guy
men.

796
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:14,899
They do not respect anything, not to
people and to the laws.

797
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:17,828
Just kill and steal
for their benefit.

798
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:19,757
And you are not
responsible.

799
01:17:19,757 --> 01:17:21,375
They were there before
their arrival.

800
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,626
And what can be
do with them?

801
01:17:23,626 --> 01:17:25,574
Are you?
No.

802
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:28,553
Believe me, to get rid of them,
they must be exterminated.

803
01:17:46,165 --> 01:17:47,556
Warning!

804
01:17:56,316 --> 01:17:59,149
Mr. Gazmán, find your
cynicism, in terror.

805
01:17:59,632 --> 01:18:02,241
No, Mr. President, just
I am being pragmatic.

806
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:06,807
One of the causes of our
recession is the parallel economy ...

807
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:10,856
... with these guys that make you lose
million at the box state.

808
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:13,546
With destruction
like that ...

809
01:18:13,546 --> 01:18:17,293
... we can build a site
we can make money again.

810
01:18:17,501 --> 01:18:20,368
So we are rid of this scourge
and we can build something more.

811
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:24,231
Destroy to build,
Is that your solution?

812
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:27,349
In any case,
thats what comes to mind.

813
01:18:36,885 --> 01:18:39,105
Here.

814
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:42,038
General.

815
01:18:42,366 --> 01:18:44,891
Is the helicopter assault
already in the air?

816
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:47,098
Yeah.

817
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:48,940
Landing.

818
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:52,831
Do not get this key
in the lock ...

819
01:18:52,831 --> 01:18:56,080
... until it is satisfied that
there is no civil strife in that neighborhood.

820
01:18:57,005 --> 01:18:58,897
- Understand?
- Well, sir.

821
01:19:33,286 --> 01:19:35,939
My General, a banda
entered the building.

822
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,321
Well, neutralize them.

823
01:19:37,321 --> 01:19:39,752
They are unarmed,
but many.

824
01:19:39,752 --> 01:19:41,519
To continue, I occupy.

825
01:19:45,918 --> 01:19:47,846
Go see what happens.

826
01:19:54,188 --> 01:19:56,606
Come, dear.

827
01:21:01,444 --> 01:21:03,213
Montana, he said
no injuries.

828
01:21:03,213 --> 01:21:06,182
It is only
my personal safety.

829
01:21:10,893 --> 01:21:12,270
What?

830
01:21:12,898 --> 01:21:15,373
Do not worry, the building
is heavily equipped.

831
01:21:15,929 --> 01:21:17,310
Calm down.

832
01:21:23,861 --> 01:21:26,964
This is mine.

833
01:21:39,724 --> 01:21:42,411
So?
This is How youprefer?

834
01:21:43,366 --> 01:21:46,447
Listen, you ...

835
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,127
The rules are
adhered to.

836
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,724
But not with guys like you.

837
01:21:59,101 --> 01:22:02,170
We love to know
guys like you.

838
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:06,577
And these orejitas?

839
01:22:08,526 --> 01:22:11,346
You okay?

840
01:22:16,804 --> 01:22:18,726
No answer.

841
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:21,797
Te llamo.

842
01:22:22,115 --> 01:22:24,961
Mr. President, I inform you that any
the sector is completely evacuated.

843
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:29,808
I do not understand, one hour ago
risked ...

844
01:22:29,808 --> 01:22:31,680
... you can not evacuate
those thousands.

845
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,495
I do not know, maybe the message
had not come either.

846
01:22:34,495 --> 01:22:37,376
Anyway, everything is
vacuum, we guarantee it.

847
01:22:44,556 --> 01:22:46,103
In that case.

848
01:22:54,564 --> 01:22:57,307
Get in position.

849
01:22:58,847 --> 01:23:01,325
Received signal,
attack in a minute.

850
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:03,361
They Are in position,
Sir.

851
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:21,680
Do not move!
Come on!

852
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,483
We say that ...!

853
01:23:25,535 --> 01:23:28,466
This is the hand you get
in the throat if you do not shut up, okay?

854
01:23:33,512 --> 01:23:35,790
Gentlemen, I am the President
of the Republic.

855
01:23:36,151 --> 01:23:39,689
- On the television.
- I've seen on the Internet.

856
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:44,230
Captain Tomaso,
Can you explain?

857
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:47,667
The images speak higher
than words, Mr. President.

858
01:23:58,086 --> 01:24:00,253
- Shoot, shoot.
- And what is that?

859
01:24:02,722 --> 01:24:05,540
I do not know,
but still rolling.

860
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:09,286
Shit!

861
01:24:09,619 --> 01:24:10,834
What is that?

862
01:24:10,834 --> 01:24:12,480
The DISS in action.

863
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,415
The police wanted to
discredit the sector ...

864
01:24:14,415 --> 01:24:17,250
... to destroy everything
and then build.

865
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,780
It sure will
a commission for that.

866
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:22,960
If the images
do not meet ...

867
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,992
... behold the disk of
special operations of DISS.

868
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:29,152
Is it not true, Walter?

869
01:24:30,743 --> 01:24:33,066
We have sent
vacation.

870
01:24:33,537 --> 01:24:34,896
Nobody move!

871
01:24:34,896 --> 01:24:36,937
What are you doing?

872
01:24:37,507 --> 01:24:39,395
Remove the key.

873
01:24:40,267 --> 01:24:43,011
Remove the key.
Fast.

874
01:24:43,472 --> 01:24:44,806
Come on!

875
01:24:44,806 --> 01:24:47,040
Remove the key.

876
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,985
Get the key,
do what I say!

877
01:24:52,367 --> 01:24:54,373
What?

878
01:24:56,328 --> 01:24:58,486
I think there will be
new elections.

879
01:24:58,486 --> 01:25:01,337
Come on, let the
artifices, the key!

880
01:25:01,337 --> 01:25:04,283
¡Tomaso not move!
If you move, ill kill you.

881
01:25:04,973 --> 01:25:07,963
Come on, turn it
I tell you the key!

882
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,637
Signal received!
Done!

883
01:25:19,867 --> 01:25:21,226
Come on.

884
01:25:21,226 --> 01:25:23,388
Pare, Gazmán,
not going anywhere.

885
01:25:23,388 --> 01:25:25,446
A soldier goes to
the end of their mission.

886
01:25:25,446 --> 01:25:27,435
Even if that
it costs life.

887
01:25:27,435 --> 01:25:29,295
That is called honor.

888
01:25:29,295 --> 01:25:32,292
It is a notion that it is
strange in their neighborhoods, right?

889
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:38,522
Yes, it is true, we prefer
another concept: the family.

890
01:25:38,739 --> 01:25:40,732
Which unites us
between us.

891
01:25:40,732 --> 01:25:42,518
Which protects us.

892
01:25:42,766 --> 01:25:43,967
Which we believe.

893
01:25:43,967 --> 01:25:46,636
Yes, will be joining.
I am going to mourn.

894
01:25:47,324 --> 01:25:48,644
And die together.

895
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:51,253
Come on, just fuck!
And you, where are you?

896
01:25:51,253 --> 01:25:56,201
Calm down, I just a. .. go, was
surely there would be a snuff.

897
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,292
Leave it.

898
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:01,481
Tomaso ¡!

899
01:26:03,793 --> 01:26:06,237
For my collection.

900
01:26:25,822 --> 01:26:28,499
This is a good wallpaper,
Sir.

901
01:26:28,949 --> 01:26:30,440
A gift.

902
01:26:34,317 --> 01:26:35,923
Gentlemen.

903
01:26:38,177 --> 01:26:40,213
Miss, excuse me.

904
01:26:40,961 --> 01:26:44,362
I do not know what to say.

905
01:26:45,922 --> 01:26:48,283
Thank you, thank you very much.

906
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:52,520
I owe you much.

907
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:55,629
I think the whole france
owes much.

908
01:26:57,351 --> 01:27:00,735
Well, I guess you do not believe
much to the politicians but ...

909
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:04,250
I assure you that ...
the next 48 hours ...

910
01:27:04,237 --> 01:27:07,250
... I will do whatever it can to
unlock the previous laws ...

911
01:27:08,085 --> 01:27:10,063
... for your sector
back to ...

912
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:13,817
... all his dignity and a place
prominent in our society.

913
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:18,144
Thank you.

914
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:21,593
- I have a question, Mr. President.
- Tell me.

915
01:27:22,312 --> 01:27:25,361
Instead of spending a fortune
hiding the rotten ...

916
01:27:25,361 --> 01:27:27,457
... Why not
start again?

917
01:27:27,457 --> 01:27:29,209
What do you mean?

918
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:31,370
A real neighborhood.

919
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:32,977
A real city.

920
01:27:32,977 --> 01:27:35,385
With green
and places to work.

921
01:27:35,824 --> 01:27:37,724
I agree.

922
01:27:37,724 --> 01:27:42,511
Damian, appoint him responsible for
this project through implementation.

923
01:27:44,936 --> 01:27:46,980
Well, Mr. President.

924
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:50,977
You have my word, and
as the word of my government.

925
01:27:51,178 --> 01:27:53,407
And the word of man?

926
01:27:54,271 --> 01:27:56,203
And my word of man.

927
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,116
Sir?

928
01:27:59,727 --> 01:28:02,734
- It's OK for me.
- Me too.

929
01:28:03,121 --> 01:28:04,649
Too.

930
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:05,859
Clear.

931
01:28:05,859 --> 01:28:07,781
Yes

932
01:28:08,649 --> 01:28:10,090
Well.

933
01:29:23,534 --> 01:29:26,381
Well, that's better
que las mías.

934
01:29:32,072 --> 01:29:34,901
Everything is for the better.
