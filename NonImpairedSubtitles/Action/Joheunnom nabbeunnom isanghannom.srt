1
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,194
Pay attention!

2
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,101
Ah, yes sir.

3
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,110
Take this map to Kanemaru now

4
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,010
And bring me the promised money.

5
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,276
What is this, sir?

6
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,084
If Kanemaru wants this,
it must be something big.

7
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,587
Watch that mouth of yours!

8
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:38,387
If word gets out,
bandits will be hounding all over it.

9
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,097
Make sure word doesn't get out.

10
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,181
They're in the independence army, too?

11
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,080
Do you know Park Chang-yi?

12
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,090
He's in on this, too?

13
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:08,987
Yes.

14
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:20,500
All you have to do is give this map
to Kanemaru.

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,105
Chang-yi will see to the rest.

16
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:29,709
Kanemaru will be on the train to
North Manchuria with a map.

17
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,580
That map is very important to us.
We need it.

18
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,985
And why should I help you?

19
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,586
'Cuz there's money in it.

20
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,289
It depends on the amount.

21
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,293
What's the reward money
on Park Chang-yi's head?

22
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,490
Will that be enough?

23
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,099
Not bad.

24
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,896
We have no other choice
but to pay you to do this.

25
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,103
So don't screw up.

26
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,706
Yes, sir.

27
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,277
Remember!

28
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,883
You've never set eyes on that map,
understood?

29
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,888
Of course, sir.

30
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,289
Now, go.

31
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:24,495
Yourjob is to get on the train.

32
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,004
And steal the map back
from Kanemaru.

33
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:32,908
We get paid and the map back.
Everyone's happy.

34
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,383
Manchurian soldiers are escorting him.
Be careful.

35
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,984
Are you worried, sir?

36
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,582
Of course not.

37
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,885
I know what you're capable of.

38
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,087
You're the best in all of Manchuria.

39
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,400
Just Manchuria?

40
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,498
Best in Manchuria means best
on the continent.

41
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,505
Forgive me, I'm not good
with words.

42

45
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,992
Bandits don't need train tickets.

46
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,695
Then?

47
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,305

Maybe Manchuria...

146

could be the Maritimes Province.

somewhere in Manchuria.

once then suddenly vanished!

the Ghost Market for it.

No way. They wouldn't dare!

169

00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,583
Russia...

175
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,891
Border...

176
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,596
Treasure...

177
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,497
Absolutely no idea.

178
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,810
Who's there?

179
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,495
Hold on.

180
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,573
What should we do?

181
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,183
Who is it?

182
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,981
It's me, Byung-choon.

183
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,088
Byung-choon?

184
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:28,692
What the!

185
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:29,987
You freak!

186
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,192
Get out!

187
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,892
Sorry! Sorry!

188
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,195
Don't move!

189
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,695
Get out!

190
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:30,881
Shit!

191
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:30,577
What happened? Tell me!
Where's the map?

192
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,178
Hurry up and give it to me.

193
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:37,983
Before I do...

194
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,192
You must pay your dues.

195
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,289
Ah, right.

196
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,283
What do you think you're doing?

197
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,597
I should've known. Fine.

198
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,192
I'll give you what you want.
Just give me the map.

199
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,089
Crazy bastard!

200
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:59,399
You've got some nerve for someone
who's hired to kill!

201
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,198
Gone insane over money!

202
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,005
You won'thless son of a bitch.

203
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,806
I took you in when you were
wandering around drunk.

204
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,676
I saved your sorry life!

205
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,986
I wanted to end this nicely,
but now you give me no choice.

206
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,897
No matter how notorious
of a ruthless killer you are,

207
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,899
you can't dodge a bullet.

208
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,895
A bastard who kisses the asses
of traitors...

209
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,406
What a pitiful end you'II...

210
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,606
Funny, ain't it?

211
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:16,780
People must know
they'll all die someday.

212
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,580
But they live as if they never will.

213
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,188
Damn funny.

214
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,788
Well, well...

215
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,595
You lived long enough.

216
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,798
Selling off your country.

217
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,499
We found out, sir

218
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,198
It's the Ghost Market thugs
and Park Do-won.

219
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,498
Knowing I, Park Chang-yi,
would be after it?

220
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,903
Yes, sir. But...

221
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,004
Looks like Park Do-won
was after you, sir.

222
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,978
The Ghost Market?

223
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,180
It's a market for stolen goods.

224
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,992
There was a gunfight last night.

225
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,593
The fool who stole the map ran away
to the Ghost Market.

226
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,708
He'll probably sell it there.

227
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,104
How many men can we round up?

228
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,608
About a dozen, sir.

229
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,778
Get the boys and go
to the Ghost Market!

230
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,385
Pack it up.

231
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,383
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

232
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,800
Come in. Cheap prices!

233
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,709
Good lantern, sir?

234
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,302
Come in and look around.

235
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,890
Umbrellas for sale!

236
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,687
Out of my way!

237
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,594
Umbrellas!

238
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:30,887
Granny?

239
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,990
You sure do live long.

240
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,495
You'll probably outlive me.

241
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,799
What happened last night?

242
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,206
Byung-choon came after me.

243
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,809
The idiot even said his name
before shooting.

244
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,708
Why?
For the map?

245
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,479
Probably.

246
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,083
So did you find out anything?

247
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,380
It's gotta be
the Qing Dynasty treasure map.

248
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:01,890
Not only the bandits
but the Japanese army's after it.

249
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,195
Let me see it.

250
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,998
There's gotta be somethir...

251
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,478
Forget it! Give it back.

252
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,981
Hold on! I know this!

253
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:33,281
This is the Russian Empire...

254
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,886
Alexand...

255
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,493
Sand? Desert?

256
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,094
Alexander.

257
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,294
What's that?

258
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,197
- Give it to me!
- I know what I'm doing!

259
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:47,895
Next word is...

260
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,099
'Buried'.

261
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,309
It says, 'Buried'!

262
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,208
Like a buried treasure?

263
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,575
That's right!

264
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,077
Then it says...

265
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,184
'Excavatior!

266
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,876
Ex-vacation? What's that?

267
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,077
It means dig up.

268
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,586
Then...

269
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,286
'In large... volumes'?

270
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:14,196
Then this all means, buried, dig up,
in large volumes?

271
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,401
Hold on!

272
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,698
- Are you sellir it?
- Nope.

273
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:20,895
You crazy?

274
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,300
The Ghost Market thugs are after this.
The word will get out quick.

275
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:29,903
The chief here will probably give 'ya
at least 1000 won.

276
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,276
You idiot!

277
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,078
This could be won'th millions!

278
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,880
Are you out of your mind?

279
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,579
The reward on your head
is 300 won.

280
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,883
What?

281
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,885
I'm only won'th a piano?

282
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:42,993
A used one at that.

283
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,488
They think I'm just a petty thief?

284
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,896
You, Mr. Train Robber,
ARE a petty thief.

285
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:55,199
Let's just sell it at the
Ghost Market for 1000 won.

286
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:59,002
Forget it. I'm gonna see
if this is won'th gold or shit.

287
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,912
Granny! Granny!

288
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,776
Know what this is?

289
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,084
It's a treasure map!

290
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,984
If we find the treasure,
it's goodbye to this for us.

291
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,582
We'll eat all we want
and live in luxury!

292
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,695
Where do you wanna go?
America?

293
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,595
Where else? France?

294
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,997
En toi, c'est dah di dah.
Je t'aime, moi non plus?

295
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,009
What?

296
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,409
Damn! Shit!

297
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,577
Shit! I told 'ya they're fast!

298
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:41,685
Where are they?

299
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,280
Out the window?

300
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,195
Get out! Hurry!

301
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,502
Get Granny!

302
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,304
Granny! Granny!

303
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,299
Those bastards!

304
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,203
Run!

305
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,312
Bastard!

306
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,982
Granny!

307
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,278
It's not safe here.

308
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:57,987
They went that way!

309
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,295
Stay right here.

310
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:09,202
Don't lose this
and don't show it to anyone.

311
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:16,775
Even if Man-gil asks,
tell him you never saw the map.

312
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:18,877
Damn!

313
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,278
Watch Granny!

314
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,401
Hey! Move!

315
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,789
- The Ghost Market Gang is coming!
- Get back!

316
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,295
Damn sons of bitches!

317
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:37,979
Yoon Tae-goo, age 35,
300 won reward.

318
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,882
What are you saying?

319
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,085
I don't speak Korean.

320
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,189
You're Chinese, are 'ya?

321
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,797
No! Please! Stop!

322
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:49,890
I knew it was you.

323
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,206
You have the map, don't you?

324
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,175
Who are you?

325
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,978
Yes or no.
Just answer the question.

326
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,183
You're after the map, too?

327
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,687
Damn bastards.

328
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,591
I did, but not now.
So there!

329
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,199
Where is it?

330
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:28,293
Use your brain, fool.

331
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,102
I'm in this shit 'cuz of that map.

332
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,902
You think I'd just go and tell 'ya?

333
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,680
The independence army wants it,
not me.

334
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,076
Independence army, my ass.

335
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,277
Think I'd fall for that?

336
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,786
Talking doesn't get through
to 'ya, does it!

337
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,393
Wait!

338
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,190
Okay! Okay!

339
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,295
I've got an offer for 'ya.

340
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,294
I don't make deals with scoundrels.

341
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,503
I'll tell you a big secret
about that map.

342
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,004
You know what it says?

343
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:15,373
'Treasure, Buried,
Dig up, Large volumes'.

344
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:16,681
What?

345
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,685
That's what it says on it!

346
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,992
It's a treasure map!

347
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,398
So you and me can go find it!

348
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:34,197
If there's a treasure,
we split it 60-40.

349
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,805
Me 60, you 40.

350
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,308
How 'bout it?

351
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,277
That's how you
make a deal, man!

352
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:54,086
Did 'ya say your name was
Park Do-won?

353
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,284
You must've heard of who I am.

354
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,986
Of course you did.

355
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:03,190
Then do you know the Ghost Market?
My boys there will...

356
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:06,996
- Hey!
- Sorry.

357
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,798
You crazy bastard!

358
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:12,500
You evil son of a bitch!

359
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:16,602
I've never seen a Korean
so mean and vicious!

360
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,683
You can't do this to me, man!

361
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,079
How old are 'ya!

362
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,185
You little...

363
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,305
Hey, Yoon Tae-goo.

364
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,678
Don't even think about escaping.

365
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,582
Give me some water.

366
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,978
What did you catch this time?

367
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,185
What's this?

368
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:05,493
Get some sleep.
You got a rough day ahead.

369
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,296
Get me some water, girlie.

370
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,403
It can talk?

371
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,200
Water, please.

372
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,080
<i>- Song-yi!</i>
- Coming!

373
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,887
But...

374
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,211
Going somewhere?

375
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,177
Escaping?

376
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,478
No, of course not.

377
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:48,890
I just gave it a tug
and itjust fell out.

378
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,791
You folks
shouldn't be so careless.

379
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,092
Fine. Go back in and sleep.

380
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:05,406
Hey, it's raining!

381
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,389
Boss?

382
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,604
We saw Yoon Tae-goo, today.

383
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,975
He's the one who took the map.

384
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,191
Just as you wanted.

385
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,794
Everyone's happy, huh?

386
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:17,395
I get money.
You get the map.

387
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,805
And the original's safe where it is.

388
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:25,478
If this map is wrong...

389
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:28,675
...or there's no treasure,

390
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,878
then I'll find you.

391
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:35,383
And make sure you get buried alive.

392
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,095
That's no way
to talk to an old pal.

393
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,577
Look at what they did to my place.

394
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,086
Man-gil, that idiot.
Where the hell is Man-gil, the fool.

395
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,190
Granny!

396
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,684
Granny?

397
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,672
Granny!

398
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:33,976
Granny!

399
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:35,582
Granny!

400
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,084
Damn! You scared me!

401
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,381
You slept in here all this time?

402
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,891
Damn Man-gil!
Told him to watch Granny...

403
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,791
Where's the map, Granny?

404
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,693
Where'd you put it?

405
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,499
Where is it?

406
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,704
No, not candy!

407
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,102
The big map I gave you.

408
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,298
The map!

409
00:52:58,441 --> 00:52:59,601
Just once.

410
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:03,110
Once?
Did someone take it?

411
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:04,975
Who did you give it to?

412
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,381
Let go.
Man-gil?

413
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,481
Did he take the map?

414
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,495
I had to come and see you.

415
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,493
Do I know you?

416
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:26,897
You're alone?

417
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,898
Yoon Tae-goo's a friend
of yours, right?

418
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,501
Where is he?

419
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,505
And who might you be?

420
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,676
I'm Park Chang-yi.

421
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,984
Park Chang-yi?

422
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,279
You bastard!

423
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,892
Help me!

424
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,104
Tae-goo...

425
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,872
Tae-goo...

426
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:25,081
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?

427
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,891
- Give me another knife!
- Yes, sir.

428
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:42,598
I have a message.

429
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,298
A message for Tae-goo.

430
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,486
So stay calm.

431
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,883
And listen up.

432
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,791
Tae-goo!

433
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,688
Got it?

434
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,178
This blade's blunt!
Sharpen it!

435
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,782
Hurry up!

436
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,983
Damn rain...

437
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,983
What! Run!

438
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:36,787
Retreat! Retreat!

439
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:48,997
This way!

440
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,212
Man-gil!

441
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:59,276
Man-gil!

442
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,483
Stay right here, okay?

443
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:24,704
Shit!

444
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:31,177
You! Run to the other side.

445
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,179
So I can see
where they're shooting from.

446
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,385
Why should I be the one?

447
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,985
Then who else?

448
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:56,201
Should I run straight on?

449
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:00,105
Or zigzag around
and make 'em confused?

450
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,779
Fine. I'll decide.

451
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,704
Hey! Come here!

452
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:33,709
Follow me!

453
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,088
Give me a gun, man!

454
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,195
Hey!

455
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,192
Give me my gun back!

456
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,280
Do-won! Where're 'ya going?

457
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,483
Come back!

458
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,288
Give me my gun!

459
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,488
Where are you going?

460
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,992
Come on! Give me my gun!

461
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,790
Gun! Now! Do-won!

462
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:59,688
Gun...

463
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,000
Shit...

464
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,703
Man-gil! Man-gil!

465
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:51,573
Man-gil!

466
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:57,586
<i>Man-gil!</i>

467
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,183
Man-gil!

468
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:04,886
<i>Man-gil!</i>

469
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:25,972
Over here!

470
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,393
Whatch out!

471
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,679
Watch out!

472
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,683
What the!

473
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,690
- Cover me!
- Get back!

474
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,879
Get the horses!

475
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:11,573
Are you Korean?

476
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,076
Yes.

477
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,884
Is Yoon Tae-goo in your gang?

478
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:23,088
You think we'd mix
with a schmuck like him?

479
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,289
Damn! That way!

480
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:32,099
When our gang gets here,
you're all dead!

481
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,005
Yoon Tae-goo.

482
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,007
Park Chang-yi.

483
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:16,971
So we meet, here.

484
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:33,892
This is awesome
but why's it so damn heavy?
