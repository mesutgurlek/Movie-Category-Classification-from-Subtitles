1
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:38,454
They called him Machete.

2
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:41,501
Selling the harsh day for the hard one.

3
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,129
100 for ruffin.

4
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:45,675
Get in.

5
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,720
125 for accepting.

6
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:49,766
So which?

7
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,562
Have you ever killed anyone before?

8
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,106
As you may know

9
00:00:54,106 --> 00:00:55,902
illegal aliens such as yourself

10
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:57,529
are being forced out of our country

11
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,906
at an alarming rate.

12
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:00,952
For the good of other people.

13
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,831
Our new senator must die.

14
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,254
And for that I will pay you $150,000.

15
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:09,008
Cash.

16
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:12,723
He was given an offer he couldn't refuse.

17
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,227
I cost the most.

18
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,315
Cause I'm the best there is.

19
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:28,667
Set up. Double crossed.

20
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:30,796
And left for dead.

21
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:33,300
I took a vow of peace.

22
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:37,265
And now you want me to help
you kill all these men?

23
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:38,392
Yes, bro.

24
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:41,022
I mean paltry.

25
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:43,902
So what I can do?

26
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:53,544
He knows the score.

27
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:57,175
Where are my wife and daughter?

28
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,429
He gets the women.

29
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,274
And he kills the bad guys.

30
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:11,784
You know that a Mexican day-labor

31
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:14,664
is a goddam federal?

32
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,294
But they soon realize.

33
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,922
He's coming after us.

34
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,388
They just fucked with the wrong Mexican.

35
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:28,105
Action.

36
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,068
Suspense.

37
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:35,451
Emotion.

38
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,705
Please father, have mercy.

39
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:40,751
God has mercy, I don't.

40
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:45,927
If you're gonna hire Machete
to kill the bad guy

41
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:49,893
You better make damn sure the bad guy

42
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,353
... isn't you.

43
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,612
Machete.

44
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,409
Rated X.

45
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,462
Brought to you from your friends
at the Weinstein Company.

46
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:44,636
The roofer is in the house.

47
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,223
God damn it, girls.

48
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,102
If you're gonna do that shit, do it on stage.

49
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:51,940
Smoking hot.

50
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:59,496
Cherry darling, I told you too
many fucking times.

51
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:02,042
You can't be up there crying
and all that shit.

52
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,128
You know what go-go dance is?

53
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,049
Useless talent No. 12?

54
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,927
No. It's a happy dance.

55
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,811
You're up there and you dance happy.
It's go go. Not cry cry.

56
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:14,605
I'm quitting.

57
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,817
You say that at least one night a week.

58
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,445
I mean it this time.

59
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,162
I need a dramatic change in my life.

60
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:24,707
I've always said you're funny.

61
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,461
But if you don't stop all that crying and shit
I might have to fire your fucking ass.

62
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:30,091
And I don't wanna fire your ass 'cause
I love looking at your ass.

63
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,138
Any girl leaving early
must check out with their finger

64
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:35,141
and have a bye-bye slip.

65
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:38,814
Here is my finger.

66
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:44,157
And here is my bye-bye slip.

67
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,537
Dick.

68
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,931
All right boys. Come on.

69
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:55,114
All right. All right.
Come on.

70
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,629
Wait here, Lieutenant.

71
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:05,257
I'll handle this.

72
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,182
Hey, Abby.

73
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,817
I can see you've had a spot of trouble, Romey.

74
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:19,699
Would you like to tell me what happened?

75
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:21,119
They escaped.

76
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,457
All three?

77
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:26,461
Yeah.

78
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,172
I don't know...

79
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:29,717
I don't know how they did it.
Just... They got out...

80
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,930
I'm sorry, Romey.
But I just don't trust you anymore.

81
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:35,561
And you know the rules.

82
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:39,400
I'm out. I swear, Abby. I'm..

83
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,778
You're not gonna see me anymore.

84
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:43,073
Not so fast.

85
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,878
I also want your balls.

86
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:01,355
I'm really quite attached to them.

87
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:02,941
Oh, sweetheart.

88
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,822
I was really attached to my specimens.

89
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:08,951
Now they're out there
in the night doing God knows what.

90
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,790
I can't do it Abby. Please..
Please, Abby.

91
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:20,055
Let me go you fuckers.
Son of a bitch. Abby!

92
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,434
Listen. You don't need, Abby.

93
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:25,397
There's more.
There's more I can get you all you'll ever need.

94
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:29,112
Fucking fuzzy.
Let me go you son of a bitch.

95
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,614
I can get you more. No!

96
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:44,431
Pick this up please.

97
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:21,162
Where is the shit?

98
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:24,167
The shit's right there.

99
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,629
The deal is still good.

100
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:29,134
No.

101
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,804
It's not.

102
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,475
Hell down on me.

103
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:36,563
Now I want all of it.

104
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,654
Looks like I got you by the balls, Abby.

105
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:07,159
So.

106
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:11,499
I ask you one more time.

107
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,171
Where's...

108
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:16,383
the...

109
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:18,720
...shit?

110
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,267
Everywhere.

111
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,341
Ah, bulls.

112
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,629
Get that thing away from my pumps.

113
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:51,299
It's just overheating.

114
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:55,556
I need to get to town.

115
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:00,858
It's just a stripped radiator cab.

116
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,781
Water leaks when the heat's up.

117
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:07,995
No pressure.

118
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:13,630
Are you OK?

119
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,258
I'm just Cherry.

120
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:18,848
Wanna have a seat anywhere?
I'll be right in.

121
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,522
Here. Take this with you.

122
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:25,525
Not your good spring water?

123
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:28,197
Ain't nothing good about it.
Bottled myself.

124
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:30,451
I get it right there out of them.

125
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:32,746
Thanks...

126
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:33,915
JT.

127
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,294
We're serving inside tonight.

128
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:38,590
Best barbecue in Texas.
Round the clock.

129
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:39,842
I gotta go.

130
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:42,221
Saving lives? Are you?

131
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,809
How did you know that?

132
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:55,536
Now that's a rump roast.

133
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:02,715
I couldn't get off work this week.

134
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,178
But you only have to stay till ten.

135
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:09,644
A friend of mine will be here before
ten to pick up Tony.

136
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:12,482
I'm gonna eat your brains and
gain your knowledge.

137
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,862
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

138
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:16,991
Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

139
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:22,416
There's a packed suitcase under his bed.

140
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:27,801
Give it to Tony to take with
him when my friend picks him up.

141
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,187
I'll leave him watching TV.

142
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,320
But you need to be here in
the next 20 minutes.

143
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,072
Thank you.

144
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:45,833
Hey, what happened to your tooth?
- Fell out.

145
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:49,964
Say a prayer for your old man.

146
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,805
"No dead bodies for Dada tonight."

147
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:56,101
No dead bodies for Daddy tonight.

148
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:57,854
Amen.
- Amen.

149
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,075
Who was that you were talking to?
- Baby-sitter.

150
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,454
She's on her way.

151
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,778
How's it going, JT?
- All right.

152
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:52,742
Still open I see.
- Oh yeah. All night.

153
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:59,086
Free of charge.
Tonight is a special night.

154
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:02,383
What's so special about tonight?

155
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,345
Been open 25 years.

156
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,475
You're the second person
to show up tonight.

157
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:08,978
Who's the first?

158
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:10,606
Right there.

159
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:18,286
Must be passing through.

160
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,790
Seems only strangers eat here.

161
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,838
I still eat here, JT.

162
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,049
Yeah, you sure do.

163
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,138
By the way don't choke on
all that food you eat.

164
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,323
Hello, Palomita.

165
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,248
I don't go by that name any more.

166
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,628
So

167
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:50,176
You will become that fancy doctor?

168
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:53,890
Never did.

169
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:58,356
Thought for sure you would.

170
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:01,361
Talked about it enough.

171
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:02,906
That's the problem with goals.

172
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:06,495
They become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

173
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,997
That's my jacket.

174
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,545
I looked for it for 2 weeks.

175
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,966
Yeah? How long did you look for me, Wray?

176
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,764
Only the jacket belonged to me, you didn't.

177
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,598
So.

178
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,895
What are you doing now?

179
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,527
I'm going to be a stand up comedian.

180
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:28,325
Really?

181
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:32,791
You're not funny.

182
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,714
That's what I have been
trying to tell everybody.

183
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:38,885
But they all say I'm hysterical.

184
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,014
But you are not.

185
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,854
There is a difference between being frank

186
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,983
... and being dick.

187
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:48,652
Yeah.

188
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,487
Well.

189
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,283
It was really good seeing you again.

190
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:56,750
What name do you go by now?

191
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:59,129
In case I wanna catch one of your shows.

192
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,173
Cherry.

193
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,011
Cherry Darling.

194
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:06,100
It sounds like a stripper.

195
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:09,523
No, it sounds like a Go Go Dancer.
There's a difference.

196
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:16,869
You'll always be Palomita to me.

197
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:23,338
I need a ride.

198
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:28,556
What do you say, El Wray?

199
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:33,272
I'll give you a ride.

200
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:38,281
Goodbye, Bill.

201
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:39,867
Which means 'See you later' ?

202
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:40,911
Of course.

203
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,669
What's up, Doc?

204
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:49,175
Your lady's looking pretty
good there. We're gonna see..

205
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:51,178
See if she could suck
the bend out of a river.

206
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:52,598
I'm kidding.

207
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:55,186
Take a look at that shit.

208
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:57,230
What happened to your arm?

209
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:58,567
I got bit.

210
00:19:58,608 --> 00:19:59,359
Bit?

211
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:00,946
Bit by what?

212
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:04,326
Well... If I told you, you probably
wouldn't believe me.

213
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,040
Some bacterium or something?

214
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,380
Can you just sew it up?

215
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,718
Normally, I would.

216
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,557
I'd even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

217
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,851
My problem is this one doesn't bleed.

218
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:20,813
Oh shit, check this out.

219
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:25,697
When this was still a military hospital,
this one guy came back from Iraq with this.

220
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,784
Chronic herpetic lesions.

221
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:30,831
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here.

222
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,083
Kind of like a fountain.

223
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,836
Ah, Jesus.

224
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,382
How did you treat it?

225
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:39,095
Fuck that, I was never in Iraq.

226
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:39,847
Good for you.

227
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,934
This shit they spread around
there you wouldn't believe.

228
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:43,687
I swear to God I've got some Iraqi eye-balls

229
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:45,816
a friend of mine brought back
to make some studies on.

230
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:47,945
Incredible.
They were completely milked over.

231
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,368
Mustard gas does it to the eyes.
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

232
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:54,247
Spots fly you think?

233
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:58,755
Chronic viral lesion.
That looks like gout.

234
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,929
He's running a temperature of 105.

235
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,556
Is that bad?
- It's high.

236
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:06,101
Bad would be 108.

237
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:09,189
You could have a seizure, go psychotic.

238
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,735
And probably die.

239
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,699
Say ahh.
- Ahhh.

240
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,703
Ugh! Jesus!

241
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,914
Nice.

242
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:20,000
Black abscess tongue.

243
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,504
All abscesses should be drained. Period.

244
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:32,940
Shut up, Joe.

245
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:44,752
Baby.

246
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:47,048
Get the needles.

247
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:50,136
Right there.

248
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:54,477
Right now.
- Asshole.

249
00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:04,119
It's spreading.

250
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:08,794
When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

251
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:10,923
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

252
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:12,509
Lose arm? What do
you mean lose arm? My arm?

253
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:14,095
It's spreading all the way
up to your shoulder.

254
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:17,059
Now if we don't sever that arm now
it's gonna take over your chest.

255
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,978
We can't very well cut that off, can we?

256
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,107
Well shouldn't I get a second opinion?

257
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:22,317
Hi Joe.

258
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:27,201
I'm going to give you a very
strong anesthetic.

259
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:29,956
So you don't feel anything
during the procedure.

260
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,377
These are my friends.

261
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,338
My yellow friend

262
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,928
Is just to take the sting off.

263
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:40,725
My blue friend

264
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:42,937
You'll barely feel.

265
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:46,568
That means my yellow friend
has already taken effect.

266
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:49,282
See how fast my friends work?

267
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:53,038
And after my red-headed friend

268
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,128
You'll never see me again.

269
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,019
We all react differently.

270
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:11,988
Now what?

271
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:15,953
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia.
In loving memory.

272
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,520
It's not the radiator.

273
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:56,775
What? Fucking pale.
Cheap.

274
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:12,761
Hey!

275
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,850
Bastard.

276
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:31,961
Hey, stop.

277
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:50,285
Stop!

278
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,663
Stop please.

279
00:25:14,452 --> 00:25:16,122
What the hell was that?

280
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,671
People picking up road kill.

281
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,382
What? Like an armadillo?

282
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:24,094
Deer.

283
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,726
There are a lot of them around here.

284
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,772
You know I read a statistic that said

285
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:35,655
That the eating of venison
has risen 30 percent in the last few years.

286
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:38,745
Sixty percent of that's from road kill.

287
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,040
People eat road kill?

288
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,545
If you're driving out here
at 70 miles an hour...

289
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,089
... and a deer darts out in front of you

290
00:25:45,297 --> 00:25:48,637
If you blink or brake or swerve ...

291
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,432
Sure you'll just kill yourself.

292
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,934
So what do you do?

293
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:53,562
Pick them off.

294
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:55,190
Just like this.

295
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:57,068
Send them flying away from you.

296
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,237
Unacceptable.

297
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:17,854
Cherry?

298
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:23,406
I thought you said if you saw a deer
you shouldn't fucking swerve.

299
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,992
That wasn't a deer.

300
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,309
Palomita.

301
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:08,861
Don't let her die on me, Block.

302
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,196
What we got?
- Car accident.

303
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:14,579
Heavy contusions about the torso,
possible spinal trauma.

304
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:17,000
One severed limb.

305
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:18,961
Where is the leg?

306
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,257
Three 'psychos' attacked her.

307
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:23,261
I shot at them.

308
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,974
I never miss.

309
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,234
They took the leg with them.

310
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:46,134
You have to come with us Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know.

311
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:47,636
He has to sign her in.

312
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:48,555
Do what now?

313
00:27:48,555 --> 00:27:51,017
If he's with her,
he's responsible for her.

314
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,814
He'll fill this out after we talk. Let's go.

315
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:59,282
What were you doing with a rifle, Wray?

316
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:00,284
Nothing.

317
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:03,497
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

318
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:04,749
Come on, Wray.

319
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,755
You know you are not supposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

320
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:10,009
Here, I stick my neck out for you.

321
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:13,807
Now you've got a girl in your
wrecked truck with a missing leg?

322
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:16,020
A missing leg? It's now missing?

323
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,024
And here you're saying in front of everybody

324
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:19,943
that someone up and snatched it?

325
00:28:19,943 --> 00:28:21,404
And that you shot at 'em with a gun

326
00:28:21,404 --> 00:28:23,825
that you never should
have had in the first place?

327
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:25,328
And that now they're gone?

328
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,916
Sheriff, can we finish this
conversation somewhere else?

329
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,501
My thought exactly.

330
00:28:29,752 --> 00:28:33,300
Dr. Block. Three fresh ones rolling in.

331
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:34,427
Christ, you're kidding.

332
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:36,806
Automobile accident off Highway 18.

333
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:38,476
DOA's?

334
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,479
Get Andy to pick them up.

335
00:28:41,397 --> 00:28:43,276
That's unsanitary, Doc.

336
00:28:43,693 --> 00:28:45,864
It helps me monitor my state of calmness.

337
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:48,618
If you get worked up enough to crack it.

338
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,666
You might cut yourself pretty good.

339
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:53,794
Then I'd know I was not calm.

340
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,393
What do you say now, Doc?

341
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:05,231
Somebody call my wife.

342
00:29:07,944 --> 00:29:09,363
It's JT, Sheriff.

343
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:11,950
JT? How is the barbecue business?

344
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:15,206
Ever since my bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's going shit.

345
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:17,085
Well, I'm sorry to hear about that.

346
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:18,838
I wish there was something I could do.

347
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:21,509
Right now I ain't calling my brother.
I'm calling the sheriff.

348
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,975
What's the trouble?
- It ain't no trouble, not yet anyway.

349
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,606
I've got two delinquents been hanging
around here for over an hour.

350
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:32,194
They won't purchase.
They won't leave.

351
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,115
Oh never mind, here they come.

352
00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:37,454
You cook that meat at 250 degrees, don't you?

353
00:29:37,913 --> 00:29:40,375
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

354
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:43,464
You give me that recipe or I'll raise your
rent higher than Georgia pine.

355
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,177
Brother, ain't no Texans ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.

356
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:48,098
That's a fact. He'd take it to his grave.

357
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:50,852
I could be bleeding like a
stuck pig I ain't gonna tell you.

358
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:54,192
I could be dying in your arms,
I ain't gonna tell you.

359
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:56,487
We'll see about that.

360
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:01,161
You gonna look?

361
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:03,750
Or you gonna eat?

362
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:13,642
You called for me?

363
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:16,063
I need for you to see this.

364
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,611
Looks like a no-brainer.

365
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:20,821
What does that mean?

366
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:21,907
No brain.

367
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:25,120
Scooped clean out of her skull.

368
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:27,207
.. don't...

369
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:28,459
Don't tell me.

370
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:30,088
Liquifactive necrosis.

371
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:33,009
Do you think?
- Oh sure.

372
00:30:33,468 --> 00:30:35,305
Thank you, that'll be all.

373
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:51,208
Did you know she was back in town?

374
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:54,004
No.

375
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:56,759
I didn't.

376
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:04,064
What happened to her?

377
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:07,110
I don't know baby.

378
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,916
I thought you stopped seeing each other.

379
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,422
Oh yeah.

380
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:22,804
Yes, you have now. She's fucking dead.

381
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,728
I mean we stopped before.

382
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,160
I haven't talked to her in a while.

383
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,337
But you've written each other.

384
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:46,638
Here and there.

385
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,017
But nothing.

386
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,604
What are you doing?

387
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:53,942
Let me see your last three messages.

388
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:57,950
You have no right ...
- I don't?

389
00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:02,541
I don't have a right?

390
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:08,384
Show it to me.

391
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,302
No.

392
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:14,228
Now that's just to take the sting off.

393
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:18,944
Show it to me.

394
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:20,781
No please.

395
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,204
Show it to me.

396
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:31,174
Now let's see how fast your friends work.

397
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:43,780
It's pretty fast.

398
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,207
What do I know, my love?

399
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:51,877
Exactly.

400
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,423
That you're a cheating ...

401
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:56,051
lying...

402
00:32:58,722 --> 00:32:59,766
... sack.

403
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:02,061
I didn't want to hurt you.

404
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,649
But you did.

405
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,319
Because...

406
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,533
You're insane.

407
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:13,332
And I was afraid.

408
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:17,172
Of what you might do to me.

409
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:18,966
And to our son.

410
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,180
I'm the mother of your son.

411
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,818
And after this one

412
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:33,032
I'll never see you again.

413
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:47,975
Block.

414
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,353
What?

415
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:52,691
You've gotta see this.

416
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:54,612
I'll be right there.

417
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:07,426
Where the hell are the bodies?

418
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:09,429
That's what we wanted to show you.

419
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,806
They are gone.

420
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,605
They didn't just get up and walk out, did they?

421
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:07,406
Somebody take care of this
perp for me before I fucking kill him.

422
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,202
What the hell is going on?
- He was causing a ruckus over at Skip's place.

423
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:11,496
So I cuffed him.

424
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:14,711
Son of a bitch.
He bit my goddamn finger off.

425
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:17,632
Quit your hollering and get
yourself a goddamn band-aid.

426
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,303
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff!

427
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:22,599
He bit my finger clean off.

428
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:24,311
Shit.

429
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:25,353
Get him.

430
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:26,147
Book him.

431
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:28,025
Cause I'll fucking kill him if I have to do it.

432
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,069
Carlos.

433
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:30,321
Go get him.

434
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:31,782
Wray.

435
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:34,703
You stay put.

436
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,243
Are you sure he is in there?

437
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:58,787
He was.

438
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,542
Motherfucker.

439
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,768
He's gone.

440
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,148
Broke out the window.

441
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:39,692
Where's my finger?

442
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:41,779
Found your ring.

443
00:36:41,987 --> 00:36:44,660
Could be the same guy as
your leg snatcher?

444
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,831
I didn't get a good look at mine.

445
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:53,133
Is that him over there?

446
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:47,936
Wray?

447
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,570
No. Don't touch him.

448
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:41,572
Why not?

449
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:42,991
He is infected.

450
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,493
With what?

451
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:45,620
Everything.

452
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:46,872
Wray!

453
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,584
Drop the fucking gun.

454
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,683
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

455
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:59,603
I'm gonna go and get Cherry.

456
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:00,480
Fine.

457
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:02,316
But we're taking my car.

458
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm riding with you.

459
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,085
Don't make any sudden moves.

460
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:27,319
Viral infections.

461
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:29,948
They came pouring in.

462
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:33,496
Some are rapidly developing
colophony lesions.

463
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,458
Highly contagious.

464
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,670
What do you think?

465
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:40,759
Self-preservation comes to mind.

466
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,052
Yeah.

467
00:39:42,177 --> 00:39:44,181
Just get the hell out of here.

468
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:47,354
First let me get my wife.

469
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:55,807
I love you sweetie.

470
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:57,726
There you go.

471
00:40:58,103 --> 00:40:58,853
Come on.

472
00:40:58,853 --> 00:40:59,605
C'mon.

473
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:00,857
Open up, dear.

474
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:03,695
I want you to be around for a while.
You understand?

475
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:09,038
Damn.

476
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:10,666
Mom.

477
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,882
You fart like a goddam pack mule.

478
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:20,726
I hate to do this to you, Earl.
But we need every man on the job.

479
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:22,729
The shit has hit the fan.

480
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:27,278
We need some guns and ammo.
Meet me at my brother's.

481
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,449
I got you. I'll be there.

482
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:33,080
Gotta eat quick, sweetie.

483
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:33,914
C'mon.

484
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:23,836
Oh my God!

485
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:22,688
What the hell is going on?

486
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,697
Are you gonna give me a gun?

487
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:29,909
Are you fucking kidding me?

488
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:38,404
Palomita.

489
00:44:42,453 --> 00:44:44,331
Get up. We're leaving.

490
00:44:44,456 --> 00:44:45,583
I can't walk.

491
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:46,669
So what?

492
00:44:47,044 --> 00:44:47,754
Get up.

493
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:48,547
Get up!

494
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:52,679
Motherfucker.

495
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:54,265
Look at me.

496
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,060
Look at me.

497
00:44:57,688 --> 00:44:59,900
I was gonna be a stand up comedian.

498
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,569
But who's gonna laugh now?

499
00:45:01,654 --> 00:45:03,615
Some of the best jokes are about cripples.

500
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:05,994
Let's go.
- It's not funny. It's pathetic.

501
00:45:06,077 --> 00:45:08,040
Would you stop crying over fucking...

502
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,083
...spilt milk?

503
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,211
I have no leg.

504
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,730
Now you do.

505
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:23,525
What do you think?

506
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,702
You could carry me, Wray?

507
00:45:30,454 --> 00:45:32,415
You never wanted that before.

508
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,794
Why start now.

509
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:56,416
Sheriff must have taken the others to JT's.

510
00:45:56,582 --> 00:45:57,459
Get in.

511
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:05,849
God damn it. Wait for me.

512
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:19,331
My leg stuck with the door.

513
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:20,541
It's just wood.

514
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,543
It's splintering.

515
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:23,422
You just leave it alone.

516
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:25,383
Why is this happening with me?

517
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:27,887
Just do me a favor right now.

518
00:46:28,138 --> 00:46:29,390
Stay strong.

519
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:32,145
Stay?

520
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:34,608
Yeah baby.

521
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:35,735
Stay.

522
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:38,489
Okay.

523
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:40,076
My name is Electra.

524
00:46:40,076 --> 00:46:41,035
Fucking listen.

525
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,623
My name is Electra.
My name is Electra, too.

526
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:46,670
It's Berry.

527
00:46:48,716 --> 00:46:49,759
No.

528
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:51,262
Is that Berry you want?

529
00:46:52,556 --> 00:46:54,100
And from Electra and from Emilia.

530
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:56,020
Doesn't make any fucking sense.

531
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,114
You can call me whatever the
fuck you want. I don't give a shit.

532
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:06,872
Conio, chica.

533
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:08,542
You said 10.
- I'm sorry.

534
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,671
We can't be watching your kid
all god damn night.

535
00:47:10,796 --> 00:47:13,217
Your friend never showed up
and we got shit to do.

536
00:47:13,342 --> 00:47:14,970
That's right.

537
00:47:15,054 --> 00:47:17,725
Then start doing it.

538
00:47:23,693 --> 00:47:26,281
Hurry. We're leaving.

539
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:28,827
Wait. My tarantula.

540
00:47:29,454 --> 00:47:31,040
Bring it. Let's go.

541
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:32,542
And my turtle.

542
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:34,587
And my scorpion.

543
00:47:34,587 --> 00:47:37,843
And we're not octopuses.
We can't carry everything.

544
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:39,221
Act upon it.

545
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,309
C'mon. Let's go.

546
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,115
Tony, what did I tell you?

547
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,744
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

548
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,415
It's okay. They can live in the same tank.

549
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,628
What about my pocket-bike?

550
00:47:58,254 --> 00:47:59,506
It's in the trunk.

551
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,847
Where do you think you're
going fucking bitch?

552
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,219
Are you sure you're gonna do this?

553
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:30,894
Everybody grab a badge and a gun!

554
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:33,899
You're all deputies as
of this moment forward.

555
00:48:33,983 --> 00:48:35,611
Except for you, Wray.

556
00:48:44,418 --> 00:48:46,422
Don't die for me.

557
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:47,966
What do we got?

558
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,595
Something's wrong up there.

559
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:53,058
JT always comes out and greets.

560
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,268
Let's go.

561
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:58,568
Why don't just shoot yourselves?

562
00:49:00,112 --> 00:49:01,782
Don't shoot each other.

563
00:49:02,408 --> 00:49:03,827
But especially...

564
00:49:06,582 --> 00:49:07,834
Don't shoot me.

565
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,307
JT?

566
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:24,780
God.

567
00:49:24,906 --> 00:49:26,908
Get off him, Rusty.

568
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,295
God-damn, JT.

569
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:46,777
Barbecue?

570
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:49,239
Asshole.

571
00:49:51,702 --> 00:49:53,664
Damn good sausage, JT.

572
00:49:53,748 --> 00:49:55,584
Best in Texas.

573
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:58,714
I must have passed out
after I killed those things.

574
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:01,010
Nice shooting.

575
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:03,181
Everybody gather up supplies.

576
00:50:03,306 --> 00:50:04,642
We head up to any.

577
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,396
I want you to open that for mommy.

578
00:50:35,153 --> 00:50:37,741
Now take the gun.

579
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:39,411
Careful.

580
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,583
And if anyone comes to the door ...

581
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,086
... that isn't me

582
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:46,340
I want you to shoot them, okay?

583
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:48,384
I'm not kidding, Tony.

584
00:50:48,468 --> 00:50:49,846
You shoot them.

585
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:52,141
Just like your video games.

586
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:55,105
You shoot them in the head.

587
00:50:55,397 --> 00:50:56,816
What if it's Dad?

588
00:50:57,943 --> 00:51:00,573
Especially if it's your dad.

589
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:14,639
And be careful where you point that thing.

590
00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:16,726
You'll blow your own face off.

591
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,270
I'll be right back.

592
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:20,649
I love you.

593
00:51:46,695 --> 00:51:47,780
Hello, baby.

594
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,656
Look what you did to our son!

595
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:29,979
Goddam it.
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

596
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:30,814
Daddy.

597
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,073
Get your sorry ass in.

598
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:41,123
If it's escape vehicles you want

599
00:52:41,207 --> 00:52:43,711
Escape vehicles I got.
Right this way.

600
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,550
Watch that meat.

601
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:47,802
Meet my wife.

602
00:52:49,429 --> 00:52:51,433
Jessy James custom dominator.

603
00:52:51,433 --> 00:52:53,771
I made Jessy a plate of
barbecue so God damn good

604
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:56,192
He made this baby for me
free of fucking charge.

605
00:52:56,525 --> 00:52:59,238
Got anything that can transport more people?

606
00:53:00,658 --> 00:53:01,659
Mustang.

607
00:53:02,286 --> 00:53:04,331
This baby is chopped. Permanent.

608
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:06,710
Ain't got no bull bar,
chicken wire, none of that shit.

609
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:08,755
No protection.
- And she's fast.

610
00:53:08,797 --> 00:53:11,552
Nitrous injected 350 horsepower engine.

611
00:53:12,053 --> 00:53:13,180
Who are you?

612
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:15,058
I mean really.

613
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:16,644
Wray's Wreckage?

614
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,482
That's what it says on your truck.

615
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:26,036
Are you a wrecker, Wray?

616
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,788
I'm nobody.

617
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,211
It's the easiest thing to remember.

618
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:34,091
So remember it.

619
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:43,691
Hey, you want some barbecue?

620
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:45,319
Best in Texas.

621
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,030
No thanks.

622
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:48,867
What's the matter?
You don't eat meat?

623
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,245
Oh, I eat meat.

624
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:52,916
I also eat lots of shit.

625
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,168
See this?

626
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:56,172
What's that?

627
00:53:56,255 --> 00:53:57,674
Shit eating grin.

628
00:53:58,593 --> 00:54:00,178
Got to be a comedian.

629
00:54:01,097 --> 00:54:02,557
What do you think of the leg?

630
00:54:02,808 --> 00:54:03,893
It's funny.

631
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:07,901
How is your stump?

632
00:54:07,901 --> 00:54:09,737
They knocked it out something fierce.

633
00:54:09,904 --> 00:54:11,615
So I can't feel a thing.

634
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:15,247
This must be the real Bone Shack.

635
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,712
Old JT knows how to live.

636
00:54:19,963 --> 00:54:21,466
Like fuck he does.

637
00:54:25,264 --> 00:54:27,058
I like how you say fuck.

638
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:28,937
Dude.
Fuck you.

639
00:54:30,189 --> 00:54:31,149
Fuck me.

640
00:54:35,114 --> 00:54:37,827
Oh, so now you're the comedian.

641
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:40,165
Go ahead.
Drop your pants.

642
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:42,252
That will be good for a laugh.

643
00:54:43,004 --> 00:54:44,548
I highly doubt that.

644
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:52,479
That's my jacket.

645
00:54:53,188 --> 00:54:54,941
Yes. I know.

646
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,027
I looked for it for two weeks.

647
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:58,823
Look.

648
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:01,827
You were being an unbelievable dick.

649
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:04,123
I was walking out on you.

650
00:55:04,165 --> 00:55:07,254
I was cold. I took your fucking jacket.

651
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:08,631
So.

652
00:55:08,631 --> 00:55:11,344
If you're gonna go on with your
psycho-obsessive-controlling rants

653
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:13,223
about a fucking jacket
then fucking take it.

654
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:17,396
Cause I'd rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

655
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,569
Did you find what was in the pocket?

656
00:55:20,694 --> 00:55:21,779
Fuck now.

657
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,825
Look for it.

658
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:28,625
No. The other one.

659
00:55:38,517 --> 00:55:41,146
I was gonna give it to you. But you left me.

660
00:55:42,357 --> 00:55:44,027
And you took the jacket.

661
00:55:45,404 --> 00:55:48,117
And I looked for it for two weeks.

662
00:55:49,828 --> 00:55:50,788
Read it.

663
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:00,388
Two against the world.

664
00:56:03,311 --> 00:56:04,688
Remember that?

665
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,361
I never forgot it.

666
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,907
Why did you leave?

667
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,789
Because you didn't believe in us.

668
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:15,916
Or in me.

669
00:57:42,985 --> 00:57:43,861
I'm sorry.

670
00:57:44,654 --> 00:57:45,656
You're gonna be all right.

671
00:57:49,913 --> 00:57:51,667
Come on.

672
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,837
Move your ass! Come on.

673
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:02,102
Are you all right?

674
00:58:11,952 --> 00:58:13,705
What did I tell you, Tony?

675
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,420
Don't point the gun at yourself.

676
00:58:18,547 --> 00:58:20,300
Didn't I tell you that?

677
00:58:21,677 --> 00:58:23,723
Thank you for telling me about it.

678
00:58:24,223 --> 00:58:24,975
You know.

679
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:26,436
Don't mention it.

680
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,440
That's an order.

681
00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:30,902
If I had known that you were...

682
00:58:33,698 --> 00:58:34,617
El Wray

683
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,830
I wouldn't have given you such a hard time.

684
00:58:37,872 --> 00:58:40,126
Didn't mean to be a prick about it.

685
00:58:40,627 --> 00:58:43,048
Need to know basis, that kind of shit.

686
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:44,301
Take this.

687
00:58:46,262 --> 00:58:47,807
Do what you do best.

688
00:58:50,686 --> 00:58:52,064
No. You're not.

689
00:58:52,147 --> 00:58:53,609
Don't give him the gun.

690
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,361
Give him that gun, Tolo.

691
00:58:57,365 --> 00:58:58,784
Give him that gun.

692
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,872
Give him all the guns.

693
00:59:19,654 --> 00:59:21,783
That boy's got the devil in him.

694
00:59:24,704 --> 00:59:26,291
Get to fight. Come on.

695
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,168
Get to our vehicles.

696
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,049
Everyone behind me.

697
00:59:42,652 --> 00:59:43,779
Outside now.

698
01:00:03,188 --> 01:00:04,441
God damn you!

699
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:16,252
Everybody back inside.

700
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:26,604
You, Skip!

701
01:00:27,314 --> 01:00:28,733
Front and center.

702
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:31,488
Go out front.
Start up the Kill Dozer.

703
01:00:31,988 --> 01:00:34,367
We need it to transport
the other survivors.

704
01:00:34,452 --> 01:00:36,496
You're fucking crazy?
I'm not going out there.

705
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,084
I'll cover you.
- Not going.

706
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:40,629
I never miss.

707
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:41,840
Come on, Skip.

708
01:00:42,841 --> 01:00:44,302
It's go go.

709
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:46,305
Not cry cry.

710
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:48,225
Cherry!

711
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:48,915
JT.

712
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,960
You take whoever you can
fit in your convertible.

713
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,254
Everyone else on board.

714
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:54,299
Skip, grab the twins.
Come on with me.

715
01:01:54,383 --> 01:01:55,927
You take the chopper.

716
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,600
I need someone else to drive my truck.
- I'll do it.

717
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:03,399
You're bleeding like a stuck pig.

718
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:05,569
If your vision's blurred, you're on your last flight.

719
01:02:05,652 --> 01:02:07,072
Anything else?

720
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:08,491
Don't wreck it.

721
01:02:11,537 --> 01:02:13,917
It ain't no barbecue without coleslaw.

722
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,044
Take this.

723
01:02:16,004 --> 01:02:17,214
Fuckin' cool.

724
01:02:23,726 --> 01:02:25,520
I can take care of myself.

725
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:27,733
Bye, Daddy.

726
01:02:29,193 --> 01:02:30,863
You remember how to ride a bike?

727
01:02:31,031 --> 01:02:32,741
Useless talent number 32.

728
01:02:33,952 --> 01:02:34,662
Good.

729
01:02:35,162 --> 01:02:36,873
Anyone else have a car?

730
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,927
Are you sure you're okay
driving this van?

731
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:44,888
Hell yeah.

732
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,815
Dakota!

733
01:02:53,653 --> 01:02:56,366
Your engine is shot you've
got three blown tires.

734
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:59,121
But it's got his pocket-bike in the trunk.

735
01:03:00,123 --> 01:03:03,921
Is it fast?
- Zero to fifty in four seconds.

736
01:03:04,004 --> 01:03:05,382
You go with her.

737
01:03:06,675 --> 01:03:07,803
I'm Cherry.

738
01:03:08,596 --> 01:03:10,057
You sure are.

739
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:12,311
Move out.

740
01:03:13,062 --> 01:03:14,648
Damn machine.

741
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:49,918
Rusty!

742
01:03:51,796 --> 01:03:53,007
Goddammit!

743
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:31,741
Sheriff?

744
01:04:31,866 --> 01:04:33,495
How much ammo we got?

745
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:36,916
Not enough.

746
01:04:49,606 --> 01:04:52,110
Don't shoot.
We're not infected.

747
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:04,006
All survivors gotta come with us.

748
01:05:05,425 --> 01:05:06,760
Especially you.

749
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:09,306
El Wray.

750
01:05:09,975 --> 01:05:12,688
I don't go by that name anymore.

751
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,506
It's okay.

752
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,348
We're here in quarantine with
the other survivors.

753
01:05:43,325 --> 01:05:44,535
Where is here?

754
01:05:45,954 --> 01:05:47,415
Field Army Base.

755
01:05:49,044 --> 01:05:49,878
El Wray?

756
01:05:52,007 --> 01:05:53,008
That you?

757
01:05:54,344 --> 01:05:57,265
He's with them.
I saw him in the convoy earlier.

758
01:05:57,475 --> 01:05:58,810
I'm a scientist.

759
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:00,396
And a businessman.

760
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,607
Not military.

761
01:06:01,648 --> 01:06:05,196
Princess wise is gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.

762
01:06:07,075 --> 01:06:09,245
They are stealing biochemical weapons.

763
01:06:09,328 --> 01:06:10,247
DC2?

764
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:13,628
Also known as Project Terror.

765
01:06:13,711 --> 01:06:17,384
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled land locked area.

766
01:06:17,426 --> 01:06:19,680
And you were supplying it to them?

767
01:06:20,348 --> 01:06:21,600
So why'd they shut you out?

768
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,353
They've found my supply.

769
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:25,190
It's under our feet.

770
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,360
Ten stories down.

771
01:06:27,486 --> 01:06:30,992
The only treatment is a regimented
exposure to DC-2 itself.

772
01:06:31,326 --> 01:06:33,078
Delays the negative effects.

773
01:06:33,078 --> 01:06:34,289
They need it.

774
01:06:35,416 --> 01:06:36,543
Like a drug.

775
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:37,503
Correct.

776
01:06:37,586 --> 01:06:41,593
But we found that a small percentage
of people are not affected by the gas itself.

777
01:06:41,635 --> 01:06:44,390
And within this small percentage lies a cure.

778
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:45,976
What do you wanna do?

779
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:49,816
Mexico.

780
01:06:50,568 --> 01:06:52,278
Put our backs against the ocean.

781
01:06:52,362 --> 01:06:53,824
And defend ourselves from there.

782
01:06:53,907 --> 01:06:55,993
No. We have to get back to my lab.

783
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:57,997
This infection will spread all over the world.

784
01:06:58,039 --> 01:06:59,834
To every man, woman and child...

785
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:01,712
Unless I finish my antidote.

786
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:04,968
You have an antidote?

787
01:07:11,938 --> 01:07:12,689
You.

788
01:07:13,524 --> 01:07:14,192
You.

789
01:07:14,192 --> 01:07:15,445
Come with us.

790
01:07:16,529 --> 01:07:17,406
Move it.

791
01:07:37,399 --> 01:07:39,152
Do you like Ava Gardner?

792
01:07:40,362 --> 01:07:41,239
Sorry?

793
01:07:45,497 --> 01:07:46,624
Ava Gardner.

794
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,168
Do you like her?

795
01:07:49,671 --> 01:07:50,881
Yeah, I guess.

796
01:07:51,841 --> 01:07:53,802
I'm just thinking that you ...

797
01:07:54,012 --> 01:07:56,933
... kinda look like
Ava Gardner a little bit.

798
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,533
You've got something you
wanna say to me?

799
01:08:07,285 --> 01:08:08,913
I have nothing to say to you.

800
01:08:08,996 --> 01:08:11,125
You've nothing to say huh?
That's funny.

801
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:14,756
Cause I coulda swear you just give
me a fuck you look great now.

802
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,844
You wanna say Fuck You to me?

803
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,596
Not at this moment.

804
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,188
You know what this is?

805
01:08:24,732 --> 01:08:25,567
A gun?

806
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:27,904
It's simplicity itself.

807
01:08:29,157 --> 01:08:31,911
You see you point it
at what you want to die.

808
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,540
And you pull the little trigger here.

809
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:36,753
And a bullet comes out here.

810
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:40,719
And the bullet hits you right there.

811
01:08:41,803 --> 01:08:43,223
And you know what?

812
01:08:44,809 --> 01:08:47,355
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.

813
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,824
Don't taunt me, tramp.

814
01:08:54,576 --> 01:08:57,456
I am not one to be taunted.

815
01:08:57,582 --> 01:08:58,750
You got it?

816
01:09:01,797 --> 01:09:03,675
Let me hear you say, " I got it. "

817
01:09:04,343 --> 01:09:05,930
I got it.

818
01:09:06,263 --> 01:09:07,974
You're damn more better.

819
01:09:28,678 --> 01:09:29,470
Salt.

820
01:09:29,972 --> 01:09:31,265
Get it. I figured out it's salt.

821
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:32,601
Blood is salty.

822
01:09:32,851 --> 01:09:36,065
That's all my sauce needed
which is a little more salt.

823
01:09:36,107 --> 01:09:38,570
Just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talking about.

824
01:09:38,611 --> 01:09:39,738
What are you doing JT?

825
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,909
That's all I got to do to put a
little more salt in.

826
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:44,246
To do the same goddamn thing that blood did.

827
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:46,834
I'm telling you, my brothers,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

828
01:09:46,834 --> 01:09:48,629
Don't do nothing stupid, JT.
I got it covered.

829
01:09:48,712 --> 01:09:53,012
It's already got my sweat. It's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood.

830
01:09:55,307 --> 01:09:56,267
Drop the gun.

831
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:57,018
JT?

832
01:09:58,354 --> 01:09:59,731
Do it now.

833
01:10:00,066 --> 01:10:01,193
Don't shoot.

834
01:10:01,693 --> 01:10:03,154
JT you all right?

835
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:13,798
He's all right, bro.

836
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:16,260
God damn but I'm
not all right at all, brother.

837
01:10:16,344 --> 01:10:17,179
Not at all.

838
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:18,431
Wait here.

839
01:10:20,184 --> 01:10:21,311
I sure will.

840
01:10:23,857 --> 01:10:25,151
Goddam sauce.

841
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:34,877
... in cages.

842
01:10:35,836 --> 01:10:37,756
See them in action.

843
01:10:38,758 --> 01:10:40,427
See them in love.

844
01:10:41,096 --> 01:10:43,015
See them in terror.

845
01:10:43,683 --> 01:10:45,896
White skin on the black market.

846
01:10:46,188 --> 01:10:49,277
Soft flash for hard cash.

847
01:10:49,736 --> 01:10:51,446
Women in cages.

848
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:53,575
I'm gonna get my dick wet.

849
01:10:53,867 --> 01:10:56,038
She's got one leg.

850
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,583
Easier access.

851
01:11:00,046 --> 01:11:01,256
Good point.

852
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:12,525
Get the rest of the shit upstairs
and we'll blow this entire floor.

853
01:11:25,924 --> 01:11:27,468
Get Lewis down here.

854
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,099
He's getting his dick wet, Sir.

855
01:11:31,184 --> 01:11:33,771
Get him the fuck down here now.

856
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:44,790
Lewis.

857
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:46,710
Listen.

858
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,657
Where are my men?

859
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:05,618
I've got several right here.

860
01:12:08,081 --> 01:12:09,667
What the fuck is this?

861
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:11,795
Their balls, sweetheart.

862
01:12:18,015 --> 01:12:18,975
Let us go.

863
01:12:19,016 --> 01:12:20,018
Tell me why we should.

864
01:12:20,018 --> 01:12:21,605
Because I earned it.

865
01:12:21,647 --> 01:12:22,816
How you figure that?

866
01:12:22,857 --> 01:12:24,109
You want the story?

867
01:12:24,193 --> 01:12:26,070
I spin it for you quick.

868
01:12:26,112 --> 01:12:29,285
Turmoil in some nasty caves
on the Afghan border.

869
01:12:29,326 --> 01:12:32,416
Me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands.

870
01:12:32,499 --> 01:12:34,127
And our balls in or throats.

871
01:12:34,168 --> 01:12:35,964
Looking for America's most wanted.

872
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,508
Bin Laden
- Yeah.

873
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:39,720
For once I ran towards
right on the money.

874
01:12:39,803 --> 01:12:40,972
I come around a corner.

875
01:12:40,972 --> 01:12:43,184
Bam. There he is looking
me right in the eyes.

876
01:12:43,184 --> 01:12:44,019
Wait.

877
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,148
You killed Bin Laden?

878
01:12:46,816 --> 01:12:48,485
I put two in his heart.

879
01:12:48,735 --> 01:12:50,364
One in his computer.

880
01:12:50,489 --> 01:12:51,824
So that was you.

881
01:12:52,116 --> 01:12:52,951
Yeah.

882
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,164
That was me.

883
01:12:59,754 --> 01:13:01,675
He wasn't supposed to be there.

884
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:02,969
We weren't supposed to be there.

885
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:06,975
And I sure as fuck wasn't supposed
to be the one who punches #% ticket.

886
01:13:07,017 --> 01:13:10,648
So instead of a chest full of medals
we got a face full of DC2.

887
01:13:11,358 --> 01:13:12,319
No cure.

888
01:13:13,446 --> 01:13:15,616
There is none till we find
somebody from the other side

889
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:17,661
... willing to sell us batches of this shit.

890
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:20,750
Science comes first.
But business comes a close fucking second.

891
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,798
Then you realized if you could infect
a large enough populace

892
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,177
... and experiment on its survivals

893
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,056
You'd find a cure.

894
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:33,856
I swore to my men that I'd do everything
in my power to keep them alive.

895
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:36,152
That's what I intend to do, Wray.

896
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:39,825
Understand...

897
01:13:41,244 --> 01:13:42,871
I never had a choice.

898
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:48,048
Neither do I, sir.

899
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:52,890
God bless you and
your service to this country.

900
01:13:59,484 --> 01:14:00,861
Are you a doctor?

901
01:14:03,491 --> 01:14:05,161
I was earlier tonight.

902
01:14:07,248 --> 01:14:09,293
I always wanted to be a doctor.

903
01:14:10,003 --> 01:14:14,134
Instead, I can do this.

904
01:14:15,596 --> 01:14:18,476
Useless talent No. 66.

905
01:14:22,274 --> 01:14:23,526
I'm very pliable.

906
01:14:23,568 --> 01:14:25,822
A girlfriend of mine had a theory.

907
01:14:25,947 --> 01:14:28,243
She said at some point in your life

908
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:32,417
You find a use for every useless
talent you've ever had.

909
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:35,047
It's like connecting the dots.

910
01:14:35,172 --> 01:14:36,883
I'm not that optimistic.

911
01:14:37,634 --> 01:14:41,099
I feel like I'm sinking
down the drain and I can't get out.

912
01:14:41,182 --> 01:14:42,142
She'd say

913
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:45,439
When you're stuck in that spiral

914
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:47,485
You reach up.

915
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:50,949
What if there's nothing up there.

916
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:53,620
Just reach up.

917
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,085
You're a dancer.

918
01:14:57,544 --> 01:14:59,297
I was earlier tonight.

919
01:15:00,049 --> 01:15:02,553
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement.

920
01:15:09,273 --> 01:15:12,487
I'm starved for entertainment, baby.
And that means you.

921
01:15:12,904 --> 01:15:14,365
Radio.

922
01:15:16,243 --> 01:15:17,787
Well, baby. Now.

923
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:28,765
That's what I'm talking about.

924
01:15:32,564 --> 01:15:33,774
Keep dancing.

925
01:15:36,487 --> 01:15:40,202
I have seen me some
crazy ass shit in my day.

926
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:44,334
But I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

927
01:15:44,793 --> 01:15:47,298
I've seen me a stripper with one breast.

928
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:50,261
And I've seen me a
stripper with twelve toes.

929
01:15:50,344 --> 01:15:52,933
And I've seen me a
stripper with no brains at all.

930
01:15:52,933 --> 01:15:55,896
But I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

931
01:15:56,396 --> 01:15:58,067
And I'll bet them rock.

932
01:15:59,361 --> 01:16:00,863
Dance bitch!

933
01:16:03,075 --> 01:16:04,244
Break a leg.

934
01:16:05,705 --> 01:16:07,792
Break it off.

935
01:16:17,392 --> 01:16:19,354
Dance for me, motherfucker.

936
01:16:33,503 --> 01:16:35,382
You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?

937
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:36,551
Actually

938
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:37,594
Yes.

939
01:16:38,513 --> 01:16:40,140
You gave me some wood?

940
01:16:40,265 --> 01:16:43,103
Now I'm gonna give you some...

941
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:44,732
... fucking wood!

942
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,301
Your Gas! You need your gas!

943
01:17:00,342 --> 01:17:02,429
Fucking gas. Fuck it!

944
01:17:02,805 --> 01:17:05,601
I'm just gonna have to make this quick.

945
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,003
Where did you get that?

946
01:17:21,128 --> 01:17:23,049
Useless talent No. 37.

947
01:17:49,929 --> 01:17:52,976
I broke my leg.
- Okay.

948
01:17:53,226 --> 01:17:55,271
I made you something.

949
01:17:57,358 --> 01:17:58,861
I do believe in you.

950
01:17:59,946 --> 01:18:01,198
I always have.

951
01:18:01,616 --> 01:18:04,079
I believe that you can be better.

952
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:05,790
You deserve better.

953
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:07,919
Even better than me.

954
01:18:09,046 --> 01:18:10,089
Right now..

955
01:18:10,673 --> 01:18:12,218
I need you to become..

956
01:18:13,887 --> 01:18:15,724
Who you were meant to be.

957
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,187
Stand.

958
01:18:32,002 --> 01:18:34,006
Open that door, will you baby?

959
01:19:02,263 --> 01:19:04,476
We've destroyed most of the tanks.

960
01:19:05,186 --> 01:19:07,899
Any that are left we'll get
on our way to the helicopters.

961
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:09,986
There are two helicopters.

962
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,282
Big enough to take all of us.

963
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,786
Who can fly?

964
01:19:17,999 --> 01:19:20,253
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?

965
01:19:20,796 --> 01:19:23,551
I can fly, but...
No way in hell I'm gonna fly on that.

966
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:27,140
Okay. Cool. I'll fly.

967
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,076
I think we're gonna stay here, Wray.

968
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:41,374
Take care of this for me then, Sheriff.

969
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,043
With pleasure.

970
01:19:43,503 --> 01:19:44,630
Two minutes.

971
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,468
Brother's a good man, JT.

972
01:19:48,052 --> 01:19:49,304
Best in Texas.

973
01:19:52,852 --> 01:19:53,728
Hop on.

974
01:19:57,193 --> 01:19:58,570
No. The other way.

975
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:03,704
No.

976
01:20:03,913 --> 01:20:05,791
The other way.

977
01:20:52,456 --> 01:20:55,462
The helicopters are on the
other side of this wall.

978
01:21:01,598 --> 01:21:02,850
We make a run for it.

979
01:21:02,933 --> 01:21:06,063
No. If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

980
01:21:06,189 --> 01:21:07,608
Don't you get it?

981
01:21:08,109 --> 01:21:09,569
We're the antidote.

982
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:12,241
Was there another way around?

983
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,367
Wait here.

984
01:21:39,747 --> 01:21:43,337
I suppose there are any other
biochemical engineers around?

985
01:21:43,963 --> 01:21:45,465
I think there is no.

986
01:21:47,094 --> 01:21:49,055
We have to get over that wall.

987
01:21:53,021 --> 01:21:55,692
I was thinking we could build us a new place.

988
01:21:55,859 --> 01:21:58,280
Right there where the old one was.

989
01:21:58,739 --> 01:21:59,782
You cook.

990
01:22:00,492 --> 01:22:01,828
I work the back.

991
01:22:03,497 --> 01:22:06,085
You don't make that rent so goddamn high.

992
01:22:06,544 --> 01:22:07,963
Share the recipe.

993
01:22:08,715 --> 01:22:10,259
We'll share the rent.

994
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:17,480
Start at 250 degrees.

995
01:22:20,903 --> 01:22:22,072
I knew it.

996
01:22:22,697 --> 01:22:25,828
For how long?
- For about ...

997
01:22:26,162 --> 01:22:27,331
Twelve pounds.

998
01:22:27,414 --> 01:22:28,624
Twelve hours.

999
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:30,545
Wrapped in tinfoil, right?

1000
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:32,715
I don't use no goddamn foil.

1001
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:34,051
Damn.

1002
01:22:34,218 --> 01:22:36,972
Tomatoes?
Fresh?

1003
01:22:37,264 --> 01:22:38,224
Canned.

1004
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,395
No shit?
- Yeah.

1005
01:22:40,437 --> 01:22:43,108
Score me some?
- Oh, yeah.

1006
01:22:43,776 --> 01:22:45,404
Cause we're brothers.

1007
01:22:47,157 --> 01:22:48,660
Thank you for this.

1008
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:50,747
You just remember.

1009
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:53,418
You gotta take this recipe to your grave.

1010
01:22:54,545 --> 01:22:58,302
I think I can goddamn guarantee that.

1011
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:24,890
That's our cue.

1012
01:23:27,227 --> 01:23:28,521
Cherry, darling.

1013
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:31,610
Follow you.

1014
01:24:03,207 --> 01:24:04,334
Let's go.

1015
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:13,664
Wray!

1016
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:21,802
Okay.

1017
01:25:22,137 --> 01:25:24,516
Can you do that? Cause we're leaving.

1018
01:25:48,891 --> 01:25:51,020
They told me I'd find you here.

1019
01:25:54,693 --> 01:25:56,739
I was beginning to lose hope.

1020
01:25:57,782 --> 01:25:58,909
I'm sorry.

1021
01:26:00,495 --> 01:26:01,664
But I lied.

1022
01:26:04,419 --> 01:26:07,423
I did want to hurt you.

1023
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:11,640
My turn.

1024
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:25,121
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.

1025
01:26:27,209 --> 01:26:29,337
Never liked that son of a bitch.

1026
01:26:31,925 --> 01:26:35,223
Was as useless as a pecker on a pope.

1027
01:26:41,942 --> 01:26:43,529
Don't touch anything.

1028
01:26:44,447 --> 01:26:46,492
He said not to touch anything.

1029
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:49,623
Shut up.

1030
01:26:49,832 --> 01:26:52,419
Sit down and don't fucking touch anything.

1031
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:00,517
Everybody sit down.

1032
01:27:23,724 --> 01:27:24,934
Go. Leave me.

1033
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:27,397
I am not leaving you here like this.

1034
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:30,862
Motherfuckers around here eat road kill.

1035
01:27:32,406 --> 01:27:33,407
You see?

1036
01:27:33,866 --> 01:27:34,993
I'm funny.

1037
01:27:35,912 --> 01:27:37,414
I made you laugh.

1038
01:27:37,539 --> 01:27:38,834
Go to the ocean.

1039
01:27:38,918 --> 01:27:41,839
Put your backs to it.
Protect yourselves there.

1040
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,719
I'm not leaving you Wray.

1041
01:27:46,138 --> 01:27:47,766
Two against the world.

1042
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:51,105
There will be.

1043
01:27:52,608 --> 01:27:53,776
I promise.

1044
01:27:54,987 --> 01:27:56,239
I never miss.

1045
01:27:58,118 --> 01:27:59,537
Don't worry, baby.

1046
01:28:00,747 --> 01:28:02,416
You'll find your way.

1047
01:29:21,847 --> 01:29:24,268
It's like you said it would be, Wray.

1048
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,275
I'm like you said I would be.

1049
01:29:28,984 --> 01:29:30,278
I find the lost.

1050
01:29:31,489 --> 01:29:32,532
The weary.

1051
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:35,955
Those who have no hope.

1052
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:37,332
I find them.

1053
01:29:37,917 --> 01:29:39,169
And I lead them.

1054
01:29:40,213 --> 01:29:42,509
To a land we've made for ourselves.

1055
01:29:44,095 --> 01:29:45,597
The land by the sea.

1056
01:30:20,575 --> 01:30:21,868
It's beautiful.

1057
01:30:23,204 --> 01:30:25,458
She's beautiful.

1058
01:30:27,545 --> 01:30:29,299
I wish you could see us.

1059
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:30,885
Us two.

1060
01:30:32,179 --> 01:30:34,308
It's like you said it would be.

1061
01:30:35,435 --> 01:30:38,147
Two against the world baby.

1062
01:30:38,231 --> 01:30:41,152
Two against the world.

1063
01:30:58,046 --> 01:31:01,341
This film is a brilliant achievement in motion picture history.

1064
01:31:01,383 --> 01:31:07,430
Finally, the truth about Hitler's diabolical plans
to create a race of superwomen can be told.

1065
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:11,851
Werewolf Women of the S.S.

1066
01:31:12,143 --> 01:31:14,561
Welcome to Death Camp 13.

1067
01:31:14,603 --> 01:31:17,231
Home of the Nazis' diabolical plan.

1068
01:31:17,272 --> 01:31:20,358
To create an army of super werewolf soldiers.

1069
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,484
This is projected.

1070
01:31:21,484 --> 01:31:24,028
Its failure will be your demise.

1071
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:26,864
... and the end of Germany, Borman.

1072
01:31:27,657 --> 01:31:30,034
You have been chosen.

1073
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:32,036
Rejoice.

1074
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:35,622
They have found the perfect solution.

1075
01:31:35,622 --> 01:31:40,836
The She-Devils of Belzac.

1076
01:31:42,379 --> 01:31:47,091
Can they alone supply the blood
needed to save Hitler's mad dreams?

1077
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:51,012
Or with the pride of Germany fall into ruin?

1078
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:52,471
This is my project.

1079
01:31:52,555 --> 01:31:57,726
We are now in total control of Pure Wolf.

1080
01:32:07,276 --> 01:32:09,362
Featuring Udo Kier

1081
01:32:09,445 --> 01:32:11,113
Sheri Moon Zombie

1082
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:12,698
Tom Towles

1083
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:25,960
This is my Mecca!

1084
01:33:10,584 --> 01:33:12,294
If you..

1085
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,463
are thinking

1086
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:16,423
of going

1087
01:33:16,465 --> 01:33:18,383
into

1088
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,552
this house

1089
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,598
If you ...

1090
01:33:25,682 --> 01:33:27,433
... are thinking

1091
01:33:27,475 --> 01:33:29,393
... of opening

1092
01:33:29,477 --> 01:33:32,438
... this door.

1093
01:33:35,524 --> 01:33:37,067
If you...

1094
01:33:37,109 --> 01:33:39,069
... are thinking

1095
01:33:39,111 --> 01:33:41,238
... of checking out

1096
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:43,573
... the basement.

1097
01:33:49,162 --> 01:33:50,997
Don't look behind.

1098
01:33:51,038 --> 01:33:53,082
Don't look in there.

1099
01:33:53,374 --> 01:33:55,626
Don't look up.

1100
01:33:55,667 --> 01:33:58,462
Don't look anywhere.

1101
01:33:59,713 --> 01:34:02,007
Don't scream for help.

1102
01:34:05,426 --> 01:34:08,596
Don't even breathe.

1103
01:34:16,478 --> 01:34:20,857
Timing & Text by Bodza

1104
01:34:22,067 --> 01:34:25,403
If you are thinking of seeing this film alone.

1105
01:34:55,347 --> 01:34:57,432
In the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts

1106
01:34:57,641 --> 01:35:02,979
The 4th Thursday in November
is the most celebrated day in the year.

1107
01:35:04,189 --> 01:35:06,149
The table is set.

1108
01:35:06,274 --> 01:35:09,527
The festivities have begun.

1109
01:35:09,527 --> 01:35:11,404
For the uninvited guests to arrive.

1110
01:35:12,455 --> 01:35:15,138
And this year there will be...

1111
01:35:15,139 --> 01:35:16,922
... no leftovers.

1112
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:45,900
White meat.

1113
01:35:45,901 --> 01:35:47,279
Dark meat.

1114
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,823
All will be carved.

1115
01:35:55,312 --> 01:35:57,256
Come on Judy. How about it?

1116
01:35:59,396 --> 01:36:01,173
Happy Thanksgiving, baby.

1117
01:36:16,455 --> 01:36:17,670
Cool it, Judy.

1118
01:36:18,658 --> 01:36:19,802
We're safe.

1119
01:36:20,599 --> 01:36:21,839
Bobby's here.

1120
01:36:34,991 --> 01:36:36,196
It's blood.

1121
01:36:38,456 --> 01:36:40,576
Son of a bitch.

1122
01:36:41,909 --> 01:36:42,791
Arrive hungry.

1123
01:36:42,813 --> 01:36:45,186
Happy Thanksgiving, Grandma.

1124
01:36:50,461 --> 01:36:52,304
From director Eli Roth.

1125
01:36:54,748 --> 01:36:56,960
You'll come home for the holidays

1126
01:36:56,961 --> 01:36:58,103
In a body bag.

1127
01:36:59,538 --> 01:37:00,470
This February.

1128
01:37:06,682 --> 01:37:08,326
Get more out of life.

1129
01:37:09,113 --> 01:37:10,818
Go out to a movie.

1130
01:40:04,633 --> 01:40:06,413
Hold on, I gotta come up!

1131
01:40:06,414 --> 01:40:08,826
I gotta take the world's biggest fuckin' piss!

1132
01:40:08,827 --> 01:40:10,671
We can't be late!

1133
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:11,718
We won't!

1134
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:38,695
Who's holding?
- If you're not, then nobody.

1135
01:40:38,696 --> 01:40:40,147
We were kinda hoping you were.

1136
01:40:40,148 --> 01:40:41,899
Yeah, how are you not holding?

1137
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,183
Jesus Christ, Shanna.

1138
01:40:43,184 --> 01:40:46,308
It's not my fucking job to supply you all
with weed when we go out.

1139
01:40:46,309 --> 01:40:48,488
Ah. Whoa Whoa, little lady.

1140
01:40:48,489 --> 01:40:50,623
You're getting angry kinda quick, don'tcha think?

1141
01:40:50,624 --> 01:40:52,750
I was just teasing you.
- I'm not angry...

1142
01:40:52,751 --> 01:40:56,340
It just would be nice if ya'll didn't just
count on me all the fuckin' time.

1143
01:40:56,341 --> 01:40:59,082
And surprise me every
once in a while with pot.

1144
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:01,144
Okay, mean girl in a high school movie.

1145
01:41:03,441 --> 01:41:06,205
All right. C'mon guys, don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.

1146
01:41:06,206 --> 01:41:07,656
One, it's not about the money.

1147
01:41:07,657 --> 01:41:10,439
It's about the pain in the ass of scoring,

1148
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,502
And two, we're not really fighting.

1149
01:41:12,503 --> 01:41:15,987
Arlene, you've forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia's like.

1150
01:41:15,988 --> 01:41:17,456
That wasn't a fight.

1151
01:41:17,457 --> 01:41:20,210
That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch.

1152
01:41:20,211 --> 01:41:24,152
And me calling her on it and
indulging her at the same time.

1153
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:25,631
Billboard.

1154
01:41:29,758 --> 01:41:32,123
Okay. Is Christian Simonson gonna be there?

1155
01:41:32,124 --> 01:41:36,146
You bet your ass he is.
- Christian Simonson the filmmaker's in town.

1156
01:41:36,252 --> 01:41:38,049
He's got a big thing for Julia.

1157
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,368
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fuckin' call me.

1158
01:41:40,369 --> 01:41:41,941
As opposed to disappearing for six months.

1159
01:41:41,942 --> 01:41:44,140
And he'd get his ass down
here more often than he does.

1160
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:47,050
And on my birthday he'd
give me a fucking phone call.

1161
01:41:47,051 --> 01:41:49,939
But other than that, he's putty in my hands.

1162
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:51,536
So what's the plan, man?

1163
01:41:51,537 --> 01:41:53,422
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.

1164
01:41:53,423 --> 01:41:54,622
Touch base with Chris and Jessie.

1165
01:41:54,623 --> 01:41:57,421
Tell them about later
and make damn sure they come.

1166
01:41:57,987 --> 01:42:01,015
Those other guys will be waiting for us
to join at the Texas Chilli Parlor.

1167
01:42:01,054 --> 01:42:02,553
Oh shit.

1168
01:42:02,554 --> 01:42:04,599
Speaking of which?

1169
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,302
What happened with you and Nate last night?

1170
01:42:06,303 --> 01:42:09,419
Well you know not much.
We just fuckin' met each other.

1171
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:11,958
I mean if you don't bust their balls a little bit
they're never gonna respect ya'.

1172
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:14,620
Okay. We're pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.

1173
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:17,190
How about enlightening us on
what it is you did do?

1174
01:42:17,191 --> 01:42:18,893
Nothing to write home about.

1175
01:42:18,894 --> 01:42:21,326
We just made out on the couch
for about twenty minutes.

1176
01:42:21,327 --> 01:42:22,903
Dressed, half-dressed or naked?

1177
01:42:22,904 --> 01:42:24,364
Dressed. I said we made out.

1178
01:42:24,365 --> 01:42:25,915
We didn't do "the thing".

1179
01:42:25,916 --> 01:42:29,245
Excuse me for living but what is "the thing"?

1180
01:42:29,246 --> 01:42:31,237
You know it's everything but.

1181
01:42:31,238 --> 01:42:32,820
They call that "the thing"?

1182
01:42:32,821 --> 01:42:35,025
I call it "the thing".

1183
01:42:35,026 --> 01:42:36,667
Do guys like "the thing"?

1184
01:42:36,668 --> 01:42:38,887
They like it better than no-thing.

1185
01:42:38,918 --> 01:42:40,301
Yeah sure.

1186
01:42:40,302 --> 01:42:42,719
Oh yeah, I wanna get back to
what it is you did do.

1187
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,743
So you're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

1188
01:42:44,744 --> 01:42:45,777
Correct.
- Whose couch?

1189
01:42:45,778 --> 01:42:47,054
His or the one in your hotel room?

1190
01:42:47,055 --> 01:42:48,484
What am I stupid over here?

1191
01:42:48,485 --> 01:42:49,427
Mine.

1192
01:42:49,428 --> 01:42:51,526
Were you making out sitting up
or lying down?

1193
01:42:51,527 --> 01:42:54,460
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.

1194
01:42:54,491 --> 01:42:57,259
Humm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?

1195
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,343
I was straddling him.

1196
01:42:59,525 --> 01:43:02,049
So what about tonight?
- Well, we'll see, Shanna.

1197
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:04,772
I mean I like Nate.
He's cute, he's a pretty good kisser.

1198
01:43:04,773 --> 01:43:06,201
But it ain't a done deal.

1199
01:43:06,202 --> 01:43:07,372
Yeah, fuck Nate.

1200
01:43:07,373 --> 01:43:10,490
I mean he's cute an all, but Jessie
Letterman's gonna be all over her.

1201
01:43:10,491 --> 01:43:12,787
Jessie Letterman the Austin director
who did "Potheads"?

1202
01:43:12,788 --> 01:43:14,079
He's a good friend.

1203
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,691
Maybe they can bring some pot.

1204
01:43:15,692 --> 01:43:17,242
Fuck that. No.

1205
01:43:17,243 --> 01:43:19,721
I don't want to be either
A, depending on their fucking ass

1206
01:43:19,722 --> 01:43:21,303
or B, dependent on their ass.

1207
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,537
If we don't score ourselves...

1208
01:43:22,538 --> 01:43:25,330
... we're gonna be stuck with
them all fucking night.

1209
01:43:25,549 --> 01:43:26,873
Try Lanna-Frank.

1210
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:28,295
Best idea you've had all day.

1211
01:43:28,296 --> 01:43:29,550
Okay.

1212
01:43:29,551 --> 01:43:31,876
That's your last billboard before Guero's.

1213
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:33,686
Oh c'mon, give me a break.

1214
01:43:33,687 --> 01:43:35,058
Oh c'mon, my ass.

1215
01:43:35,059 --> 01:43:37,794
We said every time.
- Okay.

1216
01:44:31,246 --> 01:44:32,298
You wanna join us?

1217
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:34,835
...for a second, but...
I'm with some friends.

1218
01:44:36,233 --> 01:44:38,418
So you must... must be this...

1219
01:44:38,419 --> 01:44:41,860
You must be the infamous Butterfly.
- Shhh.

1220
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:44,401
She don't know nothing about it.

1221
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:46,755
Know about what?
- What we're all gonna tell her.

1222
01:44:46,765 --> 01:44:47,647
Tell me what.

1223
01:44:47,666 --> 01:44:50,357
Yeah. Now thanks to you
I gotta tell her sooner than later.

1224
01:44:50,358 --> 01:44:51,868
Cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

1225
01:44:51,869 --> 01:44:54,629
I said a little something
about you in the air today.

1226
01:44:54,632 --> 01:44:57,296
Julia what the fuck did
you say about me on the radio?

1227
01:44:57,307 --> 01:45:00,785
All I said was I had a sexy
friend named Butterfly.

1228
01:45:00,786 --> 01:45:02,711
Who's in from out of town
for the weekend.

1229
01:45:02,712 --> 01:45:05,448
And we will be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight.

1230
01:45:05,449 --> 01:45:08,079
And if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.

1231
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,489
And I described you.

1232
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:12,919
And I said that if they spotted
you while we were out

1233
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,538
If they do something,
you'd do something.

1234
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:17,747
Okay. Now Julia I'm serious.
What did you say?

1235
01:45:17,748 --> 01:45:19,379
And what did you say I'd do.

1236
01:45:19,387 --> 01:45:23,708
Anywho, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring...

1237
01:45:23,736 --> 01:45:29,488
...or Marcy over here, who is an incredible
actress, could act it out for you, which...

1238
01:45:29,511 --> 01:45:32,933
I think will give you a better idea
of what you have in store for you tonight.

1239
01:45:32,934 --> 01:45:34,891
Okay. So just tell me your way.

1240
01:45:34,901 --> 01:45:36,400
So we'll act it out with Marcy?

1241
01:45:36,401 --> 01:45:37,286
Sure.

1242
01:45:37,287 --> 01:45:39,018
Okay, give Marcy your drink.

1243
01:45:39,174 --> 01:45:40,400
Thank you.

1244
01:45:40,643 --> 01:45:42,327
Okay. So...

1245
01:45:42,396 --> 01:45:44,312
You're in a club or a bar.

1246
01:45:44,313 --> 01:45:47,184
And Marcy is a kinda cute,
or kinda hot, or kinda sexy,

1247
01:45:47,185 --> 01:45:50,503
or better be fuckin' hysterically
funny, but not funny looking guy

1248
01:45:50,527 --> 01:45:52,259
...who you could fuck.

1249
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:53,077
Got it.

1250
01:45:53,078 --> 01:45:55,170
Okay. Marcy, take it.

1251
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:05,689
Howdy.

1252
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,538
Hi there.

1253
01:46:08,706 --> 01:46:12,530
Excuse me, but your name
wouldn't be Butterfly, would it?

1254
01:46:12,531 --> 01:46:16,910
Yes it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.

1255
01:46:16,968 --> 01:46:19,606
Barry.
- Pleased to meet you, Barry.

1256
01:46:19,635 --> 01:46:22,643
You all are getting me hot!

1257
01:46:25,562 --> 01:46:29,777
So is the Butterfly your real name?

1258
01:46:29,778 --> 01:46:31,490
Yes it is.

1259
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:33,563
How did you know my name, Barry?

1260
01:46:33,564 --> 01:46:36,200
I listened to Jungle Julia's show this morning.

1261
01:46:36,201 --> 01:46:37,631
Oh you did, did you?

1262
01:46:37,632 --> 01:46:39,986
Oh, yeah. I listen to her show every morning.

1263
01:46:39,987 --> 01:46:41,690
Oh you do, do you?

1264
01:46:41,691 --> 01:46:44,881
Yeah. She's like the coolest lady in town.

1265
01:46:45,323 --> 01:46:47,589
Don't you think she's got a big ass?

1266
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:48,854
No, man.

1267
01:46:49,234 --> 01:46:51,151
I like her ass that way.

1268
01:46:51,152 --> 01:46:53,438
She's got a black girls ass.

1269
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:55,842
Well that's what she always says,
but in actual fact...

1270
01:46:55,843 --> 01:46:58,022
She doesn't really have a black girls ass.

1271
01:46:58,023 --> 01:46:59,851
She's got a big ass.

1272
01:46:59,852 --> 01:47:01,087
Okay, what the fuck are you doing?

1273
01:47:01,088 --> 01:47:03,302
Oh, look who wants to get to
the point all of a sudden.

1274
01:47:03,303 --> 01:47:04,714
Okay, we'll get to the point.

1275
01:47:04,715 --> 01:47:06,826
But for your information, skinny-bitch,

1276
01:47:06,827 --> 01:47:12,597
Black men and a whole lot of mother fucking
white men have had plenty fun adoring my ass.

1277
01:47:12,598 --> 01:47:15,780
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

1278
01:47:15,781 --> 01:47:19,303
All right. If you're not gonna buy me
a drink, can I have mine back?

1279
01:47:20,607 --> 01:47:22,155
So Butterfly...

1280
01:47:22,156 --> 01:47:23,604
Can I buy you a drink?

1281
01:47:23,613 --> 01:47:24,732
I'd love one.

1282
01:47:24,733 --> 01:47:26,104
What can I get you?

1283
01:47:26,105 --> 01:47:27,769
I take a margarita.

1284
01:47:29,112 --> 01:47:30,329
Here you go.

1285
01:47:30,971 --> 01:47:33,141
So after they buy you a drink ...

1286
01:47:33,151 --> 01:47:35,857
When they their glass to toast ...

1287
01:47:36,003 --> 01:47:38,251
... they look you dead in the eye

1288
01:47:38,290 --> 01:47:40,519
... and repeat this poem.

1289
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:43,205
The woods are lovely

1290
01:47:43,234 --> 01:47:45,239
dark and deep

1291
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,117
And I have promises to keep

1292
01:47:47,118 --> 01:47:49,960
And miles to go before I sleep.

1293
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:52,382
Did you hear me Butterfly?

1294
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:55,672
Miles to go before you sleep.

1295
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:56,995
And then...

1296
01:47:57,045 --> 01:47:59,400
... if they say that

1297
01:48:00,607 --> 01:48:02,953
You gotta give him a lap dance.
- What?

1298
01:48:03,517 --> 01:48:05,950
If they call you Butterfly,
buy you a drink and repeat that poem ...

1299
01:48:05,951 --> 01:48:07,216
... you'll have to give him a lap dance.

1300
01:48:07,225 --> 01:48:09,162
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothing.

1301
01:48:09,163 --> 01:48:10,370
Look, you can do it or not.

1302
01:48:10,371 --> 01:48:13,191
But if you don't, everybody in Austin is
gonna think you're a chicken shit.

1303
01:48:13,210 --> 01:48:16,190
And I don't think you want everybody in
Austin thinkin' you're a chicken shit.

1304
01:48:16,191 --> 01:48:19,197
I ain't givin' nobody no lap dance
cause of what you said.

1305
01:48:19,265 --> 01:48:20,900
Look.

1306
01:48:20,901 --> 01:48:22,525
You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

1307
01:48:22,555 --> 01:48:25,553
I said you'll do it for the first guy
who says it. So ...

1308
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:27,927
Some geek comes over trying to be cool...

1309
01:48:27,928 --> 01:48:30,914
Just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

1310
01:48:30,915 --> 01:48:34,593
No harm, no foul.
But you get a free drink out of it.

1311
01:48:34,594 --> 01:48:37,016
But maybe a little later in the evening...

1312
01:48:37,017 --> 01:48:40,842
You've had a few drinks.
You're kinda loosey goosey.

1313
01:48:40,843 --> 01:48:42,866
You're safe with your girls.

1314
01:48:42,867 --> 01:48:45,650
Then some kinda cute, kinda hot, kinda sexy,

1315
01:48:45,718 --> 01:48:49,738
hysterically funny, but not funny
looking guy comes up and says it.

1316
01:48:49,845 --> 01:48:51,743
Then maybe you did it earlier...

1317
01:48:51,744 --> 01:48:53,368
... maybe you didn't.

1318
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:10,689
Any dead soldiers here?
- Ah, these two.

1319
01:50:10,709 --> 01:50:11,867
Thank you.

1320
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,011
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?

1321
01:50:15,012 --> 01:50:17,872
That's a good fucking question.

1322
01:50:28,423 --> 01:50:29,649
Lanna-Frank?

1323
01:50:30,613 --> 01:50:32,014
Where are you?

1324
01:50:33,956 --> 01:50:36,151
Well come over already,
we're waiting for you.

1325
01:50:37,582 --> 01:50:39,528
Shit. Hold on!

1326
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:53,071
So where are you?

1327
01:50:54,268 --> 01:50:57,344
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

1328
01:50:57,345 --> 01:50:59,495
No, we're not coming over there.

1329
01:50:59,496 --> 01:51:02,560
You come over here
like you said you would.

1330
01:51:02,852 --> 01:51:05,588
So is it Shauna and the girls
at the lakehouse this weekend?

1331
01:51:05,589 --> 01:51:07,711
Shauna?
- Ah.

1332
01:51:07,712 --> 01:51:09,024
Fuck, I...
- No.

1333
01:51:09,025 --> 01:51:12,509
Now there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

1334
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:14,756
whose name is Shanna,
has in common with each other.

1335
01:51:15,526 --> 01:51:16,898
We all hate the name Shauna.

1336
01:51:16,899 --> 01:51:20,100
And we really hate it
when people call us Shauna.

1337
01:51:56,647 --> 01:51:58,058
Just remember.

1338
01:51:58,059 --> 01:52:00,856
It's Shanna Banana, not Shauna Banuna.

1339
01:52:00,857 --> 01:52:03,908
Okay, but some point in the evening
I had fuckability style.

1340
01:52:04,165 --> 01:52:05,134
Yeah.

1341
01:52:05,135 --> 01:52:07,384
I mean it wasn't bullish, but...

1342
01:52:34,112 --> 01:52:36,380
Okay. Warren's sending over shots.

1343
01:52:36,722 --> 01:52:38,220
And you know the house rule.

1344
01:52:38,259 --> 01:52:40,721
If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.

1345
01:52:40,722 --> 01:52:41,601
Why?

1346
01:52:41,602 --> 01:52:43,265
Them's the Rules, baby.

1347
01:52:43,266 --> 01:52:44,960
Warren says it, we do it.

1348
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:46,828
I love that philosophy.

1349
01:52:46,838 --> 01:52:49,203
Warren says it, we do it.

1350
01:52:49,204 --> 01:52:51,733
So let's do it.

1351
01:52:51,734 --> 01:52:52,716
What is it?

1352
01:52:52,717 --> 01:52:54,449
Shot first. Questions later.

1353
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:57,106
Here we go. Post time.

1354
01:53:06,652 --> 01:53:10,487
Is that a tasted marriage
or is that a tasted beverage?

1355
01:53:10,488 --> 01:53:11,703
What the fuck is it?

1356
01:53:11,704 --> 01:53:12,959
Chartreuse.

1357
01:53:13,582 --> 01:53:17,027
The only liquor so good they
named a color after it.

1358
01:53:18,273 --> 01:53:20,638
Who's there for dose Chartreuse?

1359
01:53:22,467 --> 01:53:24,249
I'm going out for a smoke.

1360
01:53:24,254 --> 01:53:27,221
Okay-dokey.
Keep the hot flame alive.

1361
01:53:27,222 --> 01:53:28,536
Blow up the joint.

1362
01:53:41,651 --> 01:53:43,217
Drinks. What can I get you?

1363
01:53:43,218 --> 01:53:44,347
Shanna Banana?

1364
01:53:44,348 --> 01:53:46,926
Another bigass long island ice tea.

1365
01:53:46,965 --> 01:53:49,369
Bombay Sapphire and tonic. No ice.

1366
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:51,111
Oh, boy.

1367
01:54:13,233 --> 01:54:14,674
Oh wait, Punky.

1368
01:54:14,693 --> 01:54:16,543
One of the lights is off in the parking lot.

1369
01:54:16,601 --> 01:54:18,168
Flip it.

1370
01:55:19,721 --> 01:55:20,556
Now look.

1371
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:23,893
You can't look like you're trying to get her out of
here before Christian Simonson shows up.

1372
01:55:23,894 --> 01:55:26,664
But you gotta get her outta here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

1373
01:55:26,665 --> 01:55:28,850
What's the point? They're going to
Shanna's daddy's house

1374
01:55:28,851 --> 01:55:30,836
at Lake L.B.J. and it's no guys.

1375
01:55:30,837 --> 01:55:33,163
Absolutely no guys.
- Okay.

1376
01:55:33,172 --> 01:55:35,205
So after we bring the girls drinks...

1377
01:55:35,206 --> 01:55:38,345
In fairly rapid order, but not obvious...

1378
01:55:38,346 --> 01:55:40,567
We order two more rounds of shots.

1379
01:55:40,568 --> 01:55:42,487
Do you think they're gonna
fall for that?

1380
01:55:42,488 --> 01:55:44,633
We'll be very convincing.

1381
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:48,397
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fuckin' around.

1382
01:55:48,398 --> 01:55:50,052
We go to Jager shots.

1383
01:55:50,053 --> 01:55:52,567
Man, they drink Jager shots?

1384
01:55:52,568 --> 01:55:56,406
Dude, as long as a guy's buying the booze,
a fuckin' bitch'll drink anything.

1385
01:55:56,407 --> 01:55:59,348
C'mon, we can at least get one shot
of Jager down these fuckin' bitches throats.

1386
01:55:59,349 --> 01:56:01,825
After that, we'll see if they
get another Jager shot in them.

1387
01:56:01,826 --> 01:56:02,883
You never know.

1388
01:56:02,885 --> 01:56:05,286
That could be the shit that
puts them past the point of fuck-it.

1389
01:56:05,287 --> 01:56:07,206
And all of a sudden
no guys at the lake house

1390
01:56:07,207 --> 01:56:09,352
... turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.

1391
01:56:09,353 --> 01:56:10,960
My point exactly.

1392
01:56:14,893 --> 01:56:15,858
Check it out!

1393
01:56:20,445 --> 01:56:21,333
Jesus.

1394
01:56:25,026 --> 01:56:28,444
Dude, fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.

1395
01:57:01,013 --> 01:57:02,809
And where did you two disappear to?

1396
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:04,171
I had to get something out of the car

1397
01:57:04,172 --> 01:57:07,443
... and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.

1398
01:57:07,509 --> 01:57:09,448
Ah. Good for you, Nate.

1399
01:57:09,486 --> 01:57:13,288
See that pretty girl standing
by herself at the bar?

1400
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:16,144
Who, the dirty hippy?

1401
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,789
Meow. She's not a hippy.

1402
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:19,387
She might as well be a hippy.

1403
01:57:21,175 --> 01:57:23,000
Thank you, Tim boy.

1404
01:57:23,445 --> 01:57:24,617
Well.

1405
01:57:24,627 --> 01:57:26,281
Do you know what just happened to her?

1406
01:57:26,282 --> 01:57:29,374
No, but I know she's a skinny
fake blonde bitch.

1407
01:57:31,689 --> 01:57:34,206
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story.

1408
01:57:34,272 --> 01:57:35,794
What about her?

1409
01:57:37,837 --> 01:57:39,312
Hey, Warren!

1410
01:57:39,313 --> 01:57:42,330
Is there anybody in this place you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?

1411
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:45,630
Fair lady.

1412
01:57:45,639 --> 01:57:47,550
Your chariot awaits.

1413
01:57:47,558 --> 01:57:48,981
You've been eavesdropping?

1414
01:57:48,982 --> 01:57:52,289
There's eavesdropping and
can't help but hear.

1415
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:55,457
I think I belong in the latter category.

1416
01:57:55,513 --> 01:57:57,651
So, Icy Hot...

1417
01:57:57,652 --> 01:57:59,419
You offering me a ride home?

1418
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:00,988
I'm offering you a lift.

1419
01:58:00,989 --> 01:58:03,286
If when I'm ready to leave, you are too.

1420
01:58:03,287 --> 01:58:05,641
And when are you thinking about leaving?

1421
01:58:05,651 --> 01:58:07,921
Truthfully, I'm not thinking about it.

1422
01:58:07,958 --> 01:58:09,329
But when I do...

1423
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:11,675
You will be the first to know.

1424
01:58:11,676 --> 01:58:14,219
Will you be able to drive later?

1425
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:16,753
I know looks can be deceiving.

1426
01:58:17,367 --> 01:58:19,004
But I'm a teetotaler.

1427
01:58:19,033 --> 01:58:21,510
I've been drinking
club soda and lime all night.

1428
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:23,430
Now I'm building up to my big drink.

1429
01:58:23,431 --> 01:58:24,735
Which is what?

1430
01:58:24,736 --> 01:58:28,367
Virgin Pina Colada.

1431
01:58:28,396 --> 01:58:29,189
Okay.

1432
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:31,393
Why would someone who doesn't drink...

1433
01:58:31,412 --> 01:58:34,240
...spend hours at a bar drinking water?

1434
01:58:34,481 --> 01:58:38,008
You know a bar offers all kinds
of things other than alcohol.

1435
01:58:39,332 --> 01:58:40,863
Really?

1436
01:58:40,864 --> 01:58:42,357
Like what?

1437
01:58:44,249 --> 01:58:45,336
Women.

1438
01:58:45,639 --> 01:58:47,417
Nacho Grande Platters.

1439
01:58:47,748 --> 01:58:50,470
The fellowship of
some fascinating individuals

1440
01:58:50,471 --> 01:58:52,296
... like Warren here.

1441
01:58:52,475 --> 01:58:53,809
Fair enough.

1442
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:56,107
So what's your name, Icy?

1443
01:58:56,864 --> 01:58:58,301
Stuntman Mike.

1444
01:58:59,095 --> 01:59:00,977
Stuntman Mike's, your name?

1445
01:59:01,904 --> 01:59:03,909
You ask anybody.

1446
01:59:04,589 --> 01:59:05,866
Hey, Warren.

1447
01:59:06,149 --> 01:59:07,682
Who is this guy?

1448
01:59:07,767 --> 01:59:09,346
Stuntman Mike.

1449
01:59:09,421 --> 01:59:11,568
And who the hell is Stuntman Mike?

1450
01:59:11,569 --> 01:59:13,119
He's a stuntman.

1451
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:17,393
Warren, six shots of Wild Turkey.

1452
02:00:33,576 --> 02:00:35,751
It's about fucking time.

1453
02:00:39,014 --> 02:00:41,454
Take a picture, it lasts longer.

1454
02:00:42,267 --> 02:00:43,345
What?

1455
02:00:43,346 --> 02:00:46,513
That table seems to keep
getting your attention.

1456
02:00:46,541 --> 02:00:49,483
Is that the girl from the billboard outside?

1457
02:00:49,511 --> 02:00:50,267
Yep.

1458
02:00:50,389 --> 02:00:53,218
She sure is a striking looking woman.

1459
02:00:53,219 --> 02:00:55,033
You got gin, tequila...

1460
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:56,462
Look at that hair.

1461
02:00:56,463 --> 02:00:58,816
Lots of leaving conditioner.

1462
02:00:59,554 --> 02:01:01,341
Is that jealousy I detect?

1463
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:02,389
Hardly.

1464
02:01:02,853 --> 02:01:05,643
But if you wanna get with Jungle Julia...

1465
02:01:05,644 --> 02:01:08,234
There's a really easy way to do that.
- Really?

1466
02:01:08,253 --> 02:01:10,418
And what would that be?
- Get famous.

1467
02:01:10,419 --> 02:01:12,688
You won't have to find her.
She'll find you.

1468
02:01:12,689 --> 02:01:16,026
And you don't even wanna know
what she did for that billboard.

1469
02:01:16,027 --> 02:01:19,110
Enjoy it, cocksucker. You've earned it.

1470
02:01:19,649 --> 02:01:21,133
What did she ever do to you?

1471
02:01:21,134 --> 02:01:23,678
We went to school together.
From kindergarten through high school.

1472
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:25,682
That's what she did to me.

1473
02:01:25,683 --> 02:01:28,121
She was her height right now at twelve.

1474
02:01:28,598 --> 02:01:30,395
She was a monster.

1475
02:01:30,396 --> 02:01:32,323
Half the guys she still fucks
from the old class

1476
02:01:32,324 --> 02:01:34,425
she used to beat up
and terrorize in the 5th grade.

1477
02:01:34,426 --> 02:01:37,276
I see she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?

1478
02:01:37,277 --> 02:01:40,473
That pituitary case, might have kicked
my ass a couple of times.

1479
02:01:40,474 --> 02:01:43,508
Sorry, I'm built like a girl - not a black man.

1480
02:01:43,509 --> 02:01:47,368
But I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

1481
02:02:06,914 --> 02:02:07,584
Hey

1482
02:02:08,696 --> 02:02:10,634
Are you famous or something?

1483
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,043
Or something.

1484
02:02:12,109 --> 02:02:13,481
No really.

1485
02:02:14,852 --> 02:02:16,394
Hey, what do you do?

1486
02:02:17,708 --> 02:02:18,814
Really?

1487
02:02:19,069 --> 02:02:22,776
What I do is work my ass off to get my
own record label off the ground.

1488
02:02:22,777 --> 02:02:25,575
Why that girl wanted a picture of me...

1489
02:02:25,576 --> 02:02:28,110
... is because I'm a local D.J.

1490
02:02:30,171 --> 02:02:31,599
Wait a minute.

1491
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:35,921
You got a billboard by "Bug Kahuna Burger" don'tcha?

1492
02:02:35,922 --> 02:02:36,753
Yeah.

1493
02:02:37,784 --> 02:02:39,249
I got one there, too.

1494
02:02:45,908 --> 02:02:47,609
Jungle Julia Lucai.

1495
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,397
Stuntman Mike Mikki.

1496
02:02:51,165 --> 02:02:54,003
Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.

1497
02:02:54,352 --> 02:02:56,698
Now my friends and I are going to
continue to get our weed on.

1498
02:02:56,699 --> 02:02:57,880
Would you care for some?

1499
02:02:57,881 --> 02:02:59,260
Thank you, Julia.

1500
02:02:59,308 --> 02:03:00,850
But just the same...

1501
02:03:01,417 --> 02:03:02,495
No thanks.

1502
02:03:02,496 --> 02:03:03,979
Suit yourself.

1503
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:20,681
Sorry.

1504
02:03:20,682 --> 02:03:21,551
Nothing.

1505
02:03:24,445 --> 02:03:26,071
Who the fuck was that?

1506
02:03:30,573 --> 02:03:32,341
You got some voucher here.

1507
02:03:32,388 --> 02:03:34,629
I asked him what movies you worked on.

1508
02:03:34,630 --> 02:03:35,887
No fucking clue.

1509
02:03:36,171 --> 02:03:40,059
Well technically, I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

1510
02:03:40,201 --> 02:03:43,870
He shows me an episode of
"High Chaparral" - a guy falls off the horse.

1511
02:03:43,871 --> 02:03:45,184
He says it's him.

1512
02:03:46,877 --> 02:03:49,752
Do you know the show "The Virginian"?

1513
02:03:50,916 --> 02:03:53,536
There was another actor on
that show Gary Clarke

1514
02:03:53,537 --> 02:03:55,418
And I look like him a bit.

1515
02:03:55,419 --> 02:03:58,245
Obviously before I cut myself shaving.

1516
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,345
I like it.

1517
02:04:00,458 --> 02:04:04,789
Well damn if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.

1518
02:04:04,987 --> 02:04:08,278
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gery Clark.

1519
02:04:08,561 --> 02:04:09,421
And...

1520
02:04:10,046 --> 02:04:12,222
Then that show turned into
"The Men of Shiloh"

1521
02:04:12,223 --> 02:04:14,804
They brought on Lee Majors
and I doubled him.

1522
02:04:14,805 --> 02:04:18,218
From that point on I specialized
mostly in car stunts.

1523
02:04:19,456 --> 02:04:22,095
I did the whole third season of "Vegas"

1524
02:04:22,142 --> 02:04:24,411
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

1525
02:04:24,421 --> 02:04:27,059
And then Bob did another show,
"Gavilan"

1526
02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:30,076
And he brought me with
him on that, too.

1527
02:04:31,589 --> 02:04:33,197
And after that...

1528
02:04:36,998 --> 02:04:40,696
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talking about?

1529
02:04:41,026 --> 02:04:42,388
Sorry. No.

1530
02:04:42,663 --> 02:04:43,306
No.

1531
02:04:47,221 --> 02:04:49,292
So, how exactly...

1532
02:04:49,349 --> 02:04:52,687
... does one become a stuntman,
Stuntman Mike?

1533
02:04:54,654 --> 02:04:55,732
Well in Hollywood...

1534
02:04:55,733 --> 02:04:58,664
Anybody fool enough to throw himself
down a flight of stairs...

1535
02:04:58,665 --> 02:05:01,738
...can usually find somebody to pay him for it.

1536
02:05:01,842 --> 02:05:03,676
But really, I got into the business..

1537
02:05:03,677 --> 02:05:05,841
...why most people get in the stunt business.

1538
02:05:05,842 --> 02:05:06,825
How's that?

1539
02:05:06,836 --> 02:05:08,385
My brother got me in it.

1540
02:05:08,386 --> 02:05:09,558
Who' your brother?

1541
02:05:09,559 --> 02:05:10,910
Stuntman Bob.

1542
02:05:24,112 --> 02:05:26,845
I'm ready to play.
- Finally, yeah.

1543
02:05:26,873 --> 02:05:28,235
You need to catch up with us.

1544
02:05:28,236 --> 02:05:30,420
Now the party can start.
- Yeah.

1545
02:05:31,224 --> 02:05:33,087
... any who. I'm sorry.

1546
02:05:33,088 --> 02:05:34,184
Can you forgive me?

1547
02:05:35,706 --> 02:05:39,934
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

1548
02:05:39,935 --> 02:05:40,870
Promise.

1549
02:05:40,871 --> 02:05:43,130
Are you ready to go to the lake?

1550
02:05:43,131 --> 02:05:45,276
How about your little friend,
you want to bring him?

1551
02:05:45,277 --> 02:05:46,501
I thought no boys?

1552
02:05:46,502 --> 02:05:48,526
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

1553
02:05:48,527 --> 02:05:51,287
So how about it, boys or just us girls?

1554
02:05:51,589 --> 02:05:52,686
Us girls.

1555
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,954
Good idea.

1556
02:05:55,968 --> 02:05:56,932
Ladies?

1557
02:06:01,595 --> 02:06:03,098
Cheers, Butterfly.

1558
02:06:06,248 --> 02:06:10,097
The woods are lovely dark and deep

1559
02:06:10,144 --> 02:06:11,847
And I have promises to keep

1560
02:06:11,848 --> 02:06:14,674
And miles to go before I sleep.

1561
02:06:15,847 --> 02:06:17,729
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

1562
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:20,017
Miles to go.

1563
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:22,551
Before you sleep.

1564
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:26,720
Sorry, Stuntman Burt.
- Mike.

1565
02:06:27,487 --> 02:06:28,323
Mike.

1566
02:06:28,688 --> 02:06:31,014
She already broke off that dance.

1567
02:06:31,099 --> 02:06:32,944
Is that true?

1568
02:06:33,766 --> 02:06:35,969
Did I miss my chance?

1569
02:06:39,619 --> 02:06:41,473
Do I frighten you?

1570
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:47,469
Is it my scar?

1571
02:06:49,786 --> 02:06:51,251
It's your car.

1572
02:06:52,206 --> 02:06:53,625
Yeah, I know.

1573
02:06:53,681 --> 02:06:54,571
Sorry.

1574
02:06:55,772 --> 02:06:57,521
It's my mom's car.

1575
02:07:00,585 --> 02:07:02,269
Have you been following us?

1576
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:04,548
No. But that's what I love
about Austin.

1577
02:07:04,549 --> 02:07:06,760
It's just so damn small.

1578
02:07:06,761 --> 02:07:08,491
You've seen this guy before?

1579
02:07:08,492 --> 02:07:09,844
I saw him outside of Guero's.

1580
02:07:09,845 --> 02:07:12,444
I saw you outside of Guero's, too.

1581
02:07:13,352 --> 02:07:15,839
You saw my car. I saw your legs.

1582
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:19,547
Now look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

1583
02:07:19,548 --> 02:07:21,078
So you really weren't following us?

1584
02:07:21,079 --> 02:07:22,788
I'm not following you, Butterfly.

1585
02:07:22,846 --> 02:07:24,313
I just ...

1586
02:07:24,351 --> 02:07:25,571
... got lucky.

1587
02:07:27,245 --> 02:07:28,077
So...

1588
02:07:29,903 --> 02:07:31,784
How about that lap dance?

1589
02:07:31,869 --> 02:07:33,704
Sorry. It was a one time only offer.

1590
02:07:33,751 --> 02:07:36,777
And she did earlier
this evening at Antoine's.

1591
02:07:37,458 --> 02:07:38,470
No she didn't.

1592
02:07:38,471 --> 02:07:39,775
How do you know?

1593
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:41,270
I'm good that way.

1594
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:44,467
And you look a little touchd.

1595
02:07:44,468 --> 02:07:45,573
What's touchd?

1596
02:07:45,574 --> 02:07:46,897
Wounded, slightly.

1597
02:07:46,898 --> 02:07:48,419
Why should I be wounded?

1598
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:51,417
Because you expected guys to be
pestering you all night.

1599
02:07:51,418 --> 02:07:54,785
But from your look
I can tell nobody pestered you at all.

1600
02:07:55,097 --> 02:07:58,313
That kinda hurt your feelings
a little bit didn't it?

1601
02:07:59,494 --> 02:08:04,723
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.

1602
02:08:08,572 --> 02:08:09,376
So...

1603
02:08:11,155 --> 02:08:14,246
How about that lap dance?

1604
02:08:15,817 --> 02:08:18,965
I think I'm gonna have to give
you a rain check.

1605
02:08:21,377 --> 02:08:23,590
Well since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days...

1606
02:08:23,591 --> 02:08:26,209
That rain check will be worthless.

1607
02:08:27,638 --> 02:08:29,113
But that's okay.

1608
02:08:30,654 --> 02:08:33,747
I understand if I make you uncomfortable.

1609
02:08:33,898 --> 02:08:35,902
You're still a nice girl.

1610
02:08:35,998 --> 02:08:37,898
And I still like you.

1611
02:08:39,175 --> 02:08:41,813
But I must warn you of something.

1612
02:08:42,456 --> 02:08:44,632
You know how people say...

1613
02:08:44,633 --> 02:08:46,475
"You're okay in my book"

1614
02:08:46,476 --> 02:08:47,223
Or...

1615
02:08:47,224 --> 02:08:49,597
"In my book that's no good"

1616
02:08:50,193 --> 02:08:53,758
Well, I actually have...

1617
02:08:53,834 --> 02:08:55,573
... a book.

1618
02:08:55,630 --> 02:08:59,044
And everybody I ever meet goes in this book.

1619
02:08:59,839 --> 02:09:04,236
And now I've met you and
you're going in the book.

1620
02:09:05,427 --> 02:09:06,448
Except...

1621
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:08,898
I'm afraid I...

1622
02:09:08,899 --> 02:09:10,685
... must file you

1623
02:09:11,835 --> 02:09:12,885
... under

1624
02:09:13,944 --> 02:09:15,343
... chicken shit.

1625
02:09:15,344 --> 02:09:17,481
And what if I did it?

1626
02:09:17,482 --> 02:09:22,016
Well, I definitely couldn't file you under
chicken shit then, now could I?

1627
02:09:22,134 --> 02:09:24,049
What's your name again?

1628
02:09:24,593 --> 02:09:25,707
Stuntman Mike

1629
02:09:25,708 --> 02:09:27,583
Well, Stuntman Mike...

1630
02:09:28,011 --> 02:09:29,317
I'm Butterfly.

1631
02:09:29,631 --> 02:09:34,326
My friend Jungle Julia over here says that
jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

1632
02:09:34,327 --> 02:09:35,507
Yeah, it is.

1633
02:09:37,783 --> 02:09:40,773
I want you go get ready
for your lap dance.

1634
02:09:58,118 --> 02:09:59,175
Ready to go?

1635
02:09:59,527 --> 02:10:00,332
Yeah.

1636
02:10:00,465 --> 02:10:01,742
Bye.
- Bye.

1637
02:10:09,180 --> 02:10:12,514
Looking good, Cannonball Run!

1638
02:10:12,515 --> 02:10:14,400
He's just giving me a ride.

1639
02:10:14,401 --> 02:10:15,724
Ah. No doubt.

1640
02:10:15,810 --> 02:10:17,915
Have a nice ride.

1641
02:10:19,777 --> 02:10:21,382
Look, double fucks!

1642
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:27,678
I am not gonna fuck him.

1643
02:10:27,679 --> 02:10:29,030
I can hear you.

1644
02:10:30,592 --> 02:10:32,887
He's old enough to be my dad.

1645
02:10:32,888 --> 02:10:34,478
I can still hear you.

1646
02:10:37,087 --> 02:10:39,449
I love her ass.

1647
02:10:46,030 --> 02:10:47,926
Wow. That's fucking scary.

1648
02:10:47,927 --> 02:10:50,612
Well, I wanted to be impressive, and...

1649
02:10:50,613 --> 02:10:52,755
Scary tends to impress.

1650
02:10:53,937 --> 02:10:55,127
Is it safe?

1651
02:10:55,128 --> 02:10:56,785
No, it's better than safe.

1652
02:10:56,786 --> 02:10:58,281
It's Death Proof.

1653
02:10:58,604 --> 02:11:01,214
How do you make a car death proof?

1654
02:11:01,215 --> 02:11:03,153
Well, that's what stuntmen do.

1655
02:11:03,154 --> 02:11:05,619
You've seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash up...

1656
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:08,791
...there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walkin' away from?

1657
02:11:08,792 --> 02:11:09,684
Yeah.
- Well...

1658
02:11:09,685 --> 02:11:11,895
How do you think they accomplish that?

1659
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:12,714
CGI?

1660
02:11:14,466 --> 02:11:18,505
Well, unfortunately Pam, nowadays,
more often than not, you're right.

1661
02:11:18,619 --> 02:11:20,619
But back in the all or nothing days...

1662
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:23,936
The Vanishing Point days,
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days

1663
02:11:23,984 --> 02:11:26,285
The White Line Fever days...

1664
02:11:26,286 --> 02:11:28,733
Real cars smashing into real cars.

1665
02:11:28,734 --> 02:11:31,200
Real dumb people driving them.

1666
02:11:31,696 --> 02:11:34,963
So give the stunt team
the car you wanna smash up.

1667
02:11:34,964 --> 02:11:37,191
They take her, reinforce that
fucker everywhere and...

1668
02:11:37,192 --> 02:11:38,449
Voila!

1669
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:41,677
You got yourself a death proof automobile.

1670
02:11:43,658 --> 02:11:47,176
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you can make a car death proof.

1671
02:11:47,177 --> 02:11:51,233
I can drive this baby into a brick wall
doing 125 miles an hour.

1672
02:11:51,595 --> 02:11:53,025
Just for the experience.

1673
02:12:00,167 --> 02:12:01,862
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

1674
02:12:01,881 --> 02:12:03,901
Well this is a movie car.

1675
02:12:03,902 --> 02:12:07,035
Sometimes when you're shooting a crash,
the director wants to put a camera in the car.

1676
02:12:07,036 --> 02:12:09,673
And he'll shoot the crash from the inside.

1677
02:12:09,674 --> 02:12:13,416
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a crash box here.

1678
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:16,139
There you go.

1679
02:12:17,568 --> 02:12:19,425
You know when you asked
to drive me home...

1680
02:12:19,426 --> 02:12:21,682
You didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

1681
02:12:21,683 --> 02:12:24,406
Actually, I didn't ask to drive you home.

1682
02:12:24,407 --> 02:12:26,473
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, yes.

1683
02:12:26,474 --> 02:12:28,064
But look at the bright side, Pam.

1684
02:12:28,065 --> 02:12:30,874
I won't be getting fresh
putting my hand on your knee.

1685
02:12:32,856 --> 02:12:34,817
That is the bright side.

1686
02:12:35,723 --> 02:12:37,141
I thought so.

1687
02:13:02,737 --> 02:13:03,966
Well, Pam...

1688
02:13:03,975 --> 02:13:06,337
Which way you going,
left or right?

1689
02:13:06,338 --> 02:13:07,252
Right.

1690
02:13:07,813 --> 02:13:09,538
Oh, that's too bad.

1691
02:13:10,128 --> 02:13:10,938
Why?

1692
02:13:10,939 --> 02:13:14,804
Because it was a fifty fifty shot on
whether you'd be going left or right.

1693
02:13:14,805 --> 02:13:16,795
You see we're both going left.

1694
02:13:16,796 --> 02:13:19,275
You could have just as easily
been going left, too.

1695
02:13:19,276 --> 02:13:20,548
And if that was the case...

1696
02:13:20,549 --> 02:13:23,907
It would have been a while
before you started getting scared.

1697
02:13:23,908 --> 02:13:26,587
But since you're going the other way,

1698
02:13:26,938 --> 02:13:30,289
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to start getting scared...

1699
02:13:31,255 --> 02:13:32,596
... immediately.

1700
02:13:42,570 --> 02:13:43,114
Fuck!

1701
02:13:45,165 --> 02:13:46,677
Fuckin' let me out of here.

1702
02:13:47,838 --> 02:13:49,380
Stop the fucking car.

1703
02:14:31,634 --> 02:14:32,494
Okay.

1704
02:14:36,468 --> 02:14:37,650
I get it.

1705
02:14:38,289 --> 02:14:39,995
This was all joke?

1706
02:14:40,949 --> 02:14:43,033
How super funny it is.

1707
02:14:43,501 --> 02:14:45,166
Really funny. Okay.

1708
02:14:46,046 --> 02:14:47,456
You could stop now.

1709
02:14:50,856 --> 02:14:52,765
If you just drop me off?

1710
02:14:58,307 --> 02:15:01,191
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?

1711
02:15:02,282 --> 02:15:03,957
Well, that wasn't a lie.

1712
02:15:04,746 --> 02:15:07,298
This car is a hundred percent death proof.

1713
02:15:08,399 --> 02:15:10,951
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...

1714
02:15:10,952 --> 02:15:14,546
You really need to be sitting in my seat.

1715
02:15:52,083 --> 02:15:55,465
Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends.

1716
02:16:10,659 --> 02:16:14,820
No. It's Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Titch.

1717
02:16:15,365 --> 02:16:16,602
So you got it?

1718
02:16:17,157 --> 02:16:20,333
Thanks, honey.
You're gonna play it next song, right?

1719
02:16:20,849 --> 02:16:21,949
Good boy.

1720
02:16:26,138 --> 02:16:27,297
Bye-bye.

1721
02:16:27,941 --> 02:16:29,567
What do you want to hear?

1722
02:16:29,568 --> 02:16:31,836
Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Titch.

1723
02:16:31,837 --> 02:16:32,538
Who?

1724
02:16:32,597 --> 02:16:36,366
Dave, Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Titch.

1725
02:16:36,367 --> 02:16:37,831
Who the fuck are they?

1726
02:16:37,832 --> 02:16:41,750
For you information Pete Townshend
at one point almost quit The Who

1727
02:16:41,751 --> 02:16:44,190
And if he had, he would have
ended up in this group.

1728
02:16:44,191 --> 02:16:48,211
Thus making it
Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch Titch and Pete.

1729
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:50,880
And if you ask me, he should have.

1730
02:16:51,689 --> 02:16:53,120
That's my boy.

1731
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:43,948
I wanna hear this helluva song louder.

1732
02:19:36,511 --> 02:19:37,991
I don't remember.

1733
02:19:41,167 --> 02:19:42,521
Doctor Block!

1734
02:19:55,867 --> 02:19:57,046
Well.

1735
02:19:57,406 --> 02:20:00,776
What's the patient's prognosis, Doctor Block?

1736
02:20:01,341 --> 02:20:03,386
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

1737
02:20:03,387 --> 02:20:04,585
Come on now.

1738
02:20:05,637 --> 02:20:06,952
You just tell us.

1739
02:20:07,722 --> 02:20:08,998
How bad is it?

1740
02:20:13,673 --> 02:20:15,640
He got banged up real good.

1741
02:20:15,641 --> 02:20:17,813
Busted nose. Broken collar-bone.

1742
02:20:17,814 --> 02:20:20,160
Smashed up his left index finger.

1743
02:20:23,205 --> 02:20:24,666
He was real lucky.

1744
02:20:27,189 --> 02:20:28,562
That'll be all?

1745
02:20:28,611 --> 02:20:32,518
Well, that's more than enough.
Now I wanna thank you Doctor Block.

1746
02:20:36,209 --> 02:20:37,641
Son of a bitch.

1747
02:20:38,897 --> 02:20:40,338
So Pop?

1748
02:20:40,621 --> 02:20:41,935
What do you think?

1749
02:20:41,936 --> 02:20:43,942
Well Son, number one...

1750
02:20:44,478 --> 02:20:49,446
What I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

1751
02:20:49,524 --> 02:20:51,735
Well, give it a shot.

1752
02:20:51,736 --> 02:20:54,881
Well, what we have here is a
case of vehicular homicide.

1753
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:58,037
That old boy in there
murdered pretty little girls.

1754
02:20:58,038 --> 02:20:59,869
I mean he used a car
not a hatchet, but...

1755
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:01,894
They're dead just the same.

1756
02:21:03,006 --> 02:21:04,431
Well.

1757
02:21:04,432 --> 02:21:06,039
What are you gonna do?

1758
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:07,865
Not a goddamn thing.

1759
02:21:07,866 --> 02:21:10,860
D.A. says ain't no crime here.

1760
02:21:10,921 --> 02:21:14,075
One of the girls was
swimming in alcohol...

1761
02:21:14,076 --> 02:21:15,792
... floatin' on weed.

1762
02:21:15,793 --> 02:21:18,045
The old "Hooper" in here...

1763
02:21:18,069 --> 02:21:20,164
He was as clean as a whistle.

1764
02:21:20,224 --> 02:21:24,376
You actually think that he
premeditatedly murdered the girls?

1765
02:21:24,424 --> 02:21:26,227
Well, I can't prove it.

1766
02:21:26,228 --> 02:21:29,503
But since thinking don't cost nothin'
I can think it, and I do.

1767
02:21:29,504 --> 02:21:31,073
Yeah, but Pop

1768
02:21:31,074 --> 02:21:32,985
He got pretty banged up hisself.

1769
02:21:32,986 --> 02:21:34,579
Hell yeah, he got banged up.

1770
02:21:34,580 --> 02:21:39,912
But God damn, I mean the pretty girls looked like
a goddamn giant chewed them and spit them out.

1771
02:21:39,913 --> 02:21:43,103
Did any of them survive?
- Oh, shit.

1772
02:21:43,127 --> 02:21:45,744
Two tons of metal.
Two hundred miles an hour.

1773
02:21:53,683 --> 02:21:55,546
Why?

1774
02:21:55,619 --> 02:21:57,336
Well...

1775
02:21:57,348 --> 02:21:59,880
I'd guesstamate it's a sex thing.

1776
02:22:00,356 --> 02:22:02,085
The only way I can figure it.

1777
02:22:02,109 --> 02:22:04,082
High velocity impact.

1778
02:22:04,083 --> 02:22:06,493
Twisted metal. Busting glass.

1779
02:22:07,077 --> 02:22:11,108
All four souls taking
exactly at the same time.

1780
02:22:11,109 --> 02:22:16,246
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.

1781
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:23,491
Your timing couldn't be better, Zoe.

1782
02:22:23,492 --> 02:22:28,434
It just so happens that we're all three
off duty for the next three days of shooting.

1783
02:22:28,435 --> 02:22:30,589
Fuckin' hell, how does that happen?

1784
02:22:30,590 --> 02:22:33,792
Well, I'm doing Lindsey Lohan's make up,
and she's off for the next three days.

1785
02:22:33,793 --> 02:22:36,591
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time, so Kim's free.

1786
02:22:36,592 --> 02:22:41,036
And Lee's on a will notify
for the next four days.

1787
02:22:41,037 --> 02:22:42,850
So how's the shoot going?

1788
02:22:42,851 --> 02:22:43,665
Great.

1789
02:22:43,666 --> 02:22:46,721
We're having the best time.
The director, Cecil Evans is so much fun.

1790
02:22:46,722 --> 02:22:49,290
We're making the coolest movie and partying.

1791
02:22:49,291 --> 02:22:51,153
All the time.
- Hell, yeah.

1792
02:22:51,178 --> 02:22:54,209
The next job after this one is
definitely gonna suck.

1793
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:55,975
So let's hear it ladies.

1794
02:22:55,976 --> 02:22:58,447
"Set Romances", who's getting it off?

1795
02:22:58,448 --> 02:23:00,675
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

1796
02:23:00,687 --> 02:23:02,866
Ohh, Toolbox.

1797
02:23:02,867 --> 02:23:04,899
The name sounds promising.
- He's a grip.

1798
02:23:04,900 --> 02:23:06,532
What he is, is a pervert.

1799
02:23:06,533 --> 02:23:09,928
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

1800
02:23:09,929 --> 02:23:12,096
What's his perversion?

1801
02:23:13,313 --> 02:23:15,469
He likes to watch me pee.

1802
02:23:16,443 --> 02:23:20,351
Lee is sitting on the toilet and
Toolbox is watching her pee.

1803
02:23:20,352 --> 02:23:22,568
P-I-SS-I-N-G.

1804
02:23:23,931 --> 02:23:25,576
Yeah, but not no more.

1805
02:23:25,844 --> 02:23:28,486
Now she's gettin' it on with The Rock.

1806
02:23:28,487 --> 02:23:29,971
Your havin' one off with The Rock?

1807
02:23:30,153 --> 02:23:32,211
Not the Real Rock.
He's an electrician named Bruce.

1808
02:23:32,625 --> 02:23:34,755
And Kim started calling him The Rock
cause kinda looks like The Rock.

1809
02:23:34,756 --> 02:23:36,850
So now we all just call him The Rock.

1810
02:23:36,851 --> 02:23:39,223
Kim - dick department - let's hear it.

1811
02:23:40,246 --> 02:23:41,744
No dick this trip.

1812
02:23:41,745 --> 02:23:42,973
I gotta man.

1813
02:23:42,974 --> 02:23:44,873
How long have you had this boyfriend?

1814
02:23:44,874 --> 02:23:46,176
About three months.

1815
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:47,905
Who did you steal him from?

1816
02:23:48,015 --> 02:23:49,025
Nobody.

1817
02:23:49,719 --> 02:23:51,557
Kim.
- What?

1818
02:23:51,558 --> 02:23:53,615
He totally had a girlfriend.

1819
02:23:53,616 --> 02:23:57,171
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

1820
02:23:57,172 --> 02:23:59,570
I did not steal him.

1821
02:23:59,571 --> 02:24:02,797
I didn't steal any of them... They just...

1822
02:24:03,209 --> 02:24:05,170
... jumped ship.

1823
02:24:06,449 --> 02:24:08,117
So what's your story, Abernathy?

1824
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:10,674
Abby's got the big Kahuna.

1825
02:24:10,675 --> 02:24:13,523
I had a set crush on Cecil.

1826
02:24:13,596 --> 02:24:16,823
Set crush, nigga please.
You were his set wife.

1827
02:24:16,824 --> 02:24:19,026
Were and had
being the key words here.

1828
02:24:19,027 --> 02:24:21,838
Bitch, you two are still into each
other and you know it.

1829
02:24:21,839 --> 02:24:24,444
Oh yeah, well if he's
so in love with me, then...

1830
02:24:24,445 --> 02:24:28,499
Why did he fuck Daryl Hannah's stand in?

1831
02:24:30,435 --> 02:24:34,222
Yes, men are dogs. Oh, it's so funny.

1832
02:24:34,223 --> 02:24:35,622
Oh, it's so funny.

1833
02:24:35,623 --> 02:24:38,459
Oh stop actin' like you all hurt,
your ass is just mad.

1834
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:40,237
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

1835
02:24:40,238 --> 02:24:43,414
Bitch, you need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

1836
02:24:43,415 --> 02:24:46,155
Oh, well now you put it like that.

1837
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:49,564
I haven't told you the best part.

1838
02:24:49,565 --> 02:24:52,571
He fucked her on my birthday.

1839
02:24:52,572 --> 02:24:55,517
Oh. That's a horse of a different color.

1840
02:24:55,518 --> 02:24:56,917
Thank you.

1841
02:24:56,918 --> 02:24:58,877
Did he know it was your birthday?

1842
02:24:58,878 --> 02:25:01,727
He's a director, he's kind of busy.

1843
02:25:01,788 --> 02:25:03,895
He ate a piece of my birthday cake

1844
02:25:03,896 --> 02:25:05,914
... and he got me a present.

1845
02:25:05,915 --> 02:25:07,536
Yeah. I think he knew.

1846
02:25:09,532 --> 02:25:11,104
What did he give?

1847
02:25:14,732 --> 02:25:16,412
He made me a tape.

1848
02:25:16,413 --> 02:25:18,736
He made you a tape?
- Yeah.

1849
02:25:18,737 --> 02:25:21,464
He didn't burn you a CD,
he made you a tape?

1850
02:25:21,538 --> 02:25:24,788
Yeah.
- Ah man, it's so romantic.

1851
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:27,857
Yes, I know what you're gonna say,
so don't even go there.

1852
02:25:27,858 --> 02:25:29,842
It sounds like the test of true love to me.

1853
02:25:29,843 --> 02:25:33,640
I know you guys like him, he's likeable.

1854
02:25:33,641 --> 02:25:36,562
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.

1855
02:25:36,563 --> 02:25:38,547
How can you not be on my side?

1856
02:25:38,548 --> 02:25:40,239
Well I admit that sounds bad.

1857
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:41,445
It is bad.

1858
02:25:41,446 --> 02:25:44,697
It just sounds like there's a little
more to it than that.

1859
02:25:44,698 --> 02:25:47,059
Were you two fucking?
- Hell no.

1860
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:49,469
Hello, is your name Abernathy?

1861
02:25:49,470 --> 02:25:50,371
Sorry.

1862
02:25:50,372 --> 02:25:52,550
The answer to your question is no.

1863
02:25:52,551 --> 02:25:53,999
Of course not.

1864
02:25:54,986 --> 02:25:57,202
What do you mean, "no, of course not"?

1865
02:25:57,203 --> 02:26:00,440
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years,

1866
02:26:00,441 --> 02:26:02,230
is because girls will fuck him.

1867
02:26:02,231 --> 02:26:05,895
And if you fuck Cecil, you
don't become one of his girlfriends.

1868
02:26:05,896 --> 02:26:09,354
Not to say I want to be his girlfriend.

1869
02:26:09,355 --> 02:26:11,716
But if I did want to be his girlfriend...

1870
02:26:11,717 --> 02:26:14,346
If I fucked him, I wouldn't be his girlfriend.

1871
02:26:14,347 --> 02:26:16,745
I'd be one of his regulars.

1872
02:26:18,059 --> 02:26:20,494
And I'm just getting
too fuckin' old for that shit.

1873
02:26:20,495 --> 02:26:22,394
Have you let him do anything?

1874
02:26:22,395 --> 02:26:23,149
Yes.

1875
02:26:24,975 --> 02:26:26,850
I've let him give me a foot massage.

1876
02:26:26,851 --> 02:26:30,783
And when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hands.

1877
02:26:30,784 --> 02:26:33,570
Bitch, you might be acting like
you're twelve years old.

1878
02:26:33,571 --> 02:26:35,300
But he's just acting like a man.

1879
02:26:35,301 --> 02:26:37,394
You need to break that nigga off a piece.

1880
02:26:37,395 --> 02:26:39,232
Let me get this straight.

1881
02:26:39,695 --> 02:26:41,363
You're not fuckin' him.

1882
02:26:41,375 --> 02:26:43,116
You're not sucking him.

1883
02:26:43,117 --> 02:26:45,259
You're not giving him any tongue.

1884
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:47,608
But Daryl Hannah's stand in is.

1885
02:26:47,609 --> 02:26:50,885
You know some cultures might say
he made the wise choice.

1886
02:26:56,851 --> 02:26:59,590
Zoe, Kim and I are in the
Philippines at an outdoor rave.

1887
02:26:59,591 --> 02:27:00,649
What were you working on?

1888
02:27:00,650 --> 02:27:02,902
"Three Kicks To The Head Part III"

1889
02:27:02,903 --> 02:27:06,080
And admittedly, we were a little fucked up.

1890
02:27:06,481 --> 02:27:07,772
Cheers to that.

1891
02:27:10,852 --> 02:27:11,948
So Zoe...

1892
02:27:13,385 --> 02:27:15,309
The genius...

1893
02:27:15,310 --> 02:27:16,928
...wants to take a picture of me.

1894
02:27:18,584 --> 02:27:21,276
It's dark as hell and you can't see shit.

1895
02:27:21,604 --> 02:27:25,354
So she's got her camera and keeps saying,
"Step back a little."

1896
02:27:25,366 --> 02:27:26,486
So I do.

1897
02:27:26,499 --> 02:27:27,740
Then...

1898
02:27:27,741 --> 02:27:31,052
"A little further",
so I step back a little further.

1899
02:27:31,053 --> 02:27:33,780
Then "A little more", so I do.

1900
02:27:34,608 --> 02:27:36,056
Then I realize...

1901
02:27:36,057 --> 02:27:39,685
I'm right at the edge
of a seven foot concrete ditch.

1902
02:27:40,112 --> 02:27:44,555
With God knows how many rocks and
broken bottles and rats in it.

1903
02:27:44,556 --> 02:27:48,378
And if I fell in that fuckin' thing, I probably
would've broken my fuckin' neck.

1904
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:52,384
So I'm yelling at her,
"Zoe, you almost killed me."

1905
02:27:54,088 --> 02:27:57,534
So we laugh about it,
and walk a little further...

1906
02:27:58,155 --> 02:28:00,846
And Zoe starts fuckin' around

1907
02:28:00,847 --> 02:28:06,569
And then if she doesn't fall
in the fuckin' ditch.

1908
02:28:12,109 --> 02:28:14,421
I remember taking a step looking down.

1909
02:28:14,422 --> 02:28:17,964
Just as I'm thinking
"Oh, there's that ditch Abby was talking about."

1910
02:28:17,965 --> 02:28:20,217
Bam, I'm in the fuckin' ditch.

1911
02:28:20,717 --> 02:28:21,886
What happened?

1912
02:28:21,947 --> 02:28:23,809
What? With Zoe the Cat?

1913
02:28:24,442 --> 02:28:25,465
Nothing.

1914
02:28:25,526 --> 02:28:27,376
If I fell in that fuckin' thing,

1915
02:28:27,377 --> 02:28:29,471
They would have had to
helicopter me out of there.

1916
02:28:29,543 --> 02:28:32,137
Zoe just lands on her feet.

1917
02:28:32,197 --> 02:28:33,489
But then later...

1918
02:28:33,526 --> 02:28:36,204
I started feeling a little bad about myself.

1919
02:28:36,205 --> 02:28:38,262
Zoe falls in the ditch...

1920
02:28:38,263 --> 02:28:39,455
And it's nothing.

1921
02:28:39,456 --> 02:28:41,269
We were laughing about it.

1922
02:28:41,270 --> 02:28:43,519
If I fell in that fuckin' thing,

1923
02:28:43,529 --> 02:28:45,964
I probably would have been fuckin' paralyzed.

1924
02:28:45,974 --> 02:28:48,059
Oh honey, you can't think like that.

1925
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:49,724
We all have our individual talents.

1926
02:28:49,725 --> 02:28:51,702
That just happens to be one of Zoe's.

1927
02:28:53,182 --> 02:28:54,614
Physically speaking...

1928
02:28:54,702 --> 02:28:56,242
Zoe is amazing.

1929
02:28:56,446 --> 02:28:59,280
I mean agility, reflexes, nimbleness.

1930
02:28:59,943 --> 02:29:03,080
There's few human beings
that can fuck with Zoe on that front.

1931
02:29:03,148 --> 02:29:06,206
Kim, I like you, too.

1932
02:29:06,235 --> 02:29:07,784
Having said that...

1933
02:29:07,785 --> 02:29:10,696
Before you get too envious
of Zoe's prowess...

1934
02:29:10,697 --> 02:29:13,531
You're missing the
most important part of that story.

1935
02:29:13,532 --> 02:29:15,762
You didn't fall in the ditch.

1936
02:29:15,763 --> 02:29:16,736
Zoe did.

1937
02:29:17,106 --> 02:29:20,798
Zoe even knew there was a ditch
there because you told her.

1938
02:29:20,915 --> 02:29:22,931
And she still fell in.

1939
02:29:23,018 --> 02:29:26,593
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

1940
02:29:27,606 --> 02:29:29,117
I resemble that remark.

1941
02:29:32,633 --> 02:29:34,688
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?

1942
02:29:37,912 --> 02:29:39,412
Check it out, bitch.

1943
02:29:39,987 --> 02:29:41,564
Oh, nice one, Mate.

1944
02:29:42,354 --> 02:29:43,455
What's a Roscoe?

1945
02:29:43,475 --> 02:29:44,595
Roscoe is a pistol.

1946
02:29:45,626 --> 02:29:46,962
You carry a gun?

1947
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:47,935
Uh-huh.

1948
02:29:47,936 --> 02:29:49,942
Do you have a license to carry it?

1949
02:29:49,943 --> 02:29:50,741
Yeah.

1950
02:29:50,858 --> 02:29:54,335
When I became a Secret Service Agent,
they gave me a license.

1951
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:56,224
I didn't know you were.

1952
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,315
Okay, I didn't say it.

1953
02:30:00,344 --> 02:30:02,135
Stop looking at me, I didn't say it.

1954
02:30:04,143 --> 02:30:06,043
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

1955
02:30:06,044 --> 02:30:07,085
Yes.

1956
02:30:07,105 --> 02:30:09,101
Do I approve?

1957
02:30:09,179 --> 02:30:10,279
No.

1958
02:30:10,338 --> 02:30:11,516
Do I know?

1959
02:30:11,536 --> 02:30:12,229
Yes.

1960
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:13,407
Look.

1961
02:30:13,408 --> 02:30:17,469
I don't know what futuristic utopia
you live in, but the world I live in...

1962
02:30:17,470 --> 02:30:19,076
A bitch need a gun.

1963
02:30:19,077 --> 02:30:21,053
You can't get around the fact...

1964
02:30:21,092 --> 02:30:22,845
... that people who carry guns

1965
02:30:22,846 --> 02:30:25,349
... tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

1966
02:30:25,408 --> 02:30:27,054
And you can't get around the fact...

1967
02:30:27,063 --> 02:30:30,589
that if I go down in the laundry room
in my building at midnight enough times

1968
02:30:30,599 --> 02:30:32,392
I might get my ass raped.

1969
02:30:32,393 --> 02:30:34,427
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

1970
02:30:34,428 --> 02:30:37,963
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry.

1971
02:30:37,964 --> 02:30:40,914
There are other things
you can carry other than a gun.

1972
02:30:40,963 --> 02:30:42,297
Pepper spray.

1973
02:30:42,512 --> 02:30:46,720
But if a motherfucker try to rape me,
I don't wanna give him a skin rash.

1974
02:30:46,730 --> 02:30:49,155
I wanna shut that nigga down.

1975
02:30:50,392 --> 02:30:52,467
How about a knife at least?

1976
02:30:53,129 --> 02:30:56,675
You know what happens to
motherfuckers carrying knives?

1977
02:30:56,997 --> 02:30:58,886
They get shot.

1978
02:30:58,964 --> 02:30:59,928
Look...

1979
02:30:59,957 --> 02:31:01,809
If I ever become a famous actress

1980
02:31:01,818 --> 02:31:03,445
I won't carry a gun.

1981
02:31:03,484 --> 02:31:05,753
I'll hire me a do-dirt-nigga
and he'll carry the gun.

1982
02:31:05,773 --> 02:31:07,712
And when shit goes down,
I'll sit back and laugh.

1983
02:31:07,713 --> 02:31:08,783
But until that day...

1984
02:31:08,784 --> 02:31:10,398
It's Wild West motherfucker.

1985
02:31:10,787 --> 02:31:11,752
So Zoe!

1986
02:31:12,229 --> 02:31:14,264
You thought about
what you wanna do first?

1987
02:31:15,064 --> 02:31:17,022
It just so happens...

1988
02:31:17,032 --> 02:31:19,243
I know exactly what I wanna do.

1989
02:31:19,331 --> 02:31:20,645
Oh, really?

1990
02:31:20,830 --> 02:31:22,944
And what would that be?

1991
02:31:23,013 --> 02:31:25,028
To me there's no point in being in America

1992
02:31:25,077 --> 02:31:27,805
unless you're gonna
drive a Destroit muscle car.

1993
02:31:27,806 --> 02:31:29,499
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger.

1994
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:31,935
Fuck me swinging, balls out.

1995
02:31:34,868 --> 02:31:37,225
Well, I guess we can talk to transpo-

1996
02:31:37,536 --> 02:31:39,961
But does it have to be a
Dodge Challenger?

1997
02:31:39,962 --> 02:31:41,082
Not just that.

1998
02:31:41,083 --> 02:31:44,832
It has to be a 1970 Dodge
Challenger with a 440 engine.

1999
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:51,612
How in the fuck...
Do you expect to do that?

2000
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:52,936
No worries, Mate.

2001
02:31:52,975 --> 02:31:55,060
I've got it all worked out.

2002
02:31:55,206 --> 02:31:56,873
When I knew I was coming here,

2003
02:31:56,874 --> 02:32:00,339
I went online and found out that the
local paper here in Tennessee...

2004
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:02,317
Is the Lebanon News Sentinel.

2005
02:32:02,318 --> 02:32:03,146
So back home...

2006
02:32:03,147 --> 02:32:05,093
I'm sorry, where's home,
Australia, right?

2007
02:32:07,568 --> 02:32:09,234
What do you mean by that, Mate?

2008
02:32:09,679 --> 02:32:11,381
Zoe's from New Zealand.

2009
02:32:11,652 --> 02:32:13,180
And you never...

2010
02:32:13,219 --> 02:32:14,913
I repeat never...

2011
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:16,791
... call a Kiwi an Aussie.

2012
02:32:16,829 --> 02:32:19,204
That is unless you want your ass kicked.

2013
02:32:20,975 --> 02:32:22,007
I'm so sorry...

2014
02:32:23,894 --> 02:32:25,101
That's okay.

2015
02:32:25,627 --> 02:32:28,352
We're just taking the piss
out of you, Mate.

2016
02:32:28,916 --> 02:32:31,516
Auckland - to answer your question.

2017
02:32:32,216 --> 02:32:35,030
Anyway, I subscribed to the
local paper a month ago.

2018
02:32:35,039 --> 02:32:38,767
Now why the fuck you want a local
redneck newspaper in New Zealand?

2019
02:32:38,768 --> 02:32:41,034
Pipe down and I'll tell you.

2020
02:32:41,307 --> 02:32:43,029
I've been getting the
paper for the last month.

2021
02:32:43,030 --> 02:32:45,881
I've been checking the classifieds
in the back looking at cars for sale.

2022
02:32:45,929 --> 02:32:46,853
So.

2023
02:32:46,913 --> 02:32:50,766
As of yesterday,
for sale in this town

2024
02:32:50,874 --> 02:32:54,056
Some dude is selling his stock
1970 Dodge Challenger

2025
02:32:54,057 --> 02:32:57,833
with a 440 engine,
and a white paint job.

2026
02:32:58,134 --> 02:32:59,885
And you wanna buy it?

2027
02:33:00,694 --> 02:33:03,166
Kim, I may be stupid...

2028
02:33:03,167 --> 02:33:04,986
But I'm not bloody stupid.

2029
02:33:04,987 --> 02:33:08,334
I wanna say I wanna buy it,
so he'll let me test drive it.

2030
02:33:08,917 --> 02:33:12,071
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?

2031
02:33:12,996 --> 02:33:15,643
Kowalski from "Vanishing Point", Mate.

2032
02:33:15,644 --> 02:33:17,688
It's a fucking classic.

2033
02:33:17,689 --> 02:33:20,228
If I can get this guy to
let me drive it without him

2034
02:33:20,229 --> 02:33:22,904
I'll blow the doors of that bitch.

2035
02:33:23,011 --> 02:33:24,803
What's "Vanishing Point"?

2036
02:33:26,087 --> 02:33:28,004
What's "Vanishing Point"?

2037
02:33:28,130 --> 02:33:29,065
Abes,

2038
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:31,110
I'm supposed to be the illiterate one.

2039
02:33:31,111 --> 02:33:33,990
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

2040
02:33:33,991 --> 02:33:36,472
Actually Zoe, most girls...

2041
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:38,720
...wouldn't know "Vanishing Point"

2042
02:33:38,769 --> 02:33:41,046
Excuse me, most girls?

2043
02:33:41,047 --> 02:33:42,915
What the fuck are you two?

2044
02:33:42,934 --> 02:33:44,949
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.

2045
02:33:44,959 --> 02:33:46,477
Of course we watched it.

2046
02:33:46,478 --> 02:33:48,899
You all grew up watching that
"Pretty in Pink" shit.

2047
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:50,954
I like "Pretty in Pink".

2048
02:33:51,304 --> 02:33:53,942
What so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

2049
02:33:53,943 --> 02:33:55,918
Of course I did. I'm a girl.

2050
02:33:55,957 --> 02:33:57,883
But I also watched car shit, too.

2051
02:33:57,962 --> 02:33:59,031
"Vanishing point"

2052
02:33:59,032 --> 02:34:00,599
"Dirty Marry", "Crazy Larry"

2053
02:34:00,628 --> 02:34:02,029
"Gone in 60 Seconds"

2054
02:34:02,282 --> 02:34:03,440
The real one.

2055
02:34:03,441 --> 02:34:05,154
Not that Angelina Jolie bullshit.

2056
02:34:05,533 --> 02:34:09,017
We have an outdoor theatre in Auckland
that plays "Vanishing Point"

2057
02:34:09,066 --> 02:34:10,312
"Big Wednesday"

2058
02:34:10,313 --> 02:34:11,733
All the classics.

2059
02:34:28,397 --> 02:34:30,065
What do you girls want?

2060
02:34:34,421 --> 02:34:37,439
You've got a 1970 Dodge
Challenger for sale?

2061
02:34:37,507 --> 02:34:38,626
Right up here ladies.

2062
02:34:53,270 --> 02:34:55,907
There she is off the fuckin' hook.

2063
02:34:56,265 --> 02:34:58,522
Fucking legendary, Mate.

2064
02:35:02,914 --> 02:35:04,453
If you'll excuse me for a moment

2065
02:35:04,454 --> 02:35:06,389
I'd like to have a word alone
with my business associate.

2066
02:35:06,409 --> 02:35:08,219
You ladies take your time.

2067
02:35:14,894 --> 02:35:16,376
What are you waiting for?

2068
02:35:16,395 --> 02:35:17,768
Ask him you want to drive it by yourself.

2069
02:35:17,797 --> 02:35:18,624
I intend to.

2070
02:35:18,625 --> 02:35:20,580
But first I need to ask you something.

2071
02:35:20,638 --> 02:35:21,456
What?

2072
02:35:21,913 --> 02:35:24,522
If he lets us take it out on our own

2073
02:35:24,561 --> 02:35:26,556
I wanna play Ships Mast.

2074
02:35:27,101 --> 02:35:28,832
Aww, hell no.
- Keep it down.

2075
02:35:28,833 --> 02:35:30,410
Ain't no way, I'm doing Ships Mast.

2076
02:35:30,411 --> 02:35:32,133
For Christsakes, Kim.
- Don't blaspheme.

2077
02:35:32,181 --> 02:35:33,077
Sorry.

2078
02:35:33,135 --> 02:35:34,215
Now.

2079
02:35:34,565 --> 02:35:36,687
What did you say after the last time?

2080
02:35:36,765 --> 02:35:39,276
I know what I said.
- What did you say?

2081
02:35:39,316 --> 02:35:41,389
I know I said we shouldn't
do this again, but...

2082
02:35:41,390 --> 02:35:42,868
No, you didn't say "We shouldn't"

2083
02:35:42,869 --> 02:35:44,659
You said, we ain't ever
gonna do that again.

2084
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:46,469
But.
- But my ass.

2085
02:35:46,470 --> 02:35:49,720
You said, not only are we never
gonna play Ships Mast again

2086
02:35:49,721 --> 02:35:52,707
But you also said, if you
ever do what you try to do now,

2087
02:35:52,708 --> 02:35:57,720
to not only refuse, but that I had permission to
physically restrain your ass, if necessary.

2088
02:35:57,721 --> 02:36:00,036
Now, did you or did you not say that?

2089
02:36:00,037 --> 02:36:01,564
Naw naw naw naw.

2090
02:36:01,856 --> 02:36:03,753
Answer the question, muthafucker!

2091
02:36:03,754 --> 02:36:05,417
Did you or did you not say that?

2092
02:36:05,418 --> 02:36:07,685
Yes, I said that. However -

2093
02:36:07,686 --> 02:36:09,573
Whatever with your however.

2094
02:36:11,023 --> 02:36:12,133
I know I said that.

2095
02:36:12,134 --> 02:36:13,291
And I know I meant it.

2096
02:36:13,292 --> 02:36:14,547
Damn skimpy you meant it.

2097
02:36:14,548 --> 02:36:17,233
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America.

2098
02:36:17,281 --> 02:36:18,596
Nigga please.

2099
02:36:18,597 --> 02:36:23,452
Really, I meant we should never play Ships
Mast again in New Zealand or Australia.

2100
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:25,360
You are such a liar.

2101
02:36:25,759 --> 02:36:26,470
Look.

2102
02:36:27,024 --> 02:36:28,368
I know what I said, when I said that.

2103
02:36:28,374 --> 02:36:30,830
But when I said it, I didn't know
I'd ever come to America.

2104
02:36:30,831 --> 02:36:33,663
And when I said it,
if I had known I'd come to America

2105
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:38,461
and have the opportunity to play Ships Mast
on a fuckin' Vanishing Point Challenger

2106
02:36:38,462 --> 02:36:41,069
I would have added a however.

2107
02:36:41,098 --> 02:36:42,528
Right?

2108
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:50,402
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

2109
02:36:50,403 --> 02:36:51,979
However...

2110
02:36:52,048 --> 02:36:54,870
Just because you talked yourself
into some stupid shit

2111
02:36:54,871 --> 02:36:57,157
It doesn't mean I have
lost my goddamn mind.

2112
02:36:57,158 --> 02:36:59,064
You need two people
to play ships mast.

2113
02:36:59,065 --> 02:37:00,807
And I ain't playing.

2114
02:37:08,437 --> 02:37:09,858
I'll be your best friend.

2115
02:37:09,859 --> 02:37:13,721
I don't need me no best friend that lives
on the other side of planet earth.

2116
02:37:13,722 --> 02:37:15,035
I'll crack your back.

2117
02:37:15,036 --> 02:37:16,641
You'll crack it anyway.

2118
02:37:16,642 --> 02:37:19,230
Of course I would crack it anyway.

2119
02:37:19,289 --> 02:37:20,446
But now...

2120
02:37:20,447 --> 02:37:21,420
While I'm here...

2121
02:37:21,421 --> 02:37:23,250
I'll be your back cracking slave.

2122
02:37:23,269 --> 02:37:25,965
Whenever you want it, you've got it.
You don't even have to ask for it.

2123
02:37:26,004 --> 02:37:28,029
You just order me to do it,

2124
02:37:28,116 --> 02:37:30,384
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

2125
02:37:35,047 --> 02:37:37,810
So we're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him.

2126
02:37:37,811 --> 02:37:41,616
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.

2127
02:37:41,977 --> 02:37:42,754
What?

2128
02:37:42,803 --> 02:37:45,500
I said we're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him.

2129
02:37:45,501 --> 02:37:47,135
I heard what you said.

2130
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:51,143
I just can't believe what you said.

2131
02:37:51,845 --> 02:37:54,093
You know you two guys got
some fuckin' balls.

2132
02:37:54,112 --> 02:37:54,773
What?

2133
02:37:54,812 --> 02:37:56,856
Don't play dumbass with me.

2134
02:37:56,857 --> 02:37:58,502
I've been up all night.

2135
02:37:58,503 --> 02:38:00,535
I'm still a little drunk and...

2136
02:38:00,536 --> 02:38:01,858
I have a hangover.

2137
02:38:01,859 --> 02:38:03,708
I should be in my hotel room asleep.

2138
02:38:03,709 --> 02:38:05,362
Not fucking around here on Tobacco Road.

2139
02:38:05,363 --> 02:38:08,467
But because Zoe wanted to drive
some fucking "Vanishing Point" car

2140
02:38:08,468 --> 02:38:09,430
I'm here.

2141
02:38:09,431 --> 02:38:11,825
Now you two got the balls to ask me - No...

2142
02:38:11,826 --> 02:38:13,712
Scratch that -- tell me,

2143
02:38:13,713 --> 02:38:15,416
I gotta make conversation with Tom Joad

2144
02:38:15,417 --> 02:38:17,742
While the cool kids get to go out and play?

2145
02:38:17,743 --> 02:38:19,581
Bullshit on that.

2146
02:38:19,582 --> 02:38:20,632
It ain't like that.

2147
02:38:20,633 --> 02:38:21,849
Then what's it like, Kim?

2148
02:38:21,850 --> 02:38:23,542
You guys are our collateral.

2149
02:38:23,543 --> 02:38:25,869
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.

2150
02:38:25,870 --> 02:38:29,577
I really think one human
being will be collateral enough.

2151
02:38:30,502 --> 02:38:32,380
You're not gonna wanna do
what we're doing.

2152
02:38:32,381 --> 02:38:33,859
What, drive a car?

2153
02:38:34,482 --> 02:38:35,990
We're doing more than that.

2154
02:38:35,991 --> 02:38:37,772
What, drive it fast?

2155
02:38:39,173 --> 02:38:40,739
We're doing more than that.

2156
02:38:40,759 --> 02:38:43,075
Actually, we're paying you a compliment.

2157
02:38:43,114 --> 02:38:45,849
Cause we're gonna do some stupid shit.

2158
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:49,897
But that's okay, we're stunt people,
we ain't got good sense.

2159
02:38:49,898 --> 02:38:51,094
But you got good sense.

2160
02:38:51,095 --> 02:38:52,418
And anybody with good sense,

2161
02:38:52,419 --> 02:38:54,033
... ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing.

2162
02:38:54,034 --> 02:38:56,243
How do you know I don't wanna do it?

2163
02:38:56,311 --> 02:38:57,655
Cause you're a mom.

2164
02:38:57,704 --> 02:38:58,531
Yeah.

2165
02:39:01,772 --> 02:39:04,457
You know, we're supposed to
be this big "Posse"

2166
02:39:04,458 --> 02:39:08,304
But that's the excuse you guys use whenever
you want to exclude me from something.

2167
02:39:08,305 --> 02:39:11,388
So what is it you two daredevils are doing

2168
02:39:11,389 --> 02:39:15,827
That if I'm just so uncool,
I couldn't possibly understand.

2169
02:39:16,022 --> 02:39:18,562
You know, we're kinda
conning this guy, so...

2170
02:39:18,563 --> 02:39:21,949
Maybe it's best we don't go into detail
about it while he's watching us.

2171
02:39:22,027 --> 02:39:23,603
Besides...

2172
02:39:24,217 --> 02:39:26,971
He's probably not gonna
let us do it anyway.

2173
02:39:29,765 --> 02:39:30,641
Okay.

2174
02:39:31,526 --> 02:39:32,685
How about this?

2175
02:39:33,599 --> 02:39:34,796
I'll talk him into it.

2176
02:39:34,806 --> 02:39:37,171
But if I talk him into it, I go along.

2177
02:39:37,940 --> 02:39:39,429
How you gonna do that?

2178
02:39:39,430 --> 02:39:41,434
That's my problem.

2179
02:39:41,473 --> 02:39:43,263
But don't worry.

2180
02:39:43,993 --> 02:39:45,395
He'll say yes.

2181
02:39:45,648 --> 02:39:47,780
What are you gonna do, blow him?

2182
02:39:48,003 --> 02:39:48,899
No.

2183
02:39:50,437 --> 02:39:52,452
I'm gonna insinuate that
Lee's gonna blow him.

2184
02:39:58,992 --> 02:40:00,482
Not really.

2185
02:40:01,396 --> 02:40:03,061
But let me handle it.

2186
02:40:03,566 --> 02:40:04,957
We got a deal?

2187
02:40:09,007 --> 02:40:10,914
Okay mommy, listen up.

2188
02:40:11,206 --> 02:40:14,378
You wanna hang with the cool kids,
you got to be cool.

2189
02:40:14,379 --> 02:40:15,975
We take you along,
you don't say shit.

2190
02:40:15,976 --> 02:40:17,221
You don't even say crap.

2191
02:40:17,222 --> 02:40:20,305
You just sit in the back, and I don't wanna hear
a peep outta your ass. You understand?

2192
02:40:20,306 --> 02:40:21,541
I'm serious now.

2193
02:40:21,542 --> 02:40:23,799
You starting us, we're pullin' over
to the side of the road

2194
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:26,077
Kickin' your ass out
and pickin' you up later.

2195
02:40:26,078 --> 02:40:27,090
Agreed.

2196
02:40:31,041 --> 02:40:31,859
Okay.

2197
02:40:32,638 --> 02:40:33,961
Go work your magic.

2198
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:42,381
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

2199
02:40:42,400 --> 02:40:43,879
Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.

2200
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:45,525
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.

2201
02:40:45,526 --> 02:40:46,351
Aber-what?

2202
02:40:46,352 --> 02:40:47,159
Abernathy.

2203
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:48,307
What's your first name?

2204
02:40:48,308 --> 02:40:49,679
That is my first name.

2205
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:51,208
What kind of first name is that?

2206
02:40:51,209 --> 02:40:53,407
You know what, just call me Abby.

2207
02:40:53,408 --> 02:40:55,004
Okay, Abby.

2208
02:40:55,967 --> 02:40:57,155
Jasper.

2209
02:40:57,156 --> 02:40:59,420
We were wondering if my friends
and I could take the car out

2210
02:40:59,421 --> 02:41:00,931
... for a little test drive out on our own.

2211
02:41:00,932 --> 02:41:02,829
You know just to see
if we're comfortable in it.

2212
02:41:02,830 --> 02:41:04,941
Why would I do
something stupid like that?

2213
02:41:04,942 --> 02:41:07,064
To better sell your automobile.

2214
02:41:07,065 --> 02:41:09,400
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

2215
02:41:09,429 --> 02:41:11,542
Four reasons actually.

2216
02:41:11,590 --> 02:41:13,789
One, we're not thieves.

2217
02:41:13,810 --> 02:41:16,163
Two, that would be rude.

2218
02:41:16,670 --> 02:41:18,763
Three, we're staying at the
Days Inn in town.

2219
02:41:18,764 --> 02:41:22,558
You can call the hotel, check with management.
We're registered for the next month.

2220
02:41:22,559 --> 02:41:25,390
Actually, Zoe is not, but Kim and I are.

2221
02:41:25,400 --> 02:41:27,901
So we're totally trackdownable.
- Who's Kim?

2222
02:41:27,902 --> 02:41:29,216
The colored girl?

2223
02:41:29,955 --> 02:41:30,724
Yes.

2224
02:41:30,899 --> 02:41:33,060
Kim would be the girl of color.

2225
02:41:33,061 --> 02:41:36,135
And reason number four
and the most important.

2226
02:41:36,222 --> 02:41:38,841
While we're taking the car
out for a little spin

2227
02:41:38,919 --> 02:41:41,702
That'll give you a better
opportunity to get acquainted

2228
02:41:41,703 --> 02:41:43,746
...with our other friend.

2229
02:41:44,262 --> 02:41:45,012
Lee.

2230
02:41:48,778 --> 02:41:50,958
Why does she look kinda familiar?

2231
02:41:50,978 --> 02:41:54,443
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

2232
02:41:56,146 --> 02:41:57,772
Why she dressed like that?

2233
02:41:57,791 --> 02:42:00,711
Well you see, we're making a
Hollywood movie in town.

2234
02:42:00,730 --> 02:42:04,186
And it's a cheerleader movie, and
she's one of the cheerleaders.

2235
02:42:04,187 --> 02:42:05,646
What's a cheerleader movie?

2236
02:42:05,647 --> 02:42:07,913
A movie about cheerleaders.

2237
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:10,240
Is it a porno movie?

2238
02:42:11,496 --> 02:42:12,450
Yes.

2239
02:42:12,635 --> 02:42:13,511
It is.

2240
02:42:14,232 --> 02:42:16,498
But don't mention it.

2241
02:42:16,557 --> 02:42:17,657
She's shy.

2242
02:42:21,638 --> 02:42:23,156
Lee, this is Jasper.

2243
02:42:23,322 --> 02:42:24,606
Jasper, Lee.

2244
02:42:25,074 --> 02:42:27,156
You two kids stay out of trouble.

2245
02:42:27,157 --> 02:42:28,471
Hey good looking!

2246
02:42:28,472 --> 02:42:30,514
Be back to pick you up later.

2247
02:42:30,552 --> 02:42:31,351
Gulp.

2248
02:42:58,222 --> 02:43:00,366
You thinking what I'm thinkin'?

2249
02:43:01,068 --> 02:43:02,615
I think I'm thinkin' it.

2250
02:43:02,616 --> 02:43:04,115
What are you and you thinkin'?

2251
02:43:04,116 --> 02:43:07,413
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

2252
02:43:10,266 --> 02:43:11,482
Where are you going?

2253
02:43:11,483 --> 02:43:13,818
You stay put.
- Yo, I gotta take a...

2254
02:43:31,297 --> 02:43:33,282
So you're ready do to this?

2255
02:43:34,402 --> 02:43:35,599
Are you sure?

2256
02:43:35,657 --> 02:43:36,436
Well..

2257
02:43:36,494 --> 02:43:39,142
I always don't wanna
do it right before I'm gonna do it.

2258
02:43:39,143 --> 02:43:40,164
You know what I mean?

2259
02:43:40,165 --> 02:43:41,527
Yeah, I know what you mean.

2260
02:43:41,528 --> 02:43:42,860
Cause I don't wanna do it.

2261
02:43:42,861 --> 02:43:44,622
Kim.
- I'm passing it.

2262
02:43:44,623 --> 02:43:46,598
Fuck, if you're gonna take
the piss out of it...

2263
02:43:46,695 --> 02:43:48,349
I'm just saying.

2264
02:43:49,945 --> 02:43:51,464
You wanna start right on top?

2265
02:43:52,846 --> 02:43:54,578
Practically, it doesn't count.

2266
02:43:54,579 --> 02:43:56,408
Then we start on the top.

2267
02:44:01,527 --> 02:44:02,695
Here, your glove.

2268
02:44:09,985 --> 02:44:11,065
No no no no.

2269
02:44:11,066 --> 02:44:12,856
I'm wearing the jacket.

2270
02:44:12,993 --> 02:44:14,520
This is my jacket.

2271
02:44:15,727 --> 02:44:18,862
Ain't you promised to
be my slave or some shit?

2272
02:44:23,359 --> 02:44:25,159
You're on the hood.

2273
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:36,530
Yo, I think I hear a car coming.

2274
02:44:36,531 --> 02:44:38,087
Give me your belt.

2275
02:44:42,051 --> 02:44:44,626
Oh, this is my cute shit.

2276
02:44:45,618 --> 02:44:47,636
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.

2277
02:44:56,493 --> 02:44:59,344
Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.

2278
02:44:59,383 --> 02:45:01,223
Come on, give me the belt.

2279
02:45:01,224 --> 02:45:02,508
Magic word.

2280
02:45:02,509 --> 02:45:04,707
Please give me the belt.

2281
02:45:05,661 --> 02:45:07,540
Just cause you asked nicely.

2282
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:12,211
It's nice to be nice, Kim.

2283
02:45:12,805 --> 02:45:14,908
Whatever.
- You know what?

2284
02:45:14,937 --> 02:45:18,114
Don't even fuckin' think about asking me
next time you want me to do your hair.

2285
02:45:18,115 --> 02:45:19,107
And your ass gonna do it.

2286
02:45:19,108 --> 02:45:20,560
Yeah and your ass pretty please bitch.

2287
02:45:20,561 --> 02:45:23,810
Because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. Why is that fuckin' hard?

2288
02:45:24,586 --> 02:45:25,458
Abernathy?

2289
02:45:25,847 --> 02:45:27,667
Don't get on my nerves right now.

2290
02:45:27,668 --> 02:45:29,185
I got shit on my mind.

2291
02:45:50,425 --> 02:45:51,564
Hey, Abernathy.

2292
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:53,237
Check this out.

2293
02:46:05,086 --> 02:46:07,140
What the fuck
are you guys doing?

2294
02:46:15,971 --> 02:46:17,441
What does that mean?

2295
02:46:36,738 --> 02:46:38,820
Is that fast enough for your loony ass?

2296
02:46:46,879 --> 02:46:49,030
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

2297
02:47:14,701 --> 02:47:16,056
Shake it out bitch.

2298
02:47:16,057 --> 02:47:17,906
You want it fuckin' faster?

2299
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:34,381
Oh my God.

2300
02:48:34,382 --> 02:48:35,667
What the fuck --

2301
02:48:52,851 --> 02:48:53,591
Now.

2302
02:48:54,905 --> 02:48:57,211
Did you do something to him?
Did you say something?

2303
02:48:57,212 --> 02:48:58,175
Nothing.

2304
02:48:58,704 --> 02:48:59,508
Shit.

2305
02:49:33,928 --> 02:49:35,787
I'm sorry I called you black bitch.

2306
02:49:35,788 --> 02:49:37,607
I forgive you.

2307
02:49:39,164 --> 02:49:40,186
Get away.

2308
02:49:55,446 --> 02:49:57,517
Redneck lunatic bastard.

2309
02:49:57,518 --> 02:49:59,014
Get away from me.

2310
02:50:17,358 --> 02:50:19,948
I'm scared, Kim.
I'm really scared.

2311
02:50:19,949 --> 02:50:21,865
Fear nobody. Just hold on.

2312
02:50:26,240 --> 02:50:28,738
Do you wanna get hot?
You wanna get hot?

2313
02:50:30,621 --> 02:50:32,227
Suck on this for a while.

2314
02:51:07,055 --> 02:51:08,642
Leave us alone.

2315
02:51:09,391 --> 02:51:11,620
Fuck you, motherfucker.

2316
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:25,300
Get ready to fly, bitch.

2317
02:52:59,643 --> 02:53:01,094
Ladies.

2318
02:53:01,114 --> 02:53:02,846
That was fun.

2319
02:53:06,812 --> 02:53:07,620
Well...

2320
02:53:08,224 --> 02:53:09,431
Adios.

2321
02:53:28,293 --> 02:53:29,109
Bitch.

2322
02:53:45,137 --> 02:53:46,218
I'm okay.

2323
02:53:46,723 --> 02:53:49,389
Oh shit. God damn it.

2324
02:53:50,081 --> 02:53:52,466
Oh you fuckin bitch.

2325
02:53:53,605 --> 02:53:55,911
Of course you are.
What was I thinking?

2326
02:53:57,439 --> 02:54:00,038
What was I thinking?
Zoe the fuckin' Cat.

2327
02:54:05,132 --> 02:54:06,714
That was a close one.

2328
02:54:10,417 --> 02:54:12,165
You guys look like shit.

2329
02:54:12,608 --> 02:54:14,019
Who lied?

2330
02:54:15,012 --> 02:54:16,433
That shit!

2331
02:54:19,070 --> 02:54:20,482
Are you okay?

2332
02:54:23,937 --> 02:54:25,776
That's life, and that'll be sweet.

2333
02:54:29,816 --> 02:54:31,004
So?

2334
02:54:31,081 --> 02:54:32,570
Where is the maniac?

2335
02:54:32,998 --> 02:54:35,440
I shot him and his spunk ass sped off.

2336
02:54:37,222 --> 02:54:38,575
Do you wanna go and get him?

2337
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:40,346
Oh hell yeah.

2338
02:54:40,853 --> 02:54:42,409
Honey.

2339
02:54:42,526 --> 02:54:45,095
I think you might wanna get out.

2340
02:54:45,904 --> 02:54:47,325
Fuck that shit.

2341
02:54:48,580 --> 02:54:50,284
Let's kill this bastard.

2342
02:54:52,682 --> 02:54:54,589
Okay, get your ass in
the back, let's go.

2343
02:55:00,156 --> 02:55:02,618
Wait.
- Where the fuck you're going?

2344
02:55:13,459 --> 02:55:14,766
Sweet. Let's go.

2345
02:56:39,143 --> 02:56:40,457
Do it.

2346
02:56:40,609 --> 02:56:41,543
Do it.

2347
02:57:13,589 --> 02:57:14,825
Now I'll explain.

2348
02:57:16,727 --> 02:57:18,419
Where do you think you're fucking going?

2349
02:57:53,653 --> 02:57:57,867
Don't like it up the ass, do you?
You redneck lunatic bastard.

2350
02:58:05,033 --> 02:58:08,751
I'm the horniest muthafukka on the road.

2351
02:58:23,758 --> 02:58:24,838
Get him. Get him.

2352
02:58:27,357 --> 02:58:29,936
Motherfucker move.

2353
02:58:45,762 --> 02:58:46,784
Watch it.

2354
02:59:20,006 --> 02:59:22,702
Oh you know I can't let you go.

2355
02:59:23,724 --> 02:59:25,982
Without tappin' that ass.

2356
02:59:28,279 --> 02:59:29,154
One...

2357
02:59:29,155 --> 02:59:30,031

2358
02:59:30,032 --> 02:59:30,869

Go ya.

03:01:27,346 --> 03:01:28,368
C'mon.

2362
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:32,445
Don't you like us motherfucker.
We bet motherfucker. We bet.

2363
03:01:32,446 --> 03:01:34,451
Who's laughing now bitch?

2364
03:01:45,422 --> 03:01:47,369
Hey sucker.

2365
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:50,980
You're not such a lunatic bastard.

2366
03:01:50,981 --> 03:01:52,508
I'm sorry.
- What?

2367
03:01:53,831 --> 03:01:57,315
I didn't mean anything.
I was just playing around.

2368
03:01:58,653 --> 03:02:02,056
Ah, he was just playing around.
- He was just playing!

2369
03:02:02,057 --> 03:02:03,692
Now I ain't playing with you.

2370
03:02:09,546 --> 03:02:11,025
Oh, look out! Look out!

2371
03:02:20,049 --> 03:02:21,372
Watch your side!

2372
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:53,019
Jesus fuckin' Christ.

2373
03:02:53,039 --> 03:02:54,480
It's about time.

2374
03:03:14,024 --> 03:03:15,620
Please don't dead end.

2375
03:03:15,796 --> 03:03:17,256
Please don't dead end.

2376
03:03:17,343 --> 03:03:18,949
Please don't dead end.

2377
03:03:27,435 --> 03:03:31,212
There the motherfucker is.
Go. Go. Get him.

2378
03:03:54,686 --> 03:03:55,708
Help me.

2379
03:04:02,414 --> 03:04:04,604
Be careful my right arm's broken.
