[ Skipped item nr. 1 ]

2
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,136
Good morning.

3
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:10,962
Good morning, Doctor.

4
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:15,308
Mr. Rane, would you like one last look
at your face before l proceed?

5
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:17,872
l never live in the past.

6
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,110
No, thank you.

7
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,550
l have to give you something for the pain.

8
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,246
There will be no pain.

9
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:30,857
Proceed.

10
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:56,774
Scalpel.

11
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:12,299
All right. You know the drill.
Be very careful.

12
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,534
This is Charles Rane we're dealing with.

13
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:17,229
-Where is he?
-Plastic Surgery. Third floor.

14
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:18,897
He keeps changing his face.

15
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,566
lf we blow this,
we won't get another chance.

16
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:22,938
Move out!

17
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:28,148
What time is it?

18
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:29,248
What?

19
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,950
l want you to tell me what time it is.

20
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,687
Twelve o'clock.

21
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,562
Get down.

22
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:07,979
Move out there!

23
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,259
Stairs! Other way!

24
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,795
Don't move! Freeze! Don't move!

25
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,825
Charles Rane, FBl.

26
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,465
You're under arrest.

27
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,421
Enjoy the flight.

28
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,248
-There you go.
-Thanks.

29
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,611
You're welcome.

30
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,884
Listen up! Shut up! Sit!

31
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:51,584
Do as l say and nobody gets hurt.
You have the keys to the flight deck?

32
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,854
We're going to move there, nice and slow.

33
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,132
Don't make me use this.

34
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,230
Nice and slow.

35
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,202
There you go.

36
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:04,198
Real nice.

37
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,532
Real nice.

38
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,047
Turn it off.

39
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:18,514
Turn it off!

40
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,356
May l ask you what you were doing?

41
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:28,325
l was improvising
on your security techniques.

42
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,597
That's cute. That's real cute, Miss...?

43
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,269
Slayton, but my friends call me Marti.

44
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,162
Well. See...

45
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:40,733
...if this had been a real gun, that little
Angie Dickenson bullshit you just pulled...

46
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:42,433
...would've got your head blown off.

47
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,910
And endangered the lives
of all the other passengers.

48
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:46,843
l was trying to save lives.

49
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:51,251
The next time a man holds a gun
to your head on a crowded plane...

50
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,011
...you follow instructions.

51
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:57,420
You do exactly what he tells you to do.
Do you understand?

52
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,084
This is why l gave up my afternoon...

53
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:02,458
...so a former security specialist
can tell me how to obey a hijacker?

54
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,827
First of all, l'm not a former anything.

55
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,566
Second of all, l like what l do.

56
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,103
l get the chance to meet people like you.

57
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,740
l know we got a lot of information
to think about, so class dismissed.

58
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,542
We'll hijack you again next week.

59
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:24,377
-What the hell are you doing here?
-l'm doing fine. How're you?

60
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:25,782
What's wrong with your foot?

61
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:28,713
l appreciate you throwing
some business my way...

62
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,156
...but you have no right
to interfere with my class.

63
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,591
Look around.
This is an airline training facility.

64
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,429
This is not the Secret Service. Calm down.

65
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,535
Now you're telling me my job, too?

66
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:41,363
What she did was wrong. Period.

67
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:44,631
There was a time you'd have let her know
without blowing your cool.

68
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,640
lt just dawned on me.
She kind of reminds me of Lisa.

69
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,936
She looks nothing like Lisa.

70
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,478
l didn't say she looked like her,
l said she reminded me of her.

71
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:54,741
-We gotta talk.
-l'm not interested in coming back.

72
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,680
-Did l ask you to?
-You were about to.

73
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,845
Don't tell me that teaching
security techniques to bodyguards...

74
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,923
...watchmen, flight attendants,
is what you want to do.

75
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,615
lt's a job, Sly. l like it.

76
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,921
Ramsey wants to hire
the best person available...

77
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,757
...to head up the counter-terrorism unit.
That'd be you.

78
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,422
l don't want that responsibility.

79
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:15,298
l don't wanna be so good-looking, but
l deal with the hand that's dealt me.

80
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,666
Nobody can do the job better than you.

81
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,933
l knew you'd start this shit again.
Give me my check.

82
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,168
You want me to stop?

83
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:25,178
Just say, ''Yes, l'll take the job.'' l'll stop.

84
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,043
Dammit, Sly. Give it a rest, okay?

85
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,717
No, you give it a rest.

86
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,376
This isn't about a job. This is about you.

87
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:34,421
Nobody knows better than l do
how much Lisa meant to you...

88
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,387
...but you gotta stop blaming yourself.

89
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,086
You gotta get off the sidelines
and back into this game!

90
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:44,755
l set up a lunch tomorrow
with Ramsey at noon at The Oxford.

91
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,425
l hope you'll be there.

92
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,932
l really do.

93
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,452
Hey, pretty boy!

94
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:10,525
You got a pretty ass, white girl.

95
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,191
What's her name?

96
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,807
Attorney Phillips.

97
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,976
Have you found out
where they intend to take me?

98
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:36,212
Los Angeles. But they won't say when.

99
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,214
lt'll happen quickly.

100
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,046
Notify my people.
They'll know what to do.

101
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,386
California has a death penalty.

102
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,652
lt's a progressive state.

103
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:48,159
l'll have to visit it sometime.

104
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:50,591
The feds' witness can prove
you're responsible...

105
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,634
...for two airline bombings last year.

106
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,464
l'm responsible for twice that amount.

107
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,974
l'm afraid the most we can hope for is
that l claim insanity for you.

108
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:06,409
Given your childhood history,
we should be able to make that stick.

109
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:11,450
Never mention my childhood.

110
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:15,018
Have l made myself clear?

111
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:19,422
lt is the nature of man
to confuse genius with insanity.

112
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:23,623
Now...

113
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,532
...repeat after me.

114
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,599
Charles Rane...

115
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,105
...is not...

116
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,032
...insane.

117
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,607
Charles Rane...

118
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,949
...is not insane.

119
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:46,780
Again.

120
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,584
Charles Rane...

121
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:52,486
...is not insane.

122
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,825
Continue.

123
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,566
Charles...

124
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,398
...insane.

125
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:14,274
Put some of this on the fire. Okay?

126
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,472
Kiss.

127
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,153
Fine ass.

128
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,026
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

129
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,095
Open the register. Give me money!

130
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,326
Shut up! Give it to me now!
Open the register! Now!

131
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:34,964
Freeze! Drop it!

132
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,840
Get back or I'll blow her head off!
Get back!

133
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,944
Get the fuck back! Put the gun down!

134
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:46,841
Put the fucking gun down!

135
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:50,510
All right. I'm putting it down.

136
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,584
You just stay cool, all right.

137
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:57,586
You're gonna be all right, baby.
I'm not gonna try and stop you, man.

138
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:00,126
You shouldn't have tried to stop me
the first time.

139
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,004
Oh, my God! Lisa!

140
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:14,066
Oh, baby!

141
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,473
It's going to be all right. It's not too bad.

142
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,172
Oh, what have I done?!

143
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,321
What do you know?

144
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:37,652
Here he is.

145
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,959
-John Cutter, Stuart Ramsey.
-Pleasure.

146
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:44,825
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Delvecchio said you might not come.

147
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,032
Well, Mr. Delvecchio was wrong.

148
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,634
Let's have a seat.

149
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:53,265
Do you know how many airlines
have been hijacked in the last three years?

150
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,136
-No.
-Twenty-seven.

151
00:14:55,945 --> 00:15:00,314
Almost every commercial airline in
the world has had to cope with terrorism.

152
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,312
All except one.

153
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,010
lsraelis have never been fucked with.

154
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:07,280
They never let them on the plane.

155
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:09,618
Do you have thoughts on this?

156
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:14,092
Unequivocally, without a doubt,
John is the best guy l ever worked with.

157
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:20,527
The annual meeting of our stockholders
is next week in Los Angeles.

158
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:23,932
l'd like to fly out a couple days early,
have a brief vacation...

159
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,336
...before l introduce you as...

160
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:28,637
...our new vice-president.

161
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:31,845
That is assuming you still want the job.

162
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,015
l'll drink to that.

163
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:47,987
When you meet this board of directors,
you should think of something really...

164
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:51,326
...you know, impressive to say
to start things off.

165
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,626
Maybe l'll ask them to fire you.

166
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,300
Actually, this isn't a good time
to start with new plans.

167
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,964
Just be yourself: dignified and charming.

168
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:03,340
Sorry, sir. You'll have to go back through.

169
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:05,537
Are you carrying any metal objects?

170
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:08,681
Ever notice how the real suspicious ones
never have trouble?

171
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,511
Right. That's how they get on the plane.

172
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,650
Oh, man.

173
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,758
Sorry, l'm gonna have to check you myself.

174
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,194
lt's that metal plate in his head.
An old war wound.

175
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,902
You can go with your friend now.

176
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,364
Thank you.

177
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:30,932
You're welcome.

178
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,942
Real quick. How do you do that?

179
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,675
Before you get on the plane,
how do you do that?

180
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:40,110
-lt's a black thing.
-l understand black things.

181
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,584
That's what l admire about you.

182
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,948
Though you were being hit on
by an absolutely beautiful woman...

183
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,988
...you are determined to maintain
your vow of chastity.

184
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,716
You'd make a hell of a Republican.

185
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,350
lt is not necessary for you
to walk me to the plane.

186
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,894
lt's the least l can do. We're brothers.

187
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,592
Have a nice flight.

188
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,260
l have no idea why l am so nice to you.

189
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,003
Look, you got me here.

190
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,202
Are you satisfied? Now go.

191
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:08,606
Come on, man.
Don't give me that sad-ass puppy look.

192
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,302
l'm not giving you that.
l'm giving you the grateful...

193
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,972
...deeply moved, ltalian-American,
religiously inspired look, okay?

194
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:15,912
Why?

195
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:19,748
Even though you won't admit it, we both
know you made the right decision.

196
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:22,516
l'm only taking this job
to make your life miserable.

197
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:23,784
ls that right?

198
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,658
This is where l get back at you.

199
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,228
Speaking of which...

200
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,020
...have l got a surprise for you.

201
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,463
No. No surprises. What is it?

202
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:33,759
Lips are sealed.

203
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,734
-Your lips could be busted. What is it?
-Listen to this.

204
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:41,137
When you get to Los Angeles call me,
'cause l want to hear all about it.

205
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,039
Hey, are you listening to me?

206
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:44,611
Have a pleasant trip.

207
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,712
Sly, you don't understand--

208
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:51,118
Have a nice flight, Mr. Cutter.

209
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:49,569
FBl. Thank you.

210
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,589
Mr. Forget?

211
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,594
''For-jhay.'' lt's French.

212
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,728
Monsieur Forget, you'll be in seat 5-C.
That's the aisle seat.

213
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:15,368
On the left. Thanks.

214
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,450
Norman, it is not polite to stare.

215
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,728
May l take your coat, sir? Thank you.

216
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:58,001
Any truth to the rumor that men in L.A.
actually talk without cue cards?

217
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,648
They talk a lot, but whether or not
they say anything is another matter.

218
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:04,752
-l take it this is your first trip to L.A.?
-lt is.

219
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,114
l'm Sabrina Ritchie. How do you do?

220
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:10,249
Marti Slayton.
Sabrina is a beautiful name.

221
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,460
'Tis a thing most wondrous
to be flattered by one of your peers.

222
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,494
l love the accent, too.

223
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:17,923
Between us,
l've been trying to lose it for years.

224
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,261
Makes me sound cold and heartless.

225
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:22,300
Now that you mention it....

226
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,506
Always trust your first impression.

227
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,409
l have a feeling
this'll be a very interesting flight.

228
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,102
l certainly hope so.

229
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,112
You taken the head count yet?

230
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:37,776
My fingers are beginning
to point as we speak.

231
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:39,852
Champagne, madam?

232
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,741
Behave yourself.
You won't get toys in prison.

233
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:11,848
l never had any toys. My father believed
they would warp my sense of values.

234
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,985
ls your father still alive?

235
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,348
Died...

236
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:17,990
...violently.

237
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,691
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight....

238
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:29,634
54, 55, 56, 57....

239
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:35,733
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine....

240
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:50,857
-Can l get you anything?
-Nothing right now, thanks.

241
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:56,593
Looks like l just found my next ex-wife.

242
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,100
Make sure all carry-on items
are beneath your seats...

243
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:11,107
...or properly stored
in an overhead compartment.

244
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:16,548
l'm Marti. lf l can do anything to make
your trip more comfortable...

245
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,648
...please feel free to ask for my assistance.

246
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,928
Who needs assistance this early?

247
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:30,255
John Cutter.

248
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,731
He's a security specialist for the airlines.

249
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:34,300
Security?

250
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:36,771
l feel safe already.

251
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:43,362
Menu, sir?

252
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,038
Menu, sir?

253
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:50,972
Pardon me, stewardess?

254
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,048
ls that man with the handcuffs dangerous?

255
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,843
There's nothing to worry about, madam.

256
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,454
Right now, he's as safe
as this handsome little boy.

257
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,319
-What's your name?
-Norman.

258
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:06,561
lf he tries to do something bad,
l'll shoot him.

259
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:08,387
What if he shoots back?

260
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:12,997
l also have a secret decoder ring that
protects me from bullets and spiders...

261
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:14,668
...but l left it at home.

262
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:17,636
Don't worry, l've got mine
and l'll save all of us.

263
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:21,431
Give me a smile, l might get you a soda.
lf that's all right with your mom.

264
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,077
-Sure.
-Orange?

265
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:24,767
You got it.

266
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:26,503
Thank you.

267
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:35,854
Excuse me, stewardess,
l've had that light on for a while.

268
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,288
Flight attendant. lf you go to your seat,
l'll bring you the peanuts.

269
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:41,793
Actually, all l want is an aspirin.

270
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:43,925
Here we go.

271
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,198
Hey, look...

272
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:51,870
...maybe l was a little hard on you in class
but that was for your own good.

273
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,099
ls this the way you apologize?

274
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:56,508
This is gonna be a long flight.

275
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,201
You've got that right.

276
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,879
Excuse me. Excuse me.

277
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,075
Maybe you can just do me a favor?

278
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:06,581
This oughta be good.

279
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:09,281
l'm not all that comfortable on planes.

280
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,717
There's extra pillows
in the overhead compartment.

281
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,988
When anything moves faster than l walk,
l'd rather be behind the wheel.

282
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:18,598
Who'd have guessed
you're a control freak?

283
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,531
-You won't make this easy, will you?
-How can l make your trip more pleasant?

284
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:26,730
l just want you to check on me
from time to time. That's it.

285
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,642
Take your seat and l'll see what l can do.

286
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,681
Champagne with your dinners?

287
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:43,586
Not on duty, but l'll have some
tomato juice and l'll have the chicken.

288
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,523
How appropriate.

289
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,418
l'll have the steak.

290
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:50,463
Keep the champagne on ice.
We'll celebrate later.

291
00:25:57,172 --> 00:26:01,506
Sir, this is Mrs. Edwards.
She's a frequent air traveler.

292
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:06,177
When l told her about you, she said
she'd help you feel more comfortable.

293
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,675
lt's a real honor to meet you.

294
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,079
l take this flight once a month.
l have grandkids in Van Nuys.

295
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:15,655
That's just outside of Los Angeles.

296
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,953
Well, maybe not just outside, but hell,
Los Angeles is so spread out...

297
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,893
...who's to know where it begins and ends,
what's inside and outside.

298
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:28,034
Wait till l tell everyone
l sat next to you on the plane.

299
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,235
l watch your show all the time.

300
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,599
-My show?
-Never miss it.

301
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:40,045
And l love it when you do those jokes
about things that make you go, ''hmmm.''

302
00:26:47,822 --> 00:26:50,882
-Robert.
-I need special service in first class.

303
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,016
l'll send it right up.

304
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,237
l just loved it when you told off Madonna.

305
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:13,312
Who is she to tell you
how to wear your hair?

306
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,079
Excuse me, l have to go to the bathroom.

307
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,719
l'll probably be in there a long time.

308
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:22,084
Oh, l'm that way, too.

309
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,627
l don't need this.

310
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:32,023
l don't need this at all.

311
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,497
Do you know the time?

312
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:39,672
Why? You got someplace you got to go?

313
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,309
How do you like your sirloin, sir?

314
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,848
Bloody.

315
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:59,692
Everybody, sit down!
Be quiet and you won't get hurt!

316
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,105
Who's in charge?

317
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,042
l am.

318
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:22,412
Once again. Who's in charge?

319
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:23,673
You are.

320
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:24,876
Excellent.

321
00:28:25,353 --> 00:28:28,948
Quiet! Quiet! Sit your ass down!
Sit down!

322
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,582
What the hell's that?

323
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,355
Sit down, shut up or be killed!
Your choice.

324
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:38,723
Ladies and gentlemen...

325
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,336
...I'm afraid your in-flight entertainment
program has been cancelled.

326
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:45,098
The weapons being carried
by my staff are real.

327
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,773
So is their desire to use them...

328
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,135
...if provoked.

329
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:52,007
l'm prepared to do whatever is necessary
in order to achieve my goal.

330
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:55,182
If you do as instructed,
you will not be harmed.

331
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:58,179
If you disobey or interfere
with their activities...

332
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,184
...you will be shot.

333
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,289
Oh, man.

334
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,632
All right, all right.

335
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:23,133
This is your idea of surprise?

336
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:26,770
Very funny, Sly. You better be there.

337
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:59,976
No, no, no. This can't be happening.
Not now.

338
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,911
First this Arsenio shit, then this.

339
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,723
Come on, come on.

340
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:17,454
Hello. l got an emergency.
My name is John Cutter.

341
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,761
l need Sly Delvecchio.

342
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:27,701
l don't know how to spell his name.
D-E-L-vecchio.

343
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:31,742
-Gary's compiled those numbers and--
-There's a call for you.

344
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,947
Excuse me.

345
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:36,848
-Who is it?
-John Cutter.

346
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:38,313
Great.

347
00:30:41,723 --> 00:30:42,655
Shit.

348
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,788
Cutter?

349
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,425
You! Back to your seat.

350
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,292
Please don't shoot me!
l don't want to die!

351
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,162
l said, back to your seat!

352
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,633
They've taken over the plane!

353
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:01,173
Get everybody up here
for an emergency meeting, now!

354
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:03,274
They've taken over the plane!

355
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,587
How many? How many?

356
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,831
Let's say hello to your friends.

357
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,429
All right, freeze!

358
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:29,499
Drop the fucking gun, or your friend dies.

359
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:31,002
l have no friends.

360
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:34,267
His name's John Cutter.
He's airline security.

361
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:38,434
l'm sure your superiors would not like you
to do anything rash...

362
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:41,946
...and risk the lives
of all these wonderful people.

363
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,015
Stand up! Move!

364
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:54,291
Airline personnel assume a certain risk,
it's part of the job.

365
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:56,119
But these passengers...

366
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:57,830
...they're so innocent.

367
00:31:57,966 --> 00:31:59,194
What do you want?

368
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:04,696
l have what l want. l have control
of the plane and everything on it.

369
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:07,299
Must l prove that to you?

370
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:10,069
Sir...

371
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:13,306
...tell Mr. Cutter your name.

372
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:15,140
Douglas.

373
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:17,116
Cutter, meet Douglas.

374
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:18,543
Let him go.

375
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,380
Do you have any children, Douglas?

376
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:23,120
A daughter.

377
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,849
A family man.

378
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,429
He has a daughter who loves him.

379
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:32,323
And she, until your interference,
had a father.

380
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:40,133
Drop the fucking gun.

381
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,409
l loathe incompetence.

382
00:32:57,992 --> 00:32:59,186
Elevator!

383
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,976
Who are you? What're you doing?

384
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,768
There's always someone here.

385
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:21,642
l just get paid to send food upstairs.
Give me a break.

386
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:26,012
All right. Look,
we got a hijack situation upstairs, okay?

387
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,415
l need your help. Anything.

388
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:34,317
l'm not risking my life.
You'll have to fight terrorists on your own.

389
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:36,893
Give me a knife or a screwdriver.

390
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:45,629
l think we should do exactly
what Mr. Rane wants.

391
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:05,290
Come on!

392
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,433
You got to go.

393
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,773
See if you can find something
to tie him up with.

394
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,211
Notify the feds and radar.
Don't let the plane out of sight!

395
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:32,181
Let me know the minute
you contact the pilot.

396
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:34,617
Notify ATC about our situation.

397
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:39,521
l want a complete passenger list.
l want it five minutes ago! Get to work!

398
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:01,380
-So what's the plan?
-Go to the avionics compartment.

399
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:06,818
Then l can override the controls
and bring the plane down.

400
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,182
What?! This is a jumbo jet!

401
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,323
l know it. But we don't have any choice.

402
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:18,797
Correct me if l'm wrong,
but wasn't it you who said...

403
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:21,094
...to do exactly what the terrorists said?

404
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:22,668
He's not just a terrorist.

405
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:25,931
-How you gonna bring the plane down?
-l'll empty the fuel.

406
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:30,209
Are you out of your mind?
We could all crash!

407
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,346
-Exactly.
-No! l won't let you do that!

408
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,845
lt's too dangerous! You're certifiable!

409
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,040
Damn it, Lisa! l'm tired of this shit!

410
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,551
That man is one of
the most dangerous terrorists in the world.

411
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:41,985
He has killed two people.

412
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,718
He will kill everybody else on this
fucking plane if l don't bring him down.

413
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:50,423
Look, l need your help.

414
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,027
Please.

415
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,230
Tell me you're good at this.

416
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,300
l'm the best.

417
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,572
Then do it.

418
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,380
Charles Rane,
the sophisticated British aristocrat...

419
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,750
...known internationally as
''The Rane of Terror.''

420
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:19,290
He's linked to bombings
in London and lreland...

421
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,623
...but because of his ties
to the Middle East, he's been untouchable.

422
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,392
Judging from the fact he killed his father,
he was a sick kid, too.

423
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:28,125
What his old man did to him...

424
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,794
...didn't exactly qualify him
for father of the year honors.

425
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,034
You let the feds put a terrorist
on one of my planes?

426
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:38,201
-They didn't notify me. Here's his file.
-They can do that?

427
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:41,405
The FBl shows up at the last minute,
takes what seats they need....

428
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:43,607
They don't have to notify us.
They're the FBl!

429
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:47,914
Jesus Christ. You'd think they'd put
an airline hijacker on a bus or a train.

430
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,553
Why were they taking him to Los Angeles?

431
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:54,422
He was supposed to stand trial
for the Trans Pacific bombing last year.

432
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,460
Guess he had different plans.

433
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,522
He'll have to change them again.

434
00:36:58,699 --> 00:36:59,529
Why?

435
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,167
Cutter's on the plane.

436
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,354
What's the problem?

437
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,892
We're losing fuel.
One way or another, we're going down.

438
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:30,088
Then you'd better make preparations
to land.

439
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,691
Why are we going back?

440
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:36,797
-lt's easier to jump off from the rear.
-What?

441
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,631
lt's easier to jump off from the rear.

442
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:48,911
l think they're preparing to land.

443
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:52,119
-Where is it?
-Outside Lake Lucille, Louisiana.

444
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:56,649
The airfield there may not be large enough,
but it may be their only choice.

445
00:37:57,491 --> 00:38:00,619
-How fast can we get a chopper there?
-Chopper? Why?

446
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:02,353
l want you there as quickly as possible.

447
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:04,292
You mean on a helicopter?

448
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:07,458
l don't want the FBl or
some country local talking to the press...

449
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,626
...about what's affecting this airline.

450
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:11,897
Get out there and keep me informed.

451
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:27,012
Atlantic International Flight 163.
We're declaring an emergency.

452
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,485
Request immediate authorization to land.

453
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,683
Negative, 163. We're not a commercial
airport. Suggest you re-route.

454
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:35,694
Suggestion refused.

455
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:39,963
Repeat, 163. We're not equipped
to handle an aircraft your size.

456
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,533
-lt's too dangerous--
-Shut up and listen.

457
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:46,603
lt is too dangerous for you.
See that the runway is cleared.

458
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:51,039
Call Atlantic lnternational.
See what the hell is going on.

459
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:53,407
Call the hospital, too, just in case.

460
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,530
Who's Lisa?

461
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:17,936
What?

462
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:21,198
Lisa. You called me Lisa
in the avionics compartment.

463
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:26,179
She was my wife.

464
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,774
Was?

465
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:31,411
She was with me
when l tried to stop a robbery.

466
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,144
l lived.

467
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:38,756
l'm sorry.

468
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:51,599
Plan not working out...

469
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:53,668
...the way you wanted, asshole?

470
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,675
Don't flatter yourself.
You prevented nothing.

471
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,669
Although it seems
l may have underestimated you.

472
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:02,111
Dumping the fuel was quite ingenious.

473
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:06,052
At least Mr. Douglas's body
won't have quite so far to fall.

474
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,248
Maybe Vincent could hitch a ride with him
on his way down.

475
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,718
You know, Charlie,
l'm a little surprised at you.

476
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:16,488
Didn't your father teach you
never to send a boy to do a man's job?

477
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:18,962
Speaking of boys...

478
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,958
...our stewardess friend must be feeling
particularly unsatisfied.

479
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:25,702
Charlie, you ever play roulette?

480
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:27,133
On occasion.

481
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:29,276
Let me give you a word of advice.

482
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,276
Always bet on black.

483
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,984
Mr. Delvecchio, are you okay?

484
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:42,517
Could you please close the door?

485
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,355
The door is closed.

486
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,926
Do you want us to fly higher?
lt might be a little smoother up there.

487
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,063
This is fine.

488
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,992
This is fine.

489
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,879
You better buckle up.
The landing's gonna be rough.

490
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,254
Let me give you a hand.

491
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:49,315
Biggest damn Cessna l ever saw!

492
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,352
Get somebody out on the runway.
l'll be in the tower.

493
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:54,721
Patrick, just do something.

494
00:41:58,499 --> 00:41:59,932
Please fasten your seat belts.

495
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,330
Brace yourselves for a short field landing.

496
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:06,371
Flight attendants, take your positions
for an emergency landing.

497
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:46,607
The tower's going to need
as much assistance as they can get.

498
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:50,743
You communicate with the airline staff,
l'll coordinate rescue on the ground.

499
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:52,916
How do we get down there?

500
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:55,647
We step out. Gravity'll do the rest.

501
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:01,524
As soon as it stops, we jump.

502
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,218
Mr. Delvecchio,
l've got Mr. Ramsey on the line.

503
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,728
l guess we can't tell him l stepped out,
now, can we?

504
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,563
Put him through.

505
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,436
I just had an idea about how to use Cutter.

506
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:45,669
''Use''?

507
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:48,397
lf this works you're to tell the press...

508
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:52,478
...we had a security agent on the plane
as part of our anti-terrorist plan.

509
00:43:52,646 --> 00:43:55,513
lf it doesn't work out,
don't tell them about Cutter.

510
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,274
l'll handle that. Understand?

511
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,650
Do you understand?

512
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:01,579
Yes, sir.

513
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,553
Yes, sir.

514
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:14,298
l had such wonderful plans for us.

515
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,533
lf she disobeys, kill her.

516
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:20,732
Let me go!

517
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:30,643
On the ground! Face down! Do it, now!

518
00:44:31,118 --> 00:44:32,483
l'm security for the airlines.

519
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:36,111
Yeah, and l'm governor of Louisiana!
Get your ass on the ground.

520
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:39,383
l already am on the ground, asshole.

521
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,233
You're making a mistake.

522
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:51,564
l'm John Cutter. l'm airline security.
The plane's been hijacked.

523
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,536
-Get the door.
-Damn it!

524
00:44:58,712 --> 00:45:03,012
The people on the plane are hostages.
Those people are hostages!

525
00:45:05,552 --> 00:45:08,248
This is Chief Leonard Biggs,
Lake Lucille Police Department.

526
00:45:08,422 --> 00:45:10,617
Tell me what you want,
l'll tell you what l can do.

527
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,782
I want this plane fully fueled.

528
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:16,824
lf l do not see a fuel truck in position
in the next five minutes...

529
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:19,659
...you'll be responsible
for a great many deaths.

530
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,967
l'm not fully authorized
to grant any demands at this time.

531
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,699
Look out your window toward the plane,
just in front of the landing gear.

532
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,553
l've just executed five passengers.
l'll execute five more every three minutes...

533
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:44,122
...until you find me someone authorized
to meet my demands.

534
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,592
Look, l want to help...

535
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:51,329
...but how do l know you won't kill
the passengers anyway?

536
00:45:51,598 --> 00:45:53,031
Get the truck near the plane.

537
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,034
As soon as the fuel begins to flow,
l'll release half the passengers.

538
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:01,398
You will be responsible for saving
100 lives all by yourself.

539
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,143
l'll make some calls.

540
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:06,902
While you're on the phone,
l'll be killing more passengers.

541
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:08,411
Let me know when l should stop.

542
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:10,244
Now, wait, wait!

543
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:13,048
Do we have an agreement?

544
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:17,218
Fuel's on its way.

545
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,918
Check and mate.

546
00:46:21,628 --> 00:46:23,323
Shouldn't we wait for the FBl?

547
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,363
Hell, no. l'm in charge until they get here.

548
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:29,830
You heard that man. l just saved 100 lives.

549
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,598
Let them damn federal boys see
if they can do better than that, huh?

550
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,845
-Mr. Ramsay?
-Yeah?

551
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:45,975
Just got this on Rane.
You're not going to like it.

552
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:49,312
Two years ago,
lnterpol thought they had him.

553
00:46:49,456 --> 00:46:52,789
Remember the bombings in London,
the three train stations?

554
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:56,587
Rane did it. He killed over 60 people.

555
00:46:57,531 --> 00:46:59,556
Just to create a distraction.

556
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,223
Distraction?

557
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,996
This guy's got a habit of
blowing things up just to cover his escape.

558
00:47:05,172 --> 00:47:07,640
We got over 200 passengers on that plane.

559
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:09,272
What do you think he wants?

560
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:11,871
Obvious, isn't it?
The guy is facing the chair.

561
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,512
He'll do what it takes to escape.

562
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:16,047
l wouldn't be surprised
if he blew up the plane...

563
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,775
...and then just disappeared in the flames.

564
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,403
Shut up! Shut up!
Would you get him? He's strong.

565
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,107
There's four of them on there.

566
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,508
We caught him by the plane.
He tried to attack us.

567
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,171
lf l had,
l wouldn't be the one here bleeding.

568
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:51,783
What is it you were doing on that airfield?

569
00:47:51,985 --> 00:47:55,819
My name is John Cutter. l'm head
of security for Atlantic lnternational.

570
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:58,082
l was a passenger
before the plane was hijacked.

571
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:00,886
Head of security. Ain't that a pickle?

572
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:03,957
Mr. Cutter, you ain't done too good a job.

573
00:48:04,197 --> 00:48:05,687
Why's the fuel tank out there?

574
00:48:05,832 --> 00:48:08,027
l'm negotiating
the release of 100 passengers.

575
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:09,827
No! You can't trust him!

576
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,870
They're more valuable to him
on the plane. He won't let them off.

577
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:15,200
He needs fuel.

578
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,740
He wouldn't trade the hostages!

579
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:19,674
Don't you worry your ass
about what he needs!

580
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,672
He wants to talk to you.

581
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:28,083
This is Chief Biggs.
The fuel is on its way like l promised.

582
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:30,917
I, in turn, shall fulfill
my end of the bargain.

583
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:35,255
Chief, one of my men betrayed me
and escaped from the plane.

584
00:48:36,096 --> 00:48:37,427
ls that a fact?

585
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:39,896
A black man. Very smooth, convincing.

586
00:48:40,267 --> 00:48:43,361
l would prefer to deal with him directly
for his cowardice...

587
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:46,995
...but should you find it necessary
to inflict harm upon him...

588
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,301
...l will not hold you liable.

589
00:48:53,947 --> 00:48:56,108
The man in the plane says
you're one of his.

590
00:48:56,249 --> 00:49:00,208
People say they saw Elvis in a mall.
You gonna believe that shit, too?

591
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,910
Look, he's a murderer!

592
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:04,290
Let me see some identification.

593
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:11,589
Doesn't say head of security.
Says you're an instructor.

594
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,633
l'm former head of security
of Atlantic lnternational.

595
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,902
Put yourself in my place.
What would you do if you were me?

596
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,098
Kill myself.

597
00:49:34,454 --> 00:49:38,686
Wait one hour before resuming the flight.
That'll give me sufficient time to escape.

598
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:41,453
Once the plane is back up,
proceed with the original plan.

599
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:42,890
Let me go with you.

600
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:45,929
l need you to stay here
and carry out my instructions.

601
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:50,469
-What if they deny us clearance?
-Start killing passengers until they do.

602
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:32,907
Go on, move it!

603
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,476
Get going, don't stop! Come on!

604
00:50:41,988 --> 00:50:46,118
What the hell is wrong with those people?
They'll trample each other to death!

605
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:56,334
lt's a trick! You gotta listen to me.

606
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,463
l've had just about all the advice
from you l'll take.

607
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,199
Haul his ass downstairs.

608
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,308
lf he gets cute, shoot him!

609
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,439
ln the leg.

610
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:09,579
He might be telling the truth.

611
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,752
Do me a favor, honey.
Fix me a cup of that special coffee.

612
00:51:13,954 --> 00:51:15,751
Maybe a couple of Bufferin.

613
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:17,781
Dammit, you're making a mistake!

614
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:20,984
Shut up, boy!
You ain't said shit l want to hear!

615
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,918
Hold it!

616
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:16,043
Chief, prisoner got away.

617
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:17,113
No shit.

618
00:52:17,617 --> 00:52:20,814
Call for backup. l want somebody
from every sheriff's office around.

619
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:23,489
He's headed toward the fairgrounds.
Want us to go?

620
00:52:23,623 --> 00:52:26,717
Why? So he can get more practice
whipping your dumb ass?

621
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:31,330
Take some men, and keep your damn guns
holstered. Unless you have no choice.

622
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:32,662
Go!

623
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,035
Come on! Come on!

624
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,811
That won't be necessary, Vincent.
l'll take care of Mr. Cutter.

625
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,784
Secure transportation.

626
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:57,514
Meet us at the other side
of the fairgrounds in ten minutes.

627
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:18,500
-Chief Biggs? Dwight Henderson, FBl.
-Leonard Biggs, Lake Lucille Police.

628
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,009
l need a concise report
on the status of this operation.

629
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,681
Make yourself comfortable.

630
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,445
That airplane and my blood pressure
ain't going a damn bit higher than it is.

631
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:46,428
Hey, brother!

632
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,072
Damn!

633
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:04,344
Flight 163, do you read me?

634
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,118
Flight 163, come in, please.

635
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:09,478
Flight 163, do you read me?

636
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:12,989
Save your breath. They ain't gonna
answer you till they're darn ready.

637
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:17,061
All we can do is sit and wait to hear
from them or our men in the field.

638
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:20,230
Just hope that Cutter fella
was telling the truth.

639
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,898
-John Cutter?
-You know him?

640
00:55:23,169 --> 00:55:24,500
What happened to him?

641
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,502
He said he was on that plane.

642
00:55:26,673 --> 00:55:29,904
Beat up my men, headed towards
the fairgrounds. We'll catch him.

643
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,806
l hope you got
a good early retirement plan.

644
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,081
Take Dean, Peale and Christopher.
Get over to the fairgrounds.

645
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:40,175
You better see to it
that your men don't harm Cutter.

646
00:55:40,353 --> 00:55:43,914
'Cause, if he's hurt,
l'll press charges against you myself.

647
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:01,734
Move!

648
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,677
Freeze! Don't move!

649
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,074
FBl! You're under arrest!

650
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,778
Let him go!

651
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:09,987
There's another one. 5 feet 10 inches,
he's got a tan jacket and blue navy pants.

652
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:11,856
Check around.

653
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:57,300
Excuse me. Watch yourself!

654
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,510
Get him out.

655
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,074
Dwight Henderson, FBl.

656
01:00:05,285 --> 01:00:07,480
-Heard a great deal about you.
-Pleasure's mutual.

657
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,747
-You all right, man?
-l'm fine.

658
01:00:10,056 --> 01:00:12,217
What is wrong with you?
That's your surprise?

659
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:14,656
You fucking put me on a plane
with a terrorist?!

660
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:17,661
Relax, nobody knew.
The FBl didn't notify us!

661
01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:22,632
Those two agents you murdered
on the plane were friends of mine.

662
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:27,699
Thanks for telling me. l do enjoy knowing
the people whose lives l've touched.

663
01:00:27,907 --> 01:00:31,172
That's enough! You're gonna help us
or l'll rip your goddamn throat out!

664
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:32,275
Come on.

665
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:34,708
While you're considering
organ donations...

666
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:39,317
...it might be wise to spare some thought
for the passengers on board.

667
01:00:39,919 --> 01:00:44,083
lf l'm not released, you'll be clearing up
their remains for quite some time.

668
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:45,849
What are you talking about, asshole?

669
01:00:46,192 --> 01:00:50,492
My colleagues have instructions
to start killing passengers in 20 minutes.

670
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,930
Get this piece of shit inside.

671
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:01,504
l'll station some of my men
behind the plane with tear gas and masks.

672
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:04,404
Two agents will escort Rane
up the boarding stairs.

673
01:01:04,677 --> 01:01:06,508
You're just gonna let him
back on the plane?

674
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:08,840
-So he'll think.
-How are your sharpshooters?

675
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:11,209
-The best.
-They won't have a second chance.

676
01:01:11,351 --> 01:01:12,682
They won't need it.

677
01:01:12,852 --> 01:01:14,251
Sharpshooters?

678
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:18,485
What about Rane's people
that are still on the airplane?

679
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,157
Just be patient.

680
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,952
l'm the only one who knows who they are.
l can be wired.

681
01:01:24,197 --> 01:01:27,428
l can signal to Henderson's men
when it's safe to shoot.

682
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,593
We take out Rane first.
Then will you have time for the tear gas?

683
01:01:31,904 --> 01:01:34,737
My men'll start up the stairs
after the first shots are fired.

684
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:36,397
We'll already have the door secured.

685
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:39,170
This sounds too crazy, John. lt's....

686
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,504
Too much can go wrong.

687
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,373
Goddamn it, Sly! Listen!

688
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:47,549
l saw him take a passenger on that plane.
He asked about his family...

689
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,951
...then blew his brains out
all over the goddamn floor.

690
01:01:52,725 --> 01:01:56,183
The longer we wait,
the more people will be sacrificed.

691
01:01:57,063 --> 01:01:57,927
Fine.

692
01:01:58,231 --> 01:02:02,224
All right. l'll go tell Rane.
l'll make it look like he negotiated it.

693
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:05,635
No.

694
01:02:06,906 --> 01:02:08,237
Let me tell him.

695
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,630
Alone.

696
01:02:14,547 --> 01:02:15,514
Sure.

697
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,212
John?

698
01:02:23,356 --> 01:02:24,414
You okay?

699
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:28,056
l'm all right.

700
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:13,000
Mr. Cutter,
how kind of you to pay me a visit.

701
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:15,838
You've been a worthy adversary.

702
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:18,735
lt's a shame we won't be seeing
much more of each other.

703
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:20,537
Let me tell you something.

704
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,012
lf anybody else gets hurt on that plane...

705
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:27,175
...it'll take more than a prison cell
to keep me from ripping your nuts off!

706
01:03:27,353 --> 01:03:30,447
l'd come to expect more from you
than cheap vulgarities.

707
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:34,081
You and l both know l will never see
the inside of a prison.

708
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,725
The notion of good over evil
will not allow you to sit idly by...

709
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:40,924
...and watch the needless death
of your fellow citizens.

710
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:45,433
You know, you got a good point.
Maybe l should just kill you right now.

711
01:03:45,605 --> 01:03:48,574
You wouldn't take advantage
of a helpless man, would you?

712
01:03:49,108 --> 01:03:50,666
lt's never stopped you.

713
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:54,611
That's the American way, isn't it...

714
01:03:54,814 --> 01:03:55,803
...brother?

715
01:03:56,382 --> 01:03:59,613
You should know.
You're used to being taken advantage of.

716
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,581
l want them off the plane.

717
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:05,417
We share the same hunger.
We're both killers. l know the breed.

718
01:04:10,229 --> 01:04:11,628
l'm sick of your shit!

719
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,528
You need the passengers.
l want the plane.

720
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,361
Put me back on board
and the passengers will be released.

721
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:20,300
-Right. l'm supposed to trust you?
-Trust your instincts.

722
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:23,135
My instincts are to wax your ass
all over this floor.

723
01:04:23,309 --> 01:04:26,801
Those are your emotions acting
without the benefit of intellect.

724
01:04:28,014 --> 01:04:31,245
The passengers' lives are in your hands.

725
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:34,079
Don't fail them.

726
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,517
Sit!

727
01:04:54,273 --> 01:04:56,138
Why are you keeping us here?

728
01:04:56,842 --> 01:04:59,276
What do you want?
For God's sake, let us go!

729
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:00,978
lt's all right.

730
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,772
Don't give him a reason to hurt you.
That's exactly what they want.

731
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,747
Just try and remain calm.

732
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:07,977
There we go.

733
01:05:08,454 --> 01:05:10,513
Everything's gonna be all right.

734
01:05:11,557 --> 01:05:12,956
All right?

735
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:22,192
Flight 163, this is Daddy.

736
01:05:22,768 --> 01:05:24,633
l will be rejoining you shortly.

737
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:28,338
lf l'm not safely on board
within five minutes...

738
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:31,476
...you are to continue
as previously instructed.

739
01:05:32,979 --> 01:05:36,107
Gentlemen, l'm ready to leave
your lovely little town.

740
01:06:16,956 --> 01:06:19,356
This is Cutter. Everybody in position?

741
01:06:19,692 --> 01:06:22,923
Target is well within range.
Awaiting your command.

742
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,531
That's a 10-4.
Nobody does anything till l say, ''go.''

743
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:51,286
All right! All units stand by.

744
01:07:04,403 --> 01:07:05,563
Now! Take him!

745
01:07:07,473 --> 01:07:08,497
Take him!

746
01:07:32,598 --> 01:07:33,724
-How is he?
-He's okay.

747
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:35,696
-Okay, good.
-lt's all right.

748
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:51,442
Get this plane off the ground! Move!

749
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:05,994
Move around!

750
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:25,881
Biggs, drive!

751
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,176
-Where?
-Follow the fucking plane!

752
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,484
Go!

753
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,654
Go!

754
01:08:39,431 --> 01:08:41,626
I hope you enjoyed your stopover.

755
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:44,599
We'll now continue
with the remainder of the flight.

756
01:08:45,237 --> 01:08:48,832
lf you don't want to wear your seat belts,
you don't have to.

757
01:08:50,576 --> 01:08:52,168
What do we do when we catch it?

758
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:54,778
-You'll watch me sneak on the plane.
-What?

759
01:08:55,514 --> 01:08:58,813
l knew you were crazy
the minute l laid eyes on your ass.

760
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:02,579
l thought all you biscuit-eating boys
knew how to drive!

761
01:09:02,855 --> 01:09:04,584
Was that bullshit?

762
01:09:04,824 --> 01:09:07,349
l ain't had such a challenge
since high school.

763
01:09:07,526 --> 01:09:09,756
l didn't know you went to high school.

764
01:09:09,995 --> 01:09:12,156
This better be covered
by the health insurance.

765
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:14,799
lt's under the section on mental illness.

766
01:09:18,037 --> 01:09:19,834
Closer to the landing gear!

767
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:24,967
l need a gun!

768
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,941
You need your head examined!

769
01:09:27,213 --> 01:09:29,943
Keep this in good condition. lt's my wife's.

770
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,711
Bring your ass back alive, do you hear me?

771
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,786
Miss the opportunity to get back at you?
No way!

772
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,556
Let's do it!

773
01:09:51,136 --> 01:09:54,936
l got a bad feeling about this.
l got a bad feeling about this one.

774
01:09:56,809 --> 01:09:57,969
Oh, man!

775
01:10:09,655 --> 01:10:12,749
Flight Control, this is Lake Lucille.
We have a hijacked aircraft.

776
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:15,518
l want each radar station
following the plane.

777
01:10:15,661 --> 01:10:18,425
They're on it already.
Do you read me, Approach Control?

778
01:10:23,769 --> 01:10:26,829
Mr. Forget,
it's time to make the proper arrangements.

779
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:44,786
Your friend, Mr. Cutter,
has left you in a rather precarious position.

780
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:47,820
Pour me a drink.

781
01:10:50,029 --> 01:10:51,428
What do you want?

782
01:10:52,031 --> 01:10:53,658
Anything wet.

783
01:11:04,476 --> 01:11:07,604
Did you enjoy yourself down there
in the lower galley?

784
01:11:09,114 --> 01:11:12,914
You and your friend
in that tight little place?

785
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,319
Tell me, Marti.

786
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:19,320
Did the hero get into your...

787
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:21,616
...tight little place?

788
01:11:23,595 --> 01:11:25,222
You're repulsive!

789
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,228
You'll change your mind
once we get to know each other.

790
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:34,130
You'll have to kill me first.

791
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:36,635
No, Marti...

792
01:11:37,843 --> 01:11:40,004
...l'm going to kill you during.

793
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:16,906
lt's almost time.
What the hell is taking Forget so long?

794
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:19,237
Maybe he's having difficulty
finding the trunk.

795
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:20,469
ldiot.

796
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,495
Who're you?

797
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,904
Cutter. John Cutter.

798
01:13:47,606 --> 01:13:49,665
Chill out. l'm the good guy.

799
01:13:50,075 --> 01:13:51,667
-Where are they?
-ln back.

800
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,405
Can you turn the plane around
and land at the airfield we just left?

801
01:13:55,614 --> 01:13:56,740
l did it once.

802
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:58,039
Do it again.

803
01:13:58,217 --> 01:13:59,206
You got it.

804
01:14:02,955 --> 01:14:05,515
Center, Atlantic lnternational 163 with you.

805
01:14:15,801 --> 01:14:18,326
Something's wrong. Check the flight crew.

806
01:14:25,577 --> 01:14:26,942
Why'd you turn?

807
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:28,305
We were told to.

808
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,710
-By whom?
-By me.

809
01:14:35,988 --> 01:14:37,421
What a waste.

810
01:14:37,589 --> 01:14:40,683
Keep that on her. lf she moves,
throw her out the window.

811
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:42,516
Need help?

812
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,855
No, there's only one left.

813
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:46,557
He's all mine.

814
01:15:02,848 --> 01:15:03,712
Open it.

815
01:15:53,332 --> 01:15:55,027
Oh, shit! Shit!

816
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:38,960
Yes, what's your status?

817
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,229
Single at the moment...

818
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,174
...but l'm working on it.

819
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:47,141
Cutter, this is Henderson.
Have you disabled Rane?

820
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:49,342
You're damn skippy.

821
01:17:50,048 --> 01:17:51,447
All right, Cutter!

822
01:17:51,683 --> 01:17:52,980
Hey, Biggs...

823
01:17:53,185 --> 01:17:55,119
...how you doing? ls this you?

824
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:56,747
ln the flesh.

825
01:17:57,122 --> 01:17:58,851
That's a revolting thought.

826
01:19:02,587 --> 01:19:04,987
Hey, there. Have you seen John Cutter?

827
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:07,485
Last l saw him,
he was with a flight attendant.

828
01:19:07,626 --> 01:19:08,854
Okay, thanks.

829
01:19:21,706 --> 01:19:23,833
Tell Ramsey l'm taking a vacation.

830
01:19:24,142 --> 01:19:25,006
Done!

831
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:26,867
And l want a raise.

832
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:28,376
Done.

833
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:30,946
-Ready to go?
-Where do you want to go?

834
01:19:31,149 --> 01:19:32,446
Any place but here.

835
01:19:34,152 --> 01:19:35,847
What about these reporters?

836
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:38,055
What should l do about them?

837
01:19:39,257 --> 01:19:41,623
John, this isn't my bag!

838
01:19:59,478 --> 01:20:01,105
Are you from the airline?

839
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:05,679
Yes, and l'm pleased to report
that our special anti-terrorist program...

840
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,784
...which was enacted
under my supervision...

841
01:20:09,187 --> 01:20:10,916
...was an extraordinary success.

842
01:20:11,089 --> 01:20:12,613
What's your name?

843
01:20:12,824 --> 01:20:14,758
Sly Delvecchio.

844
01:20:17,696 --> 01:20:19,163
Y'all riding or walking?

845
01:20:19,364 --> 01:20:20,296
Walk!

846
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,199
Five miles to town.

847
01:20:24,102 --> 01:20:25,228
No, thanks.

848
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:28,235
Did you happen to see my wife's gun?

849
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:31,705
Good night.

850
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:33,338
Good night, Biggs.
