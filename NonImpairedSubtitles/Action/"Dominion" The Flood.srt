1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,690
Previously on Dominion...

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,487
Don't remove it.
I'll bleed to death.

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,771
Then what am I supposed to do?

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,121
You're leaving.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,931
You and Bixby almost died because
that thing came after me.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,481
If anything ever happened to you,
I couldn't live with myself.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,689
So, what, this is goodbye?
That's it.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,161
For now.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,041
Get a line.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,609
Hang in there, Michael.
Hang in there.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,207
He's losing too much blood.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,321
He's gonna be okay.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,807
Get him out of here.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,367
Get him out of here.
Come on.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,481
I'm right here, Michael.
Let's go.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,164
I'm right here!
Wait out here.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,930
Lannon!
Yeah.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,767
You're under arrest.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,567
What? What for?

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,166
Desertion of duty. No, I gotta be here.
I gotta be here.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,482
No, no... Michael...
Michael!

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,289
Front. GUARD: Walk in
through the gates.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,000
Strip.
Forward.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,847
Strip! GUARD: Those in the
line, keep your eyes forward.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,921
No!

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,488
Scan him.
Put it down.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,571
Strip. I said strip!

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,804
Strip or you go
into the hole.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,487
Get him out of here.
Next.

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,481
Strip.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,040
What you looking at?
Strip.

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,690
Lannon. AWOL.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,403
Theft of government
property.

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,445
You got something
against Vega?

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,606
You'll speak when spoken to.
Speak!

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,329
And I'm speaking to you.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,486
Throw this piece of shit
in solitary.

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,086
Get him out of here.

39
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,930
You're alive.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,485
It appears so.

41
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,602
We couldn't stop the bleeding,
so I brought you here.

42
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,762
The blade
is Empyrean steel.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,048
It should have
killed me.

44
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,211
Where is it?

45
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,809
I don't know.
I never saw it.

46
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,526
We must find that blade.
I need to see Alex.

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,451
You need to rest.

48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,723
IthoughtPdlostyou.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,241
Would that be
such a bad thing?

50
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,560
Michael.

51
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,205
You deserve better,
Becca.

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,843
You shouldn't have to live
a life cloaked in secrecy.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,320
There are good men in Vega.

54
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,970
Men you could have
a normal life with.

55
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,567
I don't want a good man.
I want a great one.

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,890
A man who I love.

57
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,403
What makes you think
I'm capable of love?

58
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,485
I know you are.

59
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,881
You must really like her.

60
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,840
Haven't you learned
your lesson yet?

61
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,046
Relax.

62
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,565
I was only trying
to scare her.

63
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,483
No doubt you would have
been spotted on radar.

64
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,285
Soldiers will be en route.
Ooh.

65
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,968
You do like her.
Uriel, enough!

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,321
Why are you here?

67
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,366
You've been keeping something
from the rest of us.

68
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,527
What might that be?
Don't play dumb!

69
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,169
You've found the Chosen One.

70
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,168
We need to talk,
little brother.

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,684
Meet me up north.

72
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,561
Bixby?
Hi.

73
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,049
They told me you were
finally out of surgery,

74
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,169
so I brought you a friend
to keep you company.

75
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,770
Cute, huh?
Yeah.

76
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,888
He was here.
Who was here?

77
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,287
The Chosen One.

78
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,606
When?

79
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,842
Last night
he brought in Michael.

80
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,605
He was here
in the infirmary?

81
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,006
Was he all right?

82
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,845
Soldiers took him
in handcuffs.

83
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,325
They have no idea
he's the Chosen One.

84
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,769
Hi. Excuse me.
Okay.

85
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,849
Um, so, I have to go now
but I am gonna come back

86
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,570
and I'm gonna check on you.

87
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,769
You're gonna feel so much
better realsoon,okay?

88
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,727
He's gonna look after you. Okay.

89
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,241
You're all set,
Senator Frost.

90
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,727
Thank you.

91
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,602
May the Savior bless you.

92
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,530
We have a long agenda.

93
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,568
Let's begin
with Senator Blake's proposal

94
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,886
for increased
defense spending.

95
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,440
Actually, General,

96
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,167
all this time,
money, and energy

97
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,969
might be put
to better use

98
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,040
if the Chosen One would simply reveal himself.

99
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,361
Might make our
defense budget obsolete.

100
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,882
Well, yes, and if the tooth fairy
should visit our pillows tonight,

101
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,482
that would solve our budget issues, too.

102
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,485
Moving on.
I'd rather not.

103
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,403
We're in a crisis, Frost.
Please.

104
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,768
Rumor has it that the child
is here in Vega.

105
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,647
Our time of waiting
may well be over.

106
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,721
Rumors and lies.

107
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,642
Back to business.

108
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,521
Yes.

109
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,842
Senator Frost is right.

110
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,409
The Chosen One is here.

111
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,124
It's me.

112
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,367
Your hope is inspirational,
as always, Senator.

113
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,041
Let's keep our
prayers in our hearts

114
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,248
and move on with the
business of running Vega.

115
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,930
Hear, hear.
Agreed.

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,684
I cede the floor.

117
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,050
You ordered Furiad to kill me.
Oh, I've wanted to.

118
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,366
Even dreamed
about it.

119
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,643
But good old Furiad
acted on his own.

120
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,240
So hard to control
that temper of his.

121
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,243
It's getting increasingly
hard to control mine.

122
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,607
Boys, calm down.

123
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,282
Take a deep breath.

124
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,249
It's time for a talk,
not a fight.

125
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,891
You should know better than
to stick us in the same room.

126
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,965
First off, you kill
all the humans you want,

127
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,687
but when it comes to Michael,
you don't touch him.

128
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,162
I told you,

129
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,730
I had nothing to do
with the attack.

130
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,327
Furiad's your soldier, and he
almost killed our brother.

131
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,484
Although
I don't blame him.

132
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,881
How could you keep the
child a secret from us?

133
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,725
An odd question
coming from the sister

134
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,207
who won't tell us where she's
been for the last 25 years.

135
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,009
Father's markings were
meant for all of us.

136
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,686
Not just you. I had to
protect him from Gabriel.

137
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,491
Didn't Father teach us
to share our toys?

138
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,570
Quiet, Gabriel. You idiots
have fought a thousand times,

139
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,529
but never like this.

140
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,443
You've got to end it.

141
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,685
You could end it.

142
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,087
Is that why you're gracing us
with your presence, Uriel?

143
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,289
You've finally chosen a side.

144
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,449
Uriel, you love mankind as much as I do.
So protect them.

145
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,521
I'm here to remind you
we're all we've got left.

146
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,881
That's why I never
choose sides.

147
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,610
I love you both.

148
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,644
Even Michael?

149
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,731
Who's spent the last two
decades soaking his steel

150
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,211
in the blood
of angels?

151
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,487
Don't pretend you care
about the eight-balls.

152
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,289
You use them
as cannon fodder.

153
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,811
What's that
supposed to mean?

154
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,291
Our brother's
learned a new trick.

155
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,164
He can possess
the eight-balls.

156
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,287
That's disgusting.

157
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,567
It's no different than what
Michael does with the child.

158
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,051
I've never forced him
to do anything.

159
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,645
But you will.

160
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,165
Does the child know
about your colorful past?

161
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,124
Is that a threat?

162
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,961
I'm taking the high road.

163
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,408
Waiting for the child to find his true
nature, and come to me on his own.

164
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,970
Like he's destined to do.

165
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,168
Stay away from him,
Gabriel.

166
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,483
Enjoy some quality time
with the boy while you can.

167
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,010
Lannon!

168
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,401
You got a visitor.

169
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,921
What?

170
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,050
You can leave us now.
Lady Riesen,

171
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,963
you have no idea what
this man is capable of.

172
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,407
I'm okay. Close it up.

173
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,411
Claire...

174
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,967
What did they do to you,
Alex?

175
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,048
Nothing I didn't deserve.

176
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,291
I had to keep
the tattoos hidden.

177
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,250
I wouldn't have even known you
were here if it wasn't for Bixby.

178
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,285
How is she?

179
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,966
She's okay.

180
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,685
And Michael?
Yeah, he's fine.

181
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,330
Listen, Alex, I'm
gonna speak to my dad

182
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,890
and I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

183
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,769
No. No.

184
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,368
It's safer if I'm in here.

185
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,448
People around me
get hurt.

186
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,805
You, Bix, Michael...

187
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,321
I don't wanna find out
who's next.

188
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,047
So when Bixby asks
to see you, what...

189
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,161
What do you want me
to say to her?

190
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,247
You tell her to always listen
to her Aunt Claire.

191
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,924
And you tell her I miss her.

192
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,251
Why don't you just
write her a letter, Alex?

193
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,970
You know,
like your dad did for you.

194
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,289
That was different.

195
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,481
H ow?

196
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,288
Release him.
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,887
Has my company really
been that unpleasant?

198
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,566
No, not at all.

199
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,324
Then stop watching
for your shift change

200
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,289
and come join me
for a drink.

201
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,521
He keeps the good stuff
at the back.

202
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,281
You're not like other
soldiers, are you, Sergeant?

203
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,091
No. I'm not. I have
a functioning brain, ma'am.

204
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,484
Yes, but...

205
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,682
There's something else.

206
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,522
Something deep inside.

207
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,050
I'm intuitive.

208
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,562
Makes me
a shrewd negotiator.

209
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,449
I know when someone's
hiding something, and

210
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,129
you, my dear,

211
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,330
are guilty as charged.

212
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,765
All right.

213
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,289
You really wanna know?

214
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,007
I'm scared of heights.

215
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,081
Hmm.

216
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,284
I understand
if you don't want to share.

217
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,408
I'm from Helena,
after all.

218
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,564
Happy drinking.

219
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,931
Fingers crossed Whele doesn't
feed you to his lions.

220
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,284
You know, when I
eventually return home,

221
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,601
I'll need someone
at my side

222
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,682
to protect my interests.

223
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,604
Why would I ever
leave Vega?

224
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,002
Why would you ever stay?

225
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,649
Here you go, sweetie.

226
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,124
EHJOV- Thank You-

227
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,926
Alex!

228
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,567
Bix. Hey.

229
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,326
Easy,easy,
you'll pop your stitches.

230
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,564
What flavor
did they stick you with?

231
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,362
Red. You know there
used to be more colors.

232
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,608
What did they
taste like?

233
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,887
Red.

234
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,364
It's not your fault.

235
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,764
Yeah, it is.

236
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,850
It is my fault.

237
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,642
Here. I saved an extra.

238
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,811
You take it.

239
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,531
All right.

240
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,090
They don't make it
how they used to.

241
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,841
Hey-

242
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,042
You know, Frost has been begging to show
off this irrigation system for weeks.

243
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,005
Where's the rest
of the Senate?

244
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,731
It's time the three of
us had a private conversation.

245
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,327
Oh, this isn't about more
silly rumors, is it?

246
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,404
You know I'd never been
a religious man.

247
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,965
Never believed
in anything

248
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,963
I couldn't see
with my own eyes.

249
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,927
Then, one day, a being came down from
the sky, with wings on his back,

250
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,731
came to our defense,
protected our city.

251
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,171
Told us
he'd saved a baby,

252
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,362
and that baby would
one day save us all.

253
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,286
Thathope is what got
us through the war.

254
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,411
What gets me
through every day.

255
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,725
What gives so many people in
this city something to live for.

256
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,163
I'm sorry
to disappoint you, Thomas,

257
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,321
but we're
the only ones here.

258
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,004
Don't lie to me, Edward.

259
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,526
I know that the Chosen One's
here and that you're hiding him.

260
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,562
Because you know that once the
people have their savior,

261
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,482
your power means nothing.

262
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,125
Oh, Frost, come on.

263
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,804
Haven't we been through this?

264
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,484
Don't patronize me, David.

265
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,605
A little girl in the
infirmary told his daughter

266
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,848
that the Chosen One
had been arrested.

267
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,208
And Claire Riesen seemed to
know exactly who he was.

268
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,207
What's that in your hand?

269
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,326
This is a wireless
control unit.

270
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,241
It has a biometric lock that
responds only to my thumbprint.

271
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,441
Covers the entire tower.

272
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,011
Icanlock all the doors.

273
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,085
Open the irrigation tanks...

274
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,287
...all of them.

275
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,445
600,000 gallons
of water,

276
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,966
rushing into the tower
all at once.

277
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,045
We'll drown.

278
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,882
All of the crops
will be destroyed.

279
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,724
And the people
of Vega will starve.

280
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,325
What is it you want?

281
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,327
I want to meet the Chosen One.

282
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,804
Wait, she asked you
to go back to Helena?

283
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,445
No, not in so many words.

284
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,330
Word of advice. Run.

285
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,566
Ethan.

286
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,130
The woman had
a body in a box

287
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,326
delivered to
her doorstep.

288
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,046
Don't worry about me.

289
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,481
Yeah, I'm sure that's what
the woman in the box said.

290
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,047
You know what I think?

291
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,245
I think a strong, regal
woman like Madam Arika,

292
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,001
I think she
threatens you, huh?

293
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,766
I think you're right.

294
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,525
Besides, what good am I
really doing here anyways?

295
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,524
Noma, you've saved
my ass at least once.

296
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,805
Lannon, where
you been, bro?

297
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,881
Been looking
all over for you.

298
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,521
I took a drive.
Needed to clear my head.

299
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,682
I get it.

300
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,009
Uh, I don't.

301
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,365
What's going
on,guys?

302
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,882
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

303
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,880
You go outside
the walls,

304
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,408
disappear for an entire
day to clear your head

305
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,527
and you're all "I get it"? Guys,
come on, that's not nothing.

306
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,810
Ethan, I've been seeing
Claire Riesen.

307
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,243
As in the same Claire Riesen
whose father orders executions?

308
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,606
All right, let's saddle up,

309
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,411
hostage situation at the
agri-tower in progress.

310
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,367
Prep for a raid.
We're up in five.

311
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,091
What's going on, Lieutenant? Our
entire food supply is at risk

312
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,642
of being destroyed as well as the lives
of the General and Consul Whele.

313
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,201
Look alive, troops!

314
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,048
Listen, we can't simply walk
in there and start shooting.

315
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,848
We need an executive
order from Riesen.

316
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,001
Well, he's not here.

317
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,525
The message Frost
sent us made it clear

318
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,325
that all security systems in the
agri-tower have been placed on lockdown.

319
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,170
So call in the engineer
and unlock them.

320
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,526
Frost is
that engineer.

321
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,604
Our grains are in that tower.
The food supply is at risk.

322
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,446
We have no choice but to use force.
Don't you see that?

323
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,363
Becca, I got your message.
Is my father okay?

324
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,761
He's fine, Claire.

325
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,761
By the power vested in
me as second consul,

326
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,127
I appoint you Lady of
the City pro tern.

327
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,281
Oh!

328
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,965
Please take
a seat.

329
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,085
She does not havethe
authority at all.

330
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,124
So what are we doing?
What's our response?

331
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,248
The Corps are in a holding
pattern, awaiting our

332
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,129
decision to enter
and liberate the hostages.

333
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,651
What are Senator
Frost's demands?

334
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,051
He's going to
flood the tower

335
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,123
unless he's given an audience
with the Chosen One.

336
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,406
What?

337
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,642
Let's vote on
sending the Corps in.

338
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,050
Wait, uh, before we vote, I'd like a
moment to confer with my consuls.

339
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,445
Frost, if you know me at all,

340
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,367
you know the food supply for
this city is not negotiable.

341
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,681
Oh, I do know you.

342
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,730
I know both of you

343
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,882
I can't allow
a few politicians

344
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,770
to control the destiny
of the entire human race

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,844
just because they feel their
grip on power is threatened.

346
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,446
Why would we be
threatened by a myth?

347
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,411
Why would Gabriel attack
Vega after 10 years of peace?

348
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,601
Look I... I know what it's like
to believe something so strongly

349
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,842
that you're blinded, Thomas.

350
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,802
It blinds you to the simple fact that
your faith is nothing but a crutch.

351
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,403
It's a Band-Aid
for your own fears.

352
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,126
Belief in something
doesn't make it real.

353
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,885
Nor will it save you.

354
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,364
My faith is made of stronger stuff
than dime-store televangelism, David.

355
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,403
I know that he will
save the human race.

356
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,201
And that he will lead us
against these monsters.

357
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,528
These monsters
you're talking about.

358
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,762
They haunt my dreams
to this day.

359
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,161
I... I try to make sense of it,
but for the life of me I can't.

360
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,524
But after all my long nights,
after all my heartache,

361
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,249
you know what
I came to realize?

362
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,570
The Chosen One? It's us.

363
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,086
It's the people of Vega.
That's what's gonna save us.

364
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,083
I wish that were true.

365
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,326
You have 30 minutes
to bring him to me.

366
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,245
You know how much
I respect you, but stalling

367
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,243
any longer is gonna get
both our fathers killed.

368
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,081
William, raiding the tower will scare
Frost into releasing the water.

369
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,208
The only alternative is to
give him what he wants.

370
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,166
Yes. Would that be
such a bad thing?

371
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,360
I think the people of Vega deserve
to know he's finally arrived.

372
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,248
Claire, I share your faith, I do, but
Alex's safety's far more important.

373
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,087
What if things go sideways
and Frost pulls the trigger?

374
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,482
He'll kill both our fathers and the
Chosen One in the process. What then?

375
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,841
Right now, we need to
vote on sending in the Corps.

376
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,003
It's our only option. They
can be there in 15 minutes.

377
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
Fine. Fine.

378
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,246
I give you permission to cast
my vote with yours.

379
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,771
Excuse me.

380
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,088
Claire! Where
are you going?

381
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,481
We have to vote.

382
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,682
It's always been like this
with the two of you,

383
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,165
fighting over a world that was
never even created for us.

384
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,768
How could Father just
desert us like this?

385
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,408
Uriel, be patient.
He will return.

386
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,683
How do you know? I know.

387
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,125
I miss him.

388
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,001
Sister.

389
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,011
Train your chosen one.

390
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,247
Unlock the markings and help
him fulfill his destiny

391
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,686
and I promise,
you won't face Gabriel alone.

392
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,921
You'll have my sword.

393
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,081
Thank you.

394
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,170
Don't thank me.

395
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,284
They were once Father's
greatest creation.

396
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,882
Odds are the Senate is authorizing
an armed assault as we speak.

397
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,771
What? Risk both of us
and the tomatoes?

398
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,970
Come on, Edward. You know Thorn
needs the kids to pass that vote,

399
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,247
and we both know they
are not up to the task.

400
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,887
It's all because of that V-1 runt
your daughter took under her wing.

401
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,770
I should've dealt with her
when I dealt with those techs.

402
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,925
Look,

403
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,240
Thomas,

404
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,163
despite all the unkind things

405
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,369
I've said about you
behind closed doors,

406
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,888
in front of them as well.

407
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,924
Up until this afternoon,

408
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,721
I've always known you
to be a reasonable man.

409
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,568
Look what you're doing here.

410
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,721
Come on. Let's be reasonable.
Open the doors.

411
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,129
I am tired
of being reasonable, David.

412
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,442
Go!Go!Go!

413
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,371
We have confirmation. Consul Whele is down.
Prepare to move.

414
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,090
I don't get it. Last time
I was on Frost's detail,

415
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,730
the guy spent all his
free time baking.

416
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,687
I gotta say, his butterscotch brownies?
Pretty damn good.

417
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,444
This is a hostage situation.

418
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,163
Frost must want something.

419
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,890
What aren't
they telling us?

420
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,770
Yeah, apparently the Senator
demanded to see the Chosen One.

421
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,321
What?

422
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,131
Yeah, crazy, huh?
The guy's totally lost it.

423
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,931
Hey, cheer up, man.

424
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,729
You know we don't get to
do shit like this anymore.

425
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,527
Looks like it
missed the artery.

426
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,842
You're gonna live.

427
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,002
Sorry to disappoint you.

428
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,082
I'm the one who
just got shot.

429
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,971
How come you look like
you're gonna drop dead?

430
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,131
It's your heart, huh?
My heart is fine.

431
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,200
What are you taking for it? Pills.
For what they're damn worth.

432
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,527
What kind of pills?

433
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,044
If I could pronounce the name, don't you
think I would've damn well said it?

434
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,565
You know,

435
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,931
between the two of us

436
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,284
we've probably beaten
death a hundred times.

437
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,803
Resisted
the possessions.

438
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,248
Fought off how many
black-eyed beasts?

439
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,085
And now

440
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,890
it will probably come to
an end at the hands of

441
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,922
Thomas Frost.
Crazy son of a bitch.

442
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,491
I wish I could say
he was crazy.

443
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,481
Mack, Lannon, Banks,
take forward position.

444
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,241
Gomez, Rogers, O'Neill, take flank.
Yes, sir.

445
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,243
You're authorized
to terminate the target.

446
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,163
Sir, what about
collateral damage, sir?

447
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,004
The crops are our priority.
Wait.

448
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,845
Lieutenant. You
heard your order.

449
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,244
Lieutenant? Lieutenant,
let me go in.

450
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,682
Get the hell back in line
before I kick your ass.

451
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,524
He has
my approval.

452
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,324
Sergeant Lannon
can negotiate.

453
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,521
Miss Riesen, with all respect, I
have the orders from the Senate.

454
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,086
I'm acting Lady of the City.

455
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,528
This is an executive order.

456
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,808
You and your negotiator
have five minutes.

457
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,283
All points, hold position.

458
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,927
They're getting Lannon to do the talking?
I'm the talker.

459
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,368
Senator Frost, we are
complying with your request.

460
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,962
Please back away
from the door.

461
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,008
Only one person
comes in. Only one man.

462
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,561
I'm the one you want to see.

463
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,721
I'm the Chosen One.

464
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,770
Is this some
kind of joke?

465
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,044
I'm afraid
not, sir.

466
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,289
Please, let the General
and the Consul go

467
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,001
and we'll talk.

468
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,321
You're a V-2.

469
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,890
I've seen you
guarding House Riesen.

470
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,889
What did they do,
paint those things on you?

471
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,525
What the hell do you
take me for, Edward?

472
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,570
Just take
it easy, Frost.

473
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,844
Come on, Frost,
this is what you wanted.

474
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,931
Sir, please. Please.
I swear. I'm the one.

475
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,567
I'm the baby Michael saved.
Prove it.

476
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,810
She died for you.

477
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,011
What did you say?

478
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,408
She died for you.

479
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,087
Yes, she did.
My daughter, Abby.

480
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,730
She died for me.

481
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,930
It was the first night
of the war.

482
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,288
And because of Abby,
I was able to survive.

483
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,164
Please, Senator,
turn off the water.

484
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,082
You can change things.

485
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,444
Now, we are gonna go outside

486
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,682
and let the people know that
things are gonna be different now.

487
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,448
We will. We'll tell everyone.
We'll tell them together.

488
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,931
Please, just... turn it off.

489
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,165
Thank you, Savior.

490
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,127
Thank you.

491
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,731
What did you do that for?

492
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,164
Put your shirt on.

493
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,169
These should help with the pain. But
you've got to stay off your feet.

494
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,286
Thank you.

495
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,001
You shouldn't
be drinking.

496
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,526
And you shouldn't have sent
the Corps into the agri-tower

497
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,841
a remarkably poor
decision, even for you.

498
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,690
I did what's
best for the city.

499
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,130
No, Claire did that by sending in the only
man capable of defusing the situation.

500
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,124
You, you let
your faith interfere.

501
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,407
You put the life of your
precious Chosen One

502
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,689
before the city,
before your own father.

503
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,482
Alex Lannon? He's the one
destined to save mankind,

504
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,841
not two old men
past their prime.

505
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,409
Have fun.

506
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,249
Praise the Mother of All.

507
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,121
David, you could
have been killed.

508
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,086
Well, forgive me if I'm
not really in the mood.

509
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,970
You're burning up.

510
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,844
There's a Helenic remedy
that'll take the fever down.

511
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,684
I'll have a guard
fetch the ingredients.

512
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,243
I'll stick to bourbon.

513
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,409
Wow, this is the last place
I thought I'd find you.

514
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,807
Twenty years,
Frost served Vega.

515
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,566
One of the city's founding fathers, and
now he'll be remembered as a madman.

516
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,330
Mmm-mmm,

517
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,082
my father has become an
expert at rewriting history.

518
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,402
Frost is gonna get
a state funeral.

519
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,687
He's gonna be
remembered as a hero.

520
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,287
A hero who saved the agri-towers
from an accidental flood

521
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,530
at the cost of his
own life.

522
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,848
He didn't die for nothing.

523
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,650
You came forward, Alex. Ihadto.

524
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,969
People's lives
were at stake.

525
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,403
But when I
was in there,

526
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,485
these words came to me

527
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,641
through my markings.

528
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,811
Those words made
Frost believe in me.

529
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,045
Maybe Frost was right.

530
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,881
Maybe the people do
deserve to know about you.

531
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,968
I don't know
what I'm doing, Claire.

532
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,002
I got lucky this time,
but I...

533
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,766
I don't know what
any of this means.

534
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,002
So maybe it's time you
start figuring it out.

535
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,809
lﬂleave
youtoit

536
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,691
Where have
you been?

537
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,610
Family
emergency.

538
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,204
Yeah, I had an emergency of my own.
I could have used your help.

539
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,484
Alex, I can help you.
I can teach you,

540
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,688
but only if
you're willing.

541
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,407
I want to learn

542
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,323
about everything.

543
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,888
What do
you want?

544
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,529
I don't want
to fight.

545
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,928
That was never what I
wanted with any of this.

546
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,562
I thought I could fix things
between you and Michael.

547
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,927
But I'm afraid Michael's
lost his way.

548
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,208
I've been telling you
that for centuries.

549
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,204
Well, now that
the Chosen One's here,

550
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,408
I can't just sit back
and do nothing.

551
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,165
You say you can sway him,

552
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,928
that he's fated to you,
and not our brother.

553
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,650
As Father wanted it.

554
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,085
Then prove it to me.

555
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,409
Help him help the humans
to their own destruction.

556
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,600
And I promise, you won't
face Michael alone.

557
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,441
You will have my sword.

558
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,044
Thank you, sister.

559
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,883
You won't
feel a thing.
