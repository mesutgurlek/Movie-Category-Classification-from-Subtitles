Are we going to shoot him?

we'll get him.

00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,712
Don't tell me you weren't thinking
about killing him already.

809
00:50:38,796 --> 00:50:39,838
I saved you
the embarrassment

810
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:41,298
of having family blood
on your hands.

811
00:50:41,382 --> 00:50:43,008
And if he was willing
to kill your brother,

812
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:44,385
he was coming
to kill you next.

813
00:50:44,468 --> 00:50:46,178
In about a minute and a
half, to be precise.

814
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:47,555
So, I saved your
fucking life twice.

815
00:50:47,638 --> 00:50:48,639
(YELLS)

816
00:50:51,642 --> 00:50:52,768
I need a drink

817
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,229
(PANTING) Fuck!

818
00:50:56,814 --> 00:50:57,815
Fuck!

819
00:50:57,898 --> 00:50:58,899
Cut him loose!

820
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,277
Yeah, okay.
Give me a minute.

821
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:03,445
I need to change my shorts,
for God's sake!

822
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:07,616
(IN SPANISH)

823
00:51:07,658 --> 00:51:08,701
He knows about my liver

824
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:12,121
He knew about
our problems with Carnal

825
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,624
He seems to know
what I'm thinking

826
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:18,544
Who is he?

827
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:19,628
I don't know

828
00:51:20,004 --> 00:51:21,088
Armando doesn't know either

829
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:24,800
So he's in here with no name,
charges, or fingerprints?

830
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:27,761
You're in charge
of security!

831
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:30,055
How does this fucking gringo
know everything?

832
00:51:30,139 --> 00:51:31,140
So kill him then

833
00:51:31,223 --> 00:51:32,224
You idiot!

834
00:51:33,684 --> 00:51:35,644
Don't be hasty!

835
00:51:36,604 --> 00:51:38,188
First, find out who sent him

836
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:39,857
Find out who he is

837
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:42,526
Then we kill him

838
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,325

(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, Butterballs.

845
00:52:01,086 --> 00:52:02,796

<i>I know there's money.</i>
<i>I could still help you out.</i>

850
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:21,565
All I want is
a piece of the pie.

851
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:24,652
<i>Talkative as ever, eh?</i>

852
00:52:24,777 --> 00:52:27,071
That's okay.
It was nice knowing you.

853
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:29,907
Sorry if we got off
on the wrong foot.

854
00:52:30,115 --> 00:52:32,493
Good luck then.
You're gonna need it.

What do you want, guero?

860
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:48,217
I have some
information for you

861
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:49,718
that I think you
might find valuable.

862
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,930
Uh, two cops,
Vazquez and Romero,

863
00:52:53,013 --> 00:52:55,265
badge number 90348...

864
00:52:55,307 --> 00:52:57,643
Okay, okay, okay.
We know our cops.

865
00:52:57,726 --> 00:52:58,936
Oh, you know them?
Mmm.

866
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:02,022
Well, in that case you'll
find this really interesting.

867
00:53:02,106 --> 00:53:04,483
They took a sizeable
amount of money

868
00:53:04,566 --> 00:53:05,609
from me when they
brought me here.

869
00:53:05,693 --> 00:53:07,653
And I figure I'll never
see the money again

870
00:53:07,736 --> 00:53:09,488
and I just wondered
if they gave you your cut.

871
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:12,408
Why? What's in it for you?

872
00:53:13,242 --> 00:53:16,704
Mmm. Nothing now. Probably
since I told you, but...

873
00:53:16,787 --> 00:53:18,706
Look, I think a finder's fee
would be fair.

874
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,958
How much?
Oh, I don't need much.

875
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:23,210
Ten percent, maybe.
Okay, eight.

876
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,796
Uh-uh. How much money?

877
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:27,089
Oh.

878
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:30,509
You know, I only stole it. I
didn't have time to count it.

879
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:34,722
Uh, but ballpark, two
million, maybe a little more.

880
00:53:35,764 --> 00:53:39,226
You know what will happen
if you are pushing my leg?

881
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:42,604
Si. I know.
I wouldn't push your leg.

882

No bullshit.

No, there's only 1.7 and a

<i>Where's the rest?</i>

The cars, some hookers.

902
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:47,628
We bought them shoes.
