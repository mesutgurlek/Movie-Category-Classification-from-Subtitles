1
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,611
-Bull's-eye!
-You bet, Dad!

2
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,525
You go straight home.

3
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,605
Bombs away!

4
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:22,123
Sayonara, sucker!

5
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:25,730
No preservatives, just pure water!

6
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,243
Cool, clear water.

7
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,888
Step up, schmuck, get some dealing done.

8
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,044
H20, that's my go.

9
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:37,201
Don't you understand? This is water.
You can't live without it.

10
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:45,126
What's a little fallout, huh?
Have a nice day!

11
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:03,686
You get a sack of grain. . .

12
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:06,323
. . .or a woman for two hours.

13
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:15,849
-What are you trading?
-I'm looking for someone.

14
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:17,412
Are you trading or not?

15
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:18,802
He had a team of camels.

16
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:23,764
People come here to trade, make a little
profit, do a little business.

17
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:27,241
If you've nothing to trade,
you've no business here.

18
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:28,482
An hour inside.

19
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,727
-Next!
-I got skills I can trade.

20
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:34,370
Sorry. The brothel's full.

21
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,447
One hour.

22
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,605
-And if you find him?
-I'll ask him to return what's mine.

23
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:59,453
And he'll be desperate
to clear his conscience.

24
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:00,682
He will be.

25
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,805
You're that good?

26
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:07,932
Perhaps you have something to trade
after all.

27
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,402
Keep talking.

28
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,083
24 hours of your life.

29
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:15,127
In return,
you'll get back what was stolen.

30
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:17,206
Sounds like a bargain.

31
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:21,486
It's not. Let's talk.
Come inside.

32
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,562
Leave your weapons here.
It's the law.

33
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:11,285
Remember, this is the vehicle
that sent Detroit broke.

34
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:14,645
Where did you get these animals?

35
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:17,691
The glorious dromedary.
The ship of the desert.

36
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:22,689
They've got independent suspension,
power steering and no emission control.

37
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,201
Ride them away now.

38
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:42,441
A warrior, Aunty.

39
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:46,171
Lost everything.
Looking for a deal.

40
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,403
But he's just a raggedy man.

41
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:54,687
He's quick.

42
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,209
Ironbar. . .

43
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:58,092
. . .can he do it?

44
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,169
Maybe.

45
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,725
What did you do before this?

46
00:11:09,053 --> 00:11:11,123
I was a cop, a driver.

47
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,844
But how the world turns.

48
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,653
One day cock of the walk,
next, a feather duster.

49
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,612
Play something tragic, Ton Ton.

50
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,331
Do you know who I was?

51
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:30,168
Nobody.

52
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:34,010
Except on the day after,
I was still alive.

53
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:37,407
This nobody had a chance to be somebody.

54
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,967
So much for history. Anyway. . . .
Water? Fruit?

55
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:33,691
Congratulations. You're the first
to survive the audition.

56
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,168
Drink.

57
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:44,642
It's okay.

58
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,128
Come with me.

59
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:03,492
Look around. All this I built.

60
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,441
Up to my armpits in blood and shit.

61
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,723
Where there was desert,
now there's a town.

62
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:13,564
Where there was robbery,
there's trade.

63
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,052
Where there was despair,
now there's hope.

64
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:18,972
It's civilization.

65
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:21,848
I'll do anything to protect it.

66
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:27,809
Today it's necessary to kill a man.
What do you say?

67
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,008
What do you pay?

68
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:36,245
I'll re-equip you. . . .
Vehicles, animals. Fuel, if you want.

69
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,852
It's a generous offer.

70
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:41,210
Why me? You've got warriors,
weapons. Give the order.

71
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,167
We are dealing with subtleties here.

72
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,803
This is no enemy.
It's almost family.

73
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:49,205
I see, real civilized.

74
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:53,402
The reasons don't concern you,
just the conditions. Deal?

75
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:58,651
First, no one knows
you're working for Aunty.

76
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,043
You hit him, you go.

77
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,643
Second, it's a fair fight.

78
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:06,163
And third, it's to the death.

79
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,532
Who's the bunny?

80
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:48,528
It's called Underworld.
It's where Bartertown gets its energy.

81
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,372
Oil, natural gas?

82
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:52,087
Pigs.

83
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:54,245
Pigs like those?

84
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,683
-Bullshit.
-Pigshit.

85
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:01,882
Pigshit. The lights,
the motors, the vehicles. . .

86
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:05,563
. . .all run by a high-powered gas
called methane.

87
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,722
Methane comes from pigshit.

88
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:12,767
Have a look.
Tell me what you see.

89
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:17,890
I see a big guy
giving a little guy a piggyback.

90
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,848
MasterBlaster. They're a unit.

91
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,049
They even share the same name.

92
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:26,888
The little one is called Master.
He's the brains.

93
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,090
He runs Underworld.

94
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:33,208
The other one is Blaster.
He's the muscle.

95
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:36,082
Together they can be very powerful.

96
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,883
They are also arrogant.

97
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:45,049
We want to keep the brain,
dump the body.

98
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:47,045
He's big. Is he good?

99
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:50,813
He can beat most men with his breath.

100
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,613
I want a closer look at him.
How do I get in there?

101
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,686
-It's a factory. Ask for work.
-I know nothing about methane.

102
00:15:58,013 --> 00:15:59,844
You can shovel shit, can't you?

103
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,132
Hey, you!

104
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,047
Let's talk!

105
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:56,726
Here, free man, come help a convict.
You don't want to end up like me.

106
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,646
How long are you in for?

107
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,645
The big one. Life.

108
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,043
For killing a pig?

109
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:05,410
I had to feed the kids.

110
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:09,732
Doesn't worry me. Down here
life's two, three years.

111
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:25,890
Where is that bum mechanic Blackfinger?

112
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:38,011
We got a real problem.

113
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,801
Twelve pounds of dynamite set to blow.

114
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:44,288
You expert! Disarm!

115
00:17:57,653 --> 00:18:01,851
It's a class job. One mistake,
it'll blow the crap out of this place.

116
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,442
-Literally.
-Think what to do!

117
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:10,688
Now. . .the dynamite is connected
to the timing device. . .

118
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,885
. . .which is connected to the switch,
which I can't find. . .

119
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,971
. . .which is connected to the. . .

120
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,368
. . .battery.

121
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,765
-I'll disconnect the battery!
-I wouldn't do that.

122
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:25,651
Who you?

123
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:27,485
-Me Max.
-You smart.

124
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:29,287
That's my vehicle.

125
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:30,483
Disarm!

126
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:31,963
How much?

127
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:34,124
No trade. Do!

128
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:37,808
Fetch!

129
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:46,044
Me order. Me Master!

130
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,649
Me run Bartertown!

131
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,131
That's why you live in shit.

132
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,404
Not shit! Energy!

133
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:56,607
Call it what you like,
it still smells like shit.

134
00:18:56,893 --> 00:19:00,886
Not shit! Energy!
No energy, no town!

135
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,409
Me King Arab!

136
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:05,211
Sure. Me, fairy princess.

137
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,292
Embargo, on!

138
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,606
Embargo on! Main valve off!

139
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:47,210
Four, three, two. . . .

140
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,651
For God's sake, what now?

141
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:52,603
Who run Bartertown?

142
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,601
Damn it!
I told you, no more embargos.

143
00:19:58,173 --> 00:19:59,049
More, Blaster.

144
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:07,852
Who run Bartertown?

145
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:14,246
Who run Bartertown?

146
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:16,525
You know who.

147
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:18,088
Say.

148
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:20,646
MasterBlaster.

149
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:23,568
Say loud.

150
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,361
MasterBlaster.

151
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,767
MasterBlaster what?

152
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,852
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

153
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:37,526
Louder!

154
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:41,486
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

155
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,003
Lift embargo.

156
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,169
You want foot in face?

157
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:15,052
Disarm.

158
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:17,765
Good boy.

159
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,651
Over here, Blaster.

160
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:23,682
-What are you laying for?
-Nothing.

161
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,128
-Who are you?
-Nobody.

162
00:22:25,373 --> 00:22:29,127
No, mister, I can feel it.
The dice are rolling!

163
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:38,609
I want my camels, my vehicle,
food, water, methane.

164
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,564
-Deal.
-You said a fair fight.

165
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:46,089
-What does that mean?
-As provided by law.

166
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:47,728
Thunderdome.

167
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:56,165
Two men, hand to hand.
No jury, no appeal, no parole.

168
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:58,410
Two men enter, one man leaves.

169
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:01,442
Weapons?

170
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,805
Anything's possible.
Chance decides.

171
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:08,007
Thunderdome.
How do I get in there?

172
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,608
That's easy. Pick a fight.

173
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,523
Everybody have a good time!

174
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:54,449
That's my vehicle
and I want it back!

175
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,123
Hearing wonky.
Sounds like an order.

176
00:23:58,173 --> 00:23:59,208
That's right.

177
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:03,686
Yumping Yesus! Him sad.
Brain broken.

178
00:24:05,493 --> 00:24:07,051
Me explain.

179
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,532
This my vehicle. You. . .

180
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:12,645
. . .pedestrian!

181
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:18,008
Three seconds. . .

182
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:20,125
. . .break neck. One. . . .

183
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:31,441
MasterBlaster!

184
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,083
Listen to the law!

185
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:37,650
Aunty, two men in dispute.

186
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:43,048
These our witness, Aunty.

187
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:46,769
Us suffer bad.
Us want justice.

188
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:49,886
We want Thunderdome!

189
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:54,241
You know the law.
Two men enter, one man leaves.

190
00:24:56,813 --> 00:25:01,603
This Blaster.
Twenty men enter, only him leave.

191
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:04,926
Then it's your choice.
Thunderdome.

192
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:39,851
Aunty! Aunty!

193
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:47,047
Welcome to another edition
of Thunderdome!

194
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:12,808
Listen on! Listen on!

195
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:15,205
This is the truth of it.

196
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:19,566
Fighting leads to killing,
and killing gets to warring.

197
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:22,845
And that was damn near
the death of us all.

198
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:28,005
Look at us now, busted up
and everyone talking about hard rain.

199
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:32,970
But we've learned by the dust
of them all. Bartertown's learned.

200
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:36,644
Now when men get to fighting,
it happens here.

201
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:38,929
And it finishes here.

202
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:43,047
Two men enter, one man leaves.

203
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:09,843
And right now,
I've got two men.

204
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:13,606
Two men with a gut full of fear.

205
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:18,731
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. . .

206
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,328
. . .dying time's here!

207
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:28,170
He's the ball cracker.
Death on foot.

208
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:32,481
You know him. You love him!
He's Blaster!

209
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:46,603
The challenger,
direct from out of the Wasteland.

210
00:27:46,893 --> 00:27:49,805
He's bad. He's beautiful.
He's crazy!

211
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:53,406
It's the man with no name!

212
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:50,092
Thunderdome's simple. Get to the
weapons, use them anyway you can.

213
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:53,809
I know you won't break the rules.
There aren't any.

214
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:00,162
Remember where you are.

215
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:02,772
This is Thunderdome.

216
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:07,684
Death is listening, and will take
the first man that screams.

217
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:10,927
Prepare!

218
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,488
Two men enter, one man leaves!

219
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,685
-You know the law!
-This is Thunderdome!

220
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:25,763
Kill him!

221
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:28,971
No, no! Look at his face!

222
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:31,446
He's got the mind of a child.

223
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,291
It's not his fault.

224
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,410
Blaster, I'm sorry.

225
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:44,771
This wasn't part of the deal.

226
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:46,243
Deal?!

227
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:50,451
What do you mean, "deal"?

228
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:55,363
You must have tasted it.
It was in your hands.

229
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,128
You had it all!

230
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,812
What do you mean, "deal"?

231
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:05,526
No more methane!

232
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:08,653
This place. . .finished!

233
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,121
No, little man.

234
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:12,006
We've only just begun.

235
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:38,888
Open it.

236
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:45,609
Two men enter. One man leaves!

237
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:21,650
What's this?!

238
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:28,171
Do you think I don't know the law?
Wasn't it me who wrote it?

239
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:31,053
And this man has broken the law.

240
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:33,290
Right or wrong, we had a deal.

241
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:37,084
And the law says,
"Bust a deal, face the wheel. "

242
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:39,643
Bust a deal and face the wheel.

243
00:36:54,653 --> 00:36:57,486
All our lives hang by a thread.

244
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:00,322
Now we've got a man
waiting for sentence.

245
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:03,850
But ain't it the truth?
You take your chances with the law.

246
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,767
Justice is only a roll of the dice. . .

247
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:10,887
. . .a flip of the coin,
a turn of the wheel.

248
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:28,572
Fix it.

249
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:31,243
You run Bartertown.

250
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,325
You fix.

251
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:44,203
Not pigs! No!

252
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:05,486
That's enough!

253
00:40:07,453 --> 00:40:10,923
Do you want to use him or kill him?
Bring him up.

254
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:27,610
Master, do what lronbar says.

255
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:31,606
I will. Yeah, I will.

256
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:54,811
Savannah!

257
00:46:00,853 --> 00:46:02,605
Finn, look.

258
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:07,093
It's him. I finded him.

259
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,291
It's Captain Walker.

260
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:54,808
-What's his talk?
-He ain't made wordstuff.

261
00:46:55,093 --> 00:46:57,527
It's a long track.
Maybe he's burned out.

262
00:46:57,813 --> 00:47:00,202
Maybe.
Maybe he's just listening.

263
00:47:02,493 --> 00:47:04,165
Walker? Hello?

264
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:08,043
Maybe he's talking,
but we ain't hearing.

265
00:47:08,413 --> 00:47:09,971
You see his lips ain't moving.

266
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:12,045
Not with wordstuff, with sonic.

267
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:15,246
That ain't never gonna work,
sonic-bonic bullshit!

268
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:20,044
This is Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

269
00:47:20,413 --> 00:47:21,687
Can you hear me?

270
00:47:22,613 --> 00:47:24,046
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

271
00:47:25,933 --> 00:47:27,207
Come in.

272
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,651
Is anybody out there?

273
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:35,408
Can you read me, Walker?

274
00:47:56,213 --> 00:47:57,692
What's up, Doc?

275
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:01,649
Hey, take me with you!

276
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,691
Can you hear me, Walker?

277
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,725
Fly, Walker!

278
00:49:42,493 --> 00:49:43,926
Who are you?

279
00:49:45,693 --> 00:49:47,092
Quiet!

280
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,812
Shut up!

281
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:56,844
Enough!

282
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:35,452
Who are you?

283
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:38,812
We are the waiting ones.

284
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:40,208
Waiting for what?

285
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:41,761
Waiting for you.

286
00:50:43,213 --> 00:50:44,123
And who am l?

287
00:50:48,573 --> 00:50:50,609
I think he be testing us.

288
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:55,086
This a testing, Walker?
You reckon we been slack?

289
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,850
I don't know.
Maybe you've been slack.

290
00:50:58,653 --> 00:51:02,487
We ain't. We kept it straight.
It's all there.

291
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:06,925
Everything marked, everything
'membered. You wait, you'll see.

292
00:51:14,813 --> 00:51:17,691
This you knows.
I be First Tracker.

293
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:20,322
Times past count I done the Tell.

294
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:25,325
But it weren't me that tumbled Walker.
It was Savannah.

295
00:51:25,973 --> 00:51:28,726
So it's only right
that she take the Tell.

296
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:35,451
This ain't one body's story.
It's the story of us all.

297
00:51:35,853 --> 00:51:39,243
We got it mouth-to-mouth.
You got to listen it and 'member.

298
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:43,367
'Cause what you hears today
you got to tell the birthed tomorrow.

299
00:51:44,413 --> 00:51:46,529
I'm looking behind us now. . .

300
00:51:46,933 --> 00:51:48,844
. . .across the count of time. . .

301
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:52,848
. . .down the long haul,
into history back.

302
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:56,051
I sees the end what were the start.

303
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,246
It's Pox-Eclipse, full of pain!

304
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:12,210
And out of it were birthed
crackling dust and fearsome time.

305
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:13,886
It were full-on winter. . .

306
00:52:14,293 --> 00:52:16,170
. . .and Mr. Dead chasing them all.

307
00:52:16,573 --> 00:52:20,407
But one he couldn't catch.
That were Captain Walker.

308
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:25,170
He gathers up a gang, takes to the air
and flies to the sky!

309
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:31,244
So they left their homes,
said bidey-bye to the high-scrapers. . .

310
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:35,089
. . .and what were left of the knowing,
they left behind.

311
00:52:36,093 --> 00:52:38,288
Some say the wind just stoppered.

312
00:52:38,653 --> 00:52:41,850
Others reckon it were a gang
called Turbulence.

313
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:49,646
And after the wreck. . .

314
00:52:50,053 --> 00:52:52,283
. . .some had been jumped by Mr. Dead. . .

315
00:52:52,653 --> 00:52:56,487
. . .but some had got the luck,
and it leads them here.

316
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:01,728
One look and they's got the hots for it.
They word it "Planet Earth. "

317
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:06,047
And they says, "We don't need
the knowing. We can live here. "

318
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:09,770
"We don't need the knowing.
We can live here. "

319
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:14,050
Time counts and keeps counting.

320
00:53:14,573 --> 00:53:16,291
They gets missing what they had.

321
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:20,162
They get so lonely for the
high-scrapers and the video.

322
00:53:25,773 --> 00:53:30,210
And they does the pictures so they'd
'member all the knowing that they lost.

323
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:41,568
'Member this?

324
00:53:41,853 --> 00:53:43,923
Tomorrow-morrow Land!

325
00:53:44,293 --> 00:53:45,772
'Member this?

326
00:53:46,053 --> 00:53:47,805
The River of Light!

327
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:49,248
'Member this?

328
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,171
Skyraft!

329
00:53:51,453 --> 00:53:52,408
'Member this?

330
00:53:52,773 --> 00:53:54,729
Captain Walker!

331
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:56,372
'Member this?

332
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:57,602
Mrs. Walker!

333
00:54:01,253 --> 00:54:05,724
Then Captain Walker picked them
of an age and good for a long haul.

334
00:54:06,213 --> 00:54:10,650
They counted twenty, and that were them.
The great leaving.

335
00:54:10,893 --> 00:54:13,930
"Rescue party departed
at first light. . .

336
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:17,250
. . .Ied by Flight Captain G.L. Walker. "

337
00:54:17,493 --> 00:54:20,644
"May God have mercy on our souls. "

338
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:24,293
They said bidey-bye to them
what they'd birthed.

339
00:54:24,653 --> 00:54:26,848
And from the nothing
they looked back. . .

340
00:54:27,173 --> 00:54:30,802
. . .and Captain Walker hollered,
"Wait, one of us will come. "

341
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:34,052
"Wait, one of us will come. "

342
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:38,408
And somebody did come.

343
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:40,690
Walker!

344
00:55:04,293 --> 00:55:06,523
We's heartful to you,
Captain Walker.

345
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:09,367
We's ready now. Take us home.

346
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:22,406
We kept it straight!
Everything marked, everything 'membered!

347
00:55:22,693 --> 00:55:25,253
You kept it real good.
You ain't been slack.

348
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,490
-Why are we waiting?
-That ain't me.

349
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:30,122
-You got the wrong guy.
-Quit joshing!

350
00:55:30,573 --> 00:55:33,087
-Catch the wind.
-We got to see Tomorrow-morrow Land!

351
00:55:33,453 --> 00:55:35,523
Home! Tomorrow-morrow Land!

352
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:44,173
There were places like these.
Cities.

353
00:55:44,413 --> 00:55:46,483
They were called cities.

354
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:50,052
They had lots of knowing.
They had skyscrapers. . .

355
00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:53,003
. . .videos and they had the sonic.

356
00:55:55,973 --> 00:55:57,452
Then this happened.

357
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:01,772
This Pox-Eclipse happened, and it's
finished. It isn't there anymore.

358
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,690
You got to understand
that this is home. . .

359
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:10,047
. . .and there's no Tomorrow Land. . .

360
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,285
. . .and I ain't Captain Walker.

361
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:44,445
This is it!

362
00:58:24,813 --> 00:58:26,565
We's loaded and waiting, Captain.

363
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:29,771
We got the wind up our arse, Captain.
Let's go!

364
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:15,569
Who's coming?
We's pulling a leaving.

365
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:19,921
There ain't gonna be no leavings.
All that's just jerking time.

366
01:00:20,173 --> 01:00:21,401
We's working it different.

367
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:24,771
Ain't you seen nothing?
He couldn't catch the wind.

368
01:00:25,093 --> 01:00:27,971
There weren't no skyrafting.
There won't be no salvage.

369
01:00:28,293 --> 01:00:30,966
This is our Tomorrow-morrow Land.
He's proof of that.

370
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:35,963
Program! All of you program.
If he ain't Captain Walker, who is he?

371
01:00:36,653 --> 01:00:39,372
He ain't no different to us.
He slogged it on foot.

372
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:42,203
If he can get here,
we can get back.

373
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:44,125
He ain't much bigger than us.

374
01:00:44,453 --> 01:00:46,762
Copilot did it.
So why can't we?

375
01:00:47,013 --> 01:00:49,243
That's the trick of it.
Who's coming?

376
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:53,250
Across the nothing?
Don't you 'member?

377
01:00:53,773 --> 01:00:56,765
When you finded him,
he were half jumped by Mr. Dead.

378
01:00:57,013 --> 01:00:59,686
Nobody's saying
it ain't a hard slog.

379
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:02,612
If we wants the knowing,
it ain't an easy ride.

380
01:01:02,853 --> 01:01:04,650
There ain't no knowing!

381
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:09,091
There ain't no skyraft and no sonic.
You slog out there to nothing!

382
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:10,681
Worse than nothing.

383
01:01:11,173 --> 01:01:14,404
The first place you'll find
is a sleaze pit called Bartertown.

384
01:01:14,693 --> 01:01:17,810
If the earth doesn't swallow you up,
that place will.

385
01:01:20,533 --> 01:01:23,969
Listen him! There ain't no
Tomorrow-morrow Land!

386
01:01:24,253 --> 01:01:25,845
We done that!

387
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:28,209
He's got wordstuff out his ass!

388
01:01:28,573 --> 01:01:31,690
Whoever's got the juice,
track with us.

389
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:13,246
Now listen good!

390
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:19,209
I'm not Captain Walker. I'm the guy
who keeps Mr. Dead in his pocket.

391
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:23,002
And I say we're gonna stay here.

392
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:27,167
And we'll live a long time
and we'll be thankful.

393
01:02:28,213 --> 01:02:29,089
Right?

394
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,605
Keep tracking.

395
01:03:27,653 --> 01:03:29,086
Get the others.

396
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:30,408
They've gone.
You got to get them back!

397
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:34,567
They've gone! Scrooloose let them go.
They're in the nothing.

398
01:04:34,853 --> 01:04:39,005
Come on, you got to help me!
You got to help me get them back!

399
01:04:41,453 --> 01:04:43,330
Savannah and Gekko.
He can hardly walk.

400
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:47,447
Little Finn, Mr. Skyfish, and Cusha.
She's gonna pop any day now.

401
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:16,522
-How long?
-Half a night.

402
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:19,043
Maybe less.
They be deep in the nothing.

403
01:05:19,293 --> 01:05:21,682
-Without much water.
-It makes no difference.

404
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:23,969
They'll be swallowed up by the sand.

405
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:25,532
Get them back, Captain!

406
01:05:26,053 --> 01:05:29,443
Stop with the "Captain. "
Stop the noise!

407
01:05:36,293 --> 01:05:37,567
I need water to carry.

408
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:52,368
What are you doing?

409
01:05:52,613 --> 01:05:54,843
I's coming salvage for my buddies.

410
01:05:56,813 --> 01:05:58,485
We needs a hunter.

411
01:07:27,813 --> 01:07:29,929
He holds his own, okay?

412
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:40,006
Help! Help me!

413
01:10:13,573 --> 01:10:15,165
Quick, let's trek!

414
01:10:28,453 --> 01:10:30,045
Is it Tomorrow-morrow Land?

415
01:10:30,813 --> 01:10:33,043
No. Bartertown.

416
01:10:34,173 --> 01:10:35,572
It's our only chance.

417
01:10:36,893 --> 01:10:38,849
Get in, we're right behind you.

418
01:10:39,133 --> 01:10:41,203
Wait! Stick together!

419
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:42,807
Where are we?

420
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,042
It's Bartertown.

421
01:10:45,413 --> 01:10:47,290
It stinks!

422
01:10:47,813 --> 01:10:50,088
Tubba, Cusha, wait up!

423
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:53,287
Which way?

424
01:10:53,853 --> 01:10:55,491
Head for the light.

425
01:10:59,533 --> 01:11:02,525
-Where are the others?
-They've gone ahead.

426
01:11:02,973 --> 01:11:05,203
-How far?
-A long way.

427
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:08,246
-Can you see them?
-Only just!

428
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,923
What are we doing?
What's our program?

429
01:11:16,253 --> 01:11:17,447
We're looking for someone.

430
01:11:17,693 --> 01:11:20,082
In here? This is jerking time!

431
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:23,928
A little guy with the knowing
of a lot of things. Understand?

432
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:26,165
Well, shut up!

433
01:11:26,853 --> 01:11:28,445
What's to see, Captain?

434
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:29,842
Quiet!

435
01:11:37,413 --> 01:11:40,052
It's him, Captain!
It's the little guy!

436
01:11:40,293 --> 01:11:45,208
Little? He's the smallest!
What the fuck, Captain. What use is he?

437
01:11:45,773 --> 01:11:46,967
Quiet!

438
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:51,803
-Where are the others?
-Out there.

439
01:12:51,253 --> 01:12:52,527
Screwy, let's fly!

440
01:13:24,453 --> 01:13:25,568
Excuse me.

441
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:17,722
Hold it!

442
01:14:20,413 --> 01:14:24,088
Remember. . .no matter where you go,
there you are.

443
01:15:13,933 --> 01:15:15,127
Hi.

444
01:15:59,493 --> 01:16:01,529
All aboard!

445
01:16:55,733 --> 01:16:56,609
Go!

446
01:16:57,853 --> 01:16:59,286
Hang on!

447
01:18:19,773 --> 01:18:22,162
Chase now, pay later.

448
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:46,331
Bartertown!
Listen to me!

449
01:18:49,853 --> 01:18:51,127
Where are you gonna run?

450
01:18:51,653 --> 01:18:54,850
Where are you gonna hide?
Listen to me!

451
01:18:55,293 --> 01:18:57,204
Bartertown will live!

452
01:18:57,853 --> 01:18:59,445
Find the little man.

453
01:18:59,773 --> 01:19:02,333
Bring him back to me. . .alive!

454
01:19:02,973 --> 01:19:04,565
We will rebuild!

455
01:19:07,773 --> 01:19:10,924
For those who took him. . .no mercy!

456
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:55,644
So, what's the plan?

457
01:19:57,013 --> 01:19:58,082
Plan?

458
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:00,804
There ain't no plan.

459
01:20:23,813 --> 01:20:24,962
Skyfish, look!

460
01:20:28,093 --> 01:20:29,572
It's got to be!

461
01:20:34,013 --> 01:20:35,446
The sonic!

462
01:20:36,613 --> 01:20:38,331
Gekko got it straight.

463
01:20:38,653 --> 01:20:39,768
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

464
01:20:40,453 --> 01:20:41,488
Come in.

465
01:21:00,893 --> 01:21:04,090
Welcome. Open your book at page one.

466
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:09,206
Now repeat after me. Bonjour.

467
01:21:10,813 --> 01:21:12,087
Good morning.

468
01:21:13,693 --> 01:21:15,570
Où allez-vous?

469
01:21:17,413 --> 01:21:18,971
Where are you going?

470
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:23,843
Je vais chez moi.

471
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,925
I am going home.

472
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:56,727
He's got the man!

473
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:46,527
Ah, Pigkiller!

474
01:25:22,173 --> 01:25:24,528
Blackfinger! Pull the pin!

475
01:25:25,213 --> 01:25:26,805
Do it now!

476
01:25:29,413 --> 01:25:30,892
Hold it, Blackfinger!

477
01:25:45,653 --> 01:25:46,563
Give him back!

478
01:25:47,053 --> 01:25:48,122
Let go!

479
01:25:49,053 --> 01:25:50,930
Blackfinger, let go!

480
01:25:51,173 --> 01:25:52,891
I've got you now,
and I'm going home!

481
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,732
You'll be all right.

482
01:26:30,573 --> 01:26:31,403
Come on now!

483
01:27:16,493 --> 01:27:18,688
We're gonna count to three.

484
01:27:25,093 --> 01:27:26,367
What happened to two?

485
01:27:43,213 --> 01:27:45,124
This is a stickup!

486
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:48,604
Anybody moves, and they're dead meat!

487
01:27:54,213 --> 01:27:56,602
I think we're all dead meat!

488
01:28:36,293 --> 01:28:38,648
Dad! We're dead meat!

489
01:28:41,093 --> 01:28:43,812
Quick, get in the plane!

490
01:28:46,733 --> 01:28:48,052
Which way did he go?

491
01:28:48,293 --> 01:28:49,931
I warned you, Dad!

492
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:00,765
-You!
-Me?

493
01:29:01,613 --> 01:29:03,365
You. It's your lucky day.

494
01:29:04,093 --> 01:29:05,048
It is?

495
01:29:05,693 --> 01:29:06,603
You got a plane.

496
01:29:07,213 --> 01:29:08,441
I have?

497
01:29:13,093 --> 01:29:14,606
It might save your life.

498
01:29:15,813 --> 01:29:17,041
It will?

499
01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:46,048
All right, let her go!

500
01:29:53,573 --> 01:29:54,972
What's the problem?

501
01:29:55,213 --> 01:29:56,931
We're not gonna get off the ground.

502
01:29:57,613 --> 01:29:58,841
We're overloaded!

503
01:30:28,813 --> 01:30:31,885
Dad, you better do something!

504
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,642
-Kick her in the guts.
-Not gonna make it.

505
01:31:12,053 --> 01:31:13,281
Not enough runway.

506
01:31:13,533 --> 01:31:14,966
We haven't any choice.

507
01:31:15,213 --> 01:31:16,043
Between them. . .

508
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:19,325
. . .and us, there's not enough runway.

509
01:31:22,413 --> 01:31:23,687
There will be.

510
01:33:55,293 --> 01:33:57,170
Ain't we a pair. . .

511
01:33:57,853 --> 01:33:59,127
. . .raggedy man.

512
01:34:07,973 --> 01:34:09,452
Goodbye, soldier.

513
01:36:04,253 --> 01:36:07,689
This you knows. The years travel fast.

514
01:36:08,133 --> 01:36:10,852
And time after time
I've done the Tell.

515
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:15,121
But this ain 't one body's Tell.
It's the Tell of us all.

516
01:36:15,653 --> 01:36:18,213
And you got to listen it and 'member.

517
01:36:18,733 --> 01:36:23,170
'Cause what you hears today,
you got to tell the newborn tomorrow.

518
01:36:23,853 --> 01:36:27,687
I's looking behind us now,
into history back.

519
01:36:27,973 --> 01:36:31,966
I sees those of us that got the luck
and started the haul for home.

520
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:37,168
It lead us here and we was heartful
'cause we seen what there once was.

521
01:36:38,213 --> 01:36:41,444
One look, and we knewed
we'd got it straight.

522
01:36:41,893 --> 01:36:46,205
Those what had gone before had knowing
of things beyond our reckoning. . .

523
01:36:46,573 --> 01:36:48,484
. . .even beyond our dreaming.

524
01:36:49,893 --> 01:36:52,646
Time counts and keeps counting.

525
01:36:53,453 --> 01:36:55,011
And we knows now. . .

526
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:59,167
. . .finding the trick of what's
been and lost ain't no easy ride.

527
01:36:59,973 --> 01:37:03,010
But that's our track.
We got to travel it.

528
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:06,052
And there ain't nobody knows
where it's gonna lead.

529
01:37:07,173 --> 01:37:10,848
Still and all, every night
we does the Tell. . .

530
01:37:11,173 --> 01:37:15,007
. . .so that we 'member who we was
and where we came from.

531
01:37:15,813 --> 01:37:19,169
But most of all we 'members
the man who finded us...

532
01:37:19,813 --> 01:37:21,724
...him that came the salvage.

533
01:37:22,053 --> 01:37:25,090
And we lights the city.
Notjust for him...

534
01:37:25,453 --> 01:37:27,967
...but for all of them
that are still out there.

535
01:37:28,493 --> 01:37:31,007
'Cause we knows
there'll come a night...

536
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:33,449
... when they sees the distant light...

537
01:37:33,733 --> 01:37:35,644
...and they'll be coming home.

538
01:42:18,013 --> 01:42:20,004
