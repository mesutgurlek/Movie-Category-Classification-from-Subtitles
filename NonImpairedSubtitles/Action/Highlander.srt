I want that too.

850
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,100
Will you do something
for me, Connor?

851
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,000
What, lass?

852
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
In the years to come,
will you light a candle...

853
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,100
and remember me
on my birthday?

854
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,800
Aye, love. I will.

855
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,600
I wanted to have
your children.

856
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,900
They would have been
strong and fine.

857
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,500
Don't see me, Connor.

858
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,300
Let me die in peace.

859
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,200
Where are we?

860
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,500
We're in the highlands.

861
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,500
Where else?

862
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,000
Running down a mountainside.

863
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,200
The sun is shining.

864
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,000
It's not cold.

865
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,900
You've got your sheepskins on...

866
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,800
and the boots
I made for you.

867
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,800
Good night,
my bonny Heather.

868
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,600
Hey! Kastagir.

869
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,000
Macleod, it's good
to see you again.

870
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,000
It seems like 100 years.

871
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,700
It's been 100 years.

872
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,300
How have you been?

873
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,600
Hey, this...

874
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,500
puts hairs on your chest.

875
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,500
What is it?

876
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,900
Boom-boom.

877
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,500
Big strong man like you...

878
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,300
shouldn't be afraid
of a little boom-boom.

879
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,400
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.

880
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,300
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

881
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,700
So...
the gathering is here.

882
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,700
Ahh.

883
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,000
Time's almost
caught us, friend.

884
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Has it? Do you think
we should go on?

885
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,600
I think we should
have a party.

886
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,900
Oh, no. I remember
our last party.

887
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Really?

888
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,500
When exactly was that?

889
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,500
It was 1783.

890
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,200
1783.

891
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,700
Oh, yes.

892
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,200
Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

893
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,700
Ha ha ha!
You were drunk.

894
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,200
What was that guy's name again?

895
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,700
His name was Bassett.

896
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,100
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.

897
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,200
I implore you.

898
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,800
I am fighting this duel,
Hotchkiss, not you.

899
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,100
See if the imbecile is ready.

900
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,600
Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

901
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,500
Tell him I'm ready.

902
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,400
Christ! I've gone blind.

903
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,200
En garde, sir.

904

Ohh!

905
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,400
Wonderful, sir.

906
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,300
Thank you, Hotchkiss.

907
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,100

908
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,400
That you?

909
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,600
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

910
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,900
Unh!

911
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,000
Oh.

Stop, sir.

915
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,000
I beseech you.

916
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,000
I apologize for
calling your wife...

- Ha ha ha!

And I bid you good day.

Shoot him, sir.

01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,800
Shoot him.

921
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,900
Now, sir, in the back!
Now, sir!

922
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000

Stop it!

No, sir.

Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure...

01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,400
the mayor's office issued
the following statement...

936
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,000
Give us a drink, pal.

how'd you like Candy?

Don't ever speak to me.

Look, I didn't mean--
