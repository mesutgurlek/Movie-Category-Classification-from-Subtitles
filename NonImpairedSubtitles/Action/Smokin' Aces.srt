<i>CARRUTHERS:
I'm telling you something...</i>

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,588
You've got to be careful
when you're
doing your stakeouts.

3
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,887
I did one for... I was
on one for six months.

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,554
I gained, like, 20, 25 pounds.
You keep eating this crap...

5
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,860
MESSNER: Well, that's
my problem, though.
I don't gain weight. I tried.

6
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,593
That's 'cause
you're 12 years old.

7
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,929
Yeah, well, then,
who gives a shit?

8
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,526
Can I get you
something to drink?

9
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,162
You're disgusting.

10
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,030
Come on, don't keep it
by the water either.

11
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,235
Don't even let it
rub shoulders
with the other bottle.

12
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,212
Do you know what?
Urine is good for your skin.

13
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:26,275
My grandmother...
I swear to God,
my grandmother told me.

14
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:30,847
She said... She did, 'cause
when I used to get a zit
or something, she said...

15
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,448
She pissed on your face?

16
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,085
Get the fuck out of here.
Are you fucking nuts?

17
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,129
What?
It's my grandmother!

18
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,291
You just told me your grandma
said that piss
is good for your skin.

Who's in the back? Joe.
Joe.

24

Joe, are you guys
seeing anything?

25
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,386
Because if you are,
it's certainly not
coming up here in the van

26
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,581
and we'd certainly like
to see what's going on.

27
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,057

What?

34
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,673
What kind of deodorant
do you use?
I don't use deodorant.

35
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,770
Look at you.
What? I live in a van.

36
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,041
What does that mean?

37
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,015
It's bad for you.
It causes Alzheimer's.

38
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,176
What?

39
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,686
Alzheimer's. You get
Alzheimer's if you're
using antiperspirant

00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,846
with aluminum.

I'm sorry. I forgot.
I don't remember

You know of a Swede?
Nothing.

These guys got some balls.

85

<i>But before I get to it,
one more thing. I should
probably bring it up.</i>

<i>Primo wants Israel's heart.</i>

87

He's going to cut
his heart out.

<i>His heart?
Jesus, what for?</i>

89
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,874

<i>You know,

<i>They're reliable?

<i>That's the punch line.

He said one million.
One million.

114

One million,

Asshole.

They think he's,

You know, something special.

136
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,341
Nice shot.

Becomes

00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,024
Can I whack anybody?
Who am I gonna whack?

141
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,423
Stop it. Stop it.

142

<i>Now he's got connections.
He's got pull.</i>

147
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,104
Then he gets his dick wet.
Strong-arm robbery.

148
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,374
Get in the van, man!
Get in the van now!
Go! Go! Go!

149
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,917
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

150
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,953
Vegas lounge act
turns legitimate thug.

151
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,282
<i>Truth is, Buddy
don't know the fucking ball
from the bounce.</i>

152
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,383
What do you got?

153
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,449
<i>He's a wannabe.</i>

154
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:45,691
<i>Like most wannabes,
he starts fucking up fast
and picking up speed.</i>

155
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,758
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

156
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,498
That's good work.
Good fucking work.
I love it.

157
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:58,938
His little criminal foray
shines a floodlight on the
entire Carlotta organization.

158
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:02,846
Cops get curious,
they start camping out
and everything goes sideways

159
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,906
<i>real fucking quick.</i>

160
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,814
<i>People get pinched,
snitches snitch.</i>

161
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,485
<i>The next thing you know,
Buddy Israel
has brought the heat to bear</i>

162
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,256
on none other than
Mr. Primo Sparazza himself.

163
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,358
Enforcer,
extortionist, killer.

164
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,661
Sparazza has been rumored
to have performed

165
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,263
in excess of
100 contract murders,

166
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,072
including one of the Bureau's
most celebrated agents,
Freeman Heller.

167
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,635
I thought Heller
was a double-op?

168
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,171
He worked for the OSS
before joining
the Bureau in its heyday.

169
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,277
He was the first operative
assigned with
infiltrating the mob.

170
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,879
Fake identity,
falsified backgrounds,

171
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,151
everything that is now
standard operating procedure,

172
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,453
<i>Heller implemented
way back when.</i>

173
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,619
...your attention
to these overlays,

174
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,392
I'll show you exactly
what I meant when I said,
"Change my face."

175
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,458
And as a result,
his undercover work
was highly successful.

176
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,028
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

177
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,267
I will have my ears
pinned back.

178
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,777
Removing a slight piece
of bone in my chin,
I will alter my jaw line.

179
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:11,215
<i>Eventually, he reached
the rank of capo inside
the Carlotta crime family,</i>

180
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,913
<i>but due to some
internal slipup,
his cover was compromised.</i>

181
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,820
<i>Primo Sparazza
was given the contract
to kill him.</i>

182
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,823
Sparazza is
a bit of a specter.

183
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:26,194
Over the years, the serious
crimes with which he was
thought to be involved with,

184
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,756
including Heller's murder,
could never be
traced back to him.

185
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:32,327
<i>A dedicated viciousness
and slavish devotion
to mob doctrine</i>

186
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,771
had Sparazza's star
on the rise.

187
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,174
So they relocated him to
Nevada and made him the head
of the Las Vegas Cosa Nostra.

188
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,233
Water.

189
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,870
What's his connection
to Israel?

190
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,347
<i>Sparazza introduced
Israel to the life.</i>

191
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,512
<i>Gave him his first big break
onstage, brought him up
through the ranks.</i>

192
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,317
And Israel played
the situation very shrewdly.

193
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,154
<i>Slowly amassing the loyalties
of Sparazza's top men,</i>

194
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,716
<i>with the idea
of toppling the throne.</i>

195
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,354
You know, I've seen
some stupid moves, but...

196
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,297
Well, you spend your life
pulling rabbits out of hats
and sawing people in half,

197
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,856
anything seems possible.

198
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,528
Israel wanted to touch
something real,
something dangerous.

199
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:09,007
But what he wound up doing
was splitting the family
into dual factions.

200
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,067
Sparazza on one side,
Israel on the other.

201
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,783
<i>The infighting that followed
drew the interest
of every investigative body</i>

202
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,821
<i>operating under the canopy
of the federal government.</i>

203
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,878
This is it, right here.

204
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,480
Presently, we have...

205
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,083
Sixteen state
and federally-funded agencies

206
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,924
running concurrent
criminal probes

207
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,930
<i>on select members
of La Cosa Nostra.</i>

208
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,832
<i>LOCKE: With Israel
being the target of
virtually every one.</i>

209
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,338
<i>His testimony
has the potential
of blowing the lid</i>

210
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,805
<i>off of what's left
of La Cosa Nostra
in this country.</i>

211
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,570
<i>That alone warrants
total immunity
from prosecution</i>

212
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,772
<i>and a vanishing act with the
Witness Protection Program.</i>

213
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,185
The wiretaps
on Serna and Padiche,
mention of Israel's heart?

214
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,518
Well, that corroborates
what we already know.

215
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,579
Sparazza's health
is in rapid decline

216
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:03,627
and before he dies,
he is demanding
the heart of his sworn enemy.

217
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,529
A recently opened
million-dollar escrow account

218
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,897
has been traced
back to Sparazza.

219
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,528
That, and the mention
of this mysterious Swede

220
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,834
makes the contract on Israel
all the more real.

221
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,437
SYKES: How real?

222
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,305
How about six figures
for that fool?
How's that love?

223
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,407
Bullshit.
No, baby.

224
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,353
They heard about
that triad hit,
the work y'all put in.

225
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,253
And they recognize
the skills.

226
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,791
Now, you all want this?

227
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,692
Hell, yeah.
Well, I'm gonna
get it for you.

228
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,092
What?

229
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,993
There it is! There it is!

230
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,538
You called the right bitches
for this one, man.

231
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,175
You see? Write that shit down.

232
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,516
Are you saying that just
because me and baby girl
here got a rep on the rise,

233
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,051
you know,
we chipped some nails
on some niggas,

234
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,850
they want us to
go in and drop
this mafioso motherfucker?

235
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,984
The way it works, girl.
Y'all peeled some
serious caps. Word travels.

236
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,258
So, we're supposed
to go in there,
bust on this punk

237
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,162
and remove his heart.
Is that for real?

238
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:19,193
You go in and pull him out.
That heart shit?
That's just for flavor.

239
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,202
Now, I'm still trying
to get the down-low
from this cat Padiche.

240
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:28,145
What we got right now
is a number and a name.

241
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,545
Buddy Israel.

242
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,810
What else did Padiche say?

243
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,081
He said the shit might get hot
and might get heavy.

244
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:39,113
I said, "Cool. 'Cause I got
two of the hottest,

245
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,920
"heaviest bitches alive."

246
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,621
Like who?
Like Pasquale Acosta.

247
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,721
Blood-money mercenary.

248
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:50,428
<i>His countrymen have dubbed him
the more dubious "EI Estrago."</i>

249
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,430
<i>"The Plague."</i>

250
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,933
<i>American educated. Fluent in
over a dozen languages.
Freelanced for the CIA.</i>

251
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,911
<i>Noted for his
legendary torture techniques.</i>

252
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,977
(SCREAMING)

253
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,251
<i>When he was caught by the SAS
in Northern Ireland,</i>

254
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,885
<i>in prison he chewed off
his fingertips to the bones,</i>

255
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,191
<i>so he couldn't be
printed or ID'd by Interpol.</i>

256
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,754
Is it possible that
he could be involved in this?

257
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:24,235
A million-dollar hit fee
would draw some huge flies.
And Acosta's pure mercenary.

258
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,140
He has a history of
taking on tough kills,
and he's certainly not alone.

259
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,972
Who else?
How about the Tremor Brothers?

260
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:36,811
Three of them.
Same skank mom,
different deadbeat dads.

261
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,817
They're used for
that suicide-style,
kamikaze shit.

262
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,614
Heard about that
dinner club in Cleveland?

263
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,646
<i>That got squat-fucked,
shot to shit,
slashed and burned?</i>

264
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,556
<i>What happened?</i>

265
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:51,529
<i>Well, the Tremor Brothers
go rip-shit riot
on the whole fucking place.</i>

266
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,794
<i>Seven dead, 28 wounded.</i>

267
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,960
<i>Just to get
this one fucking guy.</i>

268
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,632
<i>In the course of the melee,
one of them gets shot
in the neck. He passes out.</i>

269
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,541
<i>Another one catches blowback
from a jammed piece.</i>

270
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,600
<i>He's temporarily blinded.</i>

271
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,112
<i>Third one gets
a bullet lodged in his back,
he can't walk.</i>

272
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,883
<i>They're speed-freak,
neo-Nazi assholes
who read and recite</i>

273
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,356
<i>Mein Kampf like it was
Mother Goose.</i>

274
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,983
They're meaner than shit,
they're dumber than hell

275
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,550
and these motherfuckers
will go megaton

276
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,327
at the drop of a hat.

277
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,891
<i>SYKES: I ain't never
heard of him.
WATTERS: Me, neither.</i>

278
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,433
Then listen up,
'cause he may wind up
being your main competition.

279
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,374
His name is Soot. Lazlo Soot.

280
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,403
A lot of folks want
this white boy clapped.

281
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,381
Word is Soot is working
for one of them.

282
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,520
<i>Now, they don't know
where he's from, how long
he's been in the game,</i>

283
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,419
<i>or even what he looks like.</i>

284
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,994
<i>But when Soot decides to move
on somebody,</i>

285
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,926
<i>they're the last ones
to see it coming.</i>

286
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,729
<i>DUPREE: So, there it is.</i>

287
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:41,705
The bond on Buddy Israel
expires in 18 hours.
After that, it's a jump ball.

288
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,605
Who posted the bond?

289
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,611
Same guys who hired me,
his former law firm.

290
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,239
He walked out the door
after he made bail.
Hasn't been seen since.

291
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:53,809

into hell after Hitler.

00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,629
I grew up soft with the
private schools and little
blazers, you know, and...

443
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,860
Everyone talked things out,
you know?

444
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,768
No one ever threw any blows.
Still to this day,
never punched in the face.

445
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,863
Imagine that?
I'm pretty much a pantywaist.

446
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,374
I don't say this
to be self-deprecating.
I just, you know,

447
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,968
don't have much of an opinion
of myself. I'd much rather
be like you guys.

448
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,980
You know, bar fighters
and big, swinging dicks,
taking care of shit.

449
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:14,576
You know, sadly, this is it.
You know, it's disgusting.
Thanks, God!

450
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:19,184
Dog-pile of piss-poor physique
on top of a small cock
and hereditary alcoholism.

451
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,758
I appreciate it!

452
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,962
I'm babbling.
I do that drunk.
Please forgive.

453
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,122
Let's get to the
business at hand.

454
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:30,259
This wanted felon here,
Buddy Israel, little
Rick Springfield, I guess.

455
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,495
And his bail-bond
bobbing around up there
out at the lake.

456
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,665
Rip, hand to God,
you got nothing
to worry about with this.

457
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,265
Yeah?
Okay? I've assembled
a team now.

458
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,969
We're gonna go in,
we're gonna get this guy,

459
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,636
and everyone is gonna leave
the theater grinning.

460
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,304
No problem.
Will not be a problem.
No problem.

461
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,316
Great, that's good.
You're feeling it,
you're feeling it. Come on.

462
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,352
Outstanding! Get it up there!

463
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,388
Come on. Come on, man.
And bones it.

464
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,915
Huh? Right there, and then
padlock it and then
you put the chain on it.

465
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,984
That's a new one
I'm working on.

466
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,360
Really getting the hairy
eyeball off that guy.
No, no. No, no.

467
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,956
He's all right?
He's all right. Tell him.

468
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:06,198
This is good, though, what
you're telling me. All right?
I need to hear this stuff.

469
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,260
Little boosts.

470
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,837
Helps allay my fears.
I pass that peace of mind
along to my partners.

471
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,900
All right. Look up. Hey, man.
That's not yours.

472
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,171
Put the fucking rabbit down.

473
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,770
Appreciate it.
Get your dick-beaters off it.

474
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,180
Couple of things.
The hangers-on,
his posse, you know,

475
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,379
they're all strapped
or packing heat,
whatever the phrase is.

476
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,285
Strapped.
I don't know
what you guys call it.

477
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,345
Strapped? Well, so,
they got guns.

478
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,186
What else? He drinks,
you know. Self-medicates.
Total cliché.

479
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,663
This guy. He's a strung-out,
washed-up, has-been,
jerk, snitch,

480
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,824
fucking drunk,
seven-layer loser.

481
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,095
Right. Now I'm praying
he puts up a fight!

482
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,730
Please! Please, please,
rape him if it's possible!

483
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:44,139
Punch him in the seat
or something, you know?
Hit him in the brown.

484
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:48,578
I don't know. Anyway,
I believe we had a retainer
for services rendered.

485
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,248
$50,000.

486
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,476
ISRAEL: $50,000
for this fucking suite?

487
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,078
Yo, calm down.
Don't tell me
to fucking calm down!

488
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,451
That's all
they're gonna give us.

489
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,989
Look at the attention
we gettin', man.

490
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,823
We campaigning
like niggas ain't hot.
We hot.

491
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,759
And they losing
a whole floor's
worth of business,

492
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,195
saying it's
under construction.

493
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,233
I am not shelling out
this kind of bread
for this shithole, all right?

494
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,031
This is a junior suite
in Vegas. So, fuck this

495
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,093
and the fucking
animal kingdom.

496
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,570
What?
Vitoli not answer the phone.

497
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,941
Go down there and get him.
Go down there!
Come on. Let's go.

498
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,503
Has Mecklen called?
No.

499
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,085
When do we get concerned?

500
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,713
We don't get concerned.
We'll see movement
on this soon.

501
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,053
All right? We just got
to knock off a few more hours.

502
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,320
These flowers have wilted.
Call the florist.

503
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,157
No, I need you to chill.

504
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,220
I need you
to call the florist.

505
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,997
When your guy gonna call?
That's what's happening.

506
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,032
Hey, yo, Beanie.

507
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,766
Hey, ladies. Get up.

508
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,143
Beans.

509
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,310
Bag them and get
some more on deck,
all right?

510
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,022
All right, y'all.

511
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,084
We did the damn thing.

512
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,254
Now proceed to the front
in an orderly fashion,

513
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,301
or how the fuck
y'all want to, but
get the fuck going.

514
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,430
Let's go, step lively.
Get your ass up.
Put your clothes on, girl.

515
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:25,465
You're acting like y'all
on sundial. Y'all need
to be on stopwatch.

516
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,940
Damn it. I didn't realize how
fucked up I was till I
just saw your ass, girl.

517
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,785
You went from Beyoncé
to Bigfoot in less than
six fucking hours.

518
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,982
Fuck you, pussy!

519
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,458
Hey, we did that dance,
bitch. Kick rocks.

520
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,461
Goddamn!

521
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,518
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

522
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,758
Hey, yo,
is this Madame Alex?

523
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,630
Hey, y'all got sick leave?

524
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,465
'Cause one of your hoes
just got fucked up!

525
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,505
Yeah, she might be
missing some work.

526
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:59,135
Oh, hell, no! This is nice.
This is real nice! Play it up!

527
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,941
What you doing, girl?
Come on, man. Come on.

528
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,949
Hoes gotta go.
Get them out of here.
Let's go!

529
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,947
Get them to the elevator.

530
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,385
GIRL: Fuck you!
Give me my purse!
Shut the fuck up!

531
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,946
Hey, bitch!
You forgot your hat!

532
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,687
Get your hands off me,
asshole!
Take your shit, bitch.

533
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,164
Thanks, Paul.
Israel's awake.

534
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,266
There was apparently a fight
with some prostitutes,

535
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,325
but he wasn't involved.

536
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,665
What, like an actual fight?
They...
Yeah, a fight.

537
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,367
Jesus Christ.
A scuffle, a donnybrook. Yeah.

538
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,471
He had one of his men
call a madam
for another group of girls.

539
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,945
We're getting robbed here,
man.
Seriously.

540
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,276
Three days staring
at Sparazza's house.

541
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,079
This guy's got hookers
up there fistfighting.

542
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,119
Look at all you're missing.

543
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,678
Have you checked
this stuff out yet?
This is unbelievable.

544
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,554
You know that Sparazza's
had major
elective plastic surgery.

545
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,684
Fifteen of them. Right?

546
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,921
Fifteen separate
procedures since 1952.

547
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,088
Look at the work
he's had done.

548
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,530
Nose, three times.
Eyes. Eyelids. Jaw.

549
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,431
You take every
has-been actor in Hollywood,

550
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,969
they haven't been
cut this much.
Easy.

551
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,267
Crazy, you know.
Wall-to-wall felony offenses.

552
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,537
Murder, of course. Extortion.
Arson. Grand larceny.
Blah, blah, blah.

553
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,272
And a paternity suit,
just to, you know,
round out the portfolio there.

554
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,473
And not one single
criminal charge
laid against him.

555
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,518
Well, you can't kill
over a hundred people
without knowing how to tiptoe.

556
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,145
Yeah, but the Bureau
knows he killed Heller.

557
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,653
Then why not go
after him for that?

558
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,656
Heller was buried
by the agency.

559
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:23,524
Any time an operative failed,
or was perceived to have
failed, he was blackballed.

560
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,687
Look at what happened to Ness.

561
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,731
Ness and the Untouchables
took down Capone.

562
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,891
<i>Heller got shot and killed.
The bad guys beat him.</i>

563
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,595
Worse, Sparazza walked.
How much longer you think?

564
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,002
Who knows? Locke has been
with the lawyers from Justice

565
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,198
since yesterday afternoon.

566
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,970
Israel's manager is acting
as his attorney. That's what's
holding things up.

567
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:42,377
So I want to be in that
penthouse a half a second
after this deal is done.

568
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,005
We gonna get any
guff from the hotel staff?

569
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,379
Israel's obviously
paid them off.

570
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,509
We're not gonna have
any trouble
with the hotel staff.

571
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,555
You show them your ID
with the letters
"FBI" in all caps,

572
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,090
it's instant compliance.
I've seen it happen
a hundred times.

573
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,921
Special Agent Gerald Diego,

574
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,791
Federal Bureau
of Investigation,
San Francisco Field Office.

575
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,524
We're conducting a series
of impromptu inspections

576
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,793
for the Nevada
Gaming Commission,

577
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,424
and I'd like to speak
with your head of security.

578
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,993
Okay, just one second.
Just hang on, sir.

579
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,976
Where'd you get these?

580
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,186
Same place that rents
to the guards.

581
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,414
All right, there's
a shift change at 9:00 a.m.

582
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,357
The graveyard gets off.
We're gonna slip in with the
daytime guys when they go on.

583
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,486
But what about
access cards, passkeys?

584
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,123
Yeah, well, we'll get
our hands on those
when we get inside.

585
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,826
Basically, there's two
security levels, okay?

00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,522
So, Bill, if I'm
getting this right,

736
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,530
so you currently have
the penthouse level
under construction?

737
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:08,792
That's correct.
Okay.

738
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:13,428
But with these down,
doesn't that pose
a major security concern?

739
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,371
I mean, as you said,
you got to keep your eye
on everything at all times.

740
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,738
Well, we were worried
about the dust and
debris from the work

741
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,674
going on up there
ruining the cameras.

742
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,303
So you shut them off?
Yes.

743
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,908
<i>Hey, Bill, you said there's
some situation on 12?
It's table 12?</i>

744
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,249
Table 12. Okay?
I need somebody over
at table 12.

745
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,815
A little blue-haired lady
there who's rolled
about 14 times. Thank you.

Yes. I mean, no, we...

at both ends of that hallway
24 hours a day.

752
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,336
Okay.
What kind of personnel?

753

Right now?

plus Vitoli, our executive
butler, so seven men, total.

00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,505
<i>Fucking thrilled
to hear it.</i>

881
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,413
<i>So, this sit-down,
you must have felt it
from them then, huh?</i>

882
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,747
<i>Cold blood,
Sid. Dead eyes.</i>

883
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:45,585
<i>Okay, yeah, good.
So you're at the hotel.
Everything's all right?</i>

884
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,987
<i>It's quiet.</i>

885
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,183
<i>So, you're not
seeing anything?</i>

886
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,091
<i>No signs of trouble,
nobody lurking,
no threats? Nothing?</i>

887
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,652
<i>Absolutely no.
We got nothing
to worry about.</i>

888
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:55,392
<i>Israel's in
the penthouse now, right?</i>

889
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:57,934
<i>Yeah. I guess he's
been holed up there
for a week or so.</i>

890
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,992
<i>How are we on time?
The Swede's been dispatched.</i>

891
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,059
<i>He's flying himself.</i>

892
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:05,072
<i>All right, damn, all right.
So he's headed
to Tahoe then, huh?</i>

893
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,542
<i>Yeah. We're in
a bit of a footrace
right now, Buzzy.</i>

894
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,273
<i>It's a matter of who
outhustles who, you know?</i>

895
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,178
<i>We just got to get
to Israel first.</i>

896
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,443
<i>It's getting done, Sid.</i>

897
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:17,715
<i>We got to get him, Buzz.
Everything, and I mean
everything is riding on this.</i>

898
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,451
<i>We're gonna get Israel.
Trust me.</i>

899
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:33,095
<i>HUGO ON RECORDER:
You open the fucking door.</i>

900
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,810
<i>AGENT: I'm sorry, sir.</i>

901
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,175
But this is eyes only.

902
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,146
They told me to hand deliver.

903
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:35,959
Where did this come from?

904
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,862
They dug it up
in archives as part of
the Sparazza investigation.

905
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,348
Has anyone else seen this?

906
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:02,256
Only the Director himself.
He asked that you
contact him immediately.

907
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,360
Should we inform
Messner and Carruthers?

908
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,829
No. Things have changed.

909
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,266
Get the Director
on the phone

910
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:14,998
and have our jet
at the tarmac at LAX
in half an hour.

911
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,061
Yes, sir.

912
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,106
Officer!

913
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:30,980
Hugo, what's happening, man?
Right.

914
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,553
Well, yeah, hey,
you're good to go in.

915
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,757
Hey, man.
Where the fuck Vitoli at?

916
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:21,997
The fuck do you mean? I ain't
trying to clean this
shit up myself, dawg.

917
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,563
Hey, don't even think
I'm touching my man's coat

918
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,667
that I know
you nutted all over,
you no-aiming ass.

919
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:31,241
Man, what the fuck
was you thinking,
barebacking them bitches, Hugo?

920
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:35,308
I bet you your dick
is disintegrating
as we speak, player!

921
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,746
Stupid-ass motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

922
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,915
Hugo!

923
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,002
So, what did Mecklen
have to say?

924
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,108
They're getting close, man.

925
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:42,515
Got about a handful
of deal points and then
we're getting close.

926
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,244
What are you
shaking for, man?

927
00:53:47,649 --> 00:53:50,140
But it's all good, right?
Yeah.

928
00:53:53,988 --> 00:53:58,391
Look at me, man.
Look at me.
What's up? I'm working.

929
00:53:59,394 --> 00:54:01,555
Yeah, okay.
What's up?

930
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:04,456
You believe in loyalty,
don't you?

931
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,090
Do I believe in loyalty?

932
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:08,226
Especially
the kind of loyalty

933
00:54:08,303 --> 00:54:11,704
where an otherwise
sensible motherfucker
like myself

934
00:54:11,773 --> 00:54:14,469
put his own
best interests aside...
That's why you're my man.

935
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,703
'Cause outside a goddamn dog,

936
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:19,936
that kind of loyalty,
my kind of shit,

937
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:23,150
don't get no more dedicated

938
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,118
or devout.
What are you trying to say?

939
00:54:25,186 --> 00:54:28,087
What I've been saying.
I need to get your head
of security right now.

940
00:54:28,156 --> 00:54:30,124
He's not picking up
the extension.

941
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:32,022
I know that.
What floor are they on?

942
00:54:32,093 --> 00:54:34,527
I don't know right now.
What floor
are they on, Ricky?

943
00:54:34,596 --> 00:54:37,724
Okay, you know,
that's one of our guys
right over there.

944
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,031
Excuse me?

945
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:44,802
Excuse me?

946
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,702
Excuse me, sir.
Yes.

947
00:54:46,775 --> 00:54:48,572
Special Agent
Donald Carruthers, FBI.

948
00:54:48,643 --> 00:54:50,611
I need to get to
your penthouse level
immediately.

949
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:52,077
Well, I'm headed there
right now. Sure.

950
00:54:52,147 --> 00:54:54,638
Is this an emergency?
Let's hope not.

951
00:55:11,866 --> 00:55:13,163
I'm going down.

952
00:55:13,835 --> 00:55:15,393
I'll bet you are.

953
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,771
Faggot-ass redneck.

954
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,807
What'd you say?

955
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:28,644
Not you.
Some assholes on the elevator.

956
00:55:28,716 --> 00:55:31,685
Are these bitches
on a permanent
smoke break or what?

957
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:35,814
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The ho train
has left the station.

958
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,255
Yeah, they're headed
straight to you.

959
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:39,054
<i>Good.
Skank-ass bitches.</i>

960
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,890
But that's the role
you wanted to play.

961
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,123
<i>Yeah, that says
a whole lot about you.</i>

962
00:55:43,198 --> 00:55:45,223
A ho, ho lot.

963
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:54,533
What up, G?

964
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:58,443
Speak, come on. Speak up.

965
00:55:58,513 --> 00:56:01,038
Bitch, I'm about to ball this.

966
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:04,916
Okay, then. Punk.

967
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,248
No, it was not
made clear to me.

968
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,345
This is the first
I'm hearing of it.

969
00:56:07,422 --> 00:56:09,617
Have you contacted
Agent Carruthers?

970
00:56:10,024 --> 00:56:13,118
Yeah, cell reception up here
is terrible, but until you
or I speak with him,

971
00:56:13,194 --> 00:56:15,025
he's the SAC and he's
the guy I answer to...

972
00:56:15,096 --> 00:56:16,495
<i>REPORTER: As to the identity
of the two bodies...</i>

973
00:56:16,564 --> 00:56:18,088
Look, in less than an hour,
you're gonna have

974
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,396
40 to 50-odd field agents
arriving in Lake Tahoe

975
00:56:20,468 --> 00:56:21,867
without the slightest clue
as to why.

976
00:56:21,936 --> 00:56:24,234
We are instructed
to take Israel
into protective custody.

977
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:25,431
That's a two-man operation.

978
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,566
What you're describing now
is a much larger movement.

979
00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:30,133
Messner?
Listen. Hold it. I need
to speak with Locke.

980
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:31,200
Get him on the phone.

981
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:33,179
If the situation's changed,
I need to hear it from him.

982
00:56:33,248 --> 00:56:34,738
You Messner?
Yeah. Who's this?

983
00:56:34,816 --> 00:56:37,148
Take a look at that.
Hollis Elmore.
Vegas resident.

984
00:56:37,218 --> 00:56:38,310
Used to be
with the PD down there.

985
00:56:38,386 --> 00:56:40,183
Agent Messner,
we recovered the car.

986
00:56:40,255 --> 00:56:43,918
- What car?
- Dupree's car. '89
Cadillac Sedan DeVille.

987
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:47,120
Where did you find it?
Parking structure
at the Nomad.

988
00:57:02,844 --> 00:57:04,334
Are the overheads necessary?

989
00:57:04,412 --> 00:57:06,676
Turn the overheads off! Now!

990
00:57:06,748 --> 00:57:09,239
Not exactly low profile,
is this?
No, sir.

991
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:10,579
Hotel locked down at all?

992
00:57:10,652 --> 00:57:12,847
I couldn't tell you that
right now, sir.

993
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:15,412
Hugo, what the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

994
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:20,926
What, you stuck on stupid
or something? I know. You rode
a little bus to school.

995
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:25,523
Hey, man, stop using
that fucking lotion, man.
You look like a damn Muppet.

996
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,202
And don't let your bitch
cut your hair no more, dawg.

997
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:31,238
It look like she put a bowl
on that shit, man. Damn.

998
00:57:31,306 --> 00:57:34,469
Hey, but you need to bring
your ass down here and
help me out, Hugo, for real.

999
00:57:34,542 --> 00:57:36,669
I ain't cleaning all this
shit up myself, man.

1000
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,542
I'm tired.
I ain't no fucking
cleaning lady, dawg.

1001
00:57:39,614 --> 00:57:42,242
For real. Bring your ass
down here. Shit.

1002
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:43,306
(SHOT FIRED)

1003
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:45,477
(GASPING)

1004
00:57:54,462 --> 00:57:55,451
What the fuck?

1005
00:57:58,366 --> 00:58:00,857
Hell, no.
You didn't do that, dawg.

1006
00:58:06,074 --> 00:58:07,905
What'd you say to Mecklen?

1007
00:58:08,676 --> 00:58:12,339
What I've always been saying,
let's make the fucking deal.

1008
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:14,309
You see,

1009
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:18,779
this is one of them
rare moments where
your ass get a chance

1010
00:58:18,853 --> 00:58:20,013
to be completely honest.

1011
00:58:22,423 --> 00:58:26,484
If I'm asking you what
you said to Mecklen,
assume the shit is rhetorical.

1012
00:58:27,395 --> 00:58:28,987
Assume I already know.

1013
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:32,562
What do you see right now?

1014
00:58:33,568 --> 00:58:36,731
You see exactly and only

1015
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:42,542
what I choose to show you.
That is illusion, Ivy.

1016
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:47,511
That is the lie that
I tell your eyes.
Making the magic happen

1017
00:58:47,582 --> 00:58:51,985
in the moment,
in that split second,

1018
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:56,054
but seeing behind
this motherfucker and knowing

1019
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,758
that it's all bullshit.
Yeah, you're on some bullshit.

1020
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:06,027
But I can shape it, I can
shift it, I can make it
as real as this room.

1021
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,127
That's why I'm valuable here,
Ivy. And that is why
you are not.

1022
00:59:10,204 --> 00:59:12,229
I ain't valuable?
I am sorry.

1023
00:59:12,306 --> 00:59:15,707
I love you. I never
wanted it to be like this.
You know that.

1024
00:59:15,777 --> 00:59:19,804
It don't matter
what you wanted.
It's what you did.

1025
00:59:20,882 --> 00:59:23,851
If you thought old man Primo
could twist your shit up,

1026
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:28,347
<i>wait till you see

No, these phones

Do what, sir?
Shut the elevator down.

1041

of our entire elevated
lift system, sir?

No. That has to be

what happened, nice and slow.

Yeah, so, earlier,
there was that guy,
Carruthers...

1178
01:09:01,895 --> 01:09:03,362
Yeah, Agent Carruthers.
Do you know where he is?

1179
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:04,692
No. He wanted to know...
Yeah, he's here right now.

1180
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,027
We're talking to the kid.
We need about two minutes.

01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,226
...which floor security
was on.

1182
01:09:07,301 --> 01:09:09,633
And then later I saw him
get on the elevator
with the other agent.

1183
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:11,136
Wait, hold on.
Wait a minute.
What other agent?

1184
01:09:11,205 --> 01:09:13,469
There were no other agents.
Our agents
are landing here now.

1185
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,440
There was nobody here.
He said he was
from San Francisco.

1186
01:09:15,509 --> 01:09:17,272
Did he give you a name?

1187
01:09:17,344 --> 01:09:19,608
Spanish something.
It was Diego or Garcia.

1188
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,477
Yeah, run both those names
through the DC database.

1189

1190
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:23,810
Call San Francisco.
See if they...

1191
01:09:23,884 --> 01:09:25,749
You know,
he was wearing
one of our jackets.

1192
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:27,081
What?
Who was?

1193
01:09:27,154 --> 01:09:29,748
The other agent.
He said he was here
to do some inspections.

1194
01:09:29,823 --> 01:09:32,018
Then later, when I saw him
get on the elevator
with Carruthers...

1195
01:09:32,092 --> 01:09:34,117
This man identified himself
as a federal agent?

1196
01:09:34,194 --> 01:09:35,354
Yeah, I mean,
he had the badge
and everything.

1197
01:09:35,429 --> 01:09:38,330
And when you saw him later,
he was wearing one
of your security jackets.

01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:39,559

seem odd to you?

1200
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:45,896
I mean, I thought
they gave it to him
so he could...

1201
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,201
Walk with me.

1202
01:09:47,775 --> 01:09:51,438
Okay, so obviously,
we got a man posing
as one of us.

Where is Carruthers
and Messner?

1330
01:22:44,384 --> 01:22:46,784
Carruthers is dead.
Messner's unaccounted for.

1331
01:22:46,853 --> 01:22:47,842
Account for him!

1332
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:55,022
What's your name, baby girl?
Georgia.

1333
01:22:56,496 --> 01:22:57,758
Georgia.

1334
01:22:58,898 --> 01:23:01,264
You know you saved
this black man.

1335
01:23:02,335 --> 01:23:03,893
Now all you
got to be is grateful.

1336
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,630
You hurting pretty bad, huh?

1337
01:23:09,676 --> 01:23:10,734
I got shot twice.

1338
01:23:12,912 --> 01:23:16,245
I think I accidentally shot
and killed my boy today.

1339
01:23:18,651 --> 01:23:23,520
If it gives you any comfort,
you know, I was going
in there to act a fool, baby.

1340
01:23:25,058 --> 01:23:28,152
Straight-rocking heat,
slaying niggas, man.

1341
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,118
For real?

1342
01:23:31,865 --> 01:23:36,097
Your boy very well
might have been one of them.

1343
01:23:38,438 --> 01:23:41,305
I probably would've
busted on you, too.

1344
01:23:41,508 --> 01:23:43,669
What a shame
that would have been.

1345
01:23:47,947 --> 01:23:50,108
What was you
doing here, anyway?

1346
01:23:51,751 --> 01:23:55,710
We was after some fool
named Israel.

1347
01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:01,424
Damn, girl, you're gonna
make a nigga fall hard.

1348
01:24:02,028 --> 01:24:05,862
Put her down. Put her down
and get up
against the wall right now.

1349
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:11,061
Show me your hands.
Show me your fucking hands!

1350
01:24:11,404 --> 01:24:14,237
Drop the gun down
or I'll fucking drain you.
Put the gun down!

1351
01:24:14,307 --> 01:24:17,606
I didn't do
your man downstairs.
I found him like that.

1352
01:24:18,378 --> 01:24:19,470
Whether you believe me
or not,

1353
01:24:19,546 --> 01:24:22,014
you know, that ain't
even the least bit
important right now.

1354
01:24:22,081 --> 01:24:24,743
We're going to
work this out and live,

1355
01:24:25,285 --> 01:24:27,981
or we gonna keep doing
the same shit
we've been doing.

1356
01:24:28,054 --> 01:24:31,615
I ain't got
no problem with you
or your Bureau,

1357
01:24:32,559 --> 01:24:36,825
so I think you're better off
just moving on
and letting us be.

1358
01:25:20,607 --> 01:25:22,598
Agent Messner
is on his way in.

(POLICE SIRENS BLARING)

1360
01:25:44,197 --> 01:25:45,892
Agent Messner.
What's going on?

1361
01:25:45,965 --> 01:25:48,593
Are you all right, son?
You need some
medical attention?

1362
01:25:48,668 --> 01:25:50,636
No, I don't need
medical attention.
Tell me what's going on.

1363
01:25:50,703 --> 01:25:54,139
Okay, come on, sit down.
Please, no, I don't
want to sit. Explain it.

1364
01:25:54,207 --> 01:25:56,402
It's very difficult
to explain everything
right now.

1365
01:25:56,476 --> 01:25:57,943
Much larger matters loom.

1366
01:25:58,011 --> 01:26:00,138
I'm sorry to hear
about Carruthers.

1367
01:26:00,213 --> 01:26:02,807
He's a good man.
Director Locke?

1368
01:26:05,318 --> 01:26:08,549
He's had a sustained
arrhythmic episode,
severe cardiac distress.

1369
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:10,248
I can't help him here.
We have to take him to...

1370
01:26:10,323 --> 01:26:11,517
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get him up on the roof.

1371
01:26:11,591 --> 01:26:14,253
Get Mr. Israel up on the roof.
He's traveling back with us.

1372
01:26:14,327 --> 01:26:16,090
I can't explain
everything right now.

1373
01:26:16,162 --> 01:26:17,424
No, I...

1374
01:26:17,897 --> 01:26:20,457
I need you to go back
to Washington.
What the hell happened here?

1375
01:26:20,533 --> 01:26:22,899
I'm sorry, I cannot
disclose anything more
right now.

1376
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:24,027
So many people are dead.

1377
01:26:24,103 --> 01:26:25,229
I need you to return
to Washington.

1378
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,705
You'll be debriefed
in the days to come.
Explain it now.

1379
01:26:27,774 --> 01:26:29,765
Go back to Washington.

1380
01:26:30,043 --> 01:26:31,169
There he goes!

1381
01:26:31,244 --> 01:26:35,044
No, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me, please!

1382
01:26:35,114 --> 01:26:38,777
He went this way! Please,
don't shoot me. Don't shoot!
Please! Don't shoot.

get up there! Got to go!

Get these hotel guests out
in the hallway there.

1385
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,840
Just clear them down the hall.

1386
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,252
Make room. Make room, please.

1387
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:29,163
We'll have to go all the way
around to the other side.

1388
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:32,694
Clear the way here.
Clear the way.

01:28:26,859 --> 01:28:27,848
Hey.

1391
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:34,460
That your car?
No, I...

1392
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:38,831
I'm confiscating it.

1394
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:43,540
Oh, you're FBI.
Yeah.

1395
01:28:44,076 --> 01:28:47,239
Yes, I am. I would advise you
to lower your weapon, sir.

1396
01:28:47,747 --> 01:28:50,580
You're investigating
those murders
out at the lake, huh?

1397
01:28:50,716 --> 01:28:54,049
Say what?
Three men were
ambushed and shot.

1398
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,283
Two died and had
their bodies dumped
in the lake.

1399
01:28:58,124 --> 01:29:00,957
The other has
severe hypothermia,

1400
01:29:01,761 --> 01:29:05,857
possible dementia, and will
probably be a multiple
amputee by week's end.

1401
01:29:05,932 --> 01:29:07,923
Shit, okay. You're right.

1402
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:11,000
I'm sorry.

1403
01:29:13,239 --> 01:29:16,470
You shot me.
And you murdered my friends.

1404
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:18,967
Yeah, I know.

1405
01:29:20,613 --> 01:29:23,377
And you dumped us
in the lake.
Pretty much.

1406
01:29:23,616 --> 01:29:26,016
You were here hunting
the man named Israel,
weren't you?

1407
01:29:26,252 --> 01:29:29,653
Is that who
you was here for? Israel?

1408
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:33,952
I guess we both got
beat out then, didn't we?

1409
01:29:34,527 --> 01:29:35,858
Yeah, goddamn.

1410
01:29:36,195 --> 01:29:40,188
Crazy motherfuckers
up there, huh? Gee whiz.

1411
01:29:42,535 --> 01:29:44,662
Just give us your keys
and get the fuck out of here.

1412
01:29:44,737 --> 01:29:45,726
Okay.

1413
01:29:56,449 --> 01:29:59,111
I'm really sorry
about all that.

1414

Shit gets wild and crazy.

1415
01:30:03,656 --> 01:30:07,524
Fate just up and fucks you
for no good reason.

1416
01:30:08,094 --> 01:30:09,425
You know?

1417
01:30:10,296 --> 01:30:12,264
It's the way of the world!

1418
01:30:12,665 --> 01:30:14,599
The way it's always gonna be.

1419
01:30:16,936 --> 01:30:18,426
Okay, now.

1420
01:30:19,505 --> 01:30:20,836
Peace, bro.

1421
01:30:32,785 --> 01:30:34,275

1424
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:51,358
All right, Doctor, thank you.
You know, just make it
sound good.

1425
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:52,419
Okay.

01:31:53,733 --> 01:31:55,394
Where's Israel?

01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:59,929
What are you doing here?
My debriefing.

debriefing will be handled
in DC, like I told you.

No, we need to
handle it now.

You are instructed
to get out...

What are you doing,
Agent Messner?

1432
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,322
Walk. Let's go.

1433
01:32:21,794 --> 01:32:24,354
You're going to tell me
why no call was made

1434
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:27,126
to inform us
that the Israel situation
had been altered.

1435
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:29,326
Why I and my friend
and partner,

whose body
is going into
a furnace tomorrow,

01:32:31,604 --> 01:32:32,730
were never fucking contacted.

1438
01:32:32,805 --> 01:32:35,638
I cannot discuss it.
You can and you will.

1439
01:32:38,277 --> 01:32:39,301
You are finished.

1440
01:32:39,378 --> 01:32:41,869
Look at my fucking face.
You just figure that out?

1441
01:32:45,084 --> 01:32:48,383
Get that gun out of my spine
or engage the safety, please.

<i>of which Israel
was the byproduct.</i>

1448

That same year, she brought

1449

Paternity suit?
Just for fun?

<i>They got a guy. Some Swede.
Swede?</i>

1455
01:33:34,133 --> 01:33:36,795
Any word on this Swede?
...the mention of
this mysterious Swede.

1456
01:33:36,869 --> 01:33:39,429
There's no Swedish hit man
on anyone's radar.

1457
01:33:39,505 --> 01:33:42,633
Dr. Ingstrom, the Swede,
is not a hired killer.

<i>Supposedly a specialist.</i>

1459

He's had a sustained

severe cardiac distress.

1460
01:33:46,979 --> 01:33:49,777
He's actually

<i>Primo wants Israel's heart.</i>

<i>the man who escaped

You're talking about

1473
01:34:31,891 --> 01:34:34,860
You're gonna kill Israel

1474
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:39,324
No.

1475
01:34:41,834 --> 01:34:44,394
Well, they dug it up
in archives as part of
the Sparazza investigation.

1476
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:47,234
That Sparazza
had major elective
plastic surgery?

1477
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:49,399
It wasn't elective.
It was undertaken
to save his life.

1478
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:50,464
Look at the work
he's had done.

1479
01:34:50,543 --> 01:34:53,307
It wasn't cosmetic.
It was reconstructive.

1480
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:55,841
Look at the date
of the first procedure.

1481
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:57,940
Fifteen separate procedures
since 1952.

1482
01:34:58,017 --> 01:35:01,612
Same year that Sparazza
supposedly murdered
Freeman Heller.

1483
01:35:01,687 --> 01:35:05,623
I'd like to show you
exactly what I meant
when I said, "Change my face."

1484
01:35:06,025 --> 01:35:09,153
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

1485
01:35:09,228 --> 01:35:10,991
I will have my ears
pinned back.

1486
01:35:11,297 --> 01:35:15,734
Removing a slight piece
of bone in my chin
I will alter my jaw line.

1487
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:19,532
A procedure known
as rhinoplasty will reduce
the size of my nose.

1488
01:35:19,805 --> 01:35:21,898
If you add facial hair
to the equation, gentlemen,

1489
01:35:21,974 --> 01:35:24,534
you have a face
that looks nothing like mine,

1490
01:35:24,944 --> 01:35:27,708
and more importantly,
nothing like
a federal agent's.

1491
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,714
<i>Oh, Christ.
I will maintain a slight limp.</i>

1492
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:32,283
<i>My accent will be
a regional Calabrese.</i>

1493
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:34,748
My birthplace, Cosenza, Italy.

1494
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:35,980
That's him.

1495
01:35:36,121 --> 01:35:37,213
<i>And my name...</i>

1496
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:39,780
That's Heller.
...will be Primo Sparazza.

1497
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,924
Now, gentlemen,
I understand that this is
a dramatic approach.

1498
01:35:43,996 --> 01:35:47,022
<i>He went deep cover in 1940.
He could have ripped
the Mafia apart.</i>

1499
01:35:47,099 --> 01:35:48,157
But I firmly believe...

1500
01:35:48,234 --> 01:35:50,532
Dismantled most of
the organized crime

1501
01:35:50,603 --> 01:35:54,061
...this is the only way
to truly infiltrate
organized crime.

1502
01:35:54,139 --> 01:35:57,575
His superiors were convinced
that he had gone rogue,

1503
01:35:57,643 --> 01:35:58,974
swapped allegiances,

1504
01:35:59,044 --> 01:36:01,171
<i>so they gave the order
to terminate his cover.</i>

1505
01:36:01,247 --> 01:36:04,910
<i>All this time, we were told
that it was Sparazza
that killed Heller,</i>

1506
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:08,142
<i>when it was us, the FBI.</i>

1507
01:36:11,323 --> 01:36:12,984
<i>And we didn't kill him.</i>

1508
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:17,992
<i>He survived.
But the injuries he sustained</i>

1509
01:36:18,063 --> 01:36:21,464
required constant surgery,
forever altering his features.

1510
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:26,300
So he assumed
the identity of his alter ego.

1511
01:36:27,306 --> 01:36:30,366
<i>The figment of Primo Sparazza
became flesh and blood,</i>

1512
01:36:30,442 --> 01:36:33,343
<i>and Freeman Heller
was no more.</i>

1513
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:39,778
Now, the brass wanted
Heller's op removed
from official records,

1514
01:36:39,852 --> 01:36:42,412
so they buried it completely
and they wrote Heller off.

1515
01:36:42,655 --> 01:36:45,283
All the agents from that era,
they're dead and gone,

1516
01:36:45,357 --> 01:36:47,587
so history defaulted to fable.

1517
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:51,187
Until now.
Heller's op predated
the second World War.

1518
01:36:51,263 --> 01:36:53,163
About 60 years
of amassed intel.

1519
01:36:53,232 --> 01:36:55,792
Do you have any idea
of how valuable that is?

1520
01:36:55,868 --> 01:36:56,960
Yeah.

1521
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:00,337
So you made another deal,
didn't you?

1522
01:37:00,406 --> 01:37:02,499
Israel's deal
with the government
was tossed out.

1523
01:37:02,574 --> 01:37:06,510
We are now trying to
rehabilitate him, so we
can attempt a transplant.

1524
01:37:06,578 --> 01:37:09,172
You realize that
you're doing this
to save Sparazza?

1525
01:37:09,248 --> 01:37:12,012
No, son. I'm doing all this
to save Heller.

1526
01:37:12,084 --> 01:37:14,279
So you send us in there,
bugles blaring,

1527
01:37:14,353 --> 01:37:17,083
and when it bottoms out,
we're the last to know!

1528
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:19,351
We need cohesion
to move forward son, not...

1529
01:37:19,425 --> 01:37:23,885
Oh, shitcan
the cue-card rhetoric
and talk to me like a man.

1530
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:28,866
You withheld information
while Carruthers lay dying
in vain and in the dark.

1531
01:37:28,934 --> 01:37:32,426
And your reasons
for doing that
are exactly what?

1532
01:37:34,606 --> 01:37:35,766
That?

1533
01:37:37,576 --> 01:37:39,544
Some mob fossil?

1534
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:42,644
A monster that
the Bureau built?

1535
01:37:42,715 --> 01:37:45,775
You tell me something,
is he the Rosetta Stone

1536
01:37:45,851 --> 01:37:48,183
that's going to
blow the lid off
the last 60 years?

1537
01:37:48,253 --> 01:37:49,277
Possibly.

1538
01:37:49,355 --> 01:37:51,755
Is he gonna
show you where all
the bodies are buried?

1539
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:56,625
Or is his ultimate worth
bullshit?

1540
01:37:56,695 --> 01:37:58,720
Utterly useless?

1541
01:37:58,797 --> 01:38:01,891
That's a risk we take.
Yeah, empty pockets.

1542
01:38:01,967 --> 01:38:05,459
Empty pockets paid for
by the lives of
our own people.

1543
01:38:05,537 --> 01:38:06,799
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

1544
01:38:06,872 --> 01:38:08,339
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1545
01:38:08,407 --> 01:38:10,466
My guy is dead.
You're starting
to piss me off.

1546
01:38:10,542 --> 01:38:12,442
The Bureau betrayed us.

1547
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:14,069
Wake up.
You betrayed us...

1548
01:38:14,146 --> 01:38:15,408
Stop pointing...
...Deputy Director Locke.

1549
01:38:15,481 --> 01:38:16,914
Get that thing out of my face.

1550
01:38:16,982 --> 01:38:18,472
You betrayed us
the way you
betrayed them.

1551
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:19,539
You fucking asshole!

1552
01:38:23,255 --> 01:38:26,520
Okay, if you like,
I'll take your verbal
resignation right here,

1553
01:38:26,592 --> 01:38:27,581
right now.

1554
01:38:27,793 --> 01:38:31,229
Do you want your career
to end here, now, like this?

1555
01:38:31,897 --> 01:38:33,057
Your call.

1556
01:38:33,132 --> 01:38:36,192
Now, I'm prepared to dismiss
your behavior. And in light
of what's happened,

1557
01:38:36,268 --> 01:38:38,634
I understand it.
I really do,
and I'm truly sorry.

1558
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,228
But a decision
has been made.

1559
01:38:40,305 --> 01:38:43,672
And we're required to abide
by it, regardless of
our personal feelings.

1560
01:38:43,742 --> 01:38:46,609
Feelings that might
run contrary
to the collective good.

1561
01:38:46,678 --> 01:38:49,010
And that, I need you
to understand.

1562
01:38:49,081 --> 01:38:51,914
It's time for you
to get on a jet back to DC

1563
01:38:51,984 --> 01:38:54,646
and make no further
inquiry into this matter.

1564
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,984
Is that understood,
Agent Messner?

1565
01:38:59,258 --> 01:39:02,056
Are we clear, Agent Messner?

1566
01:39:07,266 --> 01:39:08,756
We're clear.

1567
01:39:13,172 --> 01:39:14,469
We're clear.

1568
01:40:44,129 --> 01:40:46,097
