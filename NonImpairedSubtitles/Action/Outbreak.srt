1
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:33,966
Come this way!

2
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,370
Men wounded in battle we can deal with.

3
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,243
But this strange disease...

4
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,242
Thirty men dead yesterday.

5
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,125
Eighteen, the day before.

6
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:51,050
We need supplies.

7
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:52,766
Plasma.

8
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:53,969
Penicillin.

9
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:55,645
We'll get what you need.

10
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,086
You're Americans.

11
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,212
Please...

12
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,642
...get me out of this shithole.

13
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:04,885
Buddy, that's what we're here for.
We're gonna take you home.

14
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,851
First we'll take a blood sample, all right?

15
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,846
I'm gonna die, right?

16
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:13,163
- You won't die.
- Tell my girl I love her.

17
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:16,006
I won't tell her.
You're gonna tell her yourself.

18
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:21,888
The soldiers inside are in
the early stages of the disease.

19
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:24,647
By tomorrow night they will look like this.

20
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:27,886
Mother of God!

21
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:30,887
I'll authorize an immediate airdrop.

22
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:39,249
It's worse than I thought.
Get the plane here by 1900.

23
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,564
Get the plane, Billy.

24
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,604
Come on! All right!

25
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,605
Isn't this your last day?

26
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:29,569
Yeah.

27
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:06,926
Sam, are you there?

28
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:12,730
Pick up the phone. We have a situation
in Zaire. It doesn't look good.

29
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:14,167
Stay there.

30
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,528
Hemorrhagic fever, high mortality.

31
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,769
We picked up a satellite relay from Cairo.

32
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:20,081
I said stay!

33
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:23,928
What's up?

34
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,328
Looks like we have a Level 4.

35
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,409
How many dead?

36
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:29,961
Don't know. There aren't any numbers yet.

37
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,124
- What do you think it is?
- Too early to say.

38
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:35,444
The WHO is preparing a team,
but I want you there first.

39
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,883
You're off Hanta and flying to Zaire.

40
00:07:37,973 --> 00:07:40,726
Let me get my crew together.
I'll get back to you.

41
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:43,242
I can't believe this. You're wet.

42
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:44,687
You guys are wet.

43
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:47,890
Which one disobeyed me first?
Lewis, it was you, right?

44
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:51,569
You guys are busted. You look very guilty.

45
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,531
Lewis, come on.

46
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,011
Get down.

47
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:04,442
How are you?

48
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:08,362
Hi, boys. How you doing?

49
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:10,445
What are you doing?

50
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:12,365
You miss me?

51
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,093
Come here. Who wants some breakfast?

52
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:17,967
Your paper.

53
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,493
You here for your stuff? Come on.

54
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:23,450
Bagels. Who wants bagels?

55
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,607
Breakfast?

56
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,492
- Who wants some breakfast?
- I've got to go away.

57
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:31,568
Where?

58
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:35,403
Zaire. They think there's cases
of hemorrhagic fever there.

59
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,325
- Is Casey going?
- Yeah.

60
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:39,763
And Jaffe. The whole crew.

61
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,127
Most of it.

62
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,166
So you want me to take the dogs?

63
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:46,606
It's just four days.

64
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,129
I'm going to Atlanta Friday.
If you're late, the dogs go too.

65
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:51,567
Fair enough.

66
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:53,965
What will you do at CDC?

67
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,612
Working BL4.

68
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:57,041
Same as you.

69
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,168
My job.

70
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,963
I'd like to think of it as my job.

71
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,693
And I won't have the Pentagon
pressuring me.

72
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,042
This is mine.

73
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,122
Take it.

74
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:11,251
And the rest of your stuff
is in boxes in there.

75
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,726
I can hang on to it till you come back...

76
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:18,241
...or whatever.

77
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:35,285
You know that you're giving me
all the pictures of us.

78
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,526
You can keep them.

79
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:42,967
You keep them.

80
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,092
I don't want them.

81
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:48,363
I don't want them either, Robby.

82
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,771
Thursday!

83
00:09:56,533 --> 00:10:00,208
I want a turn-up, on the mark.
Come on, let's move it.

84
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:01,647
Let's go!

85
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,850
This plasma goes in the right rudder
of the right wing.

86
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,652
- Where is Jaffe?
- His wife is in labor. He's on leave.

87
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,201
- Who'll read the tissue samples?
- You don't trust me?

88
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,362
- Come on!
- Fine.

89
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:14,923
You want a hotshot scope-jockey,
fine, but, frankly, I'm hurt.

90
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,891
- Who cut his orders?
- The Old Man himself.

91
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:21,404
He hasn't got up this early in years.

92
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,927
- I'll tell him you said so.
- I'll deny it.

93
00:10:25,813 --> 00:10:27,132
Good to see you.

94
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,249
Thought if I showed my star
it might speed things up for you.

95
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:32,323
Is it working?

96
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:33,368
No.

97
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,885
First file on your new man.

98
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,569
Plus telex traffic to date,
and satellite photos from the area.

99
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:42,642
Sir?

100
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,685
Get in, get out.

101
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,131
I hate having you here,
making my life miserable...

102
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,363
...but don't want to lose you to some bug.

103
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,523
- One question.
- Go on.

104
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,491
What have I ever done
to make your life miserable?

105
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:57,566
You got up today.

106
00:10:58,613 --> 00:10:59,932
Thank you, Billy.

107
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,807
Major Salt.

108
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:25,205
May I say it's an honor to work with you.

109
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:29,491
West Point, Johns Hopkins. How many
hours did you log in helicopter school?

110
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,006
- 85.
- Married?

111
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,845
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:34,891
You've never been in the field?

113
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:37,612
No, sir.
But I'm fully trained and highly motivated.

114
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:40,651
I'm talking about landing in a hot zone.
It's unique.

115
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,247
Have you seen the effects
of hemorrhagic fever?

116
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,129
No, sir.

117
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:45,248
Allow me.

118
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,482
- Major.
- Yes.

119
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:49,491
At first the patient has flu-like symptoms.

120
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:53,692
In 2 or 3 days pink lesions appear
on his body, along with pustules...

121
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:57,283
...which erupt with the blood and pus.
A milky substance begins to...

122
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:00,171
These lesions become full-blown.
They feel like mush.

123
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,404
There's vomiting, diarrhea,
bleeding in the nose, ears, gums.

124
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:06,166
The internal organs shut down.
They liquify.

125
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:09,171
Very good.
We've read that in a book too, but...

126
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,085
...in 16 hours you'll see it.

127
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,084
In the flesh, so to speak.

128
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,283
I can handle whatever we encounter.

129
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:19,122
- Lf one panics, we're all in danger.
- He's under orders not to die.

130
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,370
And that's a set of orders
he actually plans to follow.

131
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:54,566
That must be it.

132
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:54,441
He's losing it!

133
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:58,084
No! Just hang on!

134
00:14:58,413 --> 00:14:59,846
I can't breathe!

135
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:01,366
Keep your helmet...

136
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:02,722
- Take it off!
- No!

137
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,405
- Keep it on!
- Keep it on!

138
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:06,961
Don't let him expose himself!

139
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:10,571
Goddamn it! Isolate him! Isolate him!

140
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:12,486
Don't worry.

141
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,805
It's not airborne.

142
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:19,971
Sam Daniels, USAMRllD.

143
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,085
Benjamin lwabi.

144
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:23,572
We've been expecting you.

145
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,052
We came as soon as possible.

146
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,532
Not soon enough.

147
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:29,444
The village is dead.

148
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,884
Do you know the incubation period?

149
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,807
But it kills in 2 or 3 days.
The mortality rate is 100%.

150
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:37,928
Jesus.

151
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,004
Could an infected person
have gotten out of the village?

152
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:42,891
If he did,
he'd be dead or dying in the jungle.

153
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:45,123
It's 50 miles to the next village.

154
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:47,443
First case? Patient zero?

155
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,685
A young man called Murazo.

156
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:53,926
Worked with a white man
to build a road into Kinshasa.

157
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:56,323
- When he returned he was sick.
- I see.

158
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,324
And he drank from this well.

159
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,772
From there, it spreads to the entire village.

160
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,811
Did you identify the carrier? The host?

161
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:07,921
No, when we arrived, he was incoherent.

162
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,324
He died two hours later.

163
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,763
He couldn't tell us how he got it.

164
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:17,402
He's not sick.

165
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:21,851
He's a local ju-ju man. Witch doctor.

166
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,689
He stayed in his cave all week.

167
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:26,451
I'd like to talk to him.

168
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,966
No, he talks to me.

169
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:32,566
You see, he believes that the gods
were awoken from their sleep...

170
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:34,729
...by men cutting down the trees...

171
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:37,930
...where no man should be.
And the gods got angry.

172
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:39,847
This...

173
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,245
...is a punishment.

174
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:13,568
Alarmingly high fatality.

175
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:16,321
All localized within a 3-mile radius.

176
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,326
Incubation period short.
Appears contained.

177
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:21,171
You didn't put "alarmingly."

178
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:24,131
It's an adverb.
It's a lazy tool of a weak mind.

179
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:25,606
I want to add this:

180
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:26,648
Billy...

181
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,091
...this is the scariest
son-of-a-bitch I've ever seen.

182
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,606
And I've seen a lot.

183
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,763
Fine. Fax it to Ford's house.

184
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:39,769
Sorry, sir.

185
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:40,729
It's okay.

186
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,883
I've never seen anything like it.

187
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,248
I put the team in danger, sir.

188
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:46,806
We're still here.

189
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:52,645
I got scared, sir.

190
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,041
You know, fear gets a bad rap.

191
00:17:58,213 --> 00:18:01,205
I don't want anybody working
with me who isn't scared.

192
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,568
Okay?

193
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,803
Then I'm your man, sir.

194
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,485
I sent the fax 6 hours ago.

195
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,643
I am not going to issue an alert.

196
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:32,202
But you must issue an alert.

197
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:35,171
- You said it was contained.
- I said containment was probable.

198
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:36,686
You should be monitoring the airports!

199
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:40,527
Remember 1989? You found 2 cases
of Congo fever in Nairobi...

200
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:43,571
...and we put a note in
every American kid's lunch box.

201
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,086
- I was wrong.
- You were wrong.

202
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:47,403
What about 1992? Lassa fever?

203
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:49,006
- I was wrong.
- Again.

204
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:51,004
- But now you're right?
- No, I could be...

205
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:53,891
Yet you waltz into my party
smelling like dirty socks...

206
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:56,851
...take me away from Senator Rosales...

207
00:18:57,013 --> 00:19:00,210
...who heads the Senate Arms Services
subcommittee in charge of our budget!

208
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:03,330
Forget Ebola, forget Lassa.
This bug kills so fast...

209
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:05,006
Keep your voice down.

210
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:08,764
Now that is exactly my point.

211
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:12,448
It is the very lethality of this virus
which works for us here.

212
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:17,323
They don't live long enough to spread
the thing around. So it is contained.

213
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:18,767
I hope so.

214
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:45,404
I'm through talking, okay?

215
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:48,770
You never understood the concept of time.
What day is it?

216
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,242
- Sunday.
- When did you say you'd be home?

217
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,005
- Friday.
- Thursday, Sam.

218
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:54,288
I meant Thursday.

219
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,809
Thursday and Friday sound so much alike,
even I confuse them.

220
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,601
Why didn't I go to Atlanta
like I said I would?

221
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:02,684
You're decent. If you put the bags...

222
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:03,808
Fuck you.

223
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:08,568
You said you'd be home Thursday,
so I could fly Friday...

224
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:12,369
...buy a toaster, treat myself,
and maybe on Sunday have a day of rest.

225
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,331
Now I must go to the airport.
I won't get in until 7.

226
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,881
It'll be too late to buy a toaster.

227
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:22,763
You know what? I can't unpack, because
I have a welcome cocktail party at 9!

228
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,286
Lewis, move over.

229
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,329
Move!

230
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:29,324
- Get over!
- You're scaring him!

231
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,007
Lewis.

232
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:36,367
That's because you let him on the sofa.

233
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:37,889
Here.

234
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,006
We can go now.

235
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,243
How long are you keeping the dogs?

236
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:45,804
They're going with me to Atlanta.

237
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:48,043
They're my dogs too. I miss them.

238
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:51,970
Do you want them?
Either they go with me or stay with you.

239
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:53,645
We can't share them.

240
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:54,848
Decide.

241
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:56,207
A negotiation.

242
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:57,728
Okay.

243
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:58,922
Wait!

244
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:01,648
You win.

245
00:21:02,613 --> 00:21:03,728
Keep them.

246
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:08,847
Let's go.

247
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:12,164
Wait I just wanted to tell you something.
It's important.

248
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:13,887
Now I forgot.

249
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:17,490
- I'm gonna miss my flight.
- Wait a minute, I remember.

250
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:23,247
Remember that they like
those medium-size bones.

251
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:26,211
I know, the little barbecued ones...

252
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:27,648
I know.

253
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,327
That's right.

254
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:32,844
You look tired, Sam.

255
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:35,724
Was it that bad in Zaire?

256
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:38,606
Could've been better.

257
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:41,805
You be careful.

258
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,526
I wish you luck.

259
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,045
You better tell him to go.

260
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,686
We can go now.

261
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:16,367
That's not what I said. You're not
getting this. Try to be objective.

262
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:19,172
Let me understand this.
You didn't want the photos...

263
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:21,244
...but you wanted the dogs?
- That's not it.

264
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,848
You could have taken a photo
of the dogs and solved everything.

265
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:26,924
I open my heart and you make jokes.

266
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,685
- I'm not.
- We had the dogs as puppies.

267
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:30,445
- They were cute.
- That's not the point.

268
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:33,730
- They're still cute.
- They were ours, and now they're not.

269
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,526
The dogs are probably a case
for the Supreme Court.

270
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:37,807
I'm asking you if I'm right or wrong.

271
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:42,125
We're about to look at the most deadly
virus we've ever seen. Think about that.

272
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:44,204
Right or wrong? It's a question.

273
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:48,445
She's got a new job at CDC.
No, she's got your job at the CDC.

274
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:51,252
- Good for her.
- Anyway, she's starting a new life.

275
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,846
She's not coming back.

276
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:56,767
It's over. Move on, because, frankly,
I'm sick of hearing about it.

277
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:59,003
All right. What do you mean, it's over?

278
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:01,323
You really need to seek some help.

279
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:06,845
A divorce signed by both parties is
strong evidence something is off.

280
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,004
Did she say it was off?

281
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:11,562
Know how I stayed friends with you both?

282
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:14,452
- How?
- I don't have conversations like this.

283
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:18,367
I'm not asking you to take sides.
She didn't take the dogs to be mean.

284
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:20,762
- I'm asking your opinion.
- What is this?

285
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:23,562
You didn't check your suit. It's torn.

286
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:33,565
Takes your breath away.

287
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:44,687
Thank you.

288
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,365
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.

289
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:51,013
I took the liberty
of bringing in the samples.

290
00:23:51,093 --> 00:23:52,367
An early riser.

291
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,568
I was up at 4.

292
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:57,965
Let's work. I want to separate and thaw
them and throw them under the scope.

293
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:58,929
Done.

294
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:01,447
- We'll have results in a few hours.
- Good.

295
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:05,967
Listen to the way it rolls off your tongue.
Motaba.

296
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,852
You know, it sounds like a perfume.

297
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:11,243
One drop and you'll feel different.

298
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:14,371
Your lover will melt in your arms.
Here, try it.

299
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:18,606
Quick hands.

300
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:21,325
But not as quick as mine.

301
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:24,771
Don't mess with this stuff.
You must be ready for anything.

302
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:27,651
Nothing in here can't kill you.
Including the air.

303
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:30,123
Okay, sirs, here we go.

304
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:35,083
These are from an 8-hour period. Healthy
kidney cells before meeting the virus.

305
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:40,206
In one hour, a single virus has invaded,
multiplied and killed the cell.

306
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:42,604
In just over 2 hours...

307
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,970
...its offspring invaded
the nearby cells here, and here.

308
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:48,044
Continually multiplying.

309
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:50,363
Jesus Christ, five hours?

310
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:52,604
It kills this fast?

311
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:56,049
These numbers can't be right.
Ebola takes days to do this.

312
00:24:56,213 --> 00:25:00,047
Sirs, the numbers are correct.
I wish to God they weren't.

313
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:02,649
One goes in, millions come out.

314
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:04,525
And every cell is dead.

315
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,244
Now we see them individually...

316
00:25:07,893 --> 00:25:10,123
...searching for their next victim...

317
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:12,443
...until nothing's left to kill.

318
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:14,765
Mark this day, Salt.

319
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:18,130
We could spend our careers
waiting to see a new virus.

320
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:22,082
Sirs...

321
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,205
Mr. Motaba...

322
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,603
...up close and personal.

323
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,085
I hate this bug.

324
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:31,406
Come on, Casey.

325
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:34,123
You have to love its simplicity.

326
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:37,252
It's 1 billionth our size and it's beating us.

327
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,563
- What, do you want to take it to dinner?
- No.

328
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:40,847
What then?

329
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,288
Kill it.

330
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:43,163
Daniels won't like us going
behind his back like this.

331
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,130
Then we'll kill him.

332
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:49,447
Lighten up. We have no alternative.

333
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:53,401
You're so goddamned sentimental.
That's the trouble with this country.

334
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:55,811
The micrographs are ready.

335
00:26:55,973 --> 00:26:57,122
They're ready.

336
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:08,921
Oh, my God! It's our African friend.
It's back.

337
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:12,130
We have to be very careful now.

338
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:15,968
We wiped out a whole camp
to keep this bug secret.

339
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,884
Lock it up. Shelve it.

340
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,564
You know about this,
I know about this, nobody else.

341
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:25,572
Get your friend Daniels off the case.

342
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:29,931
I don't want that nosy little bastard
messing up 30 years of our work.

343
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:34,882
Is he in?

344
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,645
Just a minute, please.

345
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:39,242
Come in.

346
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:46,366
Would you please get us some coffee?
Would you like anything?

347
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,171
Why am I off Motaba?

348
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,971
Nothing for the colonel.

349
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:52,967
Sit down.

350
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,606
Didn't you say Motaba was contained?

351
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,331
It'll pop up again.

352
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:02,451
We don't have a blood test.
We don't know how it's transmitted.

353
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:05,331
There's a fresh outbreak of Hanta fever
in New Mexico.

354
00:28:05,413 --> 00:28:07,131
CDC needs help. We're sending you.

355
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:08,532
Send Peterson's team.

356
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:10,843
Don't tell me who to send, colonel!

357
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:13,846
I told Senator Rosales I'd send
my best man. That's you.

358
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,048
Now get out.

359
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:17,204
We've got baseline information on it.

360
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:19,682
What am I going to do there? Trap rats?

361
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:22,606
We have the bug growing.
We isolated most of the proteins.

362
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:26,811
We'll have an antibody test soon. Casey
put the bug into rodents and rhesus...

363
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:29,691
...and we'll know its
genetic sequence in a month.

364
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:33,766
If you leave us alone,
we'll map this guy down to its last gene.

365
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:40,131
The odds of Motaba causing any more
problems are a million to one.

366
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:42,682
- I don't know that.
- You should.

367
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:46,732
You would if you didn't harbor
this desire to face the end of the world.

368
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:52,571
It's the biggest thing we've ever seen.

369
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,405
Jesus, you're killing me.

370
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:58,244
- Fresh, brand-new virus.
- You're still killing me.

371
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,171
It's bumpy, baby.

372
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:27,491
It's okay, baby.

373
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:31,368
You'll be out of here in no time. I promise.

374
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:33,924
- When did you get it?
- Today.

375
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:36,571
- We still on?
- He wants it.

376
00:29:43,853 --> 00:29:45,411
Oh, I see.

377
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:48,610
- So your ship came in again, Jimbo?
- Our ship.

378
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:54,203
Africa,
land of great beauty and untold riches.

379
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,082
- Absolutely untold.
- Keep it that way.

380
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:00,921
Take care.

381
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:06,251
- Tell them to send an alert.
- No, I won't.

382
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:08,802
Why are you fighting me on this?

383
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:12,046
I won't base my first
official decision on a hunch.

384
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:16,012
It's not a hunch.
I've got a lab full of dead animals here!

385
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:19,848
There's no response to
intravenous acyclovir. They're all dead.

386
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:24,131
Of course! You stuck them with
the same needle. Where's the evidence?

387
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:26,170
I don't need any, I've got a feeling.

388
00:30:26,253 --> 00:30:28,483
Your feeling is in my notes.

389
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:31,850
This is very simple.
It kills everything in its path.

390
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:34,049
Tell them to put out an alert.

391
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:36,773
This sounds familiar. Is that an order?

392
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:40,005
You're turning a deadly virus
into a family matter.

393
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:41,526
This is not personal.

394
00:30:41,613 --> 00:30:45,606
I can't do this back and forth.
Once in your life, take a chance!

395
00:30:45,773 --> 00:30:48,162
You know what? I did. I married you.

396
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,212
You hung up.

397
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:56,246
First it was the dogs, now we're fighting
over a virus. I can't believe it.

398
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,244
What is the matter?

399
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,166
Music is supposed to
soothe the savage beast.

400
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:12,409
What?

401
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:16,169
Oh, Christ, you little shit.

402
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,645
- Welcome back.
- Look, look.

403
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,246
Let's have a look.

404
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:27,812
You got the papers?

405
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,884
Papers. That's a good one.

406
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,692
Look at her. You asked for a monkey,
I got you one.

407
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:35,810
- What do you mean, look at her?
- What do I mean?

408
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:37,846
I told you a male.

409
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,525
No, you said, "she."

410
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:42,412
Client has a female.
He wants to breed them.

411
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,612
Goddamn! Jesus!

412
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,331
It's okay. It's okay.

413
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:50,570
All right, all right. I'll sell her cheap.

414
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:54,689
- Come on, help me out.
- We had a deal. You screwed up.

415
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,730
I can't even sell that one. Look.

416
00:31:56,813 --> 00:32:00,123
It serves you right.
What am I going to do with her?

417
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,925
The warning will be in our report.

418
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:18,686
Colonel Daniels believes it is serious
enough to send out a special alert.

419
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:23,365
Do you know how much it costs to send
out an alert to 400,000 health workers?

420
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:26,206
In '89, he predicted Hanta and it hit.

421
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:30,207
I suppose I understand your allegiance
to your ex-husband...

422
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:31,931
...but we both know...

423
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:36,450
...the chances of this virus showing up
in the US are virtually nil.

424
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:42,846
Go on, girl.

425
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:45,131
Yeah, it's freedom.

426
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,051
Look at the trees.

427
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:48,441
It's like home.

428
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:51,046
There you go.

429
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:52,568
That's it.

430
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:56,402
Don't give me that look.

431
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,525
No, go on.

432
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,962
I'd keep you, but I'm already hitched.

433
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:09,125
Come on. Go on.

434
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,326
That's it.

435
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:22,403
This is Captain Carter again.

436
00:33:22,573 --> 00:33:25,133
At this time you must
return to your seats...

437
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:28,012
...as we're approaching Logan Airport.

438
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,845
Hey, buckaroo.

439
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,765
So cute.

440
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:39,767
Hey, mister.

441
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,842
Are you going to finish that cookie?

442
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:45,848
No.

443
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:48,725
You can have it, Sheriff.

444
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:54,172
No, no, Bobby, don't bother the nice man.

445
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,006
It's no problem.

446
00:33:56,653 --> 00:33:59,292
I don't want no trouble with the law.

447
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,486
Jimbo!

448
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,804
I missed you so much.

449
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:24,003
You look like shit. What's wrong?

450
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,971
I don't know.
Something I ate, or something.

451
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:36,167
What is it?

452
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:39,523
Sweetie, talk to me, what is it?

453
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:44,647
Help!

454
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,046
Morning, Rudy.

455
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:50,330
Lucrecia won't eat beef wafers
so we'll go back to veal.

456
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:52,646
What's wrong?

457
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:59,527
Rudy, can you hear me? Squeeze
my hand! It looks like toxic shock.

458
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:01,684
- Fred said he was fine yesterday.
- Come on!

459
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:04,333
I read about some bad strep cases
in Newsweek.

460
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:09,123
Maybe I should subscribe. Henry,
get me a blood culture and a blood count.

461
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:11,443
Goddamn it, come on, Rudy!

462
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:16,162
A final score of six to three.

463
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,607
Shit.

464
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,408
Fuck!

465
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:34,724
What about AIDS or hepatitis?

466
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:37,361
We'll test the blood. Don't worry.

467
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:41,765
Should you give me gamma globulin?
I don't want to give anything to my girl.

468
00:35:42,013 --> 00:35:44,243
Flowers would be nice on occasion.

469
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:47,690
- You should eat.
- You shouldn't eat that crap.

470
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,525
You know you want one.

471
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:50,808
You got something.

472
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:54,010
E. Coli outbreak in Michigan
in a steak house franchise.

473
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:58,405
Fevers of unknown origin in Boston.
Their docs can't figure them out.

474
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,451
Wouldn't be African explorers
back from Zaire, would they?

475
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:05,208
Yeah, right. No, just a couple kids.
No unusual travel.

476
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:09,048
Some atypical strain of Lyme and
those Boston doctors missed the boat.

477
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,009
Lisa.

478
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:13,884
Get me on a plane to Boston.

479
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,527
Right in here.

480
00:36:21,453 --> 00:36:22,806
Right over here.

481
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:36,567
James.

482
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,404
Jimbo, can you hear me?

483
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:46,891
We're here to help but we need
to know how you got sick.

484
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:48,167
Can you talk?

485
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:51,608
Hello?

486
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:55,682
Were you in contact with any animals?

487
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:12,643
- Should we call a code?
- Turn it off.

488
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,803
- What is this?
- I'm here to find out.

489
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:18,090
- We'll need a post.
- No, I'm not gonna get what he's got.

490
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:19,766
- I don't do autopsies.
- And you?

491
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:23,050
- I'll do it.
- Oh, God, he's dead, isn't he?

492
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,846
- Oh, God!
- Honey.

493
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:28,083
- Don't let him die!
- We're doing all we can.

494
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:29,686
I need you to help me.

495
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:32,083
- Jimbo, say something!
- Look at me.

496
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,722
Alice, did Jimbo tell you anything?

497
00:37:34,973 --> 00:37:36,725
Did he talk to you?

498
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,846
Very slow.

499
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:50,481
Maximum sharps precautions.

500
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,327
Slow.

501
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,241
Give me the scalpel. You assist me.

502
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:20,727
He worked at an animal quarantine facility
in San Jose.

503
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:23,282
We're monitoring his co-workers.

504
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:26,729
The host could be there.
Don't let anyone out of that place.

505
00:38:26,813 --> 00:38:31,125
We're isolating everyone. I quarantined
the Boston med staff, girl's neighbors.

506
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:33,933
Christ, Sam, I opened this guy up.

507
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:37,370
It looked like a bomb went off inside.
His pancreas, liver...

508
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:40,968
...all the organs were liquified.
I should have forced the alert.

509
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:44,409
You tried.
Get tissue samples to both our labs.

510
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,325
I'll confirm it's Motaba.

511
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,132
- Is anyone else showing symptoms?
- No, not yet.

512
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:53,286
CDC has a Stage 3 alert out.
If there are any new cases...

513
00:38:53,453 --> 00:38:54,169
...God...

514
00:38:54,253 --> 00:38:55,368
...we'll find out.

515
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:56,886
What about the girl?

516
00:38:56,973 --> 00:38:59,692
She died when I was in post.
She wasn't on the plane.

517
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:04,005
So the first time she had contact
with him was at the airport.

518
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:07,290
Plane got in at 9:00. She was
admitted at 6:00 the next morning.

519
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:09,933
We're talking a 24-hour incubation period.

520
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:13,688
- This thing moves so fast.
- That's good for us. We can see it.

521
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,923
Nobody gets sick soon, we're safe.

522
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:19,605
This doesn't sound like you.

523
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,082
- What?
- Imagining the best case scenario.

524
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:25,290
Why not? I still think there's hope for us.

525
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:58,086
Are you all right?

526
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:00,883
I'm gonna get something to drink.

527
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:09,765
What's your problem?

528
00:40:10,653 --> 00:40:11,688
Water.

529
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:13,286
You must wait your turn.

530
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:14,806
I need water.

531
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:47,288
We caught it early, and you'll make it.
But I need you to fight.

532
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:50,411
Dr. Mascelli. Dr. Mascelli to ER, stat.

533
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:52,212
Look who's here.

534
00:40:56,173 --> 00:40:58,403
You got to fight, okay, Henry?

535
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:01,207
Got to fight.

536
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:05,124
She got sick really fast.

537
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:08,490
I thought it was the flu.
She fainted. She's burning up.

538
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:26,011
They keep coming in.
What's wrong with these people?

539
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:28,289
I don't know, Emma!

540
00:41:28,373 --> 00:41:30,807
Get me the county health department,
now!

541
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:38,162
The passengers checked out clean.

542
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:41,689
No further infection at Boston Municipal.
We're in the clear!

543
00:41:54,653 --> 00:41:56,564
Robby, Dr. Reynolds.

544
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:03,123
15 cases.

545
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:06,564
There's another outbreak?

546
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,963
- Besides the one in Boston?
- Why're you reluctant?

547
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:13,046
CDC and USAMRllD are the only agencies
able to deal with a virus like this.

548
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:15,363
That's why I want to leave tonight.

549
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,966
Sorry, can't do that.

550
00:42:17,053 --> 00:42:19,044
Why in God's name would you
keep me out of there?

551
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:22,569
It's a civilian matter. CDC is on it.
Let them do their job.

552
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:24,564
We don't have a charter.

553
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:29,124
Fuck the charter. People are dying.
It's about you being a doctor!

554
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:31,761
It's about that sacred oath we took!

555
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:33,207
We're friends.

556
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:36,012
Yes, we're friends, but I'm also your boss!

557
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:39,290
I run this outfit!
You do what the hell I say!

558
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:43,442
I'm your boss. I have my boss. Clear?

559
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:45,923
Get your boss on the phone.

560
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:50,008
Tell him to put me on a plane before
you two kill a lot of people.

561
00:42:50,173 --> 00:42:54,689
I suggest you shut up now.
Don't forget who you're talking to.

562
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:57,367
I don't know who I'm talking to anymore.

563
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,809
Am I talking to USAMRllD,
the Pentagon, the CIA, McClintock?

564
00:43:00,893 --> 00:43:03,965
- Tell me who I'm talking to.
- This conversation is over.

565
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:06,245
You're going to New Mexico.

566
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:10,849
I suggest you get packed or whatever you
have to do, and I suggest you do it now!

567
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:29,409
Who screwed up? Why wasn't
my pilot given the new orders?

568
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:33,851
Ford called me 0200, told me to get
my ass to Cedar Creek, California.

569
00:43:34,013 --> 00:43:35,526
You're going to Albuquerque.

570
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,571
I'm not going to Albuquerque!
I'm going to Cedar Creek!

571
00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:41,213
Get Ford on the phone
and get him to confirm.

572
00:43:41,373 --> 00:43:43,329
No, give me that phone.

573
00:43:43,493 --> 00:43:45,961
- No, I better confirm.
- You know what time it is?

574
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:46,929
2:30.

575
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:51,131
That's right. You redirect on my orders.
Call and change my flight.

576
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:53,409
Put your finger on the phone!

577
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:54,688
My stripes.

578
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:57,242
It'll be your ass if you don't call.

579
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:59,449
Finger the phone. Finger it.

580
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:01,322
Thank you.

581
00:44:40,573 --> 00:44:44,612
Proceed to Cedar Creek with
the 1st Battalion of the 6th Infantry.

582
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:49,210
We need transmission rates of possible
carriers: insect, marine, animal, human.

583
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:53,207
If it's spreading, we need to know
where it's going and how fast.

584
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:54,961
And Billy...

585
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:58,326
...we're in a hold mode for Clean Sweep.

586
00:45:00,253 --> 00:45:03,928
You and I both know we can
throw these people a lifeline.

587
00:45:04,093 --> 00:45:06,561
We must proceed with
conventional containment.

588
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:09,372
And you must maintain an
absolute media blackout.

589
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:12,286
Control your subordinates.
Is Daniels in line?

590
00:45:12,453 --> 00:45:13,727
Yes, sir.

591
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:16,925
I'll believe that when I see it.
Anything else?

592
00:45:17,573 --> 00:45:18,801
No, sir.

593
00:45:18,973 --> 00:45:20,292
Good luck, Billy.

594
00:47:39,453 --> 00:47:41,569
Bring in the supplies.

595
00:47:45,213 --> 00:47:47,807
- What's holding them up?
- There they are now.

596
00:47:47,973 --> 00:47:50,692
Ray Fowler, Chief of Police. Mayor Gaddis.

597
00:47:50,853 --> 00:47:53,765
I'm Dr. Keough from CDC.
This is Dr. Aronson and Dr. Ruiz.

598
00:47:53,853 --> 00:47:57,892
Cedar Creek is a small town.
We're like a family. Everybody's scared.

599
00:47:58,053 --> 00:48:02,046
I know and we're here to help you in
any way we can. I'll be in charge.

600
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,965
I thought he was in charge.

601
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:08,571
Hi, Robby.
We just set up the BL4 mobile unit.

602
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:11,725
Why're you here?
I thought Ford sent you to New Mexico.

603
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:13,087
He did.

604
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:25,372
We're keeping the patients
isolated in here.

605
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,290
There's so many.

606
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:44,248
So many, so fast.

607
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:48,133
Apparently they all got it
at a movie theater.

608
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,242
Dr. Daniels?

609
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,086
There's something you should see.
This way.

610
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:56,527
The patient was admitted a week ago
after a car accident.

611
00:48:56,613 --> 00:48:59,491
He's had no contact
with anyone in isolation.

612
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:32,611
It's airborne.

613
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:56,445
- I'm Lt. Colonel Briggs. Welcome.
- Thank you. The Sit. Rep.?

614
00:49:56,853 --> 00:50:01,244
Since 0620 today we've established
an outer and inner perimeter.

615
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:04,610
No one has violated our cordon.
Before that, I can't give any guarantees.

616
00:50:04,693 --> 00:50:07,412
There are 2618 people in this town.

617
00:50:07,573 --> 00:50:10,690
I want them all accounted for by 0900.
Guarantee me that.

618
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:12,286
We're on it, sir.

619
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:15,006
Quarters in here, sir.

620
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:18,051
By the way,
Colonel Daniels is in town against orders.

621
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:19,328
Locate him.

622
00:50:19,413 --> 00:50:20,528
Arrest him.

623
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:23,326
Clear this area, now!

624
00:50:23,413 --> 00:50:24,607
We have rights!

625
00:50:34,053 --> 00:50:35,566
What're you doing?

626
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:41,683
You can't do this to us!

627
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:44,764
This is a different strain.

628
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:48,687
This one is the one we got
from Jimbo Scott, the one from Zaire.

629
00:50:48,853 --> 00:50:50,844
This new one is from Cedar Creek.

630
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:53,401
They look the same. But...

631
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:55,248
...closer...

632
00:50:56,773 --> 00:50:58,604
...and closer.

633
00:50:58,773 --> 00:51:00,525
See the differences?

634
00:51:01,413 --> 00:51:02,846
The spikes here and here.

635
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:06,767
The protein code changed,
allowing it to survive longer in the air.

636
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:08,605
So it spreads like the flu.

637
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:10,206
Casey, chain of death?

638
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:14,764
Assuming the new strain originated with
Seward. He infects the whole theater.

639
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:16,048
Go back further.

640
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:20,843
He's a medical worker. He was sprayed
with a blood sample taken from Alvarez.

641
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:22,526
Alvarez tells us what?

642
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,683
Zip. He was dead before we got here.

643
00:51:24,773 --> 00:51:29,483
But Alvarez died of the original strain.
Seward died of the new strain.

644
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,213
The virus didn't suddenly mutate, so...

645
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:33,567
...I think...

646
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,967
...that the host animal
is carrying both strains.

647
00:51:38,773 --> 00:51:41,492
Good.
Alvarez, Jimbo, what's the connection?

648
00:51:41,653 --> 00:51:43,723
- I can't find one.
- Wait a minute.

649
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:47,010
- Alvarez worked at a pet store.
- I'm just learning this now?

650
00:51:47,093 --> 00:51:48,367
We just got it.

651
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:51,889
If the host is there it may carry
antibodies to both strains.

652
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:53,884
I'm at the pet store.

653
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:57,807
Salt, get on the new strain from scratch.
Casey, blood test.

654
00:52:30,053 --> 00:52:31,805
General, you got a minute?

655
00:52:31,973 --> 00:52:35,329
There you are. Colonel Briggs,
take this man into custody.

656
00:52:35,493 --> 00:52:38,053
We're in deep shit.
The virus has aerosolized.

657
00:52:38,213 --> 00:52:39,487
What do you mean?

658
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,086
It's gone airborne.

659
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:43,963
- Would you excuse us?
- Certainly, sir.

660
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:53,168
You said Motaba is only spread
through direct human contact.

661
00:52:53,733 --> 00:52:56,691
I know what I said,
but now we're facing a new strain.

662
00:52:56,933 --> 00:52:59,242
- What?
- It spreads like the flu.

663
00:53:00,453 --> 00:53:01,806
- Impossible!
- Fine.

664
00:53:01,973 --> 00:53:05,488
Go to the hospital and see.
Go without a mask, you'll see clearly.

665
00:53:05,573 --> 00:53:09,248
You got 19 dead, hundreds more infected
and it's spreading quickly.

666
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:12,132
Isolate the sick,
and I mean really isolate them.

667
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:14,602
Keep everyone else in their homes.

668
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:15,728
We are!

669
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:19,328
No, we're not doing it!
I just drove through 100 people!

670
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:23,008
If one of them has it, then 10 of them
have it! If one gets out of town...

671
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:24,606
...we're in deep shit!

672
00:53:24,693 --> 00:53:26,763
And we're already in deep shit!

673
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:28,605
Go ahead and arrest me!

674
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,001
All right, Sam!

675
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:32,766
Don't threaten me.

676
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:34,446
Or my crew.

677
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:35,648
Please.

678
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:38,571
Leave us to do our work.

679
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:40,481
All right, Sam.

680
00:53:44,373 --> 00:53:46,682
- You were never here.
- No, I was here.

681
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:48,685
I followed the bug here.

682
00:53:49,173 --> 00:53:50,686
I've always been here.

683
00:53:53,093 --> 00:53:54,845
You remember that.

684
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:02,612
The US Army and the CDC report...

685
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:05,731
...that the virus which struck
this California town...

686
00:54:05,813 --> 00:54:08,202
...is being contained
as they search for answers.

687
00:54:08,293 --> 00:54:12,206
A quarantine has been established
to protect neighboring townships...

688
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:15,968
...and extends to the Pacific ocean,
just a scant mile away.

689
00:54:16,213 --> 00:54:19,808
You are entering a restricted area.
Turn your aircraft around.

690
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:22,282
This is a no-fly zone.

691
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:36,046
Careful of the glass.

692
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:42,850
Return to your homes!
Do not congregate in the street!

693
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,844
Return to your homes!

694
00:54:48,293 --> 00:54:49,567
Robby.

695
00:54:51,253 --> 00:54:53,164
Could this be the host?

696
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:58,931
This monkey's sick. It can't be our host.

697
00:54:59,373 --> 00:55:02,410
We need to run an ELISA.
Let's get back to the lab.

698
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:08,121
No one is permitted to leave the town.

699
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:12,684
Anybody attempting to do so
will be placed under arrest.

700
00:55:13,173 --> 00:55:16,688
I repeat, we are turning you around.

701
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:19,164
What the hell is Bobby doing?

702
00:55:20,613 --> 00:55:22,444
Tommy, follow us.

703
00:55:23,173 --> 00:55:25,812
We gotta get out of here. Kids, get down.

704
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:30,128
Remain calm. We are turning you around.

705
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:01,486
Get to the trees!

706
00:56:04,053 --> 00:56:05,645
Halt your vehicles...

707
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:07,405
...then dismount.

708
00:56:07,813 --> 00:56:10,281
They're bluffing. Keep going.

709
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:13,729
You have entered a restricted area.
We will fire.

710
00:56:13,893 --> 00:56:15,963
This is your last warning.

711
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:21,566
They're shooting!

712
00:56:21,653 --> 00:56:24,042
Damn it, people, there's no place to go.

713
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:25,965
Go! We're almost there!

714
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:29,484
What are they trying to do?

715
00:56:44,373 --> 00:56:45,886
Get out of the vehicle!

716
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:47,486
Let's see your hands!

717
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:50,565
- All right, lady, get out!
- Move!

718
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:55,003
- How are we doing?
- Just a moment.

719
00:56:55,173 --> 00:56:57,403
Tell me as soon as you got something.

720
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:02,207
Anything?

721
00:57:02,373 --> 00:57:05,490
This monkey's been infected
with the original strain.

722
00:57:05,653 --> 00:57:07,484
No antibodies, nothing.

723
00:57:09,733 --> 00:57:12,293
That means the monkey
caught it before the mutation.

724
00:57:12,373 --> 00:57:15,888
Maybe he came from Africa
with the real host, or caught it at Biotest.

725
00:57:15,973 --> 00:57:19,249
Not Biotest. CDC turned that place
inside out. Motaba negative.

726
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:21,801
- Test it again.
- They know what they're doing.

727
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:25,090
Get your people over there,
tell them to test it again.

728
00:57:25,253 --> 00:57:28,290
And after they've tested it,
tell them to test it again.

729
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:30,846
Welcome home.

730
00:57:32,693 --> 00:57:37,403
Military have escalated the quarantine
at Cedar Creek, doubling their presence.

731
00:57:37,573 --> 00:57:40,849
Authorities remain silent about
the details of the situation...

732
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:42,924
...continuing the media blackout.

733
00:57:43,013 --> 00:57:46,289
We can only guess at the seriousness
of the spread of the disease.

734
00:57:46,373 --> 00:57:49,251
Our sources number the dead as low as 10,
as high as 50.

735
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:52,530
It's like a war zone out here,
and we can only imagine...

736
00:57:52,693 --> 00:57:56,049
...the fear of the citizens
of this once very quiet rural town.

737
00:57:56,133 --> 00:58:00,524
Their voices too are silent.
All phone communications are cut off.

738
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:02,206
Those we can hear...

739
00:58:02,373 --> 00:58:07,083
...those with information, will not speak.
It is, in a word, frightening.

740
00:58:07,253 --> 00:58:09,972
A military curfew is now in effect.

741
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,693
Return to your homes immediately.

742
00:58:12,933 --> 00:58:17,484
Anyone found on the streets
after 1900 hours, or 7 p. M...

743
00:58:17,813 --> 00:58:20,532
...will be arrested and confined.

744
00:58:21,173 --> 00:58:22,845
Return to your homes.

745
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:24,844
You'll be safe there.

746
00:58:25,013 --> 00:58:27,811
Return to your homes immediately.

747
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:38,926
The area's been secured.
All civilians are in their homes.

748
00:58:39,093 --> 00:58:43,564
Only minimal protective gear is required
for military personnel.

749
00:58:46,293 --> 00:58:48,045
- Got it?
- I got it.

750
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:27,163
She was one of the first infected.

751
00:59:29,173 --> 00:59:30,925
What's E-1101?

752
00:59:33,213 --> 00:59:36,046
It's an experimental antiserum
from Yale virology.

753
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:39,725
It might be worth a try.

754
00:59:39,893 --> 00:59:44,045
I read the journals. I haven't read a word
about E-1101. Where'd you get it?

755
00:59:44,253 --> 00:59:45,766
You know I can call Yale in a second.

756
00:59:45,853 --> 00:59:48,208
I want to save these people, too.

757
00:59:48,573 --> 00:59:50,928
I'm using everything in the arsenal.

758
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:55,088
We have to work together, Sam.

759
00:59:56,373 --> 00:59:57,362
Are we?

760
00:59:58,613 --> 00:59:59,728
Are we what?

761
01:00:00,053 --> 01:00:02,123
Are we working together, sir?

762
01:00:07,413 --> 01:00:08,732
Oh, shit.

763
01:00:11,933 --> 01:00:14,652
Don't waste your time making phone calls.

764
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:22,962
Excuse me.

765
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,687
Come here.

766
01:00:26,493 --> 01:00:30,964
Give this to the rhesus and also put it
with some virus and pull it apart.

767
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:32,532
What is it?

768
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:34,888
- What's it look like?
- It's not orange juice.

769
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:36,167
No, it's not.

770
01:00:36,253 --> 01:00:37,208
Colonel?

771
01:00:37,373 --> 01:00:38,488
What is it?

772
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:41,207
I don't know.

773
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:43,091
Maybe he'll tell us.

774
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,764
If you're feeling sick at all...

775
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:54,449
...hang a pillowcase or any piece
of white cloth on your front door.

776
01:00:54,613 --> 01:00:59,289
Soldiers will take you in for a test
and you'll know the results in hours.

777
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:01,969
Early stages resemble the flu.

778
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:04,204
Coughing and high fever.

779
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:07,729
Anyone showing these signs
should report them immediately.

780
01:01:07,893 --> 01:01:10,771
Doctors have the situation in hand...

781
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,163
...and are working to find a cure.

782
01:01:22,653 --> 01:01:25,167
I'll only be gone a few hours.

783
01:01:26,613 --> 01:01:29,047
Well, I may have to spend the night.

784
01:01:29,213 --> 01:01:31,090
You girls be good.

785
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:35,730
Make sure you brush your teeth
before you go to bed.

786
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:41,325
- Don't touch your mommy.
- Oh, baby, I can't.

787
01:01:45,693 --> 01:01:46,967
I love you.

788
01:02:13,653 --> 01:02:14,802
Bye.

789
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:55,727
Positive.

790
01:03:02,493 --> 01:03:04,529
Positive, damn it.

791
01:03:06,773 --> 01:03:08,729
The whole damn town is infected.

792
01:03:38,293 --> 01:03:41,649
This way. One straight line.
Down the hall.

793
01:03:41,813 --> 01:03:43,405
Out into the field.

794
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:46,292
This way, folks. One straight line.

795
01:04:15,253 --> 01:04:18,165
No animals have been removed
from here in 14 days.

796
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:22,087
I double-checked the storage lists,
the manifests, the vet profiles. Nothing.

797
01:04:22,173 --> 01:04:26,451
Talk to every single employee.
Somebody's got to know something.

798
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,047
The source of this whole mess is there.

799
01:04:29,213 --> 01:04:32,728
The host is there, Casey.
He didn't talk to everyone.

800
01:04:32,893 --> 01:04:34,326
This coffee sucks.

801
01:04:34,493 --> 01:04:37,087
- Why don't you get some sleep.
- Why don't you?

802
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,289
- I slept in July.
- I got work to do.

803
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:43,128
Don't tell me when to sleep.
I don't tell you when to sleep.

804
01:05:33,653 --> 01:05:34,722
What happened?

805
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:38,601
Nothing.
I just got a sudden case of the willies.

806
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:41,167
I can finish up.

807
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:45,485
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I hate them willies, you know?

808
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:48,811
They should call them "the Sams",
don't you think?

809
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:50,972
You're tired?

810
01:05:51,773 --> 01:05:52,888
Yeah.

811
01:05:57,493 --> 01:06:01,725
The best projection USAMRIID is willing
to make for the spread of the virus is this:

812
01:06:01,813 --> 01:06:03,087
...24 hours...

813
01:06:03,253 --> 01:06:04,686
...36 hours...

814
01:06:05,493 --> 01:06:07,085
...48 hours.

815
01:06:07,413 --> 01:06:10,246
The curtailment must be
viewed objectively.

816
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:14,088
Be compassionate,
but be compassionate globally.

817
01:06:14,813 --> 01:06:15,848
Thank you.

818
01:06:17,213 --> 01:06:19,124
All right, all right. Please.

819
01:06:19,293 --> 01:06:22,569
The President's ETA from the East Asia
Economic Summit is in 20 hours.

820
01:06:22,653 --> 01:06:25,042
By then, he wants a recommendation
from this group.

821
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:28,091
As I understand it, you want to firebomb
the town of Cedar Creek, California...

822
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:31,449
...population 2,600, with a fuel-air bomb...

823
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:34,173
...the most powerful non-nuclear weapon
in our arsenal.

824
01:06:34,253 --> 01:06:38,724
The way it works, it explodes,
sucks in all available oxygen to the core...

825
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:43,125
...vaporizes everything within a mile:
men, women, children and one virus.

826
01:06:43,293 --> 01:06:46,729
Destruction complete, case closed,
crisis is over.

827
01:06:47,453 --> 01:06:51,685
This Constitution of the United States,
I've read it cover to cover.

828
01:06:51,853 --> 01:06:55,448
I don't find anything in it
about vaporizing 2,600 Americans.

829
01:06:55,613 --> 01:06:58,002
But it does say, several times...

830
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:01,848
...that "no person shall be deprived of life,
liberty or property...

831
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:03,605
"...without due process."

832
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:08,168
So, couple things before Clean Sweep
is even considered:

833
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:09,368
One...

834
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:12,491
...unanimous, unwavering support
for the president on this one.

835
01:07:12,573 --> 01:07:15,041
You must support the president publicly.

836
01:07:15,213 --> 01:07:17,124
He goes down, you go down!

837
01:07:17,293 --> 01:07:18,646
Secondly...

838
01:07:18,813 --> 01:07:23,523
...I want an army of experts citing
thousands of lab experiments...

839
01:07:23,693 --> 01:07:26,491
...telling any idiot with a camera
that there was no other way!

840
01:07:26,573 --> 01:07:28,245
You got that?

841
01:07:28,413 --> 01:07:32,406
No member of this government will go
sneaking off to the Washington Post...

842
01:07:32,573 --> 01:07:35,610
...telling them they were
the sole voice of opposition.

843
01:07:35,693 --> 01:07:40,244
If there's a voice of opposition out there,
I want him in here.

844
01:07:41,053 --> 01:07:43,692
Those are the citizens of Cedar Creek!

845
01:07:44,253 --> 01:07:48,007
Go on! Look at them!
These are not statistics.

846
01:07:48,173 --> 01:07:50,084
They're flesh and blood!

847
01:07:50,493 --> 01:07:53,291
And I want you to burn those
into your memories.

848
01:07:53,453 --> 01:07:57,605
Because those images should haunt us
till the day we die.

849
01:09:28,253 --> 01:09:32,883
1918. Remember your history, Donny?
The great influenza pandemic.

850
01:09:33,053 --> 01:09:36,807
Circled the globe in nine months.
Killed 25 million people.

851
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:39,851
My father lost three brothers in that. So?

852
01:09:40,173 --> 01:09:43,848
What if there were men who could
have stopped it, but didn't?

853
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,404
How would history judge such men?

854
01:09:46,493 --> 01:09:47,926
Oh, baloney.

855
01:09:48,093 --> 01:09:52,245
FDR stopped Stilwell going into Indochina.
He caused the Vietnam War.

856
01:09:52,413 --> 01:09:53,607
What does history say?

857
01:09:53,693 --> 01:09:57,686
Truman dropped the bomb on
the Japanese. Saved American lives.

858
01:09:58,013 --> 01:10:02,404
Now revisionist historians say he dropped
the bomb to scare the Russians.

859
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:05,531
Those men were at war, Donny. We're not.

860
01:10:05,693 --> 01:10:08,253
We are at war. Everybody is at war.

861
01:10:08,653 --> 01:10:13,363
I have a presidential green light on
Clean Sweep, and I am going forward.

862
01:10:17,453 --> 01:10:19,683
These people are Americans.

863
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:24,170
2,600 dead or dying Americans.

864
01:10:24,813 --> 01:10:29,523
If that bug gets out of there, 260 million
Americans will be dead or dying.

865
01:10:30,733 --> 01:10:33,293
Those people are casualties of war.

866
01:10:34,893 --> 01:10:37,282
I'd give them all a medal if I could...

867
01:10:37,693 --> 01:10:40,161
...but they are casualties of war.

868
01:10:47,533 --> 01:10:48,966
That's all.

869
01:10:49,213 --> 01:10:50,328
Come on.

870
01:10:54,093 --> 01:10:55,685
- Neal, is it?
- Yes, sir.

871
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:58,810
I have to ask you a few questions.
Have a seat.

872
01:11:01,373 --> 01:11:04,092
Jimbo, Jimbo, how did he get it?

873
01:11:05,693 --> 01:11:09,288
Maybe we're on the wrong track.
Maybe Alice gave it to him.

874
01:11:09,453 --> 01:11:12,331
His tissue samples had twice
the viral amplification of hers.

875
01:11:12,413 --> 01:11:15,052
- So we're stuck.
- We're doing the best we can.

876
01:11:16,253 --> 01:11:17,447
We're not.

877
01:11:18,013 --> 01:11:21,050
Let's wait for the comprehensive results
to come in.

878
01:11:23,453 --> 01:11:25,603
Can I ask you a personal question?

879
01:11:28,093 --> 01:11:29,526
Where are the dogs?

880
01:11:30,973 --> 01:11:31,928
God...

881
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:34,323
Please don't say they're in a kennel.

882
01:11:34,413 --> 01:11:37,769
Think I tied them to a tree
and left a bag of dog chow nearby?

883
01:11:37,853 --> 01:11:41,607
- That's what you did when you left me.
- Let's start over.

884
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:46,090
It's Alvarez, Jimbo, Biotest.

885
01:11:47,293 --> 01:11:48,487
Jesus.

886
01:11:48,813 --> 01:11:49,848
Look.

887
01:11:58,253 --> 01:12:00,483
Guys, guys, the monkey. Turn around.

888
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,651
My sweet Jesus.
He should be dead by now.

889
01:12:06,173 --> 01:12:07,845
The orange juice worked.

890
01:12:08,013 --> 01:12:09,048
Not on humans.

891
01:12:09,133 --> 01:12:13,843
Not on Cedar Creek Motaba. This monkey
was infected with the original strain.

892
01:12:14,013 --> 01:12:16,322
Right. You know what that means?

893
01:12:17,293 --> 01:12:19,853
This is no experimental antiserum.

894
01:12:22,013 --> 01:12:25,608
E-1101 was designed to kill
African Motaba.

895
01:12:28,173 --> 01:12:30,323
And they had it all the time.

896
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:40,488
Come on!

897
01:12:40,653 --> 01:12:42,086
How's his breathing?

898
01:12:42,253 --> 01:12:43,766
He's going to arrest!

899
01:12:48,653 --> 01:12:51,531
We need blood, fluid, oxygen, ice, now!

900
01:12:51,693 --> 01:12:53,763
Let's go. Put it in his armpits.

901
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:55,687
Let me in.

902
01:12:55,853 --> 01:12:57,286
- Under his armpits.
- Pressure.

903
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,806
I need his arm.

904
01:12:58,973 --> 01:13:00,008
Temperature.

905
01:13:00,093 --> 01:13:01,685
I need pressure.

906
01:13:01,853 --> 01:13:03,286
What is his temperature?

907
01:13:03,373 --> 01:13:04,249
106!

908
01:13:04,653 --> 01:13:07,213
We need suction! We need more ice, now!

909
01:13:07,613 --> 01:13:09,444
Casey. Let me in there.

910
01:13:09,613 --> 01:13:11,604
You slept long enough.

911
01:13:11,773 --> 01:13:13,525
Open your eyes! Open!

912
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:16,161
Open! Open! Open! Look at me. Look.

913
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:18,972
Casey, right here. Here I am, here I am.

914
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:20,725
See me? There you are.

915
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,281
There you are. How you doing?

916
01:13:24,493 --> 01:13:27,371
I had a wonderful dream, Auntie Em...

917
01:13:29,053 --> 01:13:31,362
You were there. You were there.

918
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:32,727
Stay with me.

919
01:13:32,893 --> 01:13:36,886
You were there too. You had a 106 fever.
We're going to take you down.

920
01:13:37,053 --> 01:13:39,123
Stay with me. Don't fuck around.

921
01:13:39,613 --> 01:13:41,683
How many brain cells did I kill?

922
01:13:42,253 --> 01:13:44,403
How many? About a billion.

923
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,243
Now I'm only as smart as you.

924
01:13:48,973 --> 01:13:51,692
What can we give him
to kill his sense of humor?

925
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:54,164
We must get a line!

926
01:13:55,293 --> 01:13:56,487
Hold him.

927
01:13:56,653 --> 01:13:58,564
- Hold his hand!
- I got it.

928
01:13:59,293 --> 01:14:00,646
Talk to me!

929
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:06,328
It didn't get past the outer glove.
Give him a line.

930
01:14:06,493 --> 01:14:07,528
What?

931
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:11,448
Come here.

932
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:39,601
I was with him.
I should've known something was wrong.

933
01:14:39,693 --> 01:14:41,206
- Did it pierce it?
- It did.

934
01:14:41,293 --> 01:14:42,408
Let me see.

935
01:14:43,373 --> 01:14:46,331
- Let me get some iodine on it.
- I did that already.

936
01:14:46,493 --> 01:14:48,245
I did that, Sam!

937
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:53,772
Oh, God,
I know how to work with needles.

938
01:14:54,093 --> 01:14:55,446
Why didn't I wait?

939
01:14:55,613 --> 01:14:58,491
- Okay, listen to me.
- Not now, okay? Not now.

940
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:02,330
- Listen to me!
- There's nothing to say.

941
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,407
There is.

942
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,047
Watch it.

943
01:15:30,933 --> 01:15:35,131
You knew about Motaba all along.
E-1101 was the antiserum.

944
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:39,843
You could've stopped this outbreak
before it mutated. But you didn't.

945
01:15:39,933 --> 01:15:40,809
We couldn't.

946
01:15:40,893 --> 01:15:41,848
We?

947
01:15:42,013 --> 01:15:42,968
We.

948
01:15:43,173 --> 01:15:44,526
That's all you need to know.

949
01:15:44,613 --> 01:15:46,649
You must tell me what the host is.

950
01:15:46,813 --> 01:15:49,964
We never found it.
We had to synthesize the antiserum.

951
01:15:50,293 --> 01:15:54,605
To protect the troops. But now
the virus comes here and 2 kids die.

952
01:15:54,773 --> 01:15:56,445
We could've stopped it then...

953
01:15:56,533 --> 01:16:00,367
...but we don't because we must
protect the perfect biological weapon.

954
01:16:00,533 --> 01:16:04,526
But then the virus mutates and we can't
stop it now and we could've then.

955
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:09,962
The decision was made in the interest
of national security.

956
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:13,569
At the time, we felt we could afford
a certain number of losses.

957
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:14,972
Robby's infected.

958
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:18,928
Sorry.

959
01:16:19,653 --> 01:16:21,325
Is "we" sorry too?

960
01:16:26,773 --> 01:16:29,048
"We" is responsible for a town dying.

961
01:16:29,253 --> 01:16:31,403
"We" is a party to Casey dying.

962
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:34,331
My wife is dying.

963
01:16:35,733 --> 01:16:37,803
Isn't she your ex-wife?

964
01:16:41,173 --> 01:16:42,925
What's your point?

965
01:16:43,093 --> 01:16:46,051
My point is your penchant
for distorting the facts.

966
01:16:46,173 --> 01:16:48,846
You and Robby are, in fact, divorced.

967
01:16:49,213 --> 01:16:50,931
Who is "we"?

968
01:16:51,413 --> 01:16:53,324
"We" includes you, Sam.

969
01:16:53,653 --> 01:16:56,213
Unless you resigned from the Army lately.

970
01:16:56,373 --> 01:16:59,490
You don't just do research
and it ends there.

971
01:16:59,973 --> 01:17:04,205
We must defend ourselves against other
maniacs developing biological weapons.

972
01:17:04,573 --> 01:17:06,609
That's how the game is played.

973
01:17:06,773 --> 01:17:11,403
It was a terrible mistake to withhold
E-1101, but we're beyond that now.

974
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,168
We've done all we can as doctors.

975
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:16,771
We must go on...

976
01:17:17,373 --> 01:17:18,601
...as soldiers.

977
01:17:22,613 --> 01:17:24,524
You're gonna wipe out the town.

978
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:29,042
You'll eradicate that mutation
and then your weapon's intact.

979
01:17:29,253 --> 01:17:31,892
That's why the troops
are moving out, right?

980
01:17:32,413 --> 01:17:34,131
It's already ordered.

981
01:17:35,573 --> 01:17:36,722
When is it?

982
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,091
2000 hours.

983
01:17:39,253 --> 01:17:41,164
By order of the president.

984
01:17:42,693 --> 01:17:43,921
The president?

985
01:17:44,213 --> 01:17:47,728
He was advised
by an expert panel of virologists.

986
01:17:47,893 --> 01:17:49,212
I wasn't there.

987
01:17:50,453 --> 01:17:52,409
It's not about a weapon.

988
01:17:52,693 --> 01:17:55,253
When the president saw that in 48 hours...

989
01:17:55,413 --> 01:17:58,849
...the virus could be on
the White House lawn, he gave the order.

990
01:17:58,933 --> 01:18:00,366
I wasn't invited.

991
01:18:01,533 --> 01:18:03,330
If you had been...

992
01:18:05,253 --> 01:18:07,289
...what would you have advised?

993
01:18:14,173 --> 01:18:18,325
Ruiz called. He scared a security guard
into telling him Jimbo...

994
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:20,404
...smuggled an animal out.

995
01:18:21,373 --> 01:18:23,728
- What kind?
- He couldn't say.

996
01:18:23,893 --> 01:18:27,249
It was small enough to fit
in the back seat of a car.

997
01:18:27,413 --> 01:18:31,167
We know it came in on a ship
from Africa around September 1st.

998
01:18:31,293 --> 01:18:33,204
That's something at least.

999
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:36,729
We must find that ship.
You better pack. We got work to do.

1000
01:18:37,653 --> 01:18:39,086
Colonel Briggs.

1001
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:41,528
Daniels was here? In here?

1002
01:18:41,733 --> 01:18:44,122
- Yes, he was.
- Why wasn't I informed?

1003
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:45,572
You were asleep.

1004
01:18:45,813 --> 01:18:47,724
I am never that asleep.

1005
01:18:49,013 --> 01:18:51,481
Now you find him and you arrest him.

1006
01:19:03,733 --> 01:19:06,201
We are so close now. We have a chance.

1007
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:07,642
I know.

1008
01:19:08,413 --> 01:19:10,563
- Do you believe that?
- I believe you.

1009
01:19:10,813 --> 01:19:12,371
You must go.

1010
01:19:15,253 --> 01:19:16,368
Listen...

1011
01:19:18,293 --> 01:19:20,249
I don't know how to say this...

1012
01:19:21,973 --> 01:19:24,009
...but if I'm not back by 1800...

1013
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,448
...and you're not symptomatic...

1014
01:19:28,893 --> 01:19:29,928
...leave.

1015
01:19:31,653 --> 01:19:33,848
- What do you mean?
- Leave town.

1016
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:38,893
Have you seen the troops moving out?

1017
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:44,172
They can't do that.

1018
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:46,805
They're doing it.

1019
01:19:54,013 --> 01:19:57,210
Sir, I think we should go very soon.
Like, right now.

1020
01:20:00,173 --> 01:20:01,208
Let's go!

1021
01:20:04,893 --> 01:20:06,565
Where's Colonel Daniels?

1022
01:20:06,733 --> 01:20:08,246
I think he's upstairs!

1023
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:09,846
Upstairs! Let's go!

1024
01:20:13,413 --> 01:20:15,768
- How many hours in flight school?
- 60 hours plus.

1025
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:18,970
- Actual flying time?
- I was yanking and banking.

1026
01:20:19,173 --> 01:20:21,084
Anybody seen Daniels?

1027
01:20:23,493 --> 01:20:26,405
We're looking for Daniels.
Have you seen him?

1028
01:20:26,573 --> 01:20:28,291
Tall, big guy?

1029
01:20:28,493 --> 01:20:29,767
Sure.

1030
01:20:32,413 --> 01:20:33,448
There.

1031
01:20:36,493 --> 01:20:40,771
Let's see some activity on these birds!
We got four flights today!

1032
01:20:40,893 --> 01:20:43,453
I want a fuel 93 and a turn 91!

1033
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:45,689
Yes, sir.

1034
01:20:45,773 --> 01:20:47,126
Where's your pilot?

1035
01:20:47,213 --> 01:20:51,923
General Ford just called.
We've got helicopter priority. Where is he?

1036
01:20:52,813 --> 01:20:54,405
My pilot, sir, he's...

1037
01:20:55,693 --> 01:20:57,092
Your pilot's what?

1038
01:20:57,573 --> 01:20:59,484
My pilot's taking a leak.

1039
01:20:59,613 --> 01:21:01,604
Taking a leak? No shit.

1040
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:04,971
In that case we'll just wait in the Loach.

1041
01:21:06,413 --> 01:21:10,167
- Tell him to squeeze it off.
- Give him a hand.

1042
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:12,967
Mr. Robertson!

1043
01:21:13,293 --> 01:21:15,682
Get out here on the double!

1044
01:21:15,853 --> 01:21:17,764
Anybody seen Daniels?

1045
01:21:17,933 --> 01:21:19,844
They're down below! Let's go!

1046
01:21:28,093 --> 01:21:30,402
Stop that chopper! That's an order!

1047
01:21:31,373 --> 01:21:33,204
Hold your fire!

1048
01:21:34,173 --> 01:21:35,492
Watch it!

1049
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:39,325
Hit the decks, troops! We're airborne.

1050
01:21:42,813 --> 01:21:46,249
Com Center, Flightline.
Com Center, Flightline.

1051
01:21:46,813 --> 01:21:48,007
Shit.

1052
01:21:53,133 --> 01:21:54,612
Get us to San Francisco.

1053
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:58,129
They'll follow, so go along the coast.
Fog might give us cover.

1054
01:21:58,533 --> 01:22:00,569
You've flown through fog, right?

1055
01:22:00,733 --> 01:22:02,371
I read about it.

1056
01:22:10,053 --> 01:22:12,647
Daniels just commandeered
one of our choppers.

1057
01:22:13,693 --> 01:22:15,365
Dare I ask how?

1058
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:18,005
Don't waste time thinking.

1059
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:20,363
Find him. If he resists, shoot him.

1060
01:22:20,653 --> 01:22:22,132
- I understand.
- Wait.

1061
01:22:22,573 --> 01:22:26,248
- You don't have to do this.
- He's a carrier of the disease. Do it.

1062
01:22:26,413 --> 01:22:27,607
I'm doing it.

1063
01:22:29,293 --> 01:22:32,330
Go after him like this,
the press will swarm all over it.

1064
01:22:32,413 --> 01:22:33,846
You're creating a panic.

1065
01:22:33,933 --> 01:22:36,652
You always have the wrong priority.

1066
01:22:36,813 --> 01:22:39,532
He's not infected. You know it.

1067
01:22:39,933 --> 01:22:44,484
He's been in direct contact with Motaba
patients. Know something beyond that?

1068
01:22:44,813 --> 01:22:46,929
You should've arrested him earlier.

1069
01:22:48,493 --> 01:22:50,006
Launch AWACS!

1070
01:23:02,173 --> 01:23:03,652
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

1071
01:23:04,173 --> 01:23:06,562
I got it. Back up, coming through.

1072
01:23:07,653 --> 01:23:09,371
Make a hole, people.

1073
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,046
Back up.

1074
01:23:11,693 --> 01:23:13,888
Colonel Daniels from USAMRllD.

1075
01:23:14,013 --> 01:23:17,050
George from Sioux City, South Dakota.
Back of the line.

1076
01:23:17,253 --> 01:23:20,404
We got a terrible epidemic.
We're from Cedar Creek!

1077
01:23:20,613 --> 01:23:24,811
- Site of the viral infection!
- You heard about the virus?

1078
01:23:24,973 --> 01:23:27,612
Need we say more?
We need the bills of lading...

1079
01:23:27,693 --> 01:23:30,765
...from ships arriving from Africa
in the last 3 months.

1080
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,125
Shall I cough on you?

1081
01:23:33,293 --> 01:23:35,443
- Mrs. Pananides.
- Now you're talking.

1082
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:39,123
I think these men need some help.

1083
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:44,009
Biotest and paperwork have to be very
careful. Live cargo, federal regulations.

1084
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,972
Here.
Compare our list with your Biotest list.

1085
01:23:47,053 --> 01:23:49,283
- You ready? Number one, Petra.
- Same.

1086
01:23:49,453 --> 01:23:50,727
- Venus.
- Same.

1087
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:51,928
- Patricia.
- Same.

1088
01:23:52,013 --> 01:23:53,526
Tae Kuk.

1089
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:55,686
- Tae Kuk.
- No, sir.

1090
01:23:55,853 --> 01:23:57,286
- No?
- No, sir.

1091
01:23:57,453 --> 01:24:01,048
- Carried a monkey, delivered to Biotest.
- No, negative, sir.

1092
01:24:01,213 --> 01:24:02,851
It's not on the list?

1093
01:24:03,853 --> 01:24:05,923
That's our vessel! That's the boat!

1094
01:24:06,013 --> 01:24:08,083
- The Tae Kuk has set out to sea.
- So what?

1095
01:24:08,173 --> 01:24:09,367
How'll we locate it?

1096
01:24:09,453 --> 01:24:13,128
My friend's in the Coast Guard.
I can make a call, easy.

1097
01:24:13,533 --> 01:24:14,568
How close?

1098
01:24:15,453 --> 01:24:17,921
Closer than his wife would like.

1099
01:24:21,293 --> 01:24:24,171
Get me on that ship. It can't be far.
It just left this morning.

1100
01:24:24,253 --> 01:24:25,686
You want me to fly you out to sea...

1101
01:24:25,773 --> 01:24:29,368
...drop you on a freighter at sea?
With all due respect, that's idiotic.

1102
01:24:29,453 --> 01:24:32,809
- Idiotic? We're fugitives from the law.
- Right.

1103
01:24:32,973 --> 01:24:35,851
Idiocy is our only option. Find the boat.

1104
01:24:40,773 --> 01:24:42,684
So what is this?

1105
01:24:43,693 --> 01:24:46,161
She's a monkey. Her name's Betsy.

1106
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:49,291
- A monkey? I could tell.
- I'm feeding her, see?

1107
01:24:49,453 --> 01:24:52,684
- She lives in the woods.
- Do a lot of monkeys live in the woods?

1108
01:24:52,773 --> 01:24:55,367
No, just Betsy. She comes to visit me.

1109
01:24:56,653 --> 01:25:00,168
Does Betsy like apples
like my little monkey loves apples?

1110
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:01,448
She does.

1111
01:25:04,413 --> 01:25:09,123
Tae Kuk, Tae Kuk, this is Army Helo 1350.
Say your position, over.

1112
01:25:09,373 --> 01:25:10,806
Try another frequency.

1113
01:25:10,893 --> 01:25:13,805
It won't work.
They'll be monitoring marine channels.

1114
01:25:13,893 --> 01:25:17,169
- We'll rely on the position report.
- Just don't be negative.

1115
01:25:17,253 --> 01:25:18,481
Affirmative.

1116
01:25:38,253 --> 01:25:40,562
You sure you got the coordinates right?

1117
01:25:40,893 --> 01:25:42,565
How much fuel have we got?

1118
01:25:42,733 --> 01:25:46,043
Don't worry. This bird will go
400 miles without refueling.

1119
01:25:48,253 --> 01:25:49,402
Wait.

1120
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:51,322
There.

1121
01:25:52,293 --> 01:25:53,282
Tae Kuk...

1122
01:25:53,373 --> 01:25:56,171
...Seattle.
- That's it. Thank you, Mrs...

1123
01:25:56,493 --> 01:25:58,643
- What's her name?
- Pananides.

1124
01:26:04,413 --> 01:26:06,324
I can't land on that ship.

1125
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:07,687
Get me on it.

1126
01:26:08,253 --> 01:26:11,370
- I'll get you close enough.
- Close enough for what?

1127
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,285
Close enough to jump, sir.

1128
01:26:14,493 --> 01:26:15,767
You're not serious.

1129
01:26:15,853 --> 01:26:17,923
All right, you fly, I'll jump.

1130
01:26:18,093 --> 01:26:19,924
No, just get closer.

1131
01:26:20,093 --> 01:26:21,367
Just get...

1132
01:26:21,533 --> 01:26:22,727
...very close.

1133
01:26:27,373 --> 01:26:29,682
That lifeboat is your best shot.

1134
01:26:29,853 --> 01:26:31,525
How do I get back up here?

1135
01:26:31,773 --> 01:26:34,845
Get them to clear me an area.
Or I can throw you a rope.

1136
01:26:35,213 --> 01:26:38,489
Just kidding, sir. Trying to keep you loose.

1137
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:50,966
Closer!

1138
01:26:51,133 --> 01:26:52,646
Get me closer!

1139
01:27:13,453 --> 01:27:16,172
Does anyone here speak English? English?

1140
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,085
- Little.
- I need information...

1141
01:27:18,173 --> 01:27:20,641
...about an animal that was on this ship.

1142
01:27:21,293 --> 01:27:23,204
You don't understand.

1143
01:27:23,373 --> 01:27:26,888
This is a medical emergency.
I'm an American Army doctor!

1144
01:27:27,053 --> 01:27:28,406
Doctor!

1145
01:27:34,813 --> 01:27:36,405
Come. Look.

1146
01:27:44,573 --> 01:27:46,404
Is anyone else sick?

1147
01:27:46,573 --> 01:27:47,926
No. No, sick.

1148
01:27:50,653 --> 01:27:53,213
Take me to this man's sleeping quarters.

1149
01:27:53,373 --> 01:27:54,647
Upstairs.

1150
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:10,886
Where's his locker?

1151
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:42,405
There's our host.

1152
01:29:11,293 --> 01:29:12,646
How are you?

1153
01:29:12,813 --> 01:29:14,644
I'm good. I'm good.

1154
01:29:20,253 --> 01:29:22,005
You should be nice to Sam.

1155
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:25,131
You know he's got a big crush on you.

1156
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:32,325
I'm so scared.

1157
01:29:37,293 --> 01:29:39,682
Would you please hold my hand?

1158
01:29:45,773 --> 01:29:47,570
I'm right here, Casey.

1159
01:29:58,613 --> 01:30:03,368
The president's scientific advisors
assured me that there is no threat...

1160
01:30:03,693 --> 01:30:07,208
...of the further spread of this disease
at the present time.

1161
01:30:07,373 --> 01:30:11,525
The two men who escaped
from the quarantine this morning...

1162
01:30:11,693 --> 01:30:14,571
...are believed to be
infected with the disease.

1163
01:30:14,733 --> 01:30:18,772
Everybody relax!
This is a military emergency! Back up!

1164
01:30:25,293 --> 01:30:26,806
It's all right.

1165
01:30:27,093 --> 01:30:30,642
Back up. Everybody back up.
This is a military emergency.

1166
01:30:30,773 --> 01:30:33,446
Stay calm. Stay calm.
Everybody stay calm.

1167
01:30:33,933 --> 01:30:34,968
That's them.

1168
01:30:35,053 --> 01:30:36,486
That's the guys.

1169
01:30:36,653 --> 01:30:38,052
Get a camera on them.

1170
01:30:38,133 --> 01:30:40,283
- Which camera do I talk into?
- Right there.

1171
01:30:40,373 --> 01:30:43,604
My name is Colonel Daniels.
I'm here with Major Salt.

1172
01:30:43,733 --> 01:30:47,248
We're not infected with the Motaba virus,
but many are.

1173
01:30:47,453 --> 01:30:49,364
We've identified the animal...

1174
01:30:49,453 --> 01:30:52,331
...carrying the virus
and need help finding it.

1175
01:30:52,493 --> 01:30:55,883
The animal who is carrying
the Motaba virus is a monkey.

1176
01:30:56,093 --> 01:30:58,812
This is a photo of the animal.
Can you get in close?

1177
01:30:58,893 --> 01:31:00,531
Can you get a shot of it?

1178
01:31:00,693 --> 01:31:02,809
Get in as close as you can.

1179
01:31:02,933 --> 01:31:06,005
It's a small monkey,
about the size of a cat. It has a white face.

1180
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:08,209
Dark fur runs down its back.

1181
01:31:08,373 --> 01:31:10,728
Don't attempt to capture it yourself.

1182
01:31:10,893 --> 01:31:14,602
Don't go near it. What you can do is
if you see this monkey...

1183
01:31:14,813 --> 01:31:18,283
...call this number at
the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta.

1184
01:31:18,653 --> 01:31:20,291
The area code is 404...

1185
01:31:20,373 --> 01:31:22,409
...and it's 555-9653.

1186
01:31:22,573 --> 01:31:25,133
Again, if you see this monkey...

1187
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:26,772
...don't go near it.

1188
01:31:38,733 --> 01:31:40,052
Hold your fire!

1189
01:31:46,973 --> 01:31:48,691
Right. Palisades.

1190
01:31:48,893 --> 01:31:52,727
Dr. Reynolds, I just want to make sure
I wrote it down correctly.

1191
01:31:52,853 --> 01:31:56,323
That's 211 Sycamore Road, Palisades?

1192
01:31:56,853 --> 01:31:58,969
And the woman's name is Jeffries?

1193
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:00,407
Thank you.

1194
01:32:00,533 --> 01:32:02,330
Thank God she called the CDC.

1195
01:32:02,413 --> 01:32:03,766
What have we got?

1196
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:07,124
Jimbo takes the monkey to Cedar Creek,
tries to sell it but can't.

1197
01:32:07,213 --> 01:32:10,523
He drives to San Francisco,
gets on an airplane for Boston...

1198
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:13,081
...without the animal.
- Must have released it.

1199
01:32:13,173 --> 01:32:15,767
Between Cedar Creek
and San Francisco is what?

1200
01:32:15,853 --> 01:32:17,445
- Palisades.
- That's it.

1201
01:32:17,773 --> 01:32:18,967
- We're there.
- There it is.

1202
01:32:19,053 --> 01:32:22,250
That's it. We're there, colonel.
We are there.

1203
01:32:23,493 --> 01:32:27,008
We intercepted a phone transmission.
They're headed there.

1204
01:32:27,173 --> 01:32:30,848
A potential screw-up you avoided
among many others you have not.

1205
01:32:31,013 --> 01:32:32,651
Who should handle this?

1206
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:34,129
You?

1207
01:32:35,013 --> 01:32:37,402
You kiss ass with the best of them.

1208
01:32:37,573 --> 01:32:39,962
- You hope to make General?
- Yes, sir.

1209
01:32:40,853 --> 01:32:43,731
You won't.
Now get me on one of those choppers.

1210
01:33:09,293 --> 01:33:10,885
She won't come.

1211
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,842
She won't come, except to me.

1212
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:16,964
I'm her only friend.

1213
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:28,121
I trust you are the best helicopter pilot
in this man's army.

1214
01:33:28,653 --> 01:33:30,052
That's a relief.

1215
01:33:31,053 --> 01:33:33,613
Viper 2, lead, left echelon.

1216
01:33:34,533 --> 01:33:37,127
Viper 2, line the skids, I'm at your six.

1217
01:33:38,093 --> 01:33:40,812
We're looking for a Loach 1350.

1218
01:33:41,573 --> 01:33:43,803
Make this easy for me, all right?

1219
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:53,131
Have you ever been sick?

1220
01:33:53,373 --> 01:33:56,012
- Yes.
- It's not much fun, is it?

1221
01:33:57,093 --> 01:34:00,290
A whole lot of people are sick right now.
A whole town.

1222
01:34:00,453 --> 01:34:03,525
And you know how much
you love your mommy?

1223
01:34:03,693 --> 01:34:05,649
That's how much I love my wife.

1224
01:34:05,733 --> 01:34:08,930
And my wife is one of the people
who's very sick.

1225
01:34:09,093 --> 01:34:10,765
I want her to get better.

1226
01:34:11,013 --> 01:34:12,287
Is it, Betsy?

1227
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:17,243
Betsy can help make everybody better
because she has medicine inside her.

1228
01:34:17,373 --> 01:34:19,807
That's what makes her very special.

1229
01:34:20,453 --> 01:34:21,852
Do you understand?

1230
01:34:22,693 --> 01:34:23,728
You won't hurt her?

1231
01:34:23,813 --> 01:34:24,802
No.

1232
01:34:25,093 --> 01:34:28,290
She'll just go to sleep.
That doesn't hurt, does it?

1233
01:34:28,453 --> 01:34:30,409
No. Promise you won't hurt her.

1234
01:34:30,573 --> 01:34:31,847
I promise.

1235
01:34:32,013 --> 01:34:34,891
If I hurt her, you can punch me in the nose.

1236
01:34:36,173 --> 01:34:37,572
A serious punch.

1237
01:34:38,693 --> 01:34:40,809
For a very serious nose.

1238
01:34:44,613 --> 01:34:47,207
All stations this net, this is Viper 6.

1239
01:34:48,453 --> 01:34:51,445
The Commander in Chief has issued
final authorization.

1240
01:34:51,973 --> 01:34:53,611
We are to proceed.

1241
01:34:56,813 --> 01:35:00,488
Some of us have doubts about what
we are about to do. It's human.

1242
01:35:00,813 --> 01:35:02,883
But the fate of the nation...

1243
01:35:04,013 --> 01:35:06,402
...perhaps the world, is in our hands.

1244
01:35:06,573 --> 01:35:08,803
We are the last line of defense...

1245
01:35:08,973 --> 01:35:12,648
...and we cannot...
we dare not refuse this burden.

1246
01:35:13,733 --> 01:35:15,849
I'm confident that each of us...

1247
01:35:16,773 --> 01:35:17,967
...each of you...

1248
01:35:18,053 --> 01:35:19,486
...will do his duty.

1249
01:35:20,293 --> 01:35:21,772
Viper 6 out.

1250
01:35:22,693 --> 01:35:25,446
Viper Command, Sandman is rolling. Over.

1251
01:35:34,253 --> 01:35:35,811
God forgive us.

1252
01:35:37,373 --> 01:35:38,328
Betsy.

1253
01:35:39,213 --> 01:35:40,612
Here, girl.

1254
01:35:59,053 --> 01:36:00,805
Oh, God, be careful.

1255
01:36:01,613 --> 01:36:03,205
He won't hurt her.

1256
01:36:20,813 --> 01:36:22,371
I can't stand this.

1257
01:36:22,533 --> 01:36:23,852
It won't be long.

1258
01:36:30,533 --> 01:36:32,763
There you are!

1259
01:36:38,373 --> 01:36:39,806
Careful. Careful.

1260
01:36:54,693 --> 01:36:57,253
Come on, Katie, move. Come on.

1261
01:36:58,733 --> 01:37:00,963
Oh, baby. Move!

1262
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:09,402
Damn it.

1263
01:37:24,133 --> 01:37:25,964
We're approaching the destination.

1264
01:37:26,053 --> 01:37:28,283
This man's a carrier of the disease...

1265
01:37:28,453 --> 01:37:31,650
...and we're going to take him
into quarantine at Travis.

1266
01:37:31,813 --> 01:37:35,328
Big Eye, Viper flight is airborne,
do you see us?

1267
01:37:35,493 --> 01:37:38,849
Big Eye paints your flight at two.
Standing by, over.

1268
01:37:39,493 --> 01:37:42,246
Don't give me any shit. Listen carefully.

1269
01:37:42,413 --> 01:37:45,610
Put Ford on the phone,
tell him it's Colonel Daniels.

1270
01:37:47,533 --> 01:37:48,807
Where are you?

1271
01:37:49,933 --> 01:37:52,447
We're on our way back. We got the host.

1272
01:37:52,613 --> 01:37:53,602
What?!

1273
01:37:53,773 --> 01:37:55,650
We found the host, Billy.

1274
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:58,482
Thank God.

1275
01:37:58,573 --> 01:38:00,484
You must call off the bombing.

1276
01:38:00,613 --> 01:38:05,289
I'll buy some time, that's all I can do.
You get back here, quickly, safely.

1277
01:38:06,893 --> 01:38:09,248
You may run into resistance.

1278
01:38:09,453 --> 01:38:10,852
Resistance?

1279
01:38:11,213 --> 01:38:14,250
That makes it tough to get back safely,
doesn't it?

1280
01:38:14,413 --> 01:38:15,482
Good luck.

1281
01:38:16,453 --> 01:38:17,568
Let's go.

1282
01:38:17,733 --> 01:38:19,803
- Problems, colonel?
- Of course!

1283
01:38:28,493 --> 01:38:30,449
Sandman flight, this is Viper 6.

1284
01:38:30,533 --> 01:38:33,093
Stand down, stand down. Return to base.

1285
01:38:33,413 --> 01:38:36,610
Viper 6, Sandman. Roger. Return to base.

1286
01:38:42,253 --> 01:38:43,481
Take a look.

1287
01:38:46,893 --> 01:38:49,691
- Is that resistance?
- That's resistance. Hold on.

1288
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:53,649
- There's our Loach, sir.
- Where?

1289
01:38:53,733 --> 01:38:57,885
Army 1350, this is Viper lead at your 6:00.
Acknowledge. Over.

1290
01:38:58,053 --> 01:38:59,452
Viper, I hear you.

1291
01:38:59,813 --> 01:39:01,610
Army 1350 stand by...

1292
01:39:01,773 --> 01:39:04,924
...to turn into formation
to accompany us to Travis.

1293
01:39:05,133 --> 01:39:06,566
On whose authority?

1294
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:08,166
- Mine.
- Who are you?

1295
01:39:08,453 --> 01:39:10,125
Major General McClintock...

1296
01:39:10,213 --> 01:39:12,169
...senior officer in this area.

1297
01:39:13,253 --> 01:39:16,609
I didn't know you were behind us.
We have the host animal.

1298
01:39:16,773 --> 01:39:18,889
We're headed back to Cedar Creek.

1299
01:39:19,053 --> 01:39:21,283
You are to accompany me to Travis.

1300
01:39:22,053 --> 01:39:24,806
You don't understand.
No one is sick at Travis.

1301
01:39:24,973 --> 01:39:27,009
Don't make this difficult for me.

1302
01:39:28,013 --> 01:39:31,050
They're lining up in attack formation.
They want us down.

1303
01:39:31,133 --> 01:39:35,126
You don't want to destroy
an Army helicopter in broad daylight.

1304
01:39:35,293 --> 01:39:39,047
With all due respect,
if you do not follow us to Travis...

1305
01:39:39,213 --> 01:39:40,965
...l'll blow you out of the sky.

1306
01:39:41,053 --> 01:39:44,728
General, with all due respect, fuck you, sir.

1307
01:39:46,573 --> 01:39:48,086
Under my authority...

1308
01:39:48,253 --> 01:39:49,606
...go weapons hot.

1309
01:39:49,693 --> 01:39:52,082
Viper 2, This is General McClintock.

1310
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,925
Go weapons hot.

1311
01:40:01,373 --> 01:40:02,408
Hold on.

1312
01:40:02,573 --> 01:40:03,847
We're going low.

1313
01:40:10,413 --> 01:40:11,766
Anything I can do?

1314
01:40:11,853 --> 01:40:13,411
Don't make me nervous.

1315
01:40:21,533 --> 01:40:22,886
The river goes to the right.

1316
01:40:22,973 --> 01:40:25,282
We must head them off. Break right.

1317
01:40:25,453 --> 01:40:27,125
Two, breaking right.

1318
01:40:32,973 --> 01:40:35,441
I don't see them. We lost them.

1319
01:40:39,213 --> 01:40:41,044
Shit! Hang on colonel.

1320
01:40:43,773 --> 01:40:45,684
Two is masked. No shot.

1321
01:40:49,613 --> 01:40:50,966
See that bridge?

1322
01:40:51,693 --> 01:40:52,967
Over or under?

1323
01:40:53,133 --> 01:40:55,442
You decide. I'm really not up to it.

1324
01:40:55,613 --> 01:40:57,843
- Hang on.
- I would have said over.

1325
01:40:58,013 --> 01:40:59,844
Wires! Two is off left.

1326
01:41:00,413 --> 01:41:01,528
What do I do?

1327
01:41:01,613 --> 01:41:03,205
Get him out of the air.

1328
01:41:07,213 --> 01:41:09,204
Don't go under the bridge!

1329
01:41:18,733 --> 01:41:19,643
You're missing him.

1330
01:41:20,813 --> 01:41:22,246
- Go into it.
- You're missing him.

1331
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:23,322
Hang on.

1332
01:41:35,613 --> 01:41:37,046
We got it.

1333
01:41:37,213 --> 01:41:39,932
- Lf you're in trouble, I want to know.
- Hang on.

1334
01:41:55,453 --> 01:41:58,411
Warn me before you pull
a stunt like that again.

1335
01:41:58,733 --> 01:42:01,042
I didn't know I was going to do it.

1336
01:42:02,173 --> 01:42:03,686
Where are you?

1337
01:42:03,853 --> 01:42:06,003
Viper 2 closing in on you now.

1338
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:09,052
Pulled a 160, he's coming back at you now.

1339
01:42:16,253 --> 01:42:17,766
They're coming at us.

1340
01:42:17,933 --> 01:42:19,366
I'm going weapons hot.

1341
01:42:19,453 --> 01:42:20,647
- Holy shit!
- Break!

1342
01:42:20,733 --> 01:42:21,927
Break!

1343
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:31,291
- Where's he gone?
- I don't know, sir.

1344
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:35,122
Son of a bitch did that on purpose.

1345
01:42:37,293 --> 01:42:39,523
- Are those rockets on the side?
- They are, sir.

1346
01:42:39,613 --> 01:42:41,444
Fire a few into those trees.

1347
01:42:52,733 --> 01:42:53,848
Look there.

1348
01:42:54,413 --> 01:42:57,132
Lead,
we got fire in the trees at two o'clock.

1349
01:42:57,293 --> 01:42:58,408
Verify.

1350
01:42:58,573 --> 01:43:01,849
Viper 2, can you get down
there and search for wreckage?

1351
01:43:02,013 --> 01:43:04,573
Negative. It's too thick down there.

1352
01:43:05,613 --> 01:43:08,810
Big Eye, we think the Loach is down.
What do you see?

1353
01:43:09,213 --> 01:43:12,967
We had 3 contacts and then
an explosion. Now we have 2.

1354
01:43:13,133 --> 01:43:16,170
Everything else is ground clutter
on the highway.

1355
01:43:16,893 --> 01:43:18,884
Flying a little low, aren't we?

1356
01:43:19,293 --> 01:43:21,045
Avoiding radar, sir.

1357
01:43:24,413 --> 01:43:26,404
She's still out. How you doing?

1358
01:43:27,693 --> 01:43:30,332
Use the E-1101 as a road map
to synthesize an antiserum.

1359
01:43:30,413 --> 01:43:31,368
Right away.

1360
01:43:31,453 --> 01:43:33,762
- We've got a lot of people here.
- I'll copy it big time.

1361
01:43:33,853 --> 01:43:35,286
I want liters of it.

1362
01:43:35,453 --> 01:43:38,490
I want everything ready if Robby responds.
You got it?

1363
01:43:38,573 --> 01:43:39,847
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

1364
01:43:59,853 --> 01:44:01,923
There's no sign of wreckage.

1365
01:44:02,093 --> 01:44:03,606
We've been decoyed.

1366
01:44:05,053 --> 01:44:07,123
You son of a bitch!

1367
01:44:34,653 --> 01:44:36,006
How you doing?

1368
01:44:41,613 --> 01:44:44,332
You're going to be okay.
We found the host.

1369
01:44:46,093 --> 01:44:48,653
You don't have to say that, Sam.

1370
01:44:49,213 --> 01:44:50,646
No, it's true.

1371
01:44:50,893 --> 01:44:52,326
Would I kid you?

1372
01:44:52,493 --> 01:44:54,643
Salt's cooking up the good stuff.

1373
01:44:55,213 --> 01:44:56,965
Let's hang out for a while.

1374
01:45:06,733 --> 01:45:08,564
I love your face.

1375
01:45:19,053 --> 01:45:20,964
Keep talking to me, Robby.

1376
01:45:24,413 --> 01:45:26,404
Please don't leave me, Robby!

1377
01:45:42,333 --> 01:45:43,527
Don't!

1378
01:46:21,613 --> 01:46:23,524
Colonel, I got it!

1379
01:46:24,013 --> 01:46:26,481
- Your helmet?
- Come on, come on, put it up.

1380
01:46:26,653 --> 01:46:27,768
We got it.

1381
01:46:28,493 --> 01:46:29,528
You ready?

1382
01:46:30,973 --> 01:46:32,406
- Say when.
- Now.

1383
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:34,532
I got it. I got it.

1384
01:46:35,213 --> 01:46:36,646
Get the lab geared up.

1385
01:46:36,733 --> 01:46:38,325
Make more. A town is waiting.

1386
01:46:38,413 --> 01:46:41,769
- It's going to work, sir.
- Go, go. Come on. The time's now.

1387
01:46:43,933 --> 01:46:47,209
You delayed the bombing.
More sentimental bullshit.

1388
01:46:47,373 --> 01:46:49,933
There's a chance we
can save these people!

1389
01:46:50,093 --> 01:46:52,163
You're nuts. Sandman 1, Viper 1.

1390
01:46:52,253 --> 01:46:53,572
How copy? Over.

1391
01:46:54,173 --> 01:46:55,447
Send your traffic.

1392
01:46:55,533 --> 01:46:58,730
We had the antiserum and didn't use it.
That will come out.

1393
01:46:58,813 --> 01:47:00,087
I can defend that.

1394
01:47:00,173 --> 01:47:02,243
It's not about saving our asses anymore.

1395
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:07,043
You are to proceed immediately with
Operation Clean Sweep. Understood?

1396
01:47:07,373 --> 01:47:09,762
Daniels knows about the African camp.

1397
01:47:10,413 --> 01:47:11,607
Roger, Viper.

1398
01:47:11,693 --> 01:47:13,365
Sandman is proceeding.

1399
01:47:58,813 --> 01:48:01,611
Her pressure's down.
It worked, she's normalizing.

1400
01:48:02,013 --> 01:48:03,924
But, sir, they're coming.

1401
01:48:04,093 --> 01:48:08,564
I picked up a transmission.
The plane is in the air. They're coming.

1402
01:48:09,213 --> 01:48:10,248
Come on.

1403
01:48:10,893 --> 01:48:12,326
Where are we going?

1404
01:48:15,453 --> 01:48:18,331
- Where are we going?
- I must talk to the pilot. Can we?

1405
01:48:18,413 --> 01:48:20,165
Yes, guard channel.

1406
01:48:20,333 --> 01:48:22,563
- Get this thing up.
- Where're we going?

1407
01:48:22,653 --> 01:48:23,847
I don't know.

1408
01:48:24,013 --> 01:48:27,210
- Get us in the air.
- Let's tell them we have the antiserum.

1409
01:48:27,373 --> 01:48:29,762
- They don't care.
- This is crazy.

1410
01:48:29,933 --> 01:48:31,207
They want their weapon.

1411
01:48:31,293 --> 01:48:32,965
- They'll kill everyone?
- Right.

1412
01:48:33,053 --> 01:48:36,887
- They'll watch innocent people die?
- Yes, they want their weapon.

1413
01:48:51,373 --> 01:48:54,968
Viper, Sandman.
We're commencing bomb run now.

1414
01:48:55,133 --> 01:48:56,964
3 minutes to target area.

1415
01:48:57,133 --> 01:48:59,442
Sandman. Bomb release is go.

1416
01:48:59,613 --> 01:49:02,491
I say again, bomb release is go. Over.

1417
01:49:04,973 --> 01:49:06,565
Where are we going?

1418
01:49:06,733 --> 01:49:09,201
I want to talk to the pilot now.

1419
01:49:09,373 --> 01:49:10,169
Go.

1420
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:14,326
To the aircraft approaching Cedar Creek,
this is Col. Sam Daniels. I'm a doctor.

1421
01:49:14,413 --> 01:49:15,687
Do you read me?

1422
01:49:15,853 --> 01:49:17,002
We read you.

1423
01:49:19,133 --> 01:49:21,852
Okay. You must not bomb this town.

1424
01:49:22,013 --> 01:49:25,847
That son-of-a-bitch,
that little son-of-a-bitch!

1425
01:49:26,013 --> 01:49:29,210
This is Viper Command,
you're being spoofed by com chatter.

1426
01:49:30,693 --> 01:49:34,368
Viper Command, Sandman.
Authenticate. Over.

1427
01:49:34,653 --> 01:49:37,690
Sandman, this is Viper Command.
I authenticate.

1428
01:49:37,853 --> 01:49:38,922
Juliette, over.

1429
01:49:39,013 --> 01:49:41,971
Your commanders do not have
the current data. We do.

1430
01:49:42,053 --> 01:49:45,204
We have an antiserum being
administered as we speak.

1431
01:49:45,413 --> 01:49:50,168
Every infected person will have their
dosage, so you must abort the mission.

1432
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:52,608
This is urgent. Do you read me?

1433
01:49:53,053 --> 01:49:56,409
You cannot bomb this town.
You must abort.

1434
01:49:56,613 --> 01:49:58,843
I'm talking to the bomber pilots.

1435
01:49:59,013 --> 01:50:00,287
Do you read me?

1436
01:50:01,813 --> 01:50:03,326
Do you read me?

1437
01:50:03,653 --> 01:50:05,086
Where is he, Briggs?

1438
01:50:05,293 --> 01:50:08,524
Can he prevent the bombing?
Can he abort their run?

1439
01:50:08,773 --> 01:50:11,003
If he gets in the way of the plane.

1440
01:50:11,173 --> 01:50:14,006
Get something up in the air
and blow him out of there!

1441
01:50:14,093 --> 01:50:15,048
Now!

1442
01:50:16,973 --> 01:50:19,089
Can't we stop his transmission?

1443
01:50:19,333 --> 01:50:21,767
Do you read me? You must abort!

1444
01:50:22,213 --> 01:50:24,773
They've been trained not to answer you.

1445
01:50:25,733 --> 01:50:27,610
You hear me, don't you, guys?

1446
01:50:28,613 --> 01:50:30,046
I'll say it one last time.

1447
01:50:30,133 --> 01:50:32,931
These people that you're going
to bomb are not the enemy.

1448
01:50:33,013 --> 01:50:36,403
We can kill the virus without killing
these people. I swear on my soul...

1449
01:50:36,493 --> 01:50:39,166
...that the President
does not have the facts.

1450
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:41,642
He doesn't know
we have a working serum.

1451
01:50:41,773 --> 01:50:44,162
Do you think he wants
to blow up the town?

1452
01:50:45,293 --> 01:50:49,809
If you think I'm lying, drop the bomb.
If you think I'm crazy, drop the bomb.

1453
01:50:49,933 --> 01:50:52,891
But don't drop the bomb because
you're following orders!

1454
01:50:52,973 --> 01:50:55,692
Your superiors have another agenda.

1455
01:50:55,853 --> 01:50:58,651
Don't you understand that right
below you in Cedar Creek...

1456
01:50:58,733 --> 01:51:03,249
...there's a biological weapon they've
been manufacturing for 30 years?

1457
01:51:03,373 --> 01:51:05,091
I guarantee you...

1458
01:51:05,733 --> 01:51:09,328
...that the disease has spread
beyond the perimeters of this town!

1459
01:51:09,413 --> 01:51:12,132
People,
we're in a state of national emergency.

1460
01:51:12,293 --> 01:51:14,523
We are under executive orders.

1461
01:51:15,013 --> 01:51:16,162
See it through.

1462
01:51:16,253 --> 01:51:19,802
If you incinerate Cedar Creek,
you incinerate the serum.

1463
01:51:30,853 --> 01:51:32,809
Billy, can you hear me?

1464
01:51:33,293 --> 01:51:38,048
Why don't you do something?
Don't kill these people to protect your lie.

1465
01:51:38,373 --> 01:51:41,285
This is murder,
anyway you fucking slice it!

1466
01:51:41,893 --> 01:51:44,771
If you manipulate the truth,
the Constitution...

1467
01:51:44,933 --> 01:51:49,404
...then it's not just a town you're killing,
but part of the American soul.

1468
01:51:49,573 --> 01:51:52,133
Billy, why aren't you at Cedar Creek?

1469
01:51:52,293 --> 01:51:53,806
This is General Ford.

1470
01:51:54,133 --> 01:51:57,728
I remind you that you are interfering
with presidential authority.

1471
01:51:58,053 --> 01:52:00,613
Sandman has a specific line to the target.

1472
01:52:00,773 --> 01:52:04,766
If you are in his way,
he cannot complete his bombing run.

1473
01:52:04,933 --> 01:52:06,286
Do you understand?

1474
01:52:06,373 --> 01:52:08,807
- Why'd he say that?
- Beats me.

1475
01:52:10,093 --> 01:52:13,927
Are you dumb or something?
You just told him how to stop the...

1476
01:52:16,133 --> 01:52:17,248
Okay.

1477
01:52:18,733 --> 01:52:20,291
Colonel, there it is.

1478
01:52:20,453 --> 01:52:21,772
I see it.

1479
01:52:22,933 --> 01:52:25,322
- You up for this?
- Yes, sir.

1480
01:52:26,773 --> 01:52:29,924
He's over the target area,
please advise. Over.

1481
01:52:30,253 --> 01:52:33,563
We have final clearance.
Do not deviate. Over.

1482
01:52:36,173 --> 01:52:38,562
I'm talking to the pilots in the bomber.

1483
01:52:38,853 --> 01:52:41,162
What you're about to do isn't easy...

1484
01:52:41,453 --> 01:52:43,683
But I've told you the truth.

1485
01:52:43,853 --> 01:52:47,050
You will release that weapon
on time and on target!

1486
01:52:47,213 --> 01:52:50,728
What you do in the next 30 seconds
will be your testimony to life.

1487
01:52:50,813 --> 01:52:55,204
Sandman, you know what's riding on this.
Please, try to remain calm.

1488
01:52:55,613 --> 01:52:59,401
Okay, guys, no more words.
But we're not moving from your path.

1489
01:52:59,613 --> 01:53:03,242
Do you hear us?
I said we're not moving from your path.

1490
01:53:03,373 --> 01:53:06,410
I've never seen anything like this,
I swear to God.

1491
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,331
Sandman, Viper Command...

1492
01:53:08,413 --> 01:53:12,486
I don't care if you fly through those
bastards. You've been trained for this.

1493
01:53:12,573 --> 01:53:14,768
Hold your course and drop.

1494
01:53:15,173 --> 01:53:17,164
You'll have to take us out with you.

1495
01:53:20,093 --> 01:53:21,412
We're not moving!

1496
01:53:21,493 --> 01:53:22,846
We're not moving!

1497
01:53:43,453 --> 01:53:44,932
They're dropping it.

1498
01:54:17,533 --> 01:54:18,886
Thank you, guys.

1499
01:54:22,933 --> 01:54:25,606
Sandman,
how did you release that weapon?

1500
01:54:26,893 --> 01:54:30,806
Viper Command, this is Sandman.
We have detonation over the water.

1501
01:54:30,973 --> 01:54:33,487
It might have been wind shear. Over.

1502
01:54:35,533 --> 01:54:39,924
I believe that you have deliberately
contravened a direct order.

1503
01:54:40,093 --> 01:54:43,130
Now return to base for
immediate rearming. Over.

1504
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:45,284
Give me the microphone, general.

1505
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:48,212
I beg your pardon?

1506
01:54:48,373 --> 01:54:50,762
Give me the mike, general.

1507
01:54:56,093 --> 01:54:59,449
Sandman, this is General Ford.
You will ignore that order.

1508
01:55:00,013 --> 01:55:03,449
For the record, I am relieving
General McClintock of command...

1509
01:55:04,413 --> 01:55:08,247
...for the crime of withholding
vital information from the President.

1510
01:55:08,413 --> 01:55:12,486
I have in no way withheld vital
information from the President.

1511
01:55:12,653 --> 01:55:14,405
- Colonel Briggs.
- Sir.

1512
01:55:14,573 --> 01:55:16,848
Place General McClintock under arrest.

1513
01:55:18,333 --> 01:55:22,087
If I go down for this, Billy,
you go down for it.

1514
01:55:23,413 --> 01:55:25,369
It's out of our hands now.

1515
01:55:26,973 --> 01:55:29,441
You sentimental son-of-a-bitch!

1516
01:55:32,413 --> 01:55:34,973
Nobody puts me under arrest!

1517
01:55:36,013 --> 01:55:36,968
Nobody.

1518
01:55:41,533 --> 01:55:43,125
Colonel Briggs...

1519
01:55:43,293 --> 01:55:46,171
...what a wonderful moment
this must be for you.

1520
01:56:16,973 --> 01:56:19,282
That was a good nap, kid.

1521
01:56:20,053 --> 01:56:21,372
You look better.

1522
01:56:22,573 --> 01:56:24,370
The gown becomes you.

1523
01:56:26,293 --> 01:56:28,966
- How're they doing on the antiserum?
- Great.

1524
01:56:29,173 --> 01:56:31,050
Cranking it out by the liter.

1525
01:56:31,373 --> 01:56:34,729
- How much are they giving the patients?
- 200 mls...

1526
01:56:37,933 --> 01:56:39,730
Is that what they gave you?

1527
01:56:48,373 --> 01:56:50,648
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

1528
01:56:52,413 --> 01:56:54,290
I didn't think you'd make it.

1529
01:56:55,213 --> 01:56:57,773
It's a pretty unique experience.

1530
01:57:01,933 --> 01:57:03,924
Like living with me.

1531
01:57:08,413 --> 01:57:10,085
Would you do it again?

1532
01:57:11,533 --> 01:57:12,852
Maybe.

1533
01:57:13,453 --> 01:57:15,842
Now that I have the antibodies.

1534
01:57:23,453 --> 01:57:24,488
