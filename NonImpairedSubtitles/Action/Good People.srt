I mean, he didn't have much.

Um...
no.

The reason I ask
is because the initial
police report

199
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,521
suggests that he died
of a drug overdose,

are just looking
for evidence

have kept drugs there.

<i>and it was Sushi night.</i>

316
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:59,563
And then we found
the money, and...

317
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:02,466
I took just enough
to keep the roof
over our heads.

318
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:08,739
Look, we're in this.

319
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:12,242
<i>As soon as we put the money</i>
<i>in the oven and we didn't</i>
<i>take it out, we were in this.</i>

320
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,915
If we don't start paying off
the mortgage, we're going
to lose the house.

321
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,688
How do we do this?

322
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,424
We spend just enough
to stop the bleeding.

323
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,827
We use cash where we can,

324
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,629
and we get Mike
to write an invoice.

325
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,832
You want to bring Mike
into this?

326
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:38,035
No, it's not like that.
We're not bringing him
into it.

327
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:42,105
But when I do
a job for him,
he usually pays me cash,

328
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,941
and then writes an invoice.

329
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:46,610
So, if anyone asks...

330
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,680
<i>right, there's a paper trail.</i>

331
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,683

looking for it, tom?

332
