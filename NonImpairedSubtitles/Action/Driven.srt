12
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,857  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:384 Y2:419
We're down under for the 1 1th race.

13
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:32,630  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:062 Y2:101

for the championship.

15
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,032  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bly looks nervous.

16
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:42,900  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Cracks are showing.
-Part ofbeing a rookie.

17
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:47,101  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:354 Y2:419
It'll be interesting to see how long
this young man can keep this up.

18
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:33,254  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:062 Y2:127
Hey, DeMille, you promised
a sound bite for tonight's sports!

19
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:36,459  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:062 Y2:126
Jimmy, only talk to this woman.
This reporter only.

20
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,681  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:382 Y2:419
DeMille, can we call it?

21
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,121  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:384 Y2:419
Wait a minute. Come here.

22
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:06,648  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:380 Y2:419
Think. Let me explain something.

23
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:11,386  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:354 Y2:419
These people love you and buy tickets.
The ones with cameras help sell them.

24
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:13,860  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:358 Y2:419
-l need to focus on tomorrow.
-lt is tomorrow.

25
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,699  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:380 Y2:419
This is part of the game.

26
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:19,234  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:354 Y2:419
ln five years, when you're
a brand name, you'll thank me.

27
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:02,580  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:358 Y2:419
Beau, you've had problems before
and never acted like this.

28
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:05,113  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:380 Y2:419
Things change.

29
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,184  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:358 Y2:419
Why can't you Just respect
what l need?

30
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:13,086  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:354 Y2:419
A bad season, so l'm
out of your life?

31
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,622  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:380 Y2:419
This is my life!

32
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:17,357  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:380 Y2:419
This is not your life!

33
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:22,233  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:380 Y2:419
This is what you do for a living.

34
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,665  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:384 Y2:419
Look...

35
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,740  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:354 Y2:419
...if l'm gonna win,
l need my mind there, not here.

36
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,772  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:380 Y2:419
So right now this is my life.

37
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,269  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:380 Y2:419
This is your life.

38
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,412  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:384 Y2:419
What am l?

39
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:49,657  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:384 Y2:419
What am l?

40
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,921  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:384 Y2:419
A distraction.

41
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,231  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'm sorry.

42
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:44,715  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:062 Y2:126
We're in lap 193
of this 225-lap race.

43
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,408  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:354 Y2:419
The defending world champion,
Beau Brandenburg, is in fiirst...

44
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:52,680  X1:156 X2:557 Y1:354 Y2:419
...driving better than we've
seen him drive all season long.

45
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:56,486  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:354 Y2:419
Christian Fittipaldi
sits in second place.

46
00:06:57,395 --> 00:07:00,558  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:358 Y2:419
And the young rookie, Jimmy Bly,
sits back in third.

47
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:03,165  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:419
Bly's been shaky
for the last few races.

48
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:06,337  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
He's such a promising star,
just got raw talent.

49
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:09,200  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:354 Y2:419
If Carl Henry could
get him to relax...

50
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:13,737  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:380 Y2:419
...there'll be no stopping him.

51
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,847  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:354 Y2:419
Laps wind down.
It's a tightpanel at the front.

52
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:24,244  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly tries to make his move
on the number 1 1 ofFittipaldi.

53
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,013  X1:139 X2:574 Y1:384 Y2:419
Motorola car comes to the inside.

54
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,663  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:354 Y2:419
And he does it!
Sweetpass by the rookie, Bly.

55
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,424  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:380 Y2:419
Great. You're doing great.

56
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:40,769  X1:152 X2:561 Y1:354 Y2:419
Close on Brandenburg?
Everybody wants to know that.

57
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:45,768  X1:119 X2:594 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly really seems to be having a
problem with consistency and focus.

58
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:49,140  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:354 Y2:419
Even so, he now fiinds himself
in second place.

59
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,179  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:354 Y2:419
With just 10 laps to go,
Brandenburg leads.

60
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,911  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:354 Y2:419
You're looking good.
Right there.

61
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:02,386  X1:128 X2:585 Y1:358 Y2:419
Brandenburg's experience shows.
He knows how to take the corners.

62
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:06,121  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:354 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly coming into the corner
has a tendency to slow down.

63
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:12,266  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:358 Y2:419
-A lot ofpressure on young Bly.
-Pass for chrissake!

64
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,937  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:384 Y2:419
What is he afraid of?

65
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,233  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:354 Y2:419
Follow Brandenburg's line.
Are you following his line?

66
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:20,042  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:380 Y2:419
I can't. Can Ipick another line?

67
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,076  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:380 Y2:419
Take Brandenburg's line.

68
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:26,146  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly drafts up into the vacuum
behind Brandenburg's car.

69
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:30,343  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:358 Y2:419
But every time he steps out of that
vacuum he runs into a wall ofair.

70
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:34,855  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Slows him down and affects momentum.
-Lay it out, Jimmy. Lay it out.

71
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,921  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:354 Y2:419
You better win this thing.
Win it or you'll look like a fool.

72
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:44,764  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly down to the inside,
tries to get alongside him!

73
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,802  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:354 Y2:419
Very, very close as they
try to come off the corner.

74
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:02,415  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
Can Bly getpast him here?
It's gonna be close.

75
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,814  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:354 Y2:419
Son ofa bitch, not again.
He's gone.

76
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,485  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:419
Bly makes his move,
nails the throttle.

77
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,764  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:380 Y2:419
They touch and Bly's in trouble!

78
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:17,025  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:358 Y2:419
Can he keep it off the wall?
He slides to the inside.

79
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:20,636  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bly's spinning out ofcontrol.

80
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,454  X1:291 X2:426 Y1:384 Y2:419
Damn it!

81
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:42,317  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:354 Y2:419
And it gives the win over
to the defending world champion.

82
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:46,186  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:380 Y2:419
This is Beau Brandenburg's day.

83
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:53,669  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
This is Beau Brandenburg's
fiirst victory in three races.

84
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:55,430  X1:215 X2:498 Y1:380 Y2:419
He's gotta be happy.

85
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,974  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg's back in the lead in
the race for the world championship.

86
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,119  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:419
Crusher, it's time
to call Joe Tanto.

87
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:41,075  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:384 Y2:419
Hello?

88
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,615  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:358 Y2:419
You'll never be up before me,
old friend.

89
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,589  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:380 Y2:419
How you doing, Carl?

91
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,663  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:380 Y2:419
...feeling nostalgic.

92
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,231  X1:257 X2:466 Y1:384 Y2:419
You still there?

93
00:10:57,435 --> 00:11:01,235  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:356 Y2:419
-Can you push it to the ragged edge?
-Yeah, l think so.

94
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:03,703  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:354 Y2:419
-And the fear?
-lt's gone.

95
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:07,008  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Fear's never gone.
-Yeah, maybe.

96
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:12,239  X1:208 X2:506 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What about Memo?
-I'm making a change.

97
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,112  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:380 Y2:419
Memo's out, you're in.

98
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,413  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:380 Y2:419
You're driving for me again, Joseph.

99
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:19,647  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:380 Y2:419
Welcome back to the big show.

100
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:28,991  X1:234 X2:489 Y1:380 Y2:419
What is it, Jimmy?

101
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:32,467  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:354 Y2:419
Because this bad thing
is coming at a bad time.

102
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:35,605  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:354 Y2:419
-So talk to me.
-l said, it's nothing.

103
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,769  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:380 Y2:419
What am l, a piece of wood?

104
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:41,705  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:356 Y2:419
-l'm talking to you!
-Look, l can't do this.

105
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:45,349  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:354 Y2:419
l can't handle it.
l'm being pulled in 10 directions.

106
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:48,584  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:358 Y2:419
l thought l could handle it,
but l can't.

107
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:51,084  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:380 Y2:419
You can, and you will.

108
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,622  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:354 Y2:419
l don't care, we deal with it.
Okay?

109
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,192  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:354 Y2:419
Then stop pushing
like you're one of them.

110
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:59,795  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:384 Y2:419
Wait. ''Them''?

111
00:12:00,598 --> 00:12:02,691  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:380 Y2:419
Like l'm the enemy? ''Them''?

112
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:06,863  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:380 Y2:419
That's great. That's....

113
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,298  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:354 Y2:419
Ever since you started kicking my ass
on everything with wheels...

114
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,877  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:356 Y2:419
...it's been us. My brother
has the touch, l don't. Fine.

115
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,446  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:354 Y2:419
But what l do have
is allegiance to you.

116
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,811  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:384 Y2:419
So don't doubt me. Don't do that.

117
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:26,687  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:354 Y2:419
l saw this 8-year-old,
goofy-looking kid...

118
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:31,521  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:354 Y2:419
...on a piece of Junk go-cart,
come from three laps behind...

119
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,663  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:380 Y2:419
...to beat guys twice his age.

120
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,690  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:380 Y2:419
You rebounded then, right?

121
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,529  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:384 Y2:419
We'll rebound now.

122
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:43,132  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:358 Y2:419
Everybody trips. That's okay.
That's life.

123
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:45,571  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's how fast you get up that counts.

124
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:48,105  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:380 Y2:419
So get up, Jimmy.

125
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,944  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:380 Y2:419
But get up fast.

126
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:18,333  X1:142 X2:581 Y1:062 Y2:122
We just got word from Carl Henry
that Joe ''The Hummer'' Tanto...

127
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:20,101  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
... will replace Memo Moreno...

128
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:23,575  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:062 Y2:100
...as Bly's teammate.

129
00:13:57,982 --> 00:13:59,176  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:384 Y2:419
Excuse me.

130
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:02,650  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:380 Y2:419
How about an autograph, cold fish?

131
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:06,390  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What are you doing here, Joe?
-Glad to see you're still warm.

132
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,889  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:354 Y2:419
They figured you needed
some competition.

133
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:11,722  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
Now there's a familiar face.
Sophia!

134
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,654  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:380 Y2:419
Don't call her, please.

135
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:15,363  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:380 Y2:419
What's wrong?

136
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,633  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Joe--
-Still working here, huh?

137
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:22,135  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:356 Y2:419
-We haven't seen you in a long time.
-No, no, no.

138
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,205  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:380 Y2:419
You keeping him under control?

139
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:27,435  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You driving?
-Yeah, back with Carl Henry's team.

140
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:29,510  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Wow.
-Yeah.

141
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:30,976  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:380 Y2:419
That's great.

142
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:34,477  X1:299 X2:416 Y1:384 Y2:419
Well....

143
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,219  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'll see you around, Joe.

144
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,561  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:354 Y2:419
-She wants to kill you. What happened?
-Nothing.

145
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:46,821  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:380 Y2:419
Nothing?

146
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:49,499  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why'd they put you in a car again?

147
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,463  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:380 Y2:419
All you do is get in the way.

148
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:54,604  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Somebody thinks l got something left.
-Somebody?

149
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,137  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Yeah.
-What do you think?

150
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,967  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:384 Y2:419
l think it's will over skill.

151
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:01,004  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:419
Will over skill?
Like Detroit in '97?

152
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:04,438  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Accidents happen.
-Accidents?

153
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:06,682  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:384 Y2:419
You almost killed me.

154
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:10,513  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:354 Y2:419
You know, Beau, l'm Just

155
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,224  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:419
-l'm different now.
-You...

156
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,223  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:384 Y2:419
...will never be different.

157
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,589  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:380 Y2:419
Be seeing you in my rear-view, Joe.

158
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,300  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

159

Please, picture. Please.

160
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,737  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:380 Y2:419
Picture? No problem.

161
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:32,935  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:380 Y2:419
You gotta be kidding, right?

162
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:38,474  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:384 Y2:419
Smile.

163
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:42,511  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:380 Y2:419
How you doing, guys?

164
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,210  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Joseph.
-Carl.

165
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,214  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:380 Y2:419
l want you to meet our sponsors.

166
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:49,423  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:380 Y2:419
You've been gone a while, Joe.

167
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:52,323  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:354 Y2:419
Not really. Been up north
testing cars for us.

168
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:54,360  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:384 Y2:419
Shouldn't he wear our hat?

169
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,028  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's a little damp, isn't it?

170
00:15:58,236 --> 00:15:59,430  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Just kidding.

-How you doing?
-Call me ''Luc.''

173
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,876  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:382 Y2:419
Luc, l think l can remember that.

174
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,911  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:419
She's a Journalist and will

175
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:13,174  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:354 Y2:419
She's doing an expose
on male dominance in sport.

176
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:16,547  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Will you have time to talk?
-Gotta ask the legend.

177
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:19,917  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Whatever he wants.
-For a beautiful lady, of course.

178
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:23,587  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:354 Y2:419
-No speeding tickets, Joseph?
-No, no speeding tickets.

-Nice to meet you.
-See you later, Luc.

181
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,126  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:382 Y2:419
Give him hell, Joe.

182
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:33,470  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:358 Y2:419
l thought Tanto was dead,
for chrissake.

183
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:37,272  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:384 Y2:419
Whoa!

184
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:40,103  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:380 Y2:419
Now that ex-wife of yours...

185
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:42,543  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:380 Y2:419
...that's a piece of work.

186
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:46,944  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:358 Y2:419
Divorces you and marries
a fellow driver.

187
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:49,618  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:354 Y2:419
l'm realizing how much
l didn't miss you.

188
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,515  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You missed me.

190
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,924  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:380 Y2:419
He's starting to find ways to stumble.

191
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,689  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:354 Y2:419
l'm not losing that lead.
lt won't happen.

192
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:04,459  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Memo drives great. What happened?
-Memo forgot his damn Job.

193
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:09,368  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:354 Y2:419
His Job is to support the team.
To support Jimmy Bly. So he's gone.

194
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:12,475  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:354 Y2:419
l could've hired 100 young turks
to take his place...

195
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:15,145  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:354 Y2:419
...but l wanted somebody
who's been to the top...

196
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:19,339  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:354 Y2:419
-...and stumbled down to the bottom.
-Thanks for reminding me.

197
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,042  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:354 Y2:419
l wanted somebody that
gets his attention.

198
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:24,915  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Maybe gains his trust.
-Why?

199
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:27,417  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:380 Y2:419
Because you're gonna help him...

200
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:31,224  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:419
-...my old friend.
-Carl.

201
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:35,988  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:354 Y2:419
Let's get something straight.
l thought you wanted me to race.

202
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,633  X1:323 X2:393 Y1:384 Y2:419
No.

203

-l'm gone.
-No, you're not.

204
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:42,538  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'm not finished yet. We go back.

205
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:46,006  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:380 Y2:419
We go way back.

l carried you for six years.
You owe me, Joe.

207
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:53,975  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:380 Y2:419
All you gotta do is help this kid.

208
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,585  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:380 Y2:419
Who knows? You might enJoy it.

209
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,982  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:380 Y2:419
You got one offer on the table.

210
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:01,616  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:384 Y2:419
Your choice.

211
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,733  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What did you give him?
-Gas money.

212
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:27,442  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:354 Y2:419
There are a hundred guys more
qualified to back Jimmy. Why him?

213
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:31,645  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:354 Y2:419
Because when he's on, he's
one of the best you'll ever see.

214
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,414  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:384 Y2:419
Just sit back and watch.

215
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:43,525  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:380 Y2:419
What's he doing?

216
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:48,132  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:354 Y2:419
He's Just wound up.
Doing his coin bit will relax him.

217
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:53,237  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:419
-What's his coin bit?
-He'll hold a slide...

218
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:56,436  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
...going full out, then go over
to pick up three coins.

219
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:00,711  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:354 Y2:419
Not with the front tire,
any fool can do that.

220
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:04,251  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:354 Y2:419
He'll snatch them up with
the back one and not lose speed.

221
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:07,185  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:358 Y2:419
-There's no way.
-You don't want to bet me.

222
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:26,601  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:384 Y2:419
There's number one.

223
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:39,111  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:384 Y2:419
There's number two.

224
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:46,993  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:384 Y2:419
What's that sound?

225
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,196  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:354 Y2:419
-lt sounds like humming.
-Yep.

226
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:53,495  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why is he humming?

227
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:57,737  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:354 Y2:419
Some crazy thing he does
when he's pushing close to the edge.

228
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:01,235  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Anyone else ever do that?
-Not among the living.

229
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,294  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Want to back off, Joe?
-Let him go.

230
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:20,555  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:380 Y2:419
Let's see if he's still got it.

231
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:40,344  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:354 Y2:419
You passed the audition, and l'm not
mopping up the mess, Hummer.

232
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:53,157  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:382 Y2:419
Not bad, Hummer.

233
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:06,835  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Your humming's getting better.
-Let me drive again?

234
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:10,036  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:354 Y2:419
l said your humming,
not your driving.

235
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,477  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:384 Y2:419
Go talk to the kid.

236
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,020  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:380 Y2:419
How you doing? l'm Joe.

237
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,592  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Nice run out there.
-lt was okay.

238
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:28,793  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, listen, l liked Memo.

239
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,591  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:380 Y2:419
He's a good guy, good driver.

240
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:34,532  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
Just so you know.
We didn't have any problems.

241
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:40,034  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:382 Y2:419
Two out of three, huh?

242
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:47,715  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:354 Y2:419
Why don't you and me grab a cup
of coffee and talk some strategy?

243
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:52,352  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:354 Y2:419
The strategy's simple: He drives,
you block. You block, he wins.

244
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:54,888  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:354 Y2:419
We gotta hit it.
We got a publicity blitz.

245
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:56,389  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:380 Y2:419
Can't we push that back?

246
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:59,028  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:380 Y2:419
Come on, it's part of the contract.

247
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:01,153  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:380 Y2:419
Talk to you later.

248
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:04,630  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:358 Y2:419
Just channel through me, okay?
l channel well.

249
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,335  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:380 Y2:419
Appreciate that.

250
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,700  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:380 Y2:419
Start coming down.

251
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:29,584  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:062 Y2:122
Last week's big news was Jimmy Bly's
close brush with the wall.

252
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:33,593  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:062 Y2:126
Bly was trailing Beau Brandenburg
on turn four of the last lap...

253
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:36,630  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:358 Y2:419
... when he lost control
at over 200 miles an hour.

254
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:39,735  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
I don't know what's going on
with Bly's driving.

255
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:43,805  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:354 Y2:419
It went so well earlier in the season,
surprising everyone.

256
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:46,772  X1:174 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
He can't seem to
get it together on the track.

257
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:50,777  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:358 Y2:419
All eyes will be on Bly
at tomorrow's Toronto Grand Prix....

258
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,856  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:354 Y2:419
So, Luc, what have you learned
since you've been here?

259
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:42,463  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:358 Y2:419
-l used to think you Just put gas in--
-Fuel.

260
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:46,265  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Get it right.
-Fuel. l knew that.

261
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:49,397  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:380 Y2:419
Put the fuel in and push the pedal...

262
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:50,732  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:384 Y2:419
...and that was it.

263
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,833  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:419
That is embarrassing,
that's what that is.

264
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:56,535  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:358 Y2:419
Joe, with only 10 races
left in the season...

265
00:23:56,747 --> 00:23:59,272  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:354 Y2:419
...why'd they get you?
What makes you special?

266
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:01,417  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:380 Y2:419
Oh, special l'm not.

267
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:05,485  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:380 Y2:419
Do you feel awkward being back?

268
00:24:08,158 --> 00:24:12,822  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Something you're not telling me?
-Well, rumor has it you...

269
00:24:13,063 --> 00:24:14,894  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:384 Y2:419
...were the circuit's wild man.

270
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,158  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:380 Y2:419
You married a woman named Cathy.

271
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:19,996  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:354 Y2:419
You cleaned up, stopped
living the old lifestyle...

272
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:22,172  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:380 Y2:419
...things didn't work out.

273
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:26,074  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:354 Y2:419
-lnteresting, only that's not me.
-lt's Just what l heard.

274
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:28,676  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:358 Y2:419
-l don't want to upset you.
-Game's over.

275
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:34,449  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:354 Y2:419
You actually have something to say.
These young drivers have barely lived.

276
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:37,217  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:354 Y2:419
Your life is so colorful
by comparison.

277
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:41,016  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:354 Y2:419
You know, Luc, l wouldn't remind
you what a fool you've been...

278
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:45,252  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:354 Y2:419
...and then insult you
by calling it colorful.

279
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,336  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:354 Y2:419
-l'm sorry.
-So don't Judge me until you know me.

280
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:57,634  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:354 Y2:419
-How do l do that?
-By finishing this game, wiseass.

281
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:01,735  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:380 Y2:419
Wiseass? Right.

282
00:25:02,112 --> 00:25:03,136  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:384 Y2:419
Good luck.

283
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,658  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:384 Y2:419
Hi.

284
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:19,796  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:384 Y2:419
Hi.

285
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:25,491  X1:319 X2:397 Y1:358 Y2:419
-So.
-So.

286
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:31,169  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:354 Y2:419
l heard about you and Beau.
And l'm sorry.

287
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:33,774  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:384 Y2:419
Thanks.

288
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:36,440  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's my problem.

289
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:38,945  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:358 Y2:419
l'm sorry, Sophia.
l didn't mean to...

290
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:40,878  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:380 Y2:419
...get into your business.

291
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,982  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'm trying to talk.

292
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:50,856  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:354 Y2:419
l Just came out of
a three-year relationship.

293
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:53,723  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:354 Y2:419
-That's a long time.
-Yeah, it's a long time.

294
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:57,831  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:358 Y2:419
When you get used to someone,
it's not....

295
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:01,999  X1:263 X2:454 Y1:384 Y2:419
l don't know.

296
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:05,765  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:384 Y2:419
What?

297
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:13,082  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:358 Y2:419
-l shouldn't be here.
-Wait. No.

298
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:16,946  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:354 Y2:419
-l shouldn't be doing this.
-Sophia, please.

299
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:18,919  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:380 Y2:419
Stay.

300
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:29,199  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'm not looking to get involved.

301
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,261  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:384 Y2:419
l'm not over him.

302
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:35,563  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:354 Y2:419
l understand that.
l'm Just looking for a friend.

303
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:37,368  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:384 Y2:419
You sure?

304
00:26:38,842 --> 00:26:41,276  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Yeah. l think so.
-Think?

305
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:47,911  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:358 Y2:419
Do you want to go sit down,
talk for a while?

306
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:52,049  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:382 Y2:419
Yeah. Yeah, l would.

307
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:00,189  X1:110 X2:603 Y1:354 Y2:419
Welcome to Toronto, Canada,
and this year's Toronto Molson Indy...

308
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:03,230  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:358 Y2:419
...and ESPN's live coverage
of this race.

309
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,765  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Hi, l'm Jeff Oaken.
-l'm Dave Wershafter.

310
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:09,905  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:358 Y2:419
...and this is race day
beside the lake.

311
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:12,700  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:384 Y2:419
Because it is time.

312
00:27:13,377 --> 00:27:16,005  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:354 Y2:419
All the qualifying
and practicing is done...

313
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:20,115  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:354 Y2:419
...it's time to play the cards
and see how it goes down.

314
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:38,764  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:354 Y2:419
Ladies and gentlemen,

317
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:47,535  X1:184 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
This race is being watched
by millions...

318
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:49,575  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:384 Y2:419
...from Finland to Australia.

319
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:54,083  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:358 Y2:419
Over 250,000 people expected
here in Toronto alone...

320
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:57,811  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:354 Y2:419
...from across the world.
1 10-lap race on a street track.

321
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:00,649  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:358 Y2:419
A lot ofdifferent styles,
but the street track...

322
00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:03,826  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:358 Y2:419
...is considered as being
the most hazardous.

323
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:07,622  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:354 Y2:419
That's because it takes place
on ordinary city streets.

324
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:12,461  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:358 Y2:419
You guys here in Toronto
should be the loudest folks to cheer.

325
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:14,736  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:382 Y2:419
Well, well, well.

326
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,297  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:382 Y2:419
So, what about me?

327
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,107  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:384 Y2:419
How do l look?

328
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:24,405  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
Or do you still hate answering
loaded questions?

329
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:27,650  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:382 Y2:419
Go ahead, ask me.

330
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:30,884  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You love him?
-l love a lot of things.

331
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:33,622  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Why marry him?
-He's a younger, better you.

332
00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:36,116  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:384 Y2:419
Ouch.

333
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,990  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:358 Y2:419
-You want to know more?
-No.

334
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:43,030  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:354 Y2:419
You left me, with nothing,
l might add.

335
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:48,569  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:354 Y2:419
Just as Memo and l are starting to
get something here, you steal his Job.

336
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:51,206  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:354 Y2:419
And he still likes you.
How pathetic is that?

337
00:28:51,408 --> 00:28:54,206  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:354 Y2:419
l don't understand this
''brotherhood of speed'' crap.

338
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:56,344  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:380 Y2:419
Just answer me one question.

339
00:28:56,813 --> 00:29:00,874  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:354 Y2:419
Does hurting me make you feel better,
or does that come naturally?

340
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:11,116  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:358 Y2:419
You think you were better than me.
You weren't.

341
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:17,231  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey.

342
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:22,933  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Joe.
-Memo.

343
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,574  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, did Cathy say anything bad?

344
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:29,371  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:354 Y2:419
She better not. Look at you.
How you been, good? Huh?

345
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,479  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
Listen, l'm sorry about all this.

346
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:34,276  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:354 Y2:419
Somebody had to do it,
why not an old friend?

347
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:36,042  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:384 Y2:419
That makes it even worse.

348
00:29:36,553 --> 00:29:40,045  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:356 Y2:419
-You never called about our wedding.
-No, l didn't.

349
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:42,919  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, friends don't do that.

350
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:46,323  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:354 Y2:419
lf they have problems, they talk.
We always did that.

351
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,124  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:358 Y2:419
Sometimes good things happen
from bad ones.

352
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,858  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:380 Y2:419
But, if it'd make you happy...

353
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,697  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:354 Y2:419
-...l'll divorce her.
-Memo, what are you doing?

354
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,905  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:358 Y2:419
Right now, right here, today.
l'm divorced.

355
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:01,203  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:380 Y2:419
But only if you marry me.

356
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:05,313  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Get out. Come on.
-Please. You know, l get so lonely.

357
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:07,813  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:380 Y2:419
Yeah, you look like you're lonely.

358
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:12,983  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:354 Y2:419
l Just want to enJoy my life.
My real life...

359
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,319  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:384 Y2:419
...not this one.

360
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:17,282  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:380 Y2:419
And Cathy does that for me.

361
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:22,158  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:358 Y2:419
Amigo, l have to go. Show these
maricas what a real driver can do.

362
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:23,958  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:354 Y2:419
-l'll do my best.
-Okay.

363
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:24,997  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bye.

364
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:33,770  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:380 Y2:419
Sophia!

365
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,073  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:380 Y2:419
Where are you going?

366
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:39,776  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:380 Y2:419
Good luck today, Beau.

367
00:30:39,983 --> 00:30:42,975  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:354 Y2:419
Everyone excited to see how
Joe Tanto does today.

368
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,155  X1:213 X2:500 Y1:354 Y2:419
His fiirst race since
he nearly lost his life.

369
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:50,053  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Stop bothering people, wiseass.
-Don't mess with me.

370
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:53,586  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:380 Y2:419
The season's rookie leader, Bly.

371
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:58,234  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:354 Y2:419
It'll be interesting to see if this
young man can handle the pressure.

372
00:30:58,602 --> 00:31:00,502  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What's she doing here?
-lt's all right.

373
00:31:00,704 --> 00:31:02,035  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:380 Y2:419
No, this is not all right.

374
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:05,436  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg's ''whatever''
enters your life by accident?

375
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:08,736  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:354 Y2:419
-''Whatever''? Hi, l'm Sophia.
-That's your problem.

376
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:10,435  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:382 Y2:419
DeMille, come on.

377
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:14,208  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:354 Y2:419
Weren't you being pulled
in too many directions?

378
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:18,152  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Man.
-That'll make more legroom for us.

379
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:22,291  X1:143 X2:581 Y1:354 Y2:419
We're ready in Toronto. Time for
the big one to get underway.

380
00:31:22,492 --> 00:31:24,585  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:380 Y2:419
Working your way down the track?

381
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:29,257  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg is on the pole
fiirst again.

382
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,662  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:419
As you have heard,
we are ever so close.

383
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,510  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:354 Y2:419
-We have fiive minutes to race time.
-Joseph.

384
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:52,181  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:380 Y2:419
Gentlemen, to your cars.

385
00:31:58,328 --> 00:32:00,853  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, Jimmy. Good luck, man.

386
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:02,987  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:382 Y2:419
Thanks, man.

387
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:06,065  X1:116 X2:597 Y1:380 Y2:419
All the racers down in pit lane now...

388
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:10,228  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:354 Y2:419
...are in the fiinal stages
ofgetting ready for this race.

389
00:32:11,274 --> 00:32:13,538  X1:182 X2:531 Y1:380 Y2:419
Pace cars are standing by.

390
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:19,912  X1:196 X2:527 Y1:358 Y2:419
We are almost underway
here in Toronto.

391
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,286  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:354 Y2:419
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready for racing?

392
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:43,264  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
Gentlemen, start your engines.

393
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:12,968  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:354 Y2:419
Starting today's race from
the pole position, Beau Brandenburg.

394
00:33:13,703 --> 00:33:16,866  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:380 Y2:419
Second qualifiier, Dario Franchitti.

395
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:19,132  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:380 Y2:419
Third, Christian Fittipaldi.

396
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:24,177  X1:120 X2:604 Y1:354 Y2:419
They're warming their tires to desired
temperature for better traction.

397
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:27,077  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:354 Y2:419
This is the fiirst
offour warm-up laps.

398
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:30,944  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:354 Y2:419
All eyes on the green flag
ready for it to drop.

399
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:33,645  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:382 Y2:419
Sixteenth, Joe Tanto.

400
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:42,096  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:380 Y2:419
The race is underway!

401
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,598  X1:132 X2:581 Y1:354 Y2:419
They roar toward the fiirst turn,
a right-hander, a treacherous gate.

402
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:48,602  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:380 Y2:419
They funnel down into that corner.

403
00:33:57,247 --> 00:34:00,148  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:354 Y2:419
The second passing opportunity
liesjust ahead.

404
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,808  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:354 Y2:419
Someone's in trouble!
Two cars sideways, the Visteon car!

405
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,888  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:354 Y2:419
Right through the barrier!
He's flipping up end over end!

406
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:11,151  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:380 Y2:419
The Visteon car in big trouble!

407
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,293  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:384 Y2:419
An incredible accident!

408
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:22,635  X1:221 X2:493 Y1:354 Y2:419
This puts us at
a full course yellow.

409
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:26,969  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:354 Y2:419
It'll give the drivers a chance
for their fiirstpit stops of the day.

410
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:32,308  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:354 Y2:419
One of the strategies to this game
is when to bring your man in.

411
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,753  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:354 Y2:419
An extra second in the pits can cost
a driver a place or two in this race.

412
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:57,563  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:354 Y2:419
There goes Brandenburg.
Bly, and Tanto is out.

413
00:34:57,941 --> 00:35:01,502  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:354 Y2:419
All three with very fastpit stops,
just over 12 seconds.

414
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:06,205  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
As Andrettiand Tracy almost
get together on the exit!

415
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:10,582  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:354 Y2:419
But now Brandenburg's in front,
Jimmy Bly in second.

416
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:14,122  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:354 Y2:419
l want you to go after Brandenburg.
Go right now. Go!

417
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:18,454  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:354 Y2:419
We have some really interesting
driving by Bly behind Brandenburg.

418
00:35:18,662 --> 00:35:22,962  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:358 Y2:419
-l can't find a hole.
-Don't look for a hole. Make a hole.

419
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:26,158  X1:162 X2:551 Y1:354 Y2:419
Back to full speed,
Bly in pursuit ofBrandenburg.

420
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:29,395  X1:170 X2:543 Y1:354 Y2:419
He's right there.
He tries him at every corner.

421
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:39,277  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:358 Y2:419
Jimmy, you got 10 laps to go.
Conserve the tires.

422
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:42,280  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:354 Y2:419
You talk into that again,
l'll make you eat it.

423
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:45,215  X1:110 X2:603 Y1:380 Y2:419
Don't conserve anything. Go get him.

424
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:50,923  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:354 Y2:419
Ifhe's gonna overtake Brandenburg,
it'll happen in Turn 3.

425
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:52,651  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:380 Y2:419
And it's right--

426
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:55,262  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:382 Y2:419
Oh, look at that!

427
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:59,025  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:380 Y2:419
What a way to move!

428
00:35:59,235 --> 00:36:03,365  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:354 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly grabs the lead away
from Brandenburg. It's magical.

429
00:36:03,573 --> 00:36:06,201  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:380 Y2:419
And Jimmy Bly hasjust taken the lead!

430
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:07,876  X1:303 X2:415 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Joe.
-Yeah?

431
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:09,170  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:380 Y2:419
l want you to pit now.

432
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:11,404  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why? l don't need to pit, Carl.

433
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,271  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:380 Y2:419
l want you to pit.

434
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:17,977  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:354 Y2:419
In a very unusual move, Carl Henry
hasjust called Tanto into the pits.

435
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:20,315  X1:238 X2:475 Y1:384 Y2:419
He hit the marks.

436
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:23,185  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:354 Y2:419
l know what you're doing, Carl.
lt's wrong.

437
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,758  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:380 Y2:419
They're changing the tires, refueling.

438
00:36:25,962 --> 00:36:29,523  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:354 Y2:419
I see no movement on the chassis,
no wing adjustments.

439
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:33,169  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:358 Y2:419
l'm not asking you to like this, Joe.
Just work with me.

440
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:40,106  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:354 Y2:419
In the meantime, the veteran
Brandenburg behind Bly.

441
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:45,441  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:356 Y2:419
That's gotta worry the young rookie.
One mistake, that's all it'll take.

442
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,711  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:356 Y2:419
-Hold. Hold, Joseph, hold.
-Come on, come on, damn!

443
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,989  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:419
Come on, Carl, let me out of here!

444
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:01,622  X1:139 X2:574 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bly in front, Brandenburg second.

445
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,526  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:382 Y2:419
Carl, l can't hold him off.

446
00:37:07,003 --> 00:37:10,131  X1:110 X2:604 Y1:380 Y2:419
Now, Joe. Go get that son ofa bitch.

447
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:14,401  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
They release Tanto,
and he roars out of the pit!

448
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:17,808  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:354 Y2:419
I don't know what
Carl Henry and his team were thinking.

449
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:21,643  X1:159 X2:565 Y1:354 Y2:419
Tanto's making a very fast exit
from the pit. Look at this!

450
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:26,550  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:354 Y2:419
Tanto slices in between
Bly and Brandenburg!

451
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:29,817  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:419
The offiicials aren't gonna
like that one.

452
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:34,595  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:354 Y2:419
Tanto has to allow Brandenburg
to pass him after a move like that.

453
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,100  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:380 Y2:419
One lap to go now.

454
00:37:41,204 --> 00:37:45,607  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:358 Y2:419
It's Bly and Brandenburg battling
it out in the last half-mile.

455
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,911  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:380 Y2:419
Brandenburg tries to the inside!

456
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,408  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:354 Y2:419
They come off the turn neck and neck.
Who's it gonna be?

457
00:37:58,288 --> 00:38:01,917  X1:189 X2:533 Y1:354 Y2:419
And here they come!
The checkered flag is out!

458
00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:07,627  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:358 Y2:419
It's Jimmy Bly,
the winner of this race!

459
00:38:09,065 --> 00:38:13,195  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:354 Y2:419
As they go around the track,
the checkered flag is flown, and....

460
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:15,598  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:380 Y2:419
Very good strategy, Carl. Thank you.

461
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:18,899  X1:157 X2:556 Y1:354 Y2:419
What a battle between
Jimmy Bly, Beau Brandenburg.

462
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:22,635  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:358 Y2:419
This time, the young rookie
took it to the veteran.

463
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,710  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:380 Y2:419
You did all right today, Joseph.

464
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:33,755  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:380 Y2:419
Don't ask me to do that again.

465
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:50,205  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:354 Y2:419
Jimmy, after four lackluster
performances, is Jimmy Bly back?

466
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:51,733  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:380 Y2:419
Well, l hope so.

467
00:38:57,347 --> 00:39:01,249  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:354 Y2:419
Everyone falls down.
lt's Just how fast you get up, right?

468
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:05,952  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:419
Beau, the win could be
called controversial.

469
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:08,988  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Well, a win is a win.
-So you won't protest?

470
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:14,260  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:354 Y2:419
No, but l will have some lunch.
Anyone wants to Join me?

471
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,394  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:380 Y2:419
Thank you.

472
00:39:19,402 --> 00:39:21,836  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:380 Y2:419
EnJoy. This won't happen again.

473
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,184  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy, want to talk later?

474
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:49,661  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:354 Y2:419
lf he wants to talk, he'll be
talking to me, okay? Come on.

475
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:59,036  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:354 Y2:419
lKnow how much you'll be worth if
you win? They'll buy you in sections.

476
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:02,302  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:354 Y2:419
Your eyes to a sunglass company,
your arm to a watch company.

477
00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:06,505  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:354 Y2:419
Your foot to a shoe company. Or maybe
you'd like to keep some parts.

478
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:10,345  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Come on, he Just finished racing.
-Hey, you're not here.

479
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:12,248  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:358 Y2:419
-DeMille.
-What?

480
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:14,347  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:380 Y2:419
What's so wrong with what she said?

481
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:16,985  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:380 Y2:419
Nothing.

482
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:21,188  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:380 Y2:419
Nothing.

483
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,989  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:380 Y2:419
What are you doing?

484
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,055  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Swimming.
-Swimming?

485
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:29,557  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:354 Y2:419
That's swimming to you, huh?
l don't think that's swimming.

486
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:31,461  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:380 Y2:419
That's a little beyond.

487
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:34,627  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:380 Y2:419
l've never seen anything like that.

488
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:38,796  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:354 Y2:419
Pretty fantastic.
Where'd you learn how to do that?

489
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:46,081  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:354 Y2:419
-l was raised by frogs.
-Raised by frogs?

490
00:41:53,189 --> 00:41:56,590  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Well, l'm glad you escaped.
-Oh, thank you.

491
00:41:58,194 --> 00:42:00,492  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy, what's on your mind?

492
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:07,102  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:419
-How does Beau do it?
-Do what?

493
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,969  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:380 Y2:419
Stay on top. Stay focused.

494
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:14,467  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:384 Y2:419
He drives scared.

495
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:18,441  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:354 Y2:419
No, l don't think so.
That guy is ice.

496
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:21,981  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:380 Y2:419
To you, he's ice. lnside he's scared.

497
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,452  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:354 Y2:419
But he likes it.
He says it makes him try harder.

498
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,084  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:354 Y2:419
He says the day he's not afraid
is the day he'll stop.

499
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:35,527  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:354 Y2:419
You're Just as good.
And the day you stop caring...

500
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:40,191  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:354 Y2:419
...what other people think and make
yourself happy, you'll be even better.

501
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:45,166  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:384 Y2:419
Come on.

502
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:01,822  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:358 Y2:419
Don't you ever stop running,
cold fish?

503
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:04,857  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:354 Y2:419
Block me again
and l'll put you into the wall.

504
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:07,359  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:380 Y2:419
Well, that's not gonna happen again.

505
00:43:08,431 --> 00:43:09,591  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:384 Y2:419
Believe me.

506
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,595  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What are you trying to prove?
-Got nothing to prove.

507
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:19,070  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:354 Y2:419
No, you proved you could do very
little with very much. Forget it.

508
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:21,903  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:354 Y2:419
Why do l waste my time
talking to this guy?

509
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:24,944  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:354 Y2:419
Because no one else
likes your arrogant ass.

510
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:29,543  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:354 Y2:419
-So that's it.
-That's it. Mystery solved.

511
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:35,351  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:354 Y2:419
While you're in this good mood,
do yourself a favor.

512
00:43:35,558 --> 00:43:37,924  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What?
-Take her back if she wants you.

513
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:41,153  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
Stay out of my business, Joe.
What are you doing?

514
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:44,060  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:354 Y2:419
l'm Just talking.
You do want her back, right?

515
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,997  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why do you care?

516
00:43:46,202 --> 00:43:49,865  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:354 Y2:419
You two have a lot of history.
That doesn't go away so fast.

517
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:53,405  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:354 Y2:419
-l pushed her away, Joe.
-But you weren't thinking right.

518
00:43:54,076 --> 00:43:56,101  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:380 Y2:419
l wasn't thinking at all.

519
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:01,180  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:380 Y2:419
You know, it's really hard when--

520
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:03,443  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:384 Y2:419
When l see her with him.

521
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:06,352  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:380 Y2:419
And l did it, you know?

522
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:09,848  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt was me. l'm responsible for it.

523
00:44:11,294 --> 00:44:13,660  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:384 Y2:419
You wanted to win no matter the cost.

524
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:17,424  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:356 Y2:419
-You want me to talk to her?
-No, Joe, don't do that.

525
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,396  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:358 Y2:419
You don't want either of us
to talk to her?

526
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:23,630  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:380 Y2:419
That's Just great.

527
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:33,478  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:354 Y2:419
Hey, Beau, if this is about pride,
you better forget it.

528
00:44:33,683 --> 00:44:38,086  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:354 Y2:419
-That's how the whole thing started.
-What would you do?

529
00:44:38,287 --> 00:44:41,313  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
Me? To get someone back
that l really love?

530
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:43,492  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:358 Y2:419
Get that rock out of my stomach?
Crawl.

531
00:44:43,693 --> 00:44:45,627  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:358 Y2:419
-You'd crawl?
-Crawl.

532
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:49,764  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You never crawl.
-l'd crawl till there's nothing left.

533
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:53,033  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:380 Y2:419
Come on, champ. Use your head.

534
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,494  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:062 Y2:101
Welcome to ESPN's coverage...

535
00:45:29,705 --> 00:45:32,731  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:062 Y2:127
...of the Twin Rings Race
qualifying section.

536
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,934  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:354 Y2:419
And we're live
from the Japan Motor Speedway...

537
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:39,706  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:354 Y2:419
...in front of 120,000
spectators today.

538
00:45:39,915 --> 00:45:43,612  X1:161 X2:552 Y1:354 Y2:419
Open wheel racing,
a very popular sport in Japan.

539
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,881  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:354 Y2:419
One day to the event,
and it's been a great day so far.

540
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:52,193  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:354 Y2:419
You should ask Jimmy how it is
to have the best manager.

541
00:45:52,395 --> 00:45:56,422  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:354 Y2:419
With the fiinal runjust completed,
the top fiive best times were:

542
00:45:56,632 --> 00:46:01,069  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg, Andretti, Gugelmin,
Montoya and Fittipaldi.

543
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:05,570  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:354 Y2:419
An interesting sideline: This year's
rookie point leader, Jimmy Bly...

544
00:46:05,775 --> 00:46:08,676  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:354 Y2:419
...only managing a tie
for 10th place.

545
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:16,047  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:354 Y2:419
Relax, dude, don't shove.
Hey, don't shove. We're friends.

546
00:46:16,252 --> 00:46:19,085  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy! Jimmy, why 10th today?

547
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:24,155  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:380 Y2:419
How come this never happens to me?

548
00:46:25,528 --> 00:46:26,517  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:380 Y2:419
All right!

549
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:09,004  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You seem preoccupied.
-l'm thinking about Jimmy.

550
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:13,164  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:354 Y2:419
You know, Carl thinks he can't cut it.
l think he can. lt's Just--

551
00:47:13,376 --> 00:47:16,140  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:358 Y2:419
lt's tough to get close
to this kid. lt is.

552
00:47:16,345 --> 00:47:20,441  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:354 Y2:419
l think Carl cares more about
helping you than helping Jimmy.

553
00:47:20,649 --> 00:47:24,210  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You're way off.
-l can see in the way he looks at you.

554
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,686  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:354 Y2:419
l mean, with Jimmy it's business.
With you, it's personal.

555
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:58,043  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:354 Y2:419
Keep it steady, Jimmy.
Keep your eyes out of the mirror.

556
00:49:04,753 --> 00:49:10,055  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:354 Y2:419
With a steady drive, Beau Brandenburg
has managed to catch up to Jimmy Bly.

557
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:15,253  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:354 Y2:419
The veteran working both sides,
doing all he can to make Bly nervous.

558
00:49:15,464 --> 00:49:17,955  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:380 Y2:419
Don't let him intimidate you.

559
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:23,828  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:384 Y2:419
l don't know if l can do this.

560
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:29,533  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You should talk less and drive more.
-Looking great, Jimmy.

561
00:49:30,346 --> 00:49:34,339  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:358 Y2:419
Brandenburg knows every inch
of this racetrack.

562
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,713  X1:188 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:419
He moves inside ofBly,
lets him know he's there.

563
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:40,612  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:384 Y2:419
Let's take him down.

564
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:45,386  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:358 Y2:419
Now it looks like he's gonna try
him on the outside.

565
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,294  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:380 Y2:419
They're neck and neck!

566
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,170  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:354 Y2:419
He gets by!
Brandenburg is in the lead.

567
00:49:57,373 --> 00:50:00,570  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:354 Y2:419
That's some incredible driving
by Beau Brandenburg.

568
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:06,313  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly's teammate, Tanto, got Bly to
the front of the pack earlier today.

569
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:09,343  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:358 Y2:419
Jimmy, don't let him get to you.
Shake it off.

570
00:50:13,022 --> 00:50:16,014  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:354 Y2:419
-l'll get it back. l can get it back.
-Stay on him.

571
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:19,319  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:354 Y2:419
Now we'll see ifBly has learned
through this season.

572
00:50:19,528 --> 00:50:22,463  X1:105 X2:615 Y1:380 Y2:419
Can he come back and regain the lead?

573
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:27,700  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Bly will try it on the high side.
-Don't overdrive the car.

574
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:31,998  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:354 Y2:419
-The suspension's getting loose.
-Bly is looking everywhere:

575
00:50:32,207 --> 00:50:35,665  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:354 Y2:419
Inside, outside, high, low,
just nowhere to go.

576
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:37,846  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:384 Y2:419
Don't overdrive the car.

577
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:42,211  X1:205 X2:508 Y1:354 Y2:419
The rear is drifting.
Jimmy, keep it steady.

578
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:46,683  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:384 Y2:419
Don't overdrive the car.

579
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:55,162  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:384 Y2:419
Don't overdrive the car.

580
00:50:57,166 --> 00:51:00,397  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:419
They're in the fiinal lap.
This is it. Final turn.

581
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:05,233  X1:125 X2:588 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly still all over the place.
He's coming up around, going high.

582
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:08,137  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly's in trouble!
Bly's in serious trouble!

583
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:12,474  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:356 Y2:419
He's off to the gray stuff!
Oh, he slams into the wall!

584
00:51:19,388 --> 00:51:21,151  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:380 Y2:419
Oh, my God!

585
00:51:43,112 --> 00:51:45,273  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:380 Y2:419
Are you okay, Jimmy?

586
00:51:45,614 --> 00:51:49,675  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:356 Y2:419
Safety trucks are rolling.
The crowd on its feet, silent.

587
00:51:57,459 --> 00:52:01,418  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:354 Y2:419
We all await word on the fate
ofrookie driver, Jimmy Bly.

588
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:20,106  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:354 Y2:419
They pull him out from under the car.
He gives the crowd a wave.

589
00:52:20,315 --> 00:52:24,376  X1:158 X2:555 Y1:354 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly, after that
awesome accident, is all right.

590
00:52:24,586 --> 00:52:27,214  X1:159 X2:553 Y1:380 Y2:419
And the crowd responds to it.

591
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:30,213  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:384 Y2:419
What a waste.

592
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,267  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:062 Y2:127
It's my pleasure to welcome you
to glimpse into the future...

593
00:52:50,813 --> 00:52:53,976  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:062 Y2:122
...and the 1000 horsepower
extreme machines...

594
00:52:54,183 --> 00:52:56,447  X1:224 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:419
...that'll race us
into the millennium.

595
00:52:56,652 --> 00:53:00,816  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:354 Y2:419
Kindlyjoin me in welcoming
the power and the glory.

596
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:15,532  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:354 Y2:419
Well, Joe. Now what part of formal
didn't you understand?

597
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:17,137  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:384 Y2:419
Wait a minute.

598
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,670  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:354 Y2:419
Oh, my mistake, yeah.
l'm gonna go get a drink.

599
00:53:22,878 --> 00:53:24,778  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You look very nice.
-Thank you.

600
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,709  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Hey, rebel.
-Yeah.

601
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:28,075  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:380 Y2:419
What you got there?

602
00:53:28,283 --> 00:53:30,945  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:354 Y2:419
lt's something l want
to give Jimmy later.

603
00:53:31,353 --> 00:53:33,821  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:380 Y2:419
Be selective who you spend time with.

604
00:53:34,022 --> 00:53:37,116  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:354 Y2:419
Extend yourself.
These people make everything happen.

605
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:39,920  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:354 Y2:419
-He's right.
-You'll stay around, right?

606
00:53:40,129 --> 00:53:41,528  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:384 Y2:419
l'll be around.

607
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:45,026  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:354 Y2:419
You do know your way around,
don't you?

608
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:48,362  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:419
-l like your brother.
-l liked him first.

609
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,370  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:354 Y2:419
-DeMille?
-Nina. Exactly who l wanted to see.

610
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:55,801  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You look fantastic.
-Thank you.

611
00:53:56,145 --> 00:54:01,208  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:358 Y2:419
Earlier today you said that Jimmy
has to find it off the track.

612
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,551  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What'd you mean?
-Here we go with the questions.

613
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,382  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:380 Y2:419
Gotta find that quiet spot.

614
00:54:06,588 --> 00:54:10,319  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:354 Y2:419
lf your mind's not right,
you will get torn apart.

615
00:54:10,826 --> 00:54:14,728  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:354 Y2:419
So you better buckle up.
lt's gonna be a bumpy ride.

616
00:54:16,265 --> 00:54:19,393  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:384 Y2:419
l can't believe that line still works.

617
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:25,571  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:354 Y2:419
Now this is either very
unprofessional, or naive...

618
00:54:25,774 --> 00:54:29,175  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:358 Y2:419
...or she swallowed your bullshit
and loved the taste.

619
00:54:29,378 --> 00:54:33,212  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Where's Memo?
-Replacing you. Working his way down.

620
00:54:33,515 --> 00:54:37,747  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:354 Y2:419
Joe, if you don't get it by midnight,
you're probably not gonna get it.

621
00:54:38,387 --> 00:54:41,515  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:358 Y2:419
And even if you do,
l don't think it'll be worth it.

622
00:54:43,592 --> 00:54:45,389  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:384 Y2:419
Just an observation.

623
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:57,166  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:384 Y2:419
Excuse me.

624
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,730  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:380 Y2:419
You make any new friends?

625
00:54:59,942 --> 00:55:03,844  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:358 Y2:419
Like these people want to talk to me.
When the season's over....

626
00:55:04,046 --> 00:55:06,640  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What?
-l was thinking...

627
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:10,444  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:358 Y2:419
...maybe we could go someplace.
l've never even had a vacation.

628
00:55:11,486 --> 00:55:13,477  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Never?
-Never.

629
00:55:15,591 --> 00:55:18,458  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:419
No pressure, all right?
Just think about it.

630
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:21,286  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:380 Y2:419
Two minutes, please?

631
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:27,798  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:384 Y2:419
What a coincidence.

632
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,167  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:354 Y2:419
ls this a little experiment
for you or something?

633
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:37,478  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:354 Y2:419
Dark chapter you can tell
your friends about?

634
00:55:38,847 --> 00:55:41,407  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:380 Y2:419
Maybe you like being man-handled.

635
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,577  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:384 Y2:419
That l can understand.

636
00:55:43,785 --> 00:55:47,118  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:354 Y2:419
But it's the being dumped part
that's kind of a drag.

637
00:55:49,024 --> 00:55:52,084  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:380 Y2:419
So you were Just used and abused?

638
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,753  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:384 Y2:419
Was that attitude?

639
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:58,362  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:380 Y2:419
Saucy. Good for you.

640
00:56:01,937 --> 00:56:05,771  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:358 Y2:419
And next time l'm around, look at him.
He ain't over it.

641
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,608  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:380 Y2:419
Your mascara's running.

642
00:56:13,015 --> 00:56:14,539  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:384 Y2:419
That's cute.

643
00:56:16,685 --> 00:56:18,482  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:380 Y2:419
Stupid bitch.

644
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:22,848  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:358 Y2:419
-So, are you two enJoying the evening?
-l'll wait over there.

645
00:56:23,058 --> 00:56:26,323  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:354 Y2:419
lf you win a championship,
what would you do first?

646
00:56:26,828 --> 00:56:28,625  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:380 Y2:419
l don't know, really.

647
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:32,197  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:354 Y2:419
You've had some peaks
and valleys over the season.

648
00:56:32,401 --> 00:56:34,335  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:380 Y2:419
What have you learned?

649
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:37,766  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:354 Y2:419
What have you learned
that you never realized before?

650
00:56:37,973 --> 00:56:40,533  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:358 Y2:419
-That it's another world.
-Where air is rare.

651
00:56:40,742 --> 00:56:44,041  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:354 Y2:419
Your team can take it all
with a strong show in Germany.

652
00:56:44,246 --> 00:56:46,646  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:354 Y2:419
How do you prepare
for something like--?

653
00:56:46,848 --> 00:56:52,184  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:354 Y2:419
There you have it, James Bly obviously
very pensive about the upcoming race.

654
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:54,251  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Yeah, well--
-What's happening?

655
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:57,156  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What's it look like?
-Jimmy.

656
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,385  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:354 Y2:419
-You came with me.
-Maybe she'll leave with you...

657
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:03,393  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:354 Y2:419
...but what l have to say
you don't need to hear.

658
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:06,829  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:354 Y2:419
Just let him talk.
lt doesn't mean anything.

659
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:11,028  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:356 Y2:419
-Yes, it does mean something.
-What, Beau? What does it mean?

660
00:57:12,774 --> 00:57:15,368  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:354 Y2:419
We should probably Just go.
Sophia, let's go.

661
00:57:15,577 --> 00:57:17,738  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Don't do that.
-Don't do what?

662
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:21,507  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:354 Y2:419
-That's none of your business.
-Come on. What's going on?

663
00:57:21,717 --> 00:57:24,208  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:419
-lt's nothing, DeMille.
-Back off.

664
00:57:27,222 --> 00:57:29,884  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:354 Y2:419
Come with me for a second.
Can l talk to you?

665
00:57:30,092 --> 00:57:33,084  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:358 Y2:419
-You're doing this all wrong.
-l know.

666
00:57:33,729 --> 00:57:35,253  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:380 Y2:419
l do everything wrong.

667
00:57:35,464 --> 00:57:38,399  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Excuse us.
-l can't believe this is happening.

668
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:42,936  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:354 Y2:419
l don't want to spend
more time away from you.

669
00:57:44,406 --> 00:57:45,964  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:380 Y2:419
l miss you.

670
00:57:48,477 --> 00:57:49,910  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:380 Y2:419
l miss you too.

671
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:54,648  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Really?
-Yeah.

672
00:57:55,083 --> 00:58:00,350  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:354 Y2:419
Do not go over there. Trust me.
Jimmy, please. Calm down, calm down.

673
00:58:00,555 --> 00:58:05,117  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:354 Y2:419
Don't blow this. Not over her.
This is not eighth-grade prom.

674
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:07,795  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:354 Y2:419
How you act,
these things are important.

675
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,425  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Jesus Christ!
-He's giving her a ring.

676
00:58:10,632 --> 00:58:12,793  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:419
-That's not good.
-Please take it back.

677
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:17,461  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:358 Y2:419
Whatever it is, you can deal
with it later. This is not the time.

678
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:20,238  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:384 Y2:419
Just work with me on this.

679
00:58:20,475 --> 00:58:21,737  X1:299 X2:416 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy.

680
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:27,242  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'm so sorry.

681
00:58:28,283 --> 00:58:30,877  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:380 Y2:419
Go. Just go.

682
00:58:32,954 --> 00:58:34,148  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:384 Y2:419
l don't--

683
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:37,083  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Let me explain it to you.
-Hey, you need--

684
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,458  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:380 Y2:419
Get away from me.

685
00:58:39,661 --> 00:58:41,629  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Play somewhere else.
-Just listen.

686
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,422  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Five minutes.
-Go away!

687
00:58:43,632 --> 00:58:45,600  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Jimmy.
-Don't push me, don't push me.

688
00:58:45,801 --> 00:58:47,132  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Go.
-Fine, fine, okay!

689
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:50,133  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Play your game somewhere else.
-Get the hell away from me.

690
00:59:06,788 --> 00:59:08,517  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:382 Y2:419
Move, move, move! Move!

691
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:36,299  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:380 Y2:419
l need backup!

692
01:00:40,115 --> 01:00:41,104  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:384 Y2:419
Pull over!

693
01:00:41,716 --> 01:00:43,240  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:380 Y2:419
Come on, Jimmy, pull over!

694
01:02:23,818 --> 01:02:25,547  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:380 Y2:419
Get away from me, man. Just--

695
01:02:25,754 --> 01:02:27,051  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:380 Y2:419
You want to go through me? Come on.

696
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:28,784  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:380 Y2:419
l want to fight him.

697
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:29,979  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:358 Y2:419
-For what?
-For what?

698
01:02:30,191 --> 01:02:31,180  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:384 Y2:419
You weren't there?

699
01:02:31,393 --> 01:02:33,759  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:354 Y2:419
What do you think he did,
take your woman away?

700
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,657  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why did l let him take her away?

701
01:02:35,864 --> 01:02:37,889  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:354 Y2:419
She was gone.
She was always gonna leave.

702
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:39,396  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:380 Y2:419
What do you know anyway?

703
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:41,728  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:354 Y2:419
Your brother puts so much
pressure on you...

704
01:02:41,936 --> 01:02:44,336  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:354 Y2:419
...you looked for an edge.
You figured she was it.

705
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:46,200  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why do you act like you care?

706
01:02:46,408 --> 01:02:48,399  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:354 Y2:419
l'm Just a thing to you,
part of the Job.

707
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:52,171  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:354 Y2:419
You pick up a check to help me out
since you didn't help yourself.

708
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,107  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why does that make you better?

709
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:55,977  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:354 Y2:419
lt doesn't.
Why did you take the car?

710
01:02:56,184 --> 01:02:57,446  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:380 Y2:419
l don't need to be pushed.

711
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:59,381  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Go on, say it.
-Forget this.

712
01:02:59,587 --> 01:03:03,523  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:354 Y2:419
You hoped this would get you thrown
out. You're looking for the exit.

713
01:03:03,725 --> 01:03:05,249  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:380 Y2:419
What are you talking about?

714
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,724  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:380 Y2:419
You don't know who you are anymore!

715
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:11,157  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:354 Y2:419
You think you've got to be perfect
or you're a failure.

716
01:03:11,366 --> 01:03:14,460  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:380 Y2:419
Well, forget that. Just forget it.

717
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:29,082  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:358 Y2:419
l was gonna give this to you
before all this went down.

718
01:03:29,584 --> 01:03:30,949  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:380 Y2:419
lmpressive, isn't it?

719
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:37,657  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What is it?
-lt's the first thing l ever won.

720
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:40,987  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:354 Y2:419
lt was probably the last time
l ever felt pure victory.

721
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:43,756  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:354 Y2:419
No pressure, nobody breathing
down my back.

722
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:45,956  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:358 Y2:419
Just driving because l loved it.
Pure.

723
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:49,762  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:354 Y2:419
That's where you've gotta get back to.
Doing it naturally, for you.

724
01:03:49,971 --> 01:03:53,236  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:354 Y2:419
l don't have your gift, but l do
have some things you don't have.

725
01:03:53,441 --> 01:03:56,808  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:354 Y2:419
l got will and l got faith.
Don't laugh, l'm serious.

726
01:03:57,779 --> 01:04:01,408  X1:138 X2:582 Y1:354 Y2:419
l believe that you can will yourself
into anything and do anything.

727
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:04,242  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:354 Y2:419
Having faith, that's like
believing in--

728
01:04:04,886 --> 01:04:07,514  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:354 Y2:419
That's like having a good disease,
it's contagious.

729
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:10,919  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:354 Y2:419
Hang with people that have it,
you're gonna catch it.

730
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:13,117  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:380 Y2:419
That'll change your attitude.

731
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:15,688  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:380 Y2:419
And winning is an attitude.

732
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:18,491  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:354 Y2:419
So if you trust me--
No, if you trust yourself...

733
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,726  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:354 Y2:419
...by this season's end,
you'll be on top or you won't.

734
01:04:21,936 --> 01:04:25,736  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:354 Y2:419
But l guarantee you're gonna know
what Jimmy Bly is made of.

735
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:41,781  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:354 Y2:419
Outside Chicago,
at the chicane it goes up...

736
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:44,788  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:354 Y2:419
...and comes down right where you
got Brandenburg--

737
01:04:44,993 --> 01:04:46,460  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:380 Y2:419
ls that when l dip down?

738
01:04:48,029 --> 01:04:49,326  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:380 Y2:419
Forget it.

739
01:04:49,831 --> 01:04:52,823  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:354 Y2:419
l'm tired of these spoons.
We play with spoons.

740
01:04:53,034 --> 01:04:55,229  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Say, ''Ah.''
-Ah.

741
01:04:55,403 --> 01:04:57,166  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:062 Y2:122
Welcome to Germany.
Home ofbeer...

742
01:04:58,506 --> 01:05:00,633  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:062 Y2:101
...the Autobahn and Beau Brandenburg.

743
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:05,004  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Qualifying begins tomorrow.
-With two races left...

744
01:05:05,213 --> 01:05:08,740  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:354 Y2:419
...Beau is leading in the race
for the world championship.

745
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,840  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly is in second.

746
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:15,489  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:354 Y2:419
Commissioner Gilson has slapped
Bly and teammate, Joe Tanto...

747
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,885  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:382 Y2:419
... with a $25,000 fiine...

748
01:05:18,092 --> 01:05:21,357  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:354 Y2:419
...for their recentjoyride
through downtown Chicago.

749
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:37,701  X1:189 X2:525 Y1:354 Y2:419
Doing great, Jimmy.
Keep pushing that speed.

750
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:43,107  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey.

751
01:05:43,418 --> 01:05:45,249  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:380 Y2:419
You don't need to talk to me anymore?

752
01:05:45,453 --> 01:05:48,479  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:354 Y2:419
-lt's not like that.
-Really? What is it like?

753
01:05:50,191 --> 01:05:52,751  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
All right, here you go. Jimmy.

754
01:06:37,071 --> 01:06:38,003  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:382 Y2:419
Three, two.

755
01:06:38,273 --> 01:06:40,036  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:062 Y2:126
One. Beautiful.
Come on, buddy.

756
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:45,574  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:354 Y2:419
Now, is he a hero, or is it hype?
What do you think?

757
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,513  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
What do you want me to say?

758
01:06:47,715 --> 01:06:48,739  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
l want to hear what you think!

759
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:51,748  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:354 Y2:419
Jimmy Just needs time
to develop, that's all.

760
01:06:51,953 --> 01:06:55,116  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:356 Y2:419
When he can get it together off
the track, he will on it.

761
01:06:55,323 --> 01:06:56,915  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:384 Y2:419
That's what l think.

762
01:06:57,692 --> 01:06:58,784  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:380 Y2:419
Like you got it together?

763
01:06:59,594 --> 01:07:02,461  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:358 Y2:419
You can help the kid off
the track more than on it.

764
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:05,998  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:354 Y2:419
You're not racing on Sunday.
l'm bringing Memo back.

765
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,384  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:354 Y2:419
Come here.
Joseph, over here.

766
01:07:11,756 --> 01:07:12,848  X1:323 X2:393 Y1:384 Y2:419
Sit.

767
01:07:13,425 --> 01:07:14,414  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:380 Y2:419
At my level.

768
01:07:16,461 --> 01:07:18,429  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's the moment of truth, my friend.

769
01:07:19,598 --> 01:07:22,658  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:354 Y2:419
lf he doesn't deliver
next time out, he goes.

770
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,770  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:380 Y2:419
Don't hate me, but you go with him.

771
01:07:28,373 --> 01:07:30,273  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:384 Y2:419
l'll come around here in Turn 7.

772
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:33,603  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:358 Y2:419
Driving off Brandenburg,
l'll fake outside.

773
01:07:33,812 --> 01:07:35,439  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:380 Y2:419
Eight's a tough place to pass.

774
01:07:35,647 --> 01:07:36,875  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'm gonna carry that speed...

775
01:07:37,082 --> 01:07:40,347  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:354 Y2:419
...bring it down the straightaway.
l have plenty of speed.

776
01:07:40,552 --> 01:07:41,644  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:384 Y2:419
lKind of flawless.

777
01:07:41,853 --> 01:07:44,413  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:358 Y2:419
You're not even paying attention.
Watch this.

778
01:07:44,623 --> 01:07:46,420  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:380 Y2:419
Show me again.

779
01:08:02,174 --> 01:08:03,300  X1:294 X2:422 Y1:062 Y2:098
Yes, sir.

780
01:08:03,508 --> 01:08:07,842  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:354 Y2:419
lf you find yourself in a position
to hold up traffic, do it.

781
01:08:08,313 --> 01:08:10,042  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:380 Y2:419
l don't want any front-running.

782
01:08:10,749 --> 01:08:12,341  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:384 Y2:419
You know the drill.

783
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:23,122  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Don't hurt yourself.
-l told you and l told you too.

784
01:08:25,664 --> 01:08:27,461  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:354 Y2:419
-What?
-l told you l'll return.

785
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:29,327  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:382 Y2:419
Here l am, returned.

786
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:31,901  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:384 Y2:419
Like the real Zorro.

787
01:08:32,337 --> 01:08:35,135  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:358 Y2:419
There's no helmet big enough
to hold that head.

788
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,898  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:384 Y2:419
There's so much love in here.

789
01:08:37,108 --> 01:08:39,167  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:354 Y2:419
You keep smiling,
your face is gonna crack.

790
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,013  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:354 Y2:419
Why shouldn't he smile?
He's got a lot to be happy about.

791
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,115  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:354 Y2:419
He's back where he belongs.
Right, baby?

792
01:08:47,652 --> 01:08:48,710  X1:316 X2:400 Y1:380 Y2:419
Yep.

793
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:51,214  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:384 Y2:419
Good?

794
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:53,081  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, you're so good.

795
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:55,282  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:380 Y2:419
You win this, yeah?

796
01:08:55,493 --> 01:08:57,154  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:380 Y2:419
You're gonna win.

797
01:08:58,363 --> 01:09:00,991  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:356 Y2:419
-Be safe, all right?
-You too, be safe.

798
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:27,120  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:062 Y2:122
This is the second to last race
of the season.

799
01:09:27,325 --> 01:09:30,158  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:354 Y2:419
And what an exciting one
itpromises to be.

800
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:35,731  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:384 Y2:419
The crowds are here.

801
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:40,200  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:354 Y2:419
It looks like there's a thunderstorm
maybe a mile from the track.

802
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:42,305  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:380 Y2:419
The rain threat hasn't dampened...

803
01:09:42,507 --> 01:09:45,499  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:354 Y2:419
...the spirits of this crowd
here in Germany.

804
01:09:51,383 --> 01:09:52,372  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:380 Y2:419
What do you want?

805
01:09:54,519 --> 01:09:55,679  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:380 Y2:419
Wanted to apologize.

806
01:09:56,554 --> 01:09:58,579  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:380 Y2:419
Apologize to yourself.

807
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:00,824  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:384 Y2:419
Let's race.

808
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:15,666  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:354 Y2:419
l want you to stay in your world
and don't get into his.

809
01:10:15,874 --> 01:10:18,399  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:354 Y2:419
You push him hard.
You get him thinking about you.

810
01:10:19,577 --> 01:10:21,511  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:380 Y2:419
And you're not thinking about him.

811
01:10:21,713 --> 01:10:22,702  X1:305 X2:410 Y1:384 Y2:419
Got it.

812
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:38,389  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:354 Y2:419
The skies are opening up
as the warm-up lap begins.

813
01:10:51,276 --> 01:10:52,402  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:380 Y2:419
How's Jimmy?

814
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:53,599  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:384 Y2:419
He's all there.

815
01:11:08,927 --> 01:11:11,293  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:380 Y2:419
We are racing in Germany.

816
01:11:11,496 --> 01:11:14,932  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:354 Y2:419
Beau Brandenburg is starting
in the pole position today.

817
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:25,005  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly is in second.

818
01:11:25,443 --> 01:11:29,436  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg moves out in front
on a course you can race in the rain.

819
01:11:29,647 --> 01:11:33,242  X1:206 X2:507 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brake tires are on
and they are at speed.

820
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:39,650  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:354 Y2:419
Memo Moreno is back, giving
Jimmy Bly help as his teammate.

821
01:11:39,858 --> 01:11:42,918  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:354 Y2:419
I'm sure Memo wants to make
his presence felt today.

822
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,526  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:380 Y2:419
Boy, he is on the fly.

823
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:47,960  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:380 Y2:419
It's like he has something to prove.

824
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:49,322  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:382 Y2:419
Good move, Memo.

825
01:11:50,535 --> 01:11:52,162  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:380 Y2:419
lKeep it steady.

826
01:11:52,937 --> 01:11:55,462  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:380 Y2:419
Somebody wants their Job back.

827
01:11:55,673 --> 01:11:59,632  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:358 Y2:419
I think Joe Tanto may want
to watch his back.

828
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:05,848  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:380 Y2:419
Somebody's spinning!

829
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,415  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:380 Y2:419
Kenny Brack, he's in trouble.

830
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:10,281  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:358 Y2:419
He's gonna go way back
in the fiield on that one.

831
01:12:10,488 --> 01:12:12,956  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:358 Y2:419
Back at the front
the battle continues.

832
01:12:15,994 --> 01:12:18,622  X1:212 X2:501 Y1:354 Y2:419
Look at Brandenburg.
He cuts offBly!

833
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,526  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:354 Y2:419
-He tries to take me out.
-Detach it. Hold your line.

834
01:12:21,866 --> 01:12:23,731  X1:227 X2:487 Y1:380 Y2:419
Ride his blind spot.

835
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:28,230  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:354 Y2:419
I will, Joe,
but I can't see a damn thing.

836
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,341  X1:136 X2:577 Y1:354 Y2:419
Neither can he.
Justpatience, my man. Patience.

837
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:54,256  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:380 Y2:419
Take him, Jimmy! Take him!

838
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:57,291  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly in second place.

839
01:12:57,502 --> 01:12:59,766  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:354 Y2:419
Putting the pressure
on Beau Brandenburg.

840
01:13:04,242 --> 01:13:05,231  X1:299 X2:418 Y1:384 Y2:419
Push it.

841
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:09,006  X1:268 X2:445 Y1:380 Y2:419
Here we go.

842
01:13:11,749 --> 01:13:14,582  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:419
Bly is gonna try to make
a move in the corner...

843
01:13:14,786 --> 01:13:17,254  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:358 Y2:419
...on Brandenburg on the outside.
He does it!

844
01:13:17,455 --> 01:13:19,184  X1:231 X2:483 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bly takes the lead.

845
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:21,925  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:384 Y2:419
Goddamn brilliant.

846
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:25,721  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:354 Y2:419
Car in trouble, spinning
on the wetpavement.

847
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:28,865  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Looks like Gidley.
-Oh, here comes Max Papis!

848
01:13:29,601 --> 01:13:30,966  X1:305 X2:414 Y1:384 Y2:419
Crash!

849
01:13:32,237 --> 01:13:36,333  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:354 Y2:419
Head on into that car!
Max Papis is airborne.

850
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:49,881  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:354 Y2:419
lf he takes it to the inside,
don't follow him, he's setting you up.

851
01:13:50,488 --> 01:13:52,979  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:358 Y2:419
In the hairpin, that fiight
for the lead continues.

852
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:54,783  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly has the lead now.

853
01:13:54,993 --> 01:13:57,484  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:380 Y2:419
Brandenburg wants it back.

854
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:03,698  X1:130 X2:583 Y1:380 Y2:419
Brandenburg goes to the high side.

855
01:14:04,035 --> 01:14:05,559  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:380 Y2:419
He gets by!

856
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,169  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:380 Y2:419
Brandenburg back to the lead.

857
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,501  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:380 Y2:419
lKeep going, he's putting on a show.

858
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:11,831  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:384 Y2:419
lt's a hell of a show.

859
01:14:13,044 --> 01:14:14,306  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:382 Y2:419
Yeah, hell of a show.

860
01:14:14,946 --> 01:14:18,609  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:354 Y2:419
Now Memo Moreno whips out
of the pack and passes Andretti.

861
01:14:18,816 --> 01:14:22,411  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:354 Y2:419
He's really trying to get up there
with Brandenburg and Bly.

862
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,746  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:380 Y2:419
Memo, what are you doing?

863
01:14:23,955 --> 01:14:25,320  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:384 Y2:419
l can almost touch him.

864
01:14:25,523 --> 01:14:27,013  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hold your position.

865
01:14:27,225 --> 01:14:28,317  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why? He's gonna win this.

866
01:14:29,127 --> 01:14:32,324  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:354 Y2:419
I'm sure Carl Henry is not
too happy with Moreno.

867
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:35,164  X1:145 X2:568 Y1:380 Y2:419
Now Bly wants to make a move.

868
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:37,424  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:354 Y2:419
Hold on, Memo Moreno
trying to make...

869
01:14:37,635 --> 01:14:40,627  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:358 Y2:419
...the same move on Jimmy Bly,
his teammate.

870
01:14:40,838 --> 01:14:43,363  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:380 Y2:419
Memo, no passing. Do you hear me?

871
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:44,935  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'm right there, Carl.

872
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:48,445  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:354 Y2:419
Lift off. Steady.
What are you doing?

873
01:14:49,113 --> 01:14:51,775  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:354 Y2:419
Moreno appears to have something
to prove here.

874
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:53,848  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:380 Y2:419
He gets alongside Bly again.

875
01:14:54,052 --> 01:14:55,383  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:382 Y2:419
Damn it, we went over this!

876
01:14:55,853 --> 01:14:56,842  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:384 Y2:419
Lift off!

877
01:14:58,523 --> 01:15:00,650  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:356 Y2:419
Lift off! You work for me.
l said, lift off.

878
01:15:00,858 --> 01:15:02,985  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:354 Y2:419
Why don't you let him drive?
Come on, baby.

879
01:15:03,194 --> 01:15:05,321  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Come on. Come on. Come on!
-Shut up!

880
01:15:08,733 --> 01:15:09,722  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:380 Y2:419
l've got to do this.

881
01:15:09,934 --> 01:15:12,801  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:354 Y2:419
With his teammate in the battle
for the championship...

882
01:15:13,004 --> 01:15:16,030  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:354 Y2:419
...Moreno decided to stick
his nose into this fiight.

883
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,298  X1:210 X2:503 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, Memo, back off.

884
01:15:17,508 --> 01:15:19,874  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:419
Only inches separate
these two cars.

885
01:15:20,078 --> 01:15:21,067  X1:194 X2:519 Y1:380 Y2:419
Memo, you're too close.

886
01:16:10,995 --> 01:16:13,259  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:354 Y2:419
What's going on here?
Bly is spinning.

887
01:16:13,898 --> 01:16:17,425  X1:126 X2:587 Y1:354 Y2:419
He gets it under control.
He's going backwards on the track.

888
01:16:17,902 --> 01:16:19,096  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy, what are you doing?

889
01:16:20,605 --> 01:16:22,402  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy, what the hell are you doing?

890
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,420  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:384 Y2:419
Memo?

891
01:16:58,976 --> 01:17:00,773  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:382 Y2:419
Get out! Oh, God!

892
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,909  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:380 Y2:419
We're getting chopper pictures.

893
01:17:04,115 --> 01:17:08,279  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:354 Y2:419
This is horrible.
The car is upside down.

894
01:17:08,486 --> 01:17:11,922  X1:161 X2:552 Y1:354 Y2:419
It's in a body of water.
Moreno is pinned underwater.

895
01:17:17,528 --> 01:17:19,120  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's okay, Memo. l'm here.

896
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:22,788  X1:104 X2:609 Y1:354 Y2:419
Beau, Memo crashed.
Jimmy went after him. You gotta help.

897
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,592  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:384 Y2:419
He went into the river at Turn 5.

898
01:17:24,802 --> 01:17:27,703  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:354 Y2:419
l'll get you out, Memo.
lt's gonna be okay.

899
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:33,810  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:354 Y2:419
-l'm on my way.
-Beau, what are you gonna do?

900
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:35,444  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:384 Y2:419
Please be careful.

901
01:17:37,115 --> 01:17:38,673  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:380 Y2:419
Oh, God! My foot!

902
01:17:40,218 --> 01:17:41,651  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:382 Y2:419
Oh, come on.

903
01:17:42,386 --> 01:17:44,980  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hang on, Memo! Hang on!

904
01:17:45,389 --> 01:17:47,118  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Help me!
-Get out!

905
01:17:47,825 --> 01:17:50,692  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:356 Y2:419
-Help me!
-Get out, now!

906
01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:52,958  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's gonna blow up!

907
01:17:54,932 --> 01:17:56,092  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hurry!

908
01:18:02,306 --> 01:18:05,833  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:354 Y2:419
We've got Bly and Brandenburg
to help a man in trouble.

909
01:18:06,344 --> 01:18:09,336  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:358 Y2:419
Rescue teams are on the way,
but the remote location...

910
01:18:09,547 --> 01:18:12,209  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:358 Y2:419
...of this crash makes
it diffiicult to reach them.

911
01:18:12,683 --> 01:18:15,709  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:380 Y2:419
Lift it up, higher. Lift it!

912
01:18:20,258 --> 01:18:23,227  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:419
Take a breath, Memo.
Come on. We're here.

913
01:18:23,895 --> 01:18:25,260  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:380 Y2:419
We're gonna get you out.

914
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:28,632  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:384 Y2:419
Now!

915
01:18:29,033 --> 01:18:30,432  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:382 Y2:419
Come on. One, two....

916
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:35,300  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:384 Y2:419
Get it over. Memo!

917
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,205  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:380 Y2:419
We got you, Memo.

918
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:40,869  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Come on, Memo.
-l can't move my leg!

919
01:18:41,546 --> 01:18:42,535  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:384 Y2:419
Come on.

920
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,077  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's gonna be okay.

921
01:18:44,282 --> 01:18:45,271  X1:239 X2:474 Y1:380 Y2:419
Fuel everywhere.

922
01:18:45,483 --> 01:18:49,010  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:358 Y2:419
They better get that driver
out of there and themselves too.

923
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,350  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:354 Y2:419
That fuel could ignite,
it could be floating on the water.

924
01:18:57,361 --> 01:18:58,760  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:384 Y2:419
Come on!

925
01:19:00,631 --> 01:19:01,791  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hurry up!

926
01:19:26,424 --> 01:19:28,255  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:380 Y2:419
That is horrifying.

927
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:30,222  X1:137 X2:576 Y1:380 Y2:419
I've never seen anything like that.

928
01:19:30,428 --> 01:19:32,623  X1:240 X2:473 Y1:384 Y2:419
It's unbelievable.

929
01:19:33,064 --> 01:19:36,830  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:354 Y2:419
Worried about the well-being
ofanother driver, another competitor.

930
01:19:37,668 --> 01:19:41,297  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:354 Y2:419
Goes to show the kind ofmen
they are, their true fabric.

931
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:44,338  X1:120 X2:593 Y1:380 Y2:419
But they worked as a team together.

932
01:19:47,612 --> 01:19:50,342  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:354 Y2:419
Oh, my God, look at that!
Are they okay?

933
01:19:50,548 --> 01:19:52,539  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:419
It looks like they are.
I think I see--

934
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,115  X1:242 X2:471 Y1:384 Y2:419
I see movement.

935
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:12,098  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:419
l can't move my legs.
l can't move them.

936
01:20:20,311 --> 01:20:21,608  X1:297 X2:420 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy?

937
01:20:21,812 --> 01:20:23,211  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy? You all right?

938
01:20:23,414 --> 01:20:24,244  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's Just my foot.

939
01:20:24,448 --> 01:20:26,973  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:354 Y2:419
You'll be fine.
You'll come through this fine.

940
01:20:27,184 --> 01:20:29,345  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:354 Y2:419
-How's Memo?
-Fine, they're looking after him.

941
01:20:42,566 --> 01:20:47,526  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:354 Y2:419
Our thoughts, ofcourse, with Memo
Moreno and his family at this point.

942
01:20:57,715 --> 01:20:59,205  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:380 Y2:419

943
01:20:59,684 --> 01:21:00,742  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, Joe.

944
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,844  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:384 Y2:419
How do l look?

945
01:21:05,156 --> 01:21:06,145  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:384 Y2:419
Never looked better.

946
01:21:09,327 --> 01:21:11,625  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Jimmy?
-Yeah?

947
01:21:12,363 --> 01:21:13,352  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey.

948
01:21:14,432 --> 01:21:15,990  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:384 Y2:419
Thanks.

949
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:19,092  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Memo, l'm sorry.
-You came back for me.

950
01:21:19,537 --> 01:21:21,368  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:380 Y2:419
Saved my life.

951
01:21:22,006 --> 01:21:23,132  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:384 Y2:419
We race.

952
01:21:23,874 --> 01:21:25,774  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:384 Y2:419
We take chances.

953
01:21:26,811 --> 01:21:28,073  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:384 Y2:419
l took this chance.

954
01:21:29,046 --> 01:21:30,536  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:384 Y2:419
So look at me.

955
01:21:32,249 --> 01:21:33,580  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:384 Y2:419
Look at me.

956
01:21:33,784 --> 01:21:35,274  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:380 Y2:419
Don't see you.

957
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,053  X1:294 X2:422 Y1:384 Y2:419
See me.

958
01:21:39,724 --> 01:21:41,749  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:384 Y2:419
One who made a mistake.

959
01:21:44,061 --> 01:21:45,358  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:384 Y2:419
That's all.

960
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:48,398  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:384 Y2:419
lt wasn't a mistake.

961
01:22:18,262 --> 01:22:19,752  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:380 Y2:419
How are you doing?

962
01:22:21,232 --> 01:22:22,563  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'm all right.

963
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,825  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:380 Y2:419
All right if l come in?

964
01:22:25,736 --> 01:22:26,930  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:384 Y2:419
Yeah.

965
01:22:31,008 --> 01:22:32,441  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:380 Y2:419
You tried to get him out.

966
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:34,099  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:380 Y2:419
So did you.

967
01:22:34,311 --> 01:22:35,437  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:384 Y2:419
You were there first.

968
01:22:36,414 --> 01:22:39,611  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:354 Y2:419
l mean, he almost got you killed
and you still tried.

969
01:22:40,184 --> 01:22:41,173  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:380 Y2:419
Anybody would've.

970
01:22:42,086 --> 01:22:43,280  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:380 Y2:419
Would they?

971
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:47,414  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:380 Y2:419
You're a good man, Jimmy.

972
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:51,652  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:354 Y2:419
l'm sorry, l didn't want to win
the championship this way.

973
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:53,719  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:380 Y2:419
See you.

974
01:23:29,567 --> 01:23:33,833  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:354 Y2:419
The old Joe Tanto had a couple
of attributes you should hold on to.

975
01:23:34,972 --> 01:23:36,803  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:380 Y2:419
Wasn't long ago you would've said:

976
01:23:37,007 --> 01:23:40,204  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:356 Y2:419
''There but for the grace
of God, it's not me.''

977
01:23:41,312 --> 01:23:44,679  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:380 Y2:419
Quietly taking your place in the pack.

978
01:23:45,382 --> 01:23:46,474  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:380 Y2:419
Where is that guy?

979
01:23:47,451 --> 01:23:48,850  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:380 Y2:419
Where has he gone?

980
01:23:49,787 --> 01:23:50,879  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:384 Y2:419
Who cares?

981
01:23:51,455 --> 01:23:52,615  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:384 Y2:419
l do.

982
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:53,983  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:384 Y2:419
l miss him.

983
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:03,058  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:354 Y2:419
You're the first to know
l'm terminating the kid's contract.

984
01:24:04,068 --> 01:24:06,832  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Why?
-l don't think he's the real deal.

985
01:24:07,905 --> 01:24:10,533  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:354 Y2:419
l don't think he's mentally
tough enough.

986
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:13,771  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:380 Y2:419
l don't think he's adult enough!

987
01:24:13,978 --> 01:24:15,741  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:384 Y2:419
Gets out of a car in a race.

988
01:24:15,946 --> 01:24:18,506  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Saved a man's life.
-l'm not here to debate!

989
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:23,349  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:354 Y2:419
l'm gonna go for Brandenburg.
Next year.

990
01:24:24,021 --> 01:24:26,581  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:419
-What are you doing?
-Whatever it takes to win.

991
01:24:27,558 --> 01:24:29,890  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:354 Y2:419
-His brother know?
-He's brokering the deal.

992
01:24:30,094 --> 01:24:31,425  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Don't do this.
-lt's done!

993
01:24:31,629 --> 01:24:33,290  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Then undo it.
-You suddenly care.

994
01:24:33,497 --> 01:24:35,829  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Don't kill him off!
-Don't kill him off?

995
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,063  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:380 Y2:419
l watched you kill yourself!

996
01:24:38,969 --> 01:24:42,700  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:354 Y2:419
You had everything,
and you threw it all away!

997
01:24:42,907 --> 01:24:45,876  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:384 Y2:419
And l had to sit there and watch!

998
01:24:46,677 --> 01:24:49,737  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:380 Y2:419
The slowest man in the fastest sport.

999
01:24:49,947 --> 01:24:54,782  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:354 Y2:419
l wake up every morning,
my legs are on fire.

1000
01:24:55,186 --> 01:24:59,247  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:354 Y2:419
l know l'm gonna have to sit
in this chair for the rest of the day.

1001
01:25:00,024 --> 01:25:03,926  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:354 Y2:419
But if they gave me one more chance,
l'd do it all over again.

1002
01:25:06,564 --> 01:25:07,758  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt ain't gonna happen.

1003
01:25:09,266 --> 01:25:13,930  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:380 Y2:419
We are all damaged.

1004
01:25:17,975 --> 01:25:19,943  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:380 Y2:419
l've got an excuse.

1005
01:25:20,844 --> 01:25:22,209  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:384 Y2:419
You don't.

1006
01:25:23,581 --> 01:25:24,878  X1:295 X2:424 Y1:380 Y2:419
Do you?

1007
01:25:57,114 --> 01:26:01,107  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:354 Y2:419
l want you to know that l know
about you going out to Brandenburg.

1008
01:26:07,057 --> 01:26:08,490  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:380 Y2:419
Where have you been?

1009
01:26:08,692 --> 01:26:10,182  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:380 Y2:419
Meeting after meeting.

1010
01:26:10,394 --> 01:26:12,157  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:380 Y2:419
l've got a dinner right now.

1011
01:26:12,363 --> 01:26:13,694  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:380 Y2:419
Catch you later?

1012
01:26:14,298 --> 01:26:16,493  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Yeah, l'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

1013
01:26:21,205 --> 01:26:22,194  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:384 Y2:419
Hello.

1014
01:26:22,973 --> 01:26:25,066  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy, it's Sophia.

1015
01:26:25,509 --> 01:26:26,635  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:380 Y2:419
ls everything okay?

1016
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:29,639  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:380 Y2:419
Something l have to tell you.

1017
01:26:36,053 --> 01:26:38,283  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:380 Y2:419
What restaurant did you pick?

1018
01:26:38,489 --> 01:26:42,255  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:354 Y2:419
Nina, you're in great hands.
You are going to love this place.

1019
01:26:42,459 --> 01:26:43,926  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:354 Y2:419
-DeMille.
-Jimmy.

1020
01:26:44,328 --> 01:26:46,990  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:354 Y2:419
What are you doing here?
l'll Just be a minute.

1021
01:26:49,433 --> 01:26:51,298  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:380 Y2:419
Please don't walk away from me.

1022
01:26:52,236 --> 01:26:53,362  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:380 Y2:419
Did you sell me out?

1023
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:55,629  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:380 Y2:419
Are you working for Brandenburg now?

1024
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,998  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:384 Y2:419
We should take this inside.

1025
01:26:58,208 --> 01:26:59,505  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why are you doing this to me?

1026
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:01,405  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:384 Y2:419
Wait a minute! Who sold out first?

1027
01:27:01,612 --> 01:27:04,080  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:380 Y2:419
l would never sell out my own brother.

1028
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:07,273  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:354 Y2:419
When you stopped listening
to me that's what you did.

1029
01:27:07,484 --> 01:27:09,111  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:380 Y2:419
l Just tried something different.

1030
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,185  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:354 Y2:419
For the first time
l thought for myself.

1031
01:27:11,388 --> 01:27:14,050  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Was that wrong?
-Shutting me out is different.

1032
01:27:14,258 --> 01:27:17,955  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:354 Y2:419
And l was with you all the way
until you handed your mind over...

1033
01:27:18,162 --> 01:27:20,858  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:354 Y2:419
...to that has-been.
Who got you here?

1034
01:27:21,065 --> 01:27:24,967  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:354 Y2:419
Who got all the glory? You couldn't
book a plane ticket without me.

1035
01:27:25,169 --> 01:27:27,933  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:354 Y2:419
You left me, and let me
tell you something:

1036
01:27:28,138 --> 01:27:29,867  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:354 Y2:419
There's no worse feeling
getting someone...

1037
01:27:30,074 --> 01:27:32,542  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:354 Y2:419
...to the top only
to have them drop you.

1038
01:27:32,743 --> 01:27:34,210  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:380 Y2:419
You did that, you.

1039
01:27:34,778 --> 01:27:36,746  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:380 Y2:419
Ten years, Jimmy!

1040
01:27:36,947 --> 01:27:38,471  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:384 Y2:419
All a waste.

1041
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:41,910  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:354 Y2:419
lt was coming together.
Why not wait a bit longer?

1042
01:27:42,119 --> 01:27:44,178  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:380 Y2:419
Because l'm not your goddamn waiter.

1043
01:27:44,388 --> 01:27:45,753  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:380 Y2:419
l was your manager.

1044
01:27:45,956 --> 01:27:49,289  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:358 Y2:419
And l deserve better than that.
l deserve much better!

1045
01:27:49,493 --> 01:27:53,554  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:354 Y2:419
Now you're over, and l am not going
down in flames with you, brother.

1046
01:27:54,398 --> 01:27:56,628  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:380 Y2:419
That's one trip you're taking alone.

1047
01:28:30,134 --> 01:28:33,228  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:062 Y2:126
Welcome to the Grand Prix.
It's a sunny day.

1048
01:28:34,638 --> 01:28:38,074  X1:169 X2:544 Y1:062 Y2:122
It's going to be a great race.
After an eventful season...

1049
01:28:38,275 --> 01:28:41,472  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:354 Y2:419
...this comes down
to championship time.

1050
01:28:48,352 --> 01:28:50,343  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:354 Y2:419
Everything's set.
Let's get this thing signed.

1051
01:28:50,554 --> 01:28:53,284  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:354 Y2:419
After the race it'll be a madhouse.
What do you say?

1052
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:54,957  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:380 Y2:419
Let's hear what she says.

1053
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:56,558  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:384 Y2:419
What's her idea?

1054
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,456  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:380 Y2:419
Her idea? What do you mean her idea?

1055
01:28:59,663 --> 01:29:01,153  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:384 Y2:419
How does it feel?

1056
01:29:01,365 --> 01:29:03,663  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:384 Y2:419
What? How does what feel?

1057
01:29:04,935 --> 01:29:06,402  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:384 Y2:419
To be used.

1058
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:08,763  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:380 Y2:419
What, l didn't treat you with manners?

1059
01:29:08,972 --> 01:29:10,997  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:380 Y2:419
You're gonna blow this over that?

1060
01:29:11,608 --> 01:29:15,135  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:354 Y2:419
What, do you want to hit me?
Would that make you feel better?

1061
01:29:16,346 --> 01:29:18,678  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Hurt?
-A little.

1062
01:29:19,783 --> 01:29:21,216  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:384 Y2:419
Didn't hurt.

1063
01:29:23,086 --> 01:29:24,246  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:380 Y2:419
Call that a punch?

1064
01:30:05,896 --> 01:30:06,885  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:380 Y2:419
Did you know?

1065
01:30:07,264 --> 01:30:09,459  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:354 Y2:419
-lKnow what?
-lKnow about my brother?

1066
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:10,997  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:382 Y2:419
Yeah, l knew.

1067
01:30:11,201 --> 01:30:12,691  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:384 Y2:419
You could've told me.

1068
01:30:13,103 --> 01:30:14,934  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:380 Y2:419
l hoped you could work things out.

1069
01:30:15,305 --> 01:30:16,533  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:380 Y2:419
He was right, you know.

1070
01:30:17,508 --> 01:30:18,873  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:380 Y2:419
Never booked a plane ticket.

1071
01:30:19,309 --> 01:30:23,803  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:354 Y2:419
Remember l said by the season's end
you're gonna know what you're made of?

1072
01:30:24,381 --> 01:30:25,939  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:384 Y2:419
lt's the end of the season.

1073
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,383  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's up to you.

1074
01:30:33,657 --> 01:30:35,249  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:380 Y2:419
Carl, you have to let me race.

1075
01:30:35,459 --> 01:30:36,483  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:384 Y2:419
l can win.

1076
01:30:36,693 --> 01:30:40,561  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:358 Y2:419
Any driver that can't get out of
the car in five seconds can't run.

1077
01:30:41,365 --> 01:30:43,094  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:358 Y2:419
Trying to prove you're
better than l think?

1078
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:45,428  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:384 Y2:419
Yeah.

1079
01:30:48,705 --> 01:30:49,694  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:384 Y2:419
Time him.

1080
01:31:07,558 --> 01:31:09,082  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:380 Y2:419
Ready?

1081
01:31:10,527 --> 01:31:11,687  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:384 Y2:419
Go!

1082
01:31:17,267 --> 01:31:19,292  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Four seconds.
-Great.

1083
01:31:20,537 --> 01:31:21,526  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:384 Y2:419
Not bad.

1084
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,308  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:384 Y2:419
Now the vertical test.

1085
01:31:26,176 --> 01:31:28,041  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:380 Y2:419
Carl, don't push it.

1086
01:31:28,245 --> 01:31:30,076  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:384 Y2:419
The vertical test.

1087
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:34,239  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:358 Y2:419
You Jump up and down
on the bad foot 10 times...

1088
01:31:34,451 --> 01:31:36,476  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:354 Y2:419
...to see if you can handle
the pressure.

1089
01:31:37,321 --> 01:31:39,812  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:380 Y2:419
Again, my rules.

1090
01:31:41,224 --> 01:31:42,282  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:380 Y2:419
Don't glare, Joe.

1091
01:31:43,226 --> 01:31:44,693  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:380 Y2:419
Makes your eyes look small.

1092
01:31:45,128 --> 01:31:46,993  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's all about commitment, right?

1093
01:31:47,598 --> 01:31:48,690  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Right.
-Right.

1094
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:51,494  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:380 Y2:419
All right, Jimmy. One.

1095
01:31:53,036 --> 01:31:54,503  X1:312 X2:403 Y1:384 Y2:419
Two.

1096
01:31:58,742 --> 01:31:59,902  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:384 Y2:419
Three.

1097
01:32:05,315 --> 01:32:06,373  X1:313 X2:403 Y1:384 Y2:419
Four.

1098
01:32:07,918 --> 01:32:09,010  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:384 Y2:419
Five. Come on.

1099
01:32:09,219 --> 01:32:11,346  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:419
Six. Come on, Jimmy.
Seven. Come on.

1100
01:32:11,555 --> 01:32:14,023  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:380 Y2:419
Eight. Nine. Ten.

1101
01:32:14,224 --> 01:32:15,555  X1:303 X2:413 Y1:358 Y2:419
-Yeah!
-Good.

1102
01:32:20,564 --> 01:32:23,124  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:419
Too bad you didn't try
that hard sooner.

1103
01:32:31,975 --> 01:32:33,670  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:380 Y2:419
There are 100 laps...

1104
01:32:33,877 --> 01:32:38,041  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:354 Y2:419
...200 miles between this race
and a champion.

1105
01:33:00,671 --> 01:33:02,036  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bye-bye, Daddy.

1106
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:06,342  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bye, Lucas.

1107
01:33:36,707 --> 01:33:39,801  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:354 Y2:419
Going into this race,
Brandenburg was thinking...

1108
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:42,171  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:354 Y2:419
...he was the winner
of the championship.

1109
01:33:42,379 --> 01:33:45,780  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:354 Y2:419
He was four points ahead,
and Bly looked out of the running.

1110
01:33:45,982 --> 01:33:49,042  X1:192 X2:531 Y1:354 Y2:419
We'vejust received word
that Bly will be driving...

1111
01:33:49,252 --> 01:33:53,552  X1:138 X2:575 Y1:354 Y2:419
... which is amazing news after
his injury he suffered in Germany.

1112
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:58,418  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:354 Y2:419
So as it stands,
if Jimmy Bly wins this race...

1113
01:33:58,628 --> 01:34:00,653  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:354 Y2:419
...he will become
the new world champion.

1114
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,289  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:380 Y2:419
So why'd you do it?

1115
01:34:06,036 --> 01:34:09,403  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:354 Y2:419
You helped me.
l thought maybe l could help you.

1116
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:15,635  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Well, l appreciate it.
-lt's okay.

1117
01:34:15,846 --> 01:34:17,313  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:380 Y2:419
Don't go too fast.

1118
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:22,680  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:380 Y2:419
Take care. Appreciate you coming.

1119
01:34:22,886 --> 01:34:24,945  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:380 Y2:419
Take care of yourself.

1120
01:34:25,155 --> 01:34:30,024  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:354 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly is a hero today, along with
Joe Tanto and Beau Brandenburg...

1121
01:34:30,227 --> 01:34:33,355  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:358 Y2:419
... who all got to the scene
ofMemo Moreno's crash...

1122
01:34:33,563 --> 01:34:36,896  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:358 Y2:419
... which had his car in the water.
He was about to drown.

1123
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,432  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:354 Y2:419
Theyjumped in,
got him out of the water...

1124
01:34:39,636 --> 01:34:43,197  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:358 Y2:419
...before a big explosion
consumed the entire area.

1125
01:34:44,908 --> 01:34:49,208  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:354 Y2:419
You know that if l lose this race,
l'm going to blame it on you.

1126
01:34:49,813 --> 01:34:51,610  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:384 Y2:419
That's what l'm here for.

1127
01:34:51,915 --> 01:34:53,246  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:380 Y2:419
l love you.

1128
01:34:53,683 --> 01:34:54,809  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:380 Y2:419
l love you too.

1129
01:36:18,501 --> 01:36:21,902  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:380 Y2:419
Gentlemen! Start your engines!

1130
01:36:25,275 --> 01:36:27,004  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:380 Y2:419
Let's look at the starting grid.

1131
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:29,405  X1:223 X2:491 Y1:354 Y2:419
Beau Brandenburg
in the pole position.

1132
01:36:29,613 --> 01:36:31,376  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:380 Y2:419
Gidley will be following him.

1133
01:36:32,482 --> 01:36:34,609  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:358 Y2:419
Joe Tanto in the Nextel car
starts 10th.

1134
01:36:36,753 --> 01:36:38,914  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly is starting
in the 26th pole position.

1135
01:36:39,122 --> 01:36:40,316  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:380 Y2:419
He didn't qualify today.

1136
01:36:40,523 --> 01:36:43,515  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:354 Y2:419
He's got 100 laps to catch
Beau Brandenburg...

1137
01:36:43,727 --> 01:36:46,093  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:354 Y2:419
...ifhe wants to become
world champion.

1138
01:37:12,188 --> 01:37:15,089  X1:195 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:419
We're off to a good start
here in Detroit.

1139
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:19,290  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:380 Y2:419
Brandenburg'sjumped out in front.

1140
01:37:19,496 --> 01:37:21,327  X1:297 X2:425 Y1:384 Y2:419
Trouble!

1141
01:37:31,508 --> 01:37:34,671  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:354 Y2:419
Tanto's caught in traffiic.
He doesn't have anyplace to go!

1142
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:40,814  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:354 Y2:419
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are under a yellow flag...

1143
01:37:41,017 --> 01:37:42,644  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:384 Y2:419
...until the cars can be removed.

1144
01:37:42,852 --> 01:37:45,946  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:354 Y2:419
Joe Tanto is in the pit
with a broken front wing.

1145
01:37:46,156 --> 01:37:47,851  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:380 Y2:419
What's the story on Tanto?

1146
01:37:48,058 --> 01:37:50,151  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:354 Y2:419
Tanto is out of it.
Don't worry about him.

1147
01:37:50,694 --> 01:37:52,161  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:384 Y2:419
Got it. That's too bad.

1148
01:37:52,595 --> 01:37:53,755  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:384 Y2:419
Come on. Come on!

1149
01:37:53,964 --> 01:37:57,764  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:354 Y2:419
Ladies and gentlemen,

1150
01:38:00,804 --> 01:38:02,032  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:380 Y2:419
Go, go, go!

1151
01:38:07,377 --> 01:38:11,245  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:354 Y2:419
A fastpit stop for the Nextel team,
but this unfortunate mishap...

1152
01:38:11,448 --> 01:38:13,712  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:354 Y2:419
...is going to drop Tanto
to lastplace...

1153
01:38:13,917 --> 01:38:16,818  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:354 Y2:419
...right behind his teammate,
Jimmy Bly.

1154
01:38:18,588 --> 01:38:20,112  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:380 Y2:419
So, Jimmy, what do you think?

1155
01:38:21,024 --> 01:38:22,423  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:380 Y2:419
lt's not looking too good.

1156
01:38:23,226 --> 01:38:24,215  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:380 Y2:419
We can work through this.

1157
01:38:24,761 --> 01:38:25,750  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:384 Y2:419
You think so?

1158
01:38:26,096 --> 01:38:28,428  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:354 Y2:419
l know we can
if we stay tight and close.

1159
01:38:28,832 --> 01:38:30,231  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:380 Y2:419
Okay. Let's do it.

1160
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,795  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:380 Y2:419
Green flag comes out again.

1161
01:38:38,541 --> 01:38:40,270  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'll take it right, you cut left.

1162
01:38:40,777 --> 01:38:43,769  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:354 Y2:419
Look at this amazing teamwork
between Bly and Tanto!

1163
01:38:44,647 --> 01:38:47,207  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, Joe, not bad for an old-timer.

1164
01:38:47,417 --> 01:38:49,385  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:380 Y2:419
That's it. Every man for himself.

1165
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:54,448  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:380 Y2:419
Hey, not so fast.

1166
01:38:56,726 --> 01:38:58,751  X1:194 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:419
Who wants to be in front
of the other?

1167
01:38:58,962 --> 01:39:00,395  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:380 Y2:419
What the hell are you two doing?

1168
01:39:01,097 --> 01:39:02,496  X1:229 X2:484 Y1:382 Y2:419
Back off, back off.

1169
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:04,291  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:384 Y2:419
Don't be afraid of me.

1170
01:39:04,501 --> 01:39:06,469  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
Why would l be afraid of you?

1171
01:39:06,669 --> 01:39:08,933  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:382 Y2:419
Carl, let Joe race his race.

1172
01:39:09,139 --> 01:39:10,572  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:380 Y2:419
Thanks, kid. l appreciate that.

1173
01:39:12,909 --> 01:39:15,776  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:358 Y2:419
Let's split them at the turn.
l'll take the inside.

1174
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:17,808  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:380 Y2:419
They split around another car!

1175
01:39:18,014 --> 01:39:20,608  X1:177 X2:536 Y1:354 Y2:419
As they battle,
it brings both cars forward.

1176
01:39:24,454 --> 01:39:25,944  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:380 Y2:419
Pass me on the left, Jimmy.

1177
01:39:29,192 --> 01:39:30,420  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:380 Y2:419
Way to go.

1178
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:34,057  X1:143 X2:578 Y1:358 Y2:419
Tanto and Bly are double-teaming
the entire fiield.

1179
01:39:34,264 --> 01:39:36,255  X1:122 X2:599 Y1:380 Y2:419
What an incredible display ofdriving!

1180
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:44,031  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Come on, don't stop now.
-Stopping? Who's stopping?

1181
01:39:46,209 --> 01:39:48,700  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:354 Y2:419
We are now halfway
to the checkered flag.

1182
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:50,979  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:380 Y2:419
Okay, Joe. Try to keep up.

1183
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:58,551  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:382 Y2:419
Still back there, Joe?

1184
01:39:58,755 --> 01:40:00,552  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:354 Y2:419
-l'm still here.
-l'm impressed.

1185
01:40:05,829 --> 01:40:08,730  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly passes and Tanto
is following suit.

1186
01:40:11,668 --> 01:40:15,866  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:354 Y2:419
With just 20 laps to go, Jimmy Bly
hasjust moved into seventh place...

1187
01:40:16,072 --> 01:40:18,540  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:356 Y2:419
...and teammate,
Joe Tanto, is in sixth.

1188
01:40:18,741 --> 01:40:19,833  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:380 Y2:419
Everybody's off the pace.

1189
01:40:20,043 --> 01:40:22,068  X1:209 X2:504 Y1:354 Y2:419
But Bly and Tanto
are coming on strong.

1190
01:40:22,278 --> 01:40:23,404  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:380 Y2:419
Brandenburg still leads.

1191
01:40:23,613 --> 01:40:27,049  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:354 Y2:419
In second place is Alex Barron.
Barron has an engine go!

1192
01:40:27,917 --> 01:40:30,385  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:380 Y2:419
Two cars swerving to miss the oil!

1193
01:40:30,587 --> 01:40:34,648  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:358 Y2:419
Car up over the wall!
Several cars involved!

1194
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:41,423  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:358 Y2:419
Here comes Jimmy Bly.
He closes on the accident.

1195
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:49,738  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bly has nowhere to go.

1196
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:01,277  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:358 Y2:419
Bly and Tanto fiind
themselves in second and third...

1197
01:41:01,484 --> 01:41:02,883  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:380 Y2:419
...behind Beau Brandenburg.

1198
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:07,283  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:358 Y2:419
The drivers will take advantage
of this full-course caution...

1199
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:11,290  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:358 Y2:419
...and enter the pits
for the last time this season.

1200
01:41:13,696 --> 01:41:18,292  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg, Bly and Tanto all are
completing very fastpit stops.

1201
01:41:19,869 --> 01:41:24,397  X1:126 X2:587 Y1:354 Y2:419
Now, with 10 laps to go,
Beau Brandenburg is in fiirstplace...

1202
01:41:24,607 --> 01:41:28,634  X1:154 X2:559 Y1:354 Y2:419
...Jimmy Bly is in second,
and Joe Tanto is in third place.

1203
01:41:30,747 --> 01:41:35,207  X1:117 X2:603 Y1:354 Y2:419
The world championship comes down
to these last 10 laps.

1204
01:41:38,788 --> 01:41:41,154  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:354 Y2:419
Jimmy, show them
what you're made of, kid.

1205
01:41:41,524 --> 01:41:42,786  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:380 Y2:419
Okay, Joe.

1206
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:44,485  X1:278 X2:442 Y1:380 Y2:419
Green flag!

1207
01:41:45,495 --> 01:41:46,757  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:380 Y2:419
We're back to racing!

1208
01:41:46,963 --> 01:41:49,329  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:354 Y2:419
It's a sprint to the fiinish
and championship.

1209
01:41:54,204 --> 01:41:57,833  X1:141 X2:572 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly is right on Brandenburg's tail.
He wants that championship.

1210
01:41:58,041 --> 01:42:00,236  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:380 Y2:419
Take him now. Make your move.

1211
01:42:01,644 --> 01:42:05,136  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:354 Y2:419
He comes alongside Brandenburg.
Brandenburg cuts him off!

1212
01:42:08,585 --> 01:42:09,916  X1:195 X2:518 Y1:380 Y2:419
Bly is gonna try it again.

1213
01:42:10,119 --> 01:42:12,519  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:354 Y2:419
He cuts and ducks inside!
Bly has the lead!

1214
01:42:12,722 --> 01:42:16,385  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:380 Y2:419
Jimmy Bly hasjust taken the lead.

1215
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:20,488  X1:179 X2:534 Y1:358 Y2:419
Bly gets past Brandenburg.
He's in the lead.

1216
01:42:20,697 --> 01:42:23,063  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:380 Y2:419
Great driving by Bly.

1217
01:42:25,168 --> 01:42:27,602  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg won't let Bly
get away that easily.

1218
01:42:27,804 --> 01:42:29,704  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:380 Y2:419
l'll pull him back in. There's time.

1219
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,474  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg is putting
pressure on Bly.

1220
01:42:33,676 --> 01:42:34,802  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:382 Y2:419
Don't overreach, kid.

1221
01:42:35,011 --> 01:42:38,003  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:354 Y2:419
Just four laps to go and you are
the world champion.

1222
01:42:39,349 --> 01:42:40,873  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:380 Y2:419
He's losing it.

1223
01:42:42,051 --> 01:42:42,949  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:380 Y2:419
Come on, Jimmy!

1224
01:42:43,152 --> 01:42:46,883  X1:179 X2:534 Y1:358 Y2:419
Bly may be in trouble.
He weaves back and forth.

1225
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:50,218  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:354 Y2:419
Brandenburg is right there,
ready to getpast him.

1226
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:59,893  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:380 Y2:419
And Brandenburg goes to the lead!

1227
01:43:07,543 --> 01:43:08,737  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:384 Y2:419
Nice while it lasted.

1228
01:43:10,313 --> 01:43:12,907  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:354 Y2:419
Bly loses the lead
with three laps to go.

1229
01:43:13,116 --> 01:43:14,276  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:384 Y2:419
He tried.

1230
01:43:14,484 --> 01:43:18,921  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:354 Y2:419
This is something we've seen
this young rookie do so many times.

1231
01:43:19,122 --> 01:43:22,023  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:354 Y2:419
Carl Henry has got
to be disappointed.

1232
01:43:27,497 --> 01:43:30,159  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:419
-What is he doing?
-Jesus.

1233
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:31,858  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:384 Y2:419
He's back.

1234
01:43:35,571 --> 01:43:39,507  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:354 Y2:419
Now, Joe Tanto making a move.
He comes up alongside Jimmy Bly.

1235
01:43:39,709 --> 01:43:42,473  X1:138 X2:575 Y1:380 Y2:419
He passes him! Tanto to second.

1236
01:43:43,212 --> 01:43:45,203  X1:165 X2:557 Y1:358 Y2:419
They're shoving and elbowing
each other.

1237
01:43:45,581 --> 01:43:48,550  X1:191 X2:522 Y1:356 Y2:419
Brandenburg, Tanto, Bly.
One, two, three.

1238
01:43:54,924 --> 01:43:56,892  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:380 Y2:419
We've got one lap to go.

1239
01:43:57,093 --> 01:43:58,253  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:384 Y2:419
Let's do it.

1240
01:44:10,373 --> 01:44:13,865  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:384 Y2:419
Joe Tanto has taken the lead!

1241
01:44:14,077 --> 01:44:15,408  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:384 Y2:419
Unbelievable.

1242
01:44:16,779 --> 01:44:18,440  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:384 Y2:419
lt's incredible. l can't believe it.

1243
01:44:18,648 --> 01:44:21,014  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:380 Y2:419
Butproblems with Tanto's car!

1244
01:44:21,217 --> 01:44:22,878  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:384 Y2:419
Tanto's in trouble.

1245
01:44:24,587 --> 01:44:25,576  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:380 Y2:419
Will it hold together?

1246
01:44:26,422 --> 01:44:27,548  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:380 Y2:419
No, not for long.

1247
01:44:27,757 --> 01:44:29,224  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:354 Y2:419
-Hang on, Joe.
-Stay in there.

1248
01:44:29,425 --> 01:44:32,792  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:354 Y2:419
What's he doing? He ought
to park it but he stays in front!

1249
01:44:33,262 --> 01:44:35,662  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:354 Y2:419
l can't hold it together!
Take it, Jimmy!

1250
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:40,296  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:380 Y2:419
They split him!

1251
01:44:40,737 --> 01:44:41,761  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:380 Y2:419
He's lifting off!

1252
01:44:41,971 --> 01:44:43,939  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:384 Y2:419
l see that. He had it!

1253
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:48,839  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:354 Y2:419
Tanto has removed himself from
the race, leaving Brandenburg and Bly.

1254
01:44:49,278 --> 01:44:53,442  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:354 Y2:419
Neck and neck down the homestretch,
battling for the world championship.

1255
01:45:11,134 --> 01:45:15,036  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:354 Y2:419
Jimmy, just drive because you
love it. Drive for pure victory.

1256
01:45:21,677 --> 01:45:23,201  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:380 Y2:419
He's humming.

1257
01:45:26,916 --> 01:45:28,144  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:380 Y2:419
Thanks for going, Jimmy.

1258
01:45:28,484 --> 01:45:30,748  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:380 Y2:419
Pure victory. You're right there.

1259
01:45:32,855 --> 01:45:36,848  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:354 Y2:419
Suddenly, Jimmy Bly seems
to have a renewed vigor.

1260
01:45:43,733 --> 01:45:45,223  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:384 Y2:419

1262
01:45:48,271 --> 01:45:50,637  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:354 Y2:419
