Besides, I made my own deal.

You're the one who taught me,
never miss an opportunity.

What's he talking about?

1110
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:07,722
I'm talking about supply and demand.

1111
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,601
WICKED wants all the Immunes
they can get.

1112
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,965
I help provide that for them.

1113

So I lure the kids in...

they get drunk, they have a good time.

1115
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,128
And then, later, WICKED comes in...

Though I must admit...

1226
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,485
I was worried they'd kill you
after what you did.

1227
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:35,805
What I did?

1228

1238
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,808
Thomas, come on.

1239
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,323
I need to get some blood from you.

1240
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,926
In the beginning, we were lost.

1241
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,167
All we knew for sure...

1242
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,722
was that the younger you were,
the stronger your chances.

1243
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,210
You worked for WICKED?

1244
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,688
Long time ago.

1245
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,681
You know, at first,
we had the best intentions.

1246
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,681
Find a cure, save the world.

1247
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,686
It was clear you kids were the key,
because you were immune.

1248
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,851
But why?

1249
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,288
Eventually, we found an answer.

1250
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,525
An enzyme produced
by the brains of the immune.

1251
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,091
Once separated from the bloodstream...

1252
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:10,687
it can serve as a powerful agent
to slow the spread of the virus.

1253
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,927
So, you found a cure?

1254
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,805
Not exactly.

1255
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:21,609
The enzyme can't be manufactured,
only harvested from the immune.

1256
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,600
The young.

1257
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,727
Of course, that didn't stop WICKED.

1258
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,927
If they had their way...

1259
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,970
they'd sacrifice an entire generation.

1260
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,805
All for this.

1261
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,251

A few months maybe.

She was a beautiful woman.

And before WICKED, she was all I had.

1323
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,689
When she got sick,
I didn't know what to do.

1324
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:27,324
I just kept her locked up. Hidden.

1325
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,523
I thought she'd get better.

1326
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,807
Every night, she'd make
these awful sounds, like screaming.

1327
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,322
And then, one night, she just stopped.

1328
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,330
She was finally quiet.

1329

1331
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:58,122
But she was just sat there, calm.

1332
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,850
She said she was feeling better.

1333
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,491
The visions were gone.
She'd taken care of them.

Wait, what's going on?

1424
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,561
She's with them.

1425
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:06,801
Since when?

1426
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:11,244
Teresa's always had an evolved
appreciation of the greater good.

1427
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:16,167
Once we restored her memories,
it was only a matter of time.

I had no choice. This is the only way.

We have to find a cure.

1432

She's right.
This is all just a means to an end.
