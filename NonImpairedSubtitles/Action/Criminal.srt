Excuse me.

Hello. How are you, Sir?

12
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:19,776
Last week, my wife forgot here
a brown bag leather.

13
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:24,884
We only have one thing in black colour, Sir.
- ...Will be very disappointed.

Right. Thank you very much.

It depends ..Jilly.

What are you wearing?

21
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:08,708
Lingerie. Same thing I always wear
when I pick up Emma from school.

22
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,309
That's why the good grades you get.

- Listen, I gotta go. I will call you later.

earlier. Send a cleaning team now.

This is not the cement Factory.

We use this to be canon.

65

A nasty way to
push them towards their doom.

105

Jericho Stuart. He is a malefice
more than half his life.

106

He has no impulse control.
No sense of proportion.

107
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:58,666
He is unable to calculate the potential
negative consequences of his actions.

You can't punish someone if he does
not know that he was doing anything wrong.

Mr. Heimdahl, how do you respond
to these serious allegations?

153
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:58,461
Well! If these treasons to call out massive
corruption at the highest levels...

154
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:01,173
And to disclose political murders...

155
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,579
Yes, then I'm guilty.

156
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,934
But your allegations have
never been proven in court of Law.

Of course not. How could they be?

most powerful criminal enterprise.

160
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:23,340
Sir, to clarify, you are calling to
overthrow the Spanish government?

161
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:28,694
No, I called for overthrow of all governments.
Politicians, religious fanatics...

162
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:35,135
Brainwashing by corporations, the corruption
of the banking system, gone... gone.

163
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:38,506
Washington, Berlin
will be great cemeteries.

164
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,897
And only then will people understand that
there is a better way to run this world.

165
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:46,462
Thats what you really want.
A worldwide revolution.

166
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:49,486
Governments must fall.

167
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,542
I have one.
Elsa Miller, former German Special Forces.

168
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:59,195
One of the Heimdahl, Staff, you have to go.
Jericho Stuart is now landing.

169
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:05,521
AIR BASE RAF Lakenheath
SUFFOLK, ENGLAND

170
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:03,636
Billy still breathing?

171
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:08,373
Artificially breathing. The machine is
keeping his body alive. He has gone.

172
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:13,348
Do you See those diodes? They give
a micro charge their frontal lobes.

173
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,519
Although the brain is clinically dead,
charging active neurons one last time

174
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:20,316
and allows us to see
a map of your neural pattern.

175
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:22,723
What then transferred
to the other's head?

176
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:26,072
No... its not... not a transfer.
Jericho was chosen

177
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,260
because Stuart has syndrome frontal lobe.

178
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,700
A trauma to his brains as a child,
is incredibly rare. One in 10 millions.

179
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:37,075
His frontal lobe remains in an undeveloped
state. A hotbed of neural stem cells.

180
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:40,608
We stimulatee them with theta
waves duplicating the pattern.

181
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,972
You might have done this work?

182
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:47,506
The subjects rats walked staight through
mazes. Thats what they had never seen before.

183
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,496
Rats?

184
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:51,395
What about human trials?

185
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,155
You are looking at it.

186
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,079
What happened to that other guy?

187
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:36,955
<i>Drilling begins.</i>

188
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:55,929
<i>Receiver Port ready for insertion.</i>

189
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,794
<i>Fiber optic wand is ready for insertion.</i>

190
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:19,530
<i>Theta Waves are activated.</i>

191
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:27,056
<i>Neural cell stimulation commenced.</i>

192
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,211
Test Theta.

193
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,422
Oh! The temperature is hiking.

194
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:52,571
Before bleeding, it's in 102. 104.

195
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,534
Calls back... stroke 104 sir.

196
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:57,242
What is going on?
We're losing him.

197
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,325
We have to stop bleeding or he will die.

198
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,914
Alright, we remove the robotic injector...

199
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,925
Hey! You pull that thing.

200
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,181
You, carry on.

201
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,610
You think... still we can't.

202
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:16,478
Carry on.

203
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:26,622
It is stabilizing.

204
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,640
What we tell his wife?

205
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:00,532
Nothing.

206
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:05,511
As far as she knows,
Billy died ten days ago.

207
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,875
That is not right.

208
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:13,005
Now if he comes from nothing like Billy.

209
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:14,973
Like Billy.

210
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:50,560
Jericho?

211
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:52,692
Jericho?

212
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,584
Jericho.

213
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:04,984
Jericho.

214
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:10,500
Jericho take it easy.
Everything is fine.

215
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:13,074
My head...
I've just gave you an injection.

216
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:15,764
It will take effect in a minute.
You will feel better.

217
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,981
You swear God?
I swear. You trust me.

218
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:22,304
Ok. Everybody out.
No no no .. there is a protocol ..

219
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:25,177
No, No, you stay.
Everybody else, come on!

220
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:36,128
Hey, Hey, Look at me, Look at me.
Do you know who I am?

221
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,924
My .. My head is bad,
I need some kind of pill.

222
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,310
Yes, no, I love in getting thing.

223
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,660
But first I need you to remember.

224
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:48,498
Remember what? What's your name?

225
00:24:50,877 --> 00:24:52,113
- My name?
- Your name.

226
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,129
Your name is Bill Pope.

227
00:24:57,702 --> 00:24:59,469
Why, you messing with me boss?

228
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,710
I'm sick, doc.
I need some kind of shock..

229
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:05,366
I need something.
Its okay. Nobody...

230
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,107
Only you can help.

231
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:13,868
Your name is Bill Pope.
Even you may tell your office is in CIA.

232
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,257
Intelligence?

233
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:18,707
Hum.. Fuck ...What the fuck?

234
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,787
- Pay attention.
- What did you do to me?

235
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,801
- Pay... What did you do to me?
- Pay attention!

236
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:27,175
Right, Jan Strook
Dutch programmer, a genius.

237
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,940
He sold trapdoors to Heimdahl.
I need water.

238
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,407
That's better.

239
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,563
Now, a few days ago...

240
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:42,801
The Dutchman dug a
wormhole in the deep web.

241
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:45,492
You can stop there and give me
a moment with him to hear me.

242
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:47,482
For me this is the theta major
brain surgery...

243
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:50,072
he is not able to tell you anything...
Oh!

244
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:53,732
Suddenly the Dutchman
has got command under his control.

245
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,453
He can fire missiles at anytime, anywhere.

246
00:25:56,591 --> 00:26:02,169
If... over his head,
So the Dutchman calls you, Bill Pope.

247
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,095
He needed protection
Offered to make a deal...

248
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:08,805
With you, Bill Pope.
I need something, please.

249
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,419
An aspirin. I beg...
Give him an aspirin.

250
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,925
Aspirin is not good for you.
But this will help.

251
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:22,971
Billy, we had orders to put it
in the Dutchman's head.

252
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:25,426
But you forced the game off,
because you thought

253
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:28,455
you could trust him by paying him on.
Remember?

254
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:33,261
Billy!... With, we did it your way.
You brought him to such a safe house.

255
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:36,341
Remember? Anything? Billy!

256
00:26:39,872 --> 00:26:44,136
Where is he? Where the Dutchman right now?
That's all we need to know.

257
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,838
You went back to him.
You had picked up the money.

258
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:49,203
You without action went
back to close the deal.

259
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,375
Remember? Remember?

260
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,206
I remember nothing, Fucker.

261
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,208
Me confused with somebody else.

262
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:11,878
Try family.

263
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,169
Your daughter's name? Come on.
Remembers it. What is her name?

264
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:22,025
Emma. Your wife Jilly? Jill?

265
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,108
Come on. Shit. You remember.
Something. Anything.

266
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:32,591
We have nothing.
The science behind it is good.

267
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:35,495
Shit, Fuck it Science.

268
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:39,676
How long have you worked on this?
18 years.

269
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:43,218
We want a refund.

270
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:47,124
Pack up these trials. Yes, sir.

271
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:53,181
<b>Jan Stroop ALIAS The Dutchman.</b>

272
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,548
Guys, we're back to square one.
We start from the beginning.

273
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:16,313
Charlie, put the Dutchman's video.
Yes, sir.

274
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,170
What a fucking mess.
My name is Jan Strook.

275
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:23,097
My Cyber name is Dutchman.

276
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:26,803
I am now the Sole administrator
of Vigilant Shield..

277
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:31,331
The emergency command and control
systems of the United States...

278
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:35,847
I can authorize and
activate any weapons system in its arsenal.

279
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,731
And I can overwrite any standing order.

280
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:42,829
I will sell wormhole back to you.

281
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:48,286
For asylum, a permanent passport, guaranteed
protection and ten million dollars.

282
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:54,748
Turn it off. Let us think about this...
Heimdahl have safe house here.

283
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:59,476
The luggage stores is here. So somewhere
between those two points, the Dutchman is.

284
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:01,596
But where?

285
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:08,387
Hotel, hostel? The homeless shelters
already checked. So what the hell is?

286
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,148
You're not listening to me.

287
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,558
- Hello.
- Bill Pope, please.

288
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,540
Who is this?
An old friend, Jan Strook.

289
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,228
- Is he there?
- Billy...

290
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:22,808
My husband is dead.

291
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:29,863
Hello?

292
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,662
Can I have a minute, guys?

293
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,163
Open your mouth.

294
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:08,878
Its a vasodilator to increase
the blood circulation...

295
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:10,882
and reduce the pressure
inside your head.

296
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:17,590
Thanks Doc. You release me now?

297
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,944
You take care yourself.

298
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:24,857
Okay!

299
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:30,978
Who loves?
$ 4.20. Number eleven, order ready.

300
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,880
Hey! Hey! Hey!... Hey!

301
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:46,488
Gun? You are funny.

302
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:48,958
It's not worth it.

303
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:52,585
Who is that guy?

304
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,107
What's wrong with your face?

305
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,884
- I'll take your van.
- What?

306
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:11,845
What did you say?
I said I take you Van.

307
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:14,647
Ht is saying that he
will take our van.

308
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,739
What? He can get the hiccups.

309
00:37:16,883 --> 00:37:19,553
You heard him, and now get out.

310
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,363
Come on, get out.

311
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:27,772
What happens?

312
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:30,770
What is happening here?

313
00:37:32,408 --> 00:37:34,818
My leg, dirty bastard.

314
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:35,859
Martin.

315
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:51,955
You fucking...

316
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:09,567
- Who is this guy?
- I'm cold.

317
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:10,054
Where is the money, Jill?

318
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,029
No, the big bag of money.

319
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:19,141
- Billy's bag.
- I do not know.

320
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:21,890
Please.

321
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:29,403
Do not make me hurt you.

322
00:44:31,283 --> 00:44:34,553
Please you can take whatever you want.
Yah! No wish I have...

323
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:45,879
You have changed the PIN.
The PIN code 6969.

324
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,150
Yah! I know stuff.

325
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:14,121
SILENT ALARM

326
00:45:16,195 --> 00:45:18,168
A silent alarm from the Pope's house.

327
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:47,196
Security code, please.
Alpha, 2365.

328
00:45:47,793 --> 00:45:51,349
Emma must have pressed the button
by mistake, guys. Sorry, I will restart.

329
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:19,394
It's okay. Where you are going?
Is it okay? It's okay!

330
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,902
Mama is with you.
There's someone in the house.

331
00:47:01,376 --> 00:47:06,895
My name is Jan, Jan Strook.
My cyber name is Dutchman.

332
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:10,725
I am now the sole administrator
Vigilant Shield.

333
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:14,251
The emergency command and control
systems of the United States.

334
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:20,953
I brought you in. I made my partner.
I treated you like my son...

335
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:23,319
And you betrayed me.

336
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:28,621
I am seeking cede control
to an irresponsible authority.

337
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:32,884
The Americans have fucked me and
now they want to kill me.

338
00:47:32,908 --> 00:47:36,477
<i>I will find and rip it to get
your heart out, you understand?</i>

339
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:40,504
The anarchist Heimdhal is chasing me and...
I can not let...

340
00:47:40,604 --> 00:47:44,144
tracing.. fuck and getting..
Because I'm not crazy.

341
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:51,625
Jan. Please come back.
Come back home. To the cause.

342
00:47:57,707 --> 00:48:02,988
I asked for asylum in Russian Federation.
And a permanent passport.

343
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:08,302
I want a better deal and a bodyguard.
Guaranteed protection and ten million $.

344
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:11,511
It's not about the money,
but my freedom.

345
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:15,701
I will demonstrate my control over
Vigilant Shield today at 6 PM.

346
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:21,174
<b>Nine hours to deadline.</b>

347
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:23,125
Understood.

348
00:48:26,663 --> 00:48:30,430
We'll wait for deadline.
Let's see what the Dutch can do.

349
00:48:32,057 --> 00:48:33,262
Jilian called the police.

350
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:36,397
They have a description
of the intruder.

351
00:48:37,095 --> 00:48:40,304
It looks like Jericho, she
told he knew personal details.

352
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,672
PIN number, security code.
You're kidding me.

353
00:48:44,169 --> 00:48:47,694
I talked to him.
He recognized my voice and knew my name.

354
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,681
That's fucked up.

355
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:56,558
The lab report just came back.
They confirmed that three passengers.

356
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:59,163
The two were officers in the vehicle.

357
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:02,436
But the third passenger in
the car was not Jericho.

358
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:07,866
Then I have to find him.

359
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:20,970
Here we go - You
change trash for cash.

360
00:49:38,907 --> 00:49:41,706
Come on. I'm hungry.

361
00:50:01,246 --> 00:50:05,436
Hello, I want this and vanilla...
Hello, Francoise.

362
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:11,122
Hello.
A grapefruit, Suikerbol and a macchiato.

363
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:15,115
- Coming.
- What did I just say?

364
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:21,596
Pamplemousse, Grapefruit, Suikerbol and coffee.
- Pampa-Mooo!

365
00:50:24,116 --> 00:50:30,588
I am speaking Spanish.
It's French, Mother fucker.

366
00:50:36,108 --> 00:50:37,312
I do not think we've met.

367
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,508
Anybody else? Anybody else?

368
00:50:45,089 --> 00:50:48,288
Call the police... Oh!...

369
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:52,099
You can not get fists world, you animal!
Anybody else?

370
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:55,612
We'll talk about after coffee.
Fuck it. Macchiato

371
00:50:55,712 --> 00:50:59,557
I think you broke my nose... Oh! Forever.
No!

372
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:03,129
- You are alright?
- Oh! No, no... you are alright.

373
00:51:37,709 --> 00:51:42,939
Hey! Do Georgia Wall books here?

374
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:47,705
- There's a queue, sir, if you do not mind.
- That's right, and I'm the lips sweet face.

375
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:51,195
Maybe you can tell me
where is this...

376
00:51:56,061 --> 00:52:01,209
Fourth floor Section 41.
Fourth floor! Fourth floor!

377
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:04,045
Sorry.

378
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:39,601
This is not right. Where's the bag Billy?
Where's the bag?

379
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:45,110
God!

380
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:52,516
Guys, someone logged in as Billy.

381
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,925
Some must be Jericho.

382
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:03,362
- Lock it.
- No... leave him.

383
00:53:04,189 --> 00:53:07,846
- I want to see what he is searching for?
- I can not get into the account..

384
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:12,105
What is the access point?
Terminal one in Public Librariy..

385
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:27,318
- It is this. This one.
- Okay.

386
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:33,259
It looks like he accessed our
telephone tracking software.

387
00:53:35,594 --> 00:53:36,958
Dr. Franks.

388
00:53:40,298 --> 00:53:44,026
Hello - it is Quaker.
Jericho is on his way...

389
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:47,070
We have your location, do not hang up.
Do you understand me?

390
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:50,274
- Do not hang up.
- I understand.

391
00:54:02,746 --> 00:54:06,056
What's up, doc?
I need more of these pills.

392
00:54:06,758 --> 00:54:11,405
Without those pills Bill Pope
makes my head broken inside.

393
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:13,869
You remember? I remeber. My fuck ..
Breaks my skull in two...

394
00:54:14,065 --> 00:54:16,677
My head bursts apart
just like yours...

395
00:54:16,701 --> 00:54:20,451
Unless you find out how you can
help me. Yes. Yes. Ofcourse.

396
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:25,284
Where to? Do not say
I do not hear anything.

397
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:28,643
Pharmacy, near the down road.
Good.

398
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:32,349
Let us go.

399
00:54:47,198 --> 00:54:49,166
Hello, Dr. Franks.

400
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:59,175
Hey! Hey! Just hurry up, yes.
That was mean, I'm sorry.

401
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:06,531
Do you hear that? I'm sorry. As Billy
talking not me Yah! He fucked up my name.

402
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:09,323
Billy Pope's personality is
affecting your behavior.

403
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:12,786
And a damn know about Billy, I know
nothing about that. All I know is that...

404
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:16,190
I'm living this. I can do stuff.
It was you, Alright!

405
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:18,290
Do not want to put stuff in
my head, I try to...

406
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:21,453
You have skills.
That's right, I do math now.

407
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:24,457
I talk languages, I know what
I want and I do what I want.

408
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:26,254
Everything is different. I am grand new.

409
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:28,575
Memories are chronological?
I do not know.

410
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,704
They are triggered by things...
I say, I smell.

411
00:55:30,804 --> 00:55:34,948
I use sometimes things just emerge.
I just need one of those pills.

412
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:36,416
All I need is...

413
00:55:38,249 --> 00:55:40,242
All I need is one pill.

414
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:46,355
Jericho! You recognize Billy's responses?
What about places, touch, smell?

415
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:50,499
What about emotions?
Yah! I met his wife and child.

416
00:55:50,595 --> 00:55:52,457
- And?
- And...

417
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:57,817
There was something.
What do you mean something?

418
00:55:58,036 --> 00:56:02,204
People always told me I
did not feel anything... this and that.

419
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:07,000
I don't know.. talking family still.
I can not... I can not do this.

420
00:56:07,098 --> 00:56:07,809
Shove.

421
00:56:16,588 --> 00:56:17,743
What about now?

422
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:22,678
Now you messed me up.
For making you better.

423
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:24,463
These are called emotions.

424
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:31,027
Whatever they are, they are not useful to
me - You do not mean much without them.

425
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:36,806
Thanks for the pills, Doc.

426
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:42,693
I need some tests from you
before the process begins to fade..

427
00:56:44,241 --> 00:56:45,410
Disappear?

428
00:56:52,324 --> 00:56:57,437
How much time do I have?
48 hours, I do not know.

429
00:56:58,263 --> 00:57:00,205
Maybe I can make it longer.

430
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:02,873
Then I'd better go right now.
I have things to do.

431
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:04,804
Make money to find. Money?

432
00:57:05,003 --> 00:57:09,264
Yes, a big bag full money.
- What will you do with money, when you find it?

433
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:16,631
I don't know.
Buy .. Buy a house you know!

434
00:57:17,173 --> 00:57:22,556
A TV. One vacation like other people, right!
- Of course.

435
00:57:24,856 --> 00:57:26,090
Take what you owe.

436
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,993
- On the house, sir.
- Cheers.

437
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:32,031
Who says now Cheers?

438
00:57:57,925 --> 00:57:59,917
Ruiza, you still have 20 pounds
for Arsenal.

439
00:58:00,184 --> 00:58:01,967
I think it's fair if you pay me, right!

440
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:03,978
That's enough.

441
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:10,140
You remember everything, right?
Where is the Dutchman?

442
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:16,280
I do not know.
But I know how I have a single break.

443
00:58:45,017 --> 00:58:48,716
I do not know what you guys do, but
have stop beating him.

444
00:58:48,981 --> 00:58:50,171
Especially in the head.

445
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:54,353
Yah! I get the point.
But he is coming along.

446
00:58:54,612 --> 00:58:57,162
So who am I to do now?
Is it Bill Pope?

447
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,337
No, it's Jericho, influenced
by Billy's memories...

448
00:59:01,786 --> 00:59:04,363
- Skills, routines.
- Routines?

449
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:05,555
Yah! Routines.

450
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,590
If routines. Basically what we do in life
I is reduced to subconscious routines.

451
00:59:08,614 --> 00:59:12,647
It is these things that make the
leap of Bill Pope to Jericho.

452
00:59:13,085 --> 00:59:15,687
He makes it with money.
A bag which is driving him.

453
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:18,038
Offer that money.
And he will give you everything you want.

454
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:20,285
Take him to the last
place you had to Dutch.

455
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:23,053
Trigger memories of Billy
Pope and follow the trail.

456
00:59:23,253 --> 00:59:25,275
A source from the Lubyanka
Square just gave it to us.

457
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:27,822
The Dutchman wants to make
a deal with the Russians.

458
00:59:27,922 --> 00:59:30,193
He is going to give
proof today at 6 PM.

459
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:34,005
Did you hear that? We're fucked.

460
00:59:34,105 --> 00:59:38,934
Becaused, you wanted a psychopath finish
that instead of a hero from SEAL things.

461
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:49,324
<b>Three hours until the deadline.</b>

462
01:00:11,531 --> 01:00:14,594
The ransom money... in the bag.

463
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:17,604
You take us to the
Dutchman and it is yours.

464
01:00:20,498 --> 01:00:21,538
Do we have a deal?

465
01:00:25,103 --> 01:00:26,286
Do we have a deal?

466
01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:36,725
That! That!

467
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,690
Yah! The beach.

468
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:44,675
That too. I want to go there.

469
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:51,490
Okay! Okay! You... you can go to the beach.
Now, We have a deal?

470
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,818
Yah!

471
01:01:02,573 --> 01:01:03,887
- Don't shoot.
- Don't shoot..

472
01:01:06,294 --> 01:01:07,183
Stop! Down.

473
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,533
Only you can put out as spy.

474
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:17,340
The Dutchman, where is he?
And the money is yours.

475
01:01:18,556 --> 01:01:21,190
- Wher is money?
- Corner.

476
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,224
I will get there.
And the picture.

477
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:47,528
Which way, Jericho?

478
01:01:58,964 --> 01:02:01,014
- Right.
- Right.

479
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,595
<i>Airport London.</i>

480
01:02:30,836 --> 01:02:34,063
Sir, the facial recognition
system just detect a red alert.

481
01:02:34,637 --> 01:02:37,318
Pull over. Stop.

482
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:47,219
Put the convicted waiting and send it home.
That's it!

483
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:51,626
The Dutch has been right
in the city airport MI5...

484
01:02:51,826 --> 01:02:52,982
We have to go.

485
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:59,179
Hey, hey! My money.
Hey, what about my money?

486
01:04:02,527 --> 01:04:05,714
Elsa, he is yours now.
I need him alive.

487
01:04:08,869 --> 01:04:10,122
I'm afraid it's not your man.

488
01:04:29,853 --> 01:04:33,101
- I'm wounded.
- Give me the gun.

489
01:04:44,354 --> 01:04:45,717
Don't kill.

490
01:05:57,601 --> 01:06:01,160
Sir! A team of drivers
searching Jericho's body.

491
01:06:02,907 --> 01:06:04,564
What a fucked mess.

492
01:06:05,563 --> 01:06:07,979
The Russians can not be
allowed to make the buy.

493
01:06:08,946 --> 01:06:13,508
Check their embassy. Anything in,
anything out will be filtered, clear!

494
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:14,480
Yes Sir!

495
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,157
Heimdahl bastard that of
our aims from the start.

496
01:06:17,888 --> 01:06:21,422
I want new pass
codes, new firewalls...

497
01:06:21,993 --> 01:06:25,816
Switch to military channels, understand?
Yes, Sir.

498
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,813
<b>One hour to deadline </b>.

499
01:06:32,713 --> 01:06:35,713
<i>Today, Cannon
Bridge, were fired.</i>

500
01:06:36,213 --> 01:06:39,710
<i>Several people were
seriously injured.</i>

501
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:44,413
The authorities still searching for
bodies fell into the River Thames.

502
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,364
I'm sorry that I lost it.

503
01:06:48,486 --> 01:06:51,136
- Maybe if I...
- If, if, if... if.

504
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:56,928
If you had kept closer to the Dutchman,
may be now we already had the wormhole.

505
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:04,528
I must say I'm not that
happy at the moment, Elsa.

506
01:07:05,836 --> 01:07:07,726
- Do you want me to leave?
- No.

507
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:15,085
I apologize.

508
01:07:16,926 --> 01:07:17,926
Good.

509
01:07:26,471 --> 01:07:28,333
We need to find Jericho.

510
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:23,094
Mommy, can I watch TV?
Sure, sweetie.

511
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,125
What are you doing in my basement?

512
01:09:26,644 --> 01:09:27,998
What is all this?

513
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:31,814
That belongs to Emma.

514
01:09:35,409 --> 01:09:36,738
Did you work with Billy?

515
01:09:37,655 --> 01:09:38,914
I do not think...

516
01:09:40,023 --> 01:09:43,074
Someone like him ever worked
with someone like me..

517
01:09:44,844 --> 01:09:48,008
They stuck Billy in my head.

518
01:09:48,993 --> 01:09:50,641
I have a scar, you see?

519
01:09:52,202 --> 01:09:57,350
All stuff he knew, all stuff he could do
I have mixed up inside me.

520
01:09:59,376 --> 01:10:00,564
That's impossible.

521
01:10:02,558 --> 01:10:04,606
The first car you too have bought...

522
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:11,105
Used Rover. Smelled like fish and
chips. The clutch marred the first week...

523
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:15,297
Of course I did not have
the $ 100 to fix it.

524
01:10:16,393 --> 01:10:20,810
I told you, they put his brain in me.
Thats enough.

525
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:25,937
Mom, where are you? I'm hungry.
Just a second, baby.

526
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,090
Sunday night.

527
01:10:31,312 --> 01:10:32,671
Chicken and waffles.

528
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:36,622
You doing the chicken, the waffles.

529
01:10:37,856 --> 01:10:40,667
I know she likes the syrup
in the bottom only.

530
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:46,943
I see pieces that pop up suddenly...

531
01:10:48,092 --> 01:10:49,400
At different places.

532
01:10:50,848 --> 01:10:51,995
I see things.

533
01:10:53,318 --> 01:10:55,151
Do not ask me how they did it, but...

534
01:10:57,196 --> 01:10:59,802
- They did.
- Why?

535
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:02,192
Aah!

536
01:11:02,937 --> 01:11:07,096
They're looking details of a place where
your husband hid a guy before he was killed.

537
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,618
Now, ..you to take care of.
I'll finish here.

538
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:28,057
I'll finish here and go away.
Leave me alone.

539
01:11:42,084 --> 01:11:45,368
Billy could never hurt
you, so can I?

540
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:48,141
<b>Off the coast of Portugal.</b>

541
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,614
<b>USS VIRGINIA SSN743.</b>

542
01:13:20,675 --> 01:13:22,692
Armed missile to port, sir.

543
01:13:23,447 --> 01:13:24,550
That's not possible.

544
01:13:24,624 --> 01:13:26,834
Guidance systems are to go.
Tracking system to go.

545
01:13:26,934 --> 01:13:27,837
Turn them off.

546
01:13:29,588 --> 01:13:31,320
I can not, we are blocked sir.

547
01:13:38,854 --> 01:13:41,505
Missile fired. I repeat, missile fired.

548
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:49,445
Send self-destruct code
before it reaches its target.

549
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:52,623
Alpha 30, Echo 40, Bravo Hotel.

550
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:56,016
Negative..., not responding.

551
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:15,063
It's good! It destroyed! It's good!

552
01:14:17,968 --> 01:14:21,053
Jesus Christ.
We do not fired that missile, sir.

553
01:14:39,696 --> 01:14:41,895
Did you know I lost my daddy?

554
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,688
Yah!

555
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:49,848
He gave me Ellie, for my birthday.

556
01:14:52,316 --> 01:14:54,713
If we do not dig deeper,
its trunk sticking out.

557
01:14:55,466 --> 01:14:56,466
Do deeper.

558
01:15:01,846 --> 01:15:02,886
Are you hurt?

559
01:15:12,784 --> 01:15:13,784
Stop.

560
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,627
Emma, come here please!

561
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:19,615
No mommy, we bury Ellie.
Come here.

562
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,727
He said he was a friend of daddy.

563
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,644
Go away, please.

564
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:31,213
Can you stay for dinner? He is nice.

565
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:33,722
Emma, go inside.

566
01:15:42,576 --> 01:15:44,195
I make waffles and then I go.

567
01:16:04,049 --> 01:16:05,065
Come and play.

568
01:16:05,643 --> 01:16:07,890
- What?
- Come play.

569
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:13,625
- I do not know.
- I'll teach you.

570
01:16:18,316 --> 01:16:22,039
I do not know if this is a good idea.
Fine. Come on.

571
01:16:26,244 --> 01:16:27,244
Come on.

572
01:16:33,536 --> 01:16:35,655
Just put your hands well.

573
01:16:37,647 --> 01:16:38,953
Put your hand there and touch.

574
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:40,699
And then you do...

575
01:16:47,602 --> 01:16:48,602
That's okay.

576
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:03,814
That's good and again.

577
01:17:08,687 --> 01:17:12,953
Emma, it's late.
It's time to go to bed.

578
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:15,672
Yes, Mommy. Good night, Jericho.

579
01:17:18,172 --> 01:17:20,247
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, honey.

580
01:17:33,745 --> 01:17:34,809
Who are you?

581
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:40,428
I don't know.

582
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,864
Most of my life a number.

583
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,670
My brains do not always work well.

584
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,861
I have not always done well.

585
01:17:54,655 --> 01:17:56,869
Having your husband
in my head made me...

586
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:01,425
It made me feel things.
Knowing things.

587
01:18:03,187 --> 01:18:05,167
Right, wrong.

588
01:18:07,246 --> 01:18:10,588
I guess it does not matter.
The doctor says it will disappears soon.

589
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:15,151
Can you tell me what Billy felt?

590
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:20,341
Can you?

591
01:18:32,168 --> 01:18:33,332
That's too much!

592
01:18:33,532 --> 01:18:36,412
There was something funny
that Billy used to do.

593
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,657
That was our signal that he loved me.

594
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:45,376
I...

595
01:18:46,693 --> 01:18:49,535
I know... I Know.

596
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:54,685
I know with that what is supposed
to be in the night...

597
01:18:56,847 --> 01:18:59,415
But I never... Our wedding day.

598
01:19:00,751 --> 01:19:01,751
Do you remember?

599
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:05,221
Yes.

600
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:07,879
The beach.

601
01:19:08,299 --> 01:19:12,852
The first time you gave to Emma.
I was so happy.

602
01:19:13,654 --> 01:19:17,364
Yah!... I... I have...

603
01:19:18,734 --> 01:19:22,076
I... I feel it... I feel it.

604
01:19:28,945 --> 01:19:29,993
He loves you.

605
01:19:31,437 --> 01:19:32,643
So much.

606
01:19:41,088 --> 01:19:42,485
Where will you go now?

607
01:19:45,251 --> 01:19:46,926
I don't know. Where...

608
01:19:48,013 --> 01:19:49,687
Where ...he takes me.

609
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:55,636
Then stay here.
You can stay on the couch.

610
01:20:02,412 --> 01:20:05,006
It would not be the first
time on that couch.

611
01:20:12,336 --> 01:20:17,083
<i>Our Top Story: A mysterious missile was
launched off the coast of Portugal.</i>

612
01:20:17,195 --> 01:20:19,837
<i>The question is where did
the missile come from.</i>

613
01:20:27,099 --> 01:20:32,084
Good morning. I brought you some fresh coffee.
- Thanks.

614
01:20:37,408 --> 01:20:40,368
Do not worry about it.
It's okay.

615
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:45,950
Where the missile came from. We do
not know who will be held responsible.

616
01:20:57,747 --> 01:21:03,592
You work at the university. There is a cage
in the library. A bookcase with a key.

617
01:21:03,616 --> 01:21:07,097
Yes, there are rare books...
Billy and I used to go there sometimes..

618
01:21:07,244 --> 01:21:09,665
Why? Does this have something to do with...
Yes... Yes.

619
01:21:11,501 --> 01:21:14,532
Jilly. I need a car.

620
01:21:14,683 --> 01:21:16,883
And the key to the book.
Oh! Sure..

621
01:21:23,168 --> 01:21:26,462
We'll have Jill money, lots of money.

622
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:37,524
I wish I could keep him.

623
01:22:00,424 --> 01:22:04,168
Emma, come upstairs, please.
I am coming.

624
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,628
Come, You must take a shower.

625
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:10,700
Have you done down the door?
Yes.

626
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:26,313
Where is Jericho?

627
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:53,188
You're the guy, who killed me.

628
01:23:54,037 --> 01:23:55,323
Good memory.

629
01:23:56,246 --> 01:23:57,247
Yah!

630
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:04,523
If you hurt me, I'll do worse.

631
01:24:05,736 --> 01:24:07,140
I respect your belief.

632
01:24:08,839 --> 01:24:10,093
And you do well..

633
01:24:18,683 --> 01:24:19,689
On there.

634
01:24:39,732 --> 01:24:41,161
Sir, I have something.

635
01:24:41,688 --> 01:24:44,021
Akhmadov, Russian FSB operative.

636
01:24:44,633 --> 01:24:47,464
What makes arriving in a
fishing boat in Dagana?

637
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:51,394
It seems that is not stupid enough
to try it alone from the embassy.

638
01:24:52,002 --> 01:24:54,604
They are bringing a team to grab
and pick up the Dutchman!

639
01:24:54,755 --> 01:24:56,306
Put me in the air, now!

640
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:15,326
Stay in 1-11. They're
heading right toward us.

641
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:18,882
We follow the Russians.
They will lead us to the Dutchman.

642
01:25:23,596 --> 01:25:25,931
I do not particularly like children.

643
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:28,574
They never meet expectations.
Jericho.

644
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:31,112
Jericho! Help us, please.
Boarding.

645
01:25:31,312 --> 01:25:34,094
No!... Please!

646
01:25:35,508 --> 01:25:41,771
Stop! .. No more violence
No more violence. Get him.

647
01:25:44,738 --> 01:25:46,240
Take me to the Dutchman.

648
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:51,747
He's in there.

649
01:26:03,544 --> 01:26:04,798
Let me see thermal images.

650
01:26:12,716 --> 01:26:17,089
The Russian team was in the other truck.
We follow them, navigate.

651
01:26:18,953 --> 01:26:24,169
All units, we are in a covert persecution
Do not approach. Understood.

652
01:26:33,597 --> 01:26:35,746
There, at the university.

653
01:26:36,494 --> 01:26:40,397
Do not approach until we see the Dutchman.
All units, they are not approachable.

654
01:26:50,953 --> 01:26:53,122
Let's go!

655
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:03,391
Team Snipers, what is your position?

656
01:27:03,582 --> 01:27:05,050
Sniper team on move.

657
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,544
Sir, we have Heimdahl and Jericho.
Follow me. Follow me.

658
01:27:24,644 --> 01:27:26,890
All units, come.
Disable the Russian team.

659
01:27:27,001 --> 01:27:28,719
We need Jericho alive.

660
01:27:41,983 --> 01:27:43,659
Your wife and child just died.

661
01:27:50,556 --> 01:27:52,112
Put this thing on the ground.

662
01:27:53,783 --> 01:27:56,461
Your man is not there. They do not have.
What do you mean?

663
01:27:56,552 --> 01:27:58,058
I just said they dion't have it.

664
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:03,451
I just told you. He's up there. Alright.
They do not have...

665
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:11,511
I'll go. Go to the airfield.
You need to get out of here.

666
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:13,806
Get to Dutch. I'll see you there.

667
01:28:23,206 --> 01:28:24,306
CHEMISTRY LAB

668
01:28:24,393 --> 01:28:26,639

- Over here.

669
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:29,467
Jillians office.

670
01:28:35,705 --> 01:28:36,705
Where is he?

671
01:28:37,769 --> 01:28:39,277
In the corner office.

Get out.

675
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:46,633
Don't kill me.
- Shut up, you do not know me, but I know you.

676
01:29:46,776 --> 01:29:51,449
You and Pope have made a deal.
He's dead, but he is making it good.

677
01:29:54,124 --> 01:29:55,172
That's your money.

678
01:29:56,668 --> 01:29:57,700
Your passport.

679
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:11,513
Passport.

680
01:30:11,608 --> 01:30:15,866
The wormhole. Where is it?
It's still in my computer.

681
01:30:15,992 --> 01:30:17,199
- Set it now.
- No problem.

682
01:30:21,297 --> 01:30:25,390
Do exactly what I tell and maybe
live to spend all this money.

683
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:38,965
You're a fucking genius.

684
01:30:42,124 --> 01:30:45,330
This is some thing of crazy .. here..

685
01:30:45,616 --> 01:30:49,479
Live by the sword, Die by the sword.
Brilliant.

686
01:30:55,094 --> 01:30:57,365
Give me the flash drive.
I'll give you what you want.

687
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,941
Come on, do not make me wait.
Yah! Yah! Flash drive.

688
01:31:01,888 --> 01:31:02,839
Thank you.

689
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:04,985
Fuck!

690
01:31:07,689 --> 01:31:10,197
- Fuck.
- Painful?

691
01:31:11,207 --> 01:31:15,585
Give to Heimdall
Vigilant Shield is fucking crazy.

692

<i>Elsa</i> - I got it, I'm on my way.

693
01:31:25,302 --> 01:31:29,000
The Dutchman and Jericho are dead.
<i>Good girl. I'll be waiting for you </i>.

LONDON UNIVERSITY

696
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:04,380
Do you need an ambulance, sir.
Wait here. I immediately send a nurse.

697
01:32:05,636 --> 01:32:06,935
Okay.

698
01:32:23,921 --> 01:32:24,929
Who is that?

699
01:32:39,238 --> 01:32:40,261
She's dead.

700
01:32:45,162 --> 01:32:49,368
Yes. Here. Take the computer.

701
01:32:49,559 --> 01:32:51,915
Have a Scan of her.
Stolen ambulance right outside.

702
01:32:52,103 --> 01:32:53,039
A wounded man took it.

703
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:55,518
Fits the description of Jericho.
Jericho ...started...

704
01:32:55,618 --> 01:32:56,464
On our way.

705
01:32:56,564 --> 01:32:57,246
Communicting in front of .. ambulance.

Elsa.
Does it sound to you like Elsa, Fucker.

707
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:08,067
Where is she?

708
01:33:08,136 --> 01:33:10,400
I ended up with it. She is dead.

709
01:33:10,575 --> 01:33:13,839
Fuck her. I have what you wanted.
This is what will happen.

710
01:33:13,935 --> 01:33:17,870
Are you dictating terms to me?
That's right, psycho.

711
01:33:18,496 --> 01:33:19,697
Get the little girl.

712
01:33:20,215 --> 01:33:26,001
I will send you instructions. You come
here and give me the flash drive...

713
01:33:26,723 --> 01:33:29,065
Or they die. Say something.

714
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,096
Jericho, help. He's seeking. Do something.
Hi.

715
01:33:32,207 --> 01:33:36,596
She will be the first, so her
mommy can watch. You understand?

716
01:33:37,101 --> 01:33:40,325
I'll fuck you up. I'll fuck you up.

717
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,539
Jericho! Jericho!

718
01:33:58,363 --> 01:34:04,112
Do not give him the USB flash drive, you understand
me? He destroys the earth. Do you hear me?

719
01:34:05,426 --> 01:34:09,199
I have it figured out.
Jericho, you have not been figured.

720
01:34:09,294 --> 01:34:12,685
You are here ...temporary.
You're not Bill Pope.

721
01:34:12,786 --> 01:34:16,961
He has a gun over her head.
He has a gun...

722
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:23,030
On the baby. I can not remember her name.
Emma.

723
01:34:23,509 --> 01:34:26,072
Her name is Emma.
Connect me with the ambulance radio.

724
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,350
You're on. Here he can hear you.
Jericho, Dr. Franks.

725
01:34:29,631 --> 01:34:33,584
I can undo implantation.
You can be normal.

726
01:34:33,638 --> 01:34:35,196
We need to do it now.

727
01:34:35,311 --> 01:34:38,562
Before it's gone, turn around
and come back to see me.

728
01:34:40,817 --> 01:34:41,902
What about Jill?

729
01:34:42,102 --> 01:34:45,203
Let somebody at stake.
There are more lives. We all will die.

730
01:34:45,485 --> 01:34:47,485
Let them, they do not matter.

731
01:34:48,588 --> 01:34:49,898
But it matters to me!

732
01:35:39,892 --> 01:35:40,995
A little closer.

733
01:36:06,282 --> 01:36:08,178
<i>Officer to the ground!
Officer to the ground!</i>

734
01:36:08,285 --> 01:36:10,243
<i>Medical units... hit the Gas tank.</i>

735
01:36:24,671 --> 01:36:27,393
He is getting close, so
let's get ready.

736
01:36:59,592 --> 01:37:01,164
Jericho.

737
01:37:18,619 --> 01:37:20,037
It has Emma!

738
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:31,317
Put it down.

739
01:37:34,358 --> 01:37:35,911
Put it down.

740
01:37:48,434 --> 01:37:49,717
Give me the flash drive.

741
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:07,756
Emma. Run.

742
01:38:41,905 --> 01:38:43,731
What are the coordinates down there?

743
01:38:44,429 --> 01:38:48,494
I have... reasons
to be new to them.

Yah! Yah!

Yah, the Dutchman is Fixed.

Heimdahls first shot.

01:40:08,408 --> 01:40:12,603
What it was, he tried
to steer around.

761
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:14,787
It comes back for him.

762
01:40:18,024 --> 01:40:19,826

"You hurt me.
I have to be worse."

Are you sure about this?
Yes, he has been responding.

768
01:41:51,091 --> 01:41:53,010
Maybe this despolete something.

769

Bill Pope remains here to stay.

You might not be remembering,
but I know you.

It's incredible, he remembers.

772
01:43:38,009 --> 01:43:40,015
Then relase him now He moves.

773
01:43:42,699 --> 01:43:44,845
I will give him offering a job.
