1
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:27,560
GSW.

2
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,399
That압 what the hospitals call it.

3
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:33,966
Gunshot wound.

4
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:38,203
Doctor has to report it
to the police.

5
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,537
That makes it hard
for guys in my line to get...

6
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,377
... ''quality health care. ''

7
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:54,549
Not many men know
what their life압 worth.

8
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:55,984
I do.

9
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,692
Seventy grand.
That압 what they took from me.

10
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:04,597
And that압 what
I was going to get back.

11
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,422
They say, ''Time heals all wounds. ''

12
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,691
You앇 think, after five months
of lying on my back...

13
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,069
...I앇 give up
any idea of getting even.

14
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,738
Just be a nice guy, call it a day.

15
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:49,738
Nice guys are fine. You got to have
someone to take advantage of.

16
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,914
But they always finish last.

17
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,888
Help a cripple.
Thank you, sir.

18
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:04,418
Help a Vietnam vet walk again.

19
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:09,223
Help a cripple.
Thank you, sir.

20
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,163
What the fuck you doing?
Get the fuck out!

21
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:14,960
Shut up. l cured you.

22
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,473
Cocksucker.

23
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:27,344
-What do l owe you?
-Two ninety-eight.

24
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:48,433
Son of a--
Hey, my cigarettes!

25
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,170
Sorry, sorry. Pardon me.

26
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:00,570
Thank you.

27
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:06,739
One hundred...

28
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,211
...two hundred...

29
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:09,747
...three hundred.

30
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,054
Have a nice day, Mr. Johnson.

31
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,754
Excellent fit, sir.

32
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,854
And how will you be paying?

33
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:51,453

34
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:53,256
Let me see that Magnum.

35
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:58,894
That압 it.

36
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:23,854
$500 and the gun.

00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:28,992
l앏l need to see l.D.

38
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,931
Of course.

39
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:48,206
l앐 sorry, Mr. Johnson,
this card압 been canceled.

40
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:49,951
lmpossible.

41
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,950
Do you have another form
of payment?

42
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:54,656
Try it again.

43
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:07,862
Old habits die hard, I guess.

44
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:13,062
If you don앖 kick them,
they kick you.

45
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:16,602
Ain앖 marriage grand?

46
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,262
Porter.

47
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,601
Youre not dead.

48
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,476
What are you going to do?
lKill me?

49
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,472
Not now.

50
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,410
Youre cleaning up.

51
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,395
Val still wants to talk to you.

52
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:44,164
Sorry, babe.

53
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:48,536
Shall I tell him
to call back again?

54
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:53,080
No, l앏l talk to him.
Shut him up, anyway.

55
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:01,216
Yep, same as always. You?

56
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:03,151
Yeah, good, good.

57
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:06,321
Why? Are you there now?

58
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:12,992
Don앖 sweat it, Val.
We all look alike to them.

59
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:17,865
Same crew. The Chows.
Twice a week.

60
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:22,271
Tuesday and Friday, between 1 1 and 1 2.
Always the same route.

61
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,609
Chinese money laundry.

62
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:29,949
How much in the case?

63
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:33,583
Anywhere between 350 and half a mill.

64
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,126
How much do you need, Val?

65
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:43,265
We split it 50-50.

66
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:46,864
l mean, how much do you need
to buy your way back?

67
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:52,468
lnto the syndicate.

68
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,107
How much?

69
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,040
-The Outfit?
-Whatever.

70
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,714
Jesus. You know everything.

71
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,140
Hi, sweetie.

72
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,476
1 30 grand.

73
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:18,491
The Chows won앖 go to the cops.
They keep everything in-house.

74
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:20,726
And they don앖 feel pain like we do.

75
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:23,597
You notice anything about those guys?

76
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:26,832
They look nasty.
Probably kung fu motherfuckers.

77
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,841
-Did l miss something?
-They weren앖 wearing seat belts.

78
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:35,150
We앏l hit them on Friday.

79
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,801
Hubba, hubba, hubba!

80
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,344
Lookie here.

81
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:50,188
How압 that pileup taste?

82
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:56,491
Daddy brought home the bacon, baby.

83
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:04,903
Val!

84
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:06,773
What?

85
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,154
Problem with kicking a Chow압 ass...

86
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,453
...is an hour later
you want to do it again.

88
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:49,610
1 40 apiece.

89
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:51,483
Total.

90
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:54,656
Total?

91
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:01,957
That압 70 grand?
That압 not enough.

92
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:06,066

93
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:10,739

Fucking slants!

94
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:12,838
Should have hit them Tuesday.

95
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,667
Fuck!

96
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,110
We got away clean.

97
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,146
And got something to show for it.

98
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,842
Be grateful for what you get,
rule number one.

99
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,856
Yeah, rule number one.

100
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:40,165

101
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,034
Everything압 cool.

102
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,609
Just not enough! All right?

103
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:54,507
Never is, Val.

104
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:58,453
Baby, just put the money
in the car, will you?

105
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:13,301
l can앖 fucking believe it.
You know what, Porter?

106
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:16,370
This is funny.

107
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,466
This will kill you.

108
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,867
lt압 always 1 40.

109
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,249
Someone ought to give me a Ph.D.

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,687
Jesus! Wait till l앐 out

You were great.
Everything압 cool. Give me--

Okay, keep the gun.

There we go.

00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,740
l bet you got a lot of questions
rattling in your head.

118
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:41,823

120

There압 somebody here to see you.

170
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,197

l앐 Porter.

172
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:31,342
Porter, that looks like assault to me.

173
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:37,213
Porter looks like he likes
to resist arrest.

174
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,757
Fuck! Not in here.

175
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:45,117
Jesus! He just wants to talk.

176
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:48,496
Am l right? Did l call it?

177
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:52,901
Are you Stegman?

178
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,438
Maybe. What do you want?

179
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:01,235
Your boy didn앖 make his delivery.

180
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:08,006
Why don앖 we talk outside?

181
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:09,341
Youre a dealer?

182
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,347
Just forget about it, all right?

183
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,388
Don앖 touch my money either.
Come on--

184
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,024
This is heroin?

185
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,125
This is heroin.

186
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:24,422
Don앖 worry about it.
Take it easy.

187
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,132
Let압 talk.

188
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:30,104
What are you looking at?
Play your game.

189
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,735
And youre bleeding
all over my couch!

190
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:35,033
Come on!

191
00:25:40,616 --> 00:25:42,914
Steggie압 been holding out on us.

192
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:45,745
l앏l check it out.

193
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:48,551
Val Resnick.

194
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,656
-What about him?
-Tell me where he is.

195
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:55,796
Even if l knew,
the answer would still be no.

196
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:59,329
-Where앇 you meet up with my boy?
-At his drop.

197
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,465
ls he dead?

198
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:04,432
No, but she is. OD앇 on that crap
you았e been sending her.

199
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:07,174
So? What do you care?

200
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,171
l앐 her husband.

201
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:12,771
Youre not going to kill me.
are you?

202
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:17,675
Not in front of these kids.

203
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:21,288
Where is he?

204
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:26,483
l don앖 know!

205
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:28,789
That압 the truth.

206
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:33,501
lt got delivered to me last night.
l won앖 see anyone till next month.

207
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:37,329
Why all the trouble?

208
00:26:38,674 --> 00:26:41,108
He압 afraid of the girl.
l mean...

209
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,842
...of Mrs. Porter.

210
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,139
l mean, that압 how it looks to me.

211
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:56,519
l don앖 know nothing about this.

212
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,827
l know Val from the old days.

213
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:01,688
Three months ago he asks me
to do him a favor.

214
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,491
l make an extra grand a month.
l figure, what the hell?

215
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:10,397
Now you threaten to kill me?
That much a buddy of Val압 l am not.

216
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:13,675
He압 in the city.
That압 all l know.

217
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:15,375
How do you know that?

218
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:18,308
-He said so.
-When?

219
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:22,706
When he came. Said he squared
himself with the syndicate.

220
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:25,647
Said he was back
in the big time for good.

221
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:27,252
He was very excited.

222
00:27:27,556 --> 00:27:30,525
You tell him that Porter is back too.

223
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,157
And he wants his money.

224
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:36,762
l앏l come back for you
when these kids are not around.

225
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,593
When would l tell him this?

226
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:04,290
Talk to me.

227
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:08,554
There압 a young lady to see you.
Her name is Pearl.

228
00:28:08,764 --> 00:28:10,755
She압 got two very bad habits.

229
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,127
Right now l앐 only interested
in one of them.

230
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,397
Send her up.

231
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:23,109
Apartment 7 1 8, ma아m.
Go right on up.

232
00:28:42,164 --> 00:28:43,392
Send her up.

233
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:46,828
It압 Haskell.
Sorry to call you at home--

234
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:49,229
Don앖 be sorry.
Just don앖 call.

235
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:53,465
I got a call from a cab guy
on the south end.

236
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,643
-What is it?
-It압 this guy, Stegman.

237
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,344
Shit. Hold on a second.

238
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:10,516
On your knees, bitch.
l want satisfaction.

239
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,927
l앐 on the phone, Pearl.

240
00:29:16,698 --> 00:29:18,962
lt압 ''Mistress Pearl.''

241
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:22,294
l앐 on the fucking phone!

242
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,202
Make it quick.

243
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:29,776
This guy Stegman calls.

244
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:34,379
He sounded all nervous,
like something scared him.

245
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,347
He had to talk to you.
I said I앇 see what I could do.

246
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:42,653
-What was it about?
-He said to tell you Lynn was dead.

247
00:29:43,225 --> 00:29:47,992
He said some guy wanted you.
That압 all he said.

248
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:49,855
I thought you ought to know.

249
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:53,234
You did right.
l want to talk to him.

250
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:55,025
Who, Stegman?

251
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:58,706
No, President Nixon.
Of course, Stegman!

252
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,373
Tell him Varrick압, by the bridge.

253
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:02,666
Make it....

254
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:06,710
Make it 20 minutes.

255
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,347
l앐 working here!

256
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:19,417
Can앖 you see l앐 working here?

257
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:23,995
Put it on my tab.

258
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:26,166
l앐 looking for a girl.

259
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:31,099
She goes by the name of Rosie.
Here압 her photo. Do you know her?

260
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,738
She worked by telephone,
not freelance.

261
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,674
Probably connected
with the syndicate.

262
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:43,009
Out of my league.
l wouldn앖 know her.

263
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,615
Maybe you know somebody who would.

264
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,395
-Why you looking for her?
-l앐 her brother.

265
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:59,293
l got cancer.
l want to see her.

266
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:07,399
You two look close.

267
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:12,041
Got a cigarette?

268
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:19,920
Your sister sounds expensive.

269
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:24,086
Try Michael,
bartender at the Regal Hotel.

270
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,121
That wasn앖 the name
l was looking for.

271
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,792
The only one l got.

272
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,021
l tried to call you, but you
must have changed your number.

273
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:06,267
l never gave you my original number.

274
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:09,530
What did this guy look like?

275
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:12,466
He had dark hair, blue eyes.

276
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:15,438
A real Cro-Magnon-looking bastard.

277
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:18,204
lf Lynn압 dead,
maybe he did us a favor.

278
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:21,346
l know, except l앐 out
a grand a month.

279
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,379
Maybe we can work something out.

280
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:25,550
Did you get a name?

281
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:28,113
He said he was Porter.

282
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,890
He said he was there for Porter?

283
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:36,531
No, he said he was Porter.

284
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:45,665
l wouldn앖 want that guy
after me either.

285
00:32:45,941 --> 00:32:49,536
-l know how you must feel.
-What am l? A nobody?

286
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,748
l았e got friends.
All l have to do is point.

287
00:32:54,082 --> 00:32:56,346
l pick up a phone
and he압 a dead man.

288
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:58,377
And this time he stays dead!

289
00:32:58,954 --> 00:33:01,479
Try to keep it down,
all right?

290
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:03,515
lt압 okay.

291
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,489
What앇 he say about me?

292
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:08,187
He said you owed him money.

293
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,988
Nothing else?

294
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,832
Nothing. Why?
How much you owe him?

295
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,000
None of your business.

296
00:33:16,238 --> 00:33:19,537
l just got the feeling
he앇 like to kill you.

297
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,835
Oh, Christ!

298
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:23,908
Porter.

299
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:31,886
What앇 you tell him?

300
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:33,617
Nothing!

301
00:33:33,955 --> 00:33:37,789
-What could l tell him?
-You tell him about the money? Heroin?

302
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:40,962
He had it with him!
l told him l delivered it.

303
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,526
Nothing else?

304
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:44,560
l don앖 know nothing else!

305
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:49,596
You gave him something. A name.
Someone who knows where to find me.

306
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:52,066
l swear on my mother--

307
00:33:52,274 --> 00:33:53,434
Fuck your mother!

308
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:58,378
-That압 not nice. Take it easy.
-What are you looking at?

309
00:33:58,914 --> 00:33:59,778
Val, don앖.

310
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:02,575
Not again. Don앖 do that, man.

311
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:05,777
Come on. Not again.

312
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:07,086
Don앖.

313
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:10,052
-Forget it.
-ls there some trouble here?

314
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:12,883
Were just leaving.

315
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:16,395
You know what?
This one압 on me.

316
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:19,327
You see me reaching
for my fucking wallet?

317
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:27,768
Sorry. He just got a promotion,
so he압 a little tense.

318
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,272
ls there a Michael here?

319
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:33,413
That압 him over yonder.

320
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,682
Youre the man to see
about horizontal refreshment?

321
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:43,752
l앐 looking for a girl named Rosie.

322
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:47,827
Prostitution is illegal
and youre speaking Greek.

323
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:55,334
Usually these matters are conducted
with more discretion.

324
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:00,630
Be discreet now.

325
00:35:06,715 --> 00:35:07,545
What was her name?

326
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:08,712
Rosie.

327
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:11,544
-Who압 looking for her?
-Just call her.

328
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:22,360
Rosie?

329
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:24,356
Give me the phone.

330
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:27,967
Take care of that.

331
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:32,297
Who the hell is this?

332
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:33,572
Porter.

333
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,400
Try again, honey.
Porter압 dead.

334
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:41,345
l used to drive for you.
Provide a safe work environment.

335
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,808
Porter?

336
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:59,825
Why pour salt on old wounds?

337
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,500
I didn앖 need to.

338
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,906
I guess I had a soft spot for her.

339
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:32,698
Come in.

340
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:36,903
You look pretty good
for a dead guy.

341
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,807
How앇 you hear about it?

342
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,945
People were talking.

343
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:50,445
Plus l heard your wife
was back in town alone.

344
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,578
She압 dead.

345
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:56,714
l앐 sorry, Porter.

346
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:58,819
Why?

347
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:04,622
Jesus. Surly Porter.
Youre the same as ever, aren앖 you?

348
00:37:08,203 --> 00:37:10,262
This doesn앖 look like you.

349
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:13,665
Yeah, well, people change.

350
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:16,004
Stay.

351
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:18,812
lt압 okay.
Come on, sweetheart.

352
00:37:19,848 --> 00:37:22,316
Meet the nastiest dog
who ever lived.

353
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,487
What압 his name?

354
00:37:27,522 --> 00:37:28,352
Porter.

355
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:31,959
He took your job after you left.

356
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:35,287
He압 just as tough,
but he won앖 leave me.

357
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,433
l need a favor.

358
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,340
A favor?

359
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:51,177
Maybe youre not the same as ever.

360
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:56,375
l앐 looking for a syndicate boy.

361
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,587
lt압 the Outfit.
We don앖 say ''syndicate'' anymore.

362
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:02,586
You know what l mean.
Whatever.

363
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,316
Don앖 get touchy, Porter.
What압 his name?

364
00:38:07,762 --> 00:38:09,059
Val Resnick.

365
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,397
That son of a bitch.

366
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,200
You know him?

367
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:21,365
l met up with him once
a few years ago.

368
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:25,007
He can앖 use Star압 service.
He beats up the girls.

369
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,975
He almost killed one.

370
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:28,679
You?

371
00:38:33,388 --> 00:38:36,687
Does it matter?
You quit looking after me, remember?

372
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:44,190
Would you know where he might be?

373
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:48,766
l suppose he압 at the hotel.

374
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:52,663
-Which one?
-The Outfit hotel.

375
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:54,739
The address?

376
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,346
Were friends, right?

377
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:03,949
l mean, we used to be.
But l앐 an employee too.

378
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:07,915
The Outfit wouldn앖 like me
telling you, would they?

379
00:39:08,656 --> 00:39:09,918
How strong are you?

380
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:14,060
Personally, l think you are
the strongest man l았e ever met.

381
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:16,194
But l wonder if it압 enough.

382
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:18,296
For what?

383
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:22,059
You want this guy
for something he won앖 like.

384
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:24,198
l앐 going to kill him.

385
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,767
That압 something he won앖 like.

386
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:35,978
What if they grab you and ask you
how you found out?

387
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,220
You know l wouldn앖 turn you in.

388
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,320
-l wouldn앖 talk.
-What if they ask you hard?

389
00:39:44,158 --> 00:39:47,423
l앏l say it was
a cab dispatcher named Stegman.

390
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:54,458
The Oakwood Arms, Union and 1 7th.

391
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:27,301
Hi, Val.

392
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:32,130
Where압 my money?

393
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,203
l took your gun.

394
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,142
lt압 back here.
You look like a pro.

395
00:40:42,383 --> 00:40:45,511
lKeep your mouth shut
and you앏l walk out of here.

396
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:51,958
My 70 grand. l want it.

397
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:55,394
l don앖 have it right now.

398
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,629
-Where is it?
-l gave all 1 30,000 to the Outfit.

399
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:02,460
l gave it all to them.

400
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:08,906
Tell them you gave them money that
doesn앖 belong to you. Get it back.

401
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:12,637
l can앖 do that.
You don앖 know these--

402
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,681
You앏l kill me
whether l get it or not.

403
00:41:18,252 --> 00:41:20,516
All right, l앏l get the money.

404
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:23,918
Just give me a few days.
What the fuck are you doing?

405
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:27,058
Noon. Tomorrow.

406
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:28,225
Say it.

407
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,330
All right.

408
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:33,694
This may sound crazy,
but no hard feelings?

409
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:37,763
l did what l had to do.
You can appreciate that.

410
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:39,437
l appreciate that, you--

411
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:41,002
No, no! Don앖.

412
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:44,068
Please.

413
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:45,846
Allow me.

414
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,052
Jesus!

415
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:05,724
You bitch!

416
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:09,058
Let her work.

417
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:24,550
Me love you, baby.

418
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:29,086
Me love you long time.

419
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,154
No, no, wait.

420
00:42:43,337 --> 00:42:44,167
Tomorrow.

421
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:45,971
Noon.

422
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:50,507
You and the money be at
7th and Franklin at the pay phone.

423
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,975
Where앇 you get this?

424
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,922
Some hooker had it.
l recognized you.

425
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,624
l swiped it in case l could use it.

426
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,326
Did you hurt her?

427
00:43:07,495 --> 00:43:09,463
The hooker.
Did you hurt her?

428
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:11,528
What압 that have to do
with anything?

429
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:22,810
l았e got a few minutes.

430
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:25,879
So go boil an egg.

431
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,486
Phillip says you have a problem
you need help with.

432
00:43:37,325 --> 00:43:38,349
Yes, sir.

433
00:43:39,227 --> 00:43:40,558
ls it your problem...

434
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:43,025
...who breached our security
last night?

435
00:43:44,866 --> 00:43:46,333
He breaks into my apartment--

436
00:43:46,534 --> 00:43:49,594
There압 an old expression
that has served me well:

437
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:53,037
''Do not shit where you eat.''

438
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:56,533
Or ''live.''

439
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:58,311
''Do not shit where you live.''

440
00:43:58,546 --> 00:43:59,843
l like that better.

441
00:44:00,615 --> 00:44:01,809
l앐 sorry, Mr. Carter.

442
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:04,517
There are three ways
we can handle this.

443
00:44:04,852 --> 00:44:09,346
One: We help you.
Two: We allow you to help yourself.

444
00:44:10,424 --> 00:44:12,824
Three: We have you replaced.

445
00:44:18,032 --> 00:44:22,969
We have an investment in you, Resnick,
of time, money and training.

446
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:25,339
So assisting you would be...

447
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,771
...in a way, protecting our investment.

448
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,407
And that is always
good business policy.

449
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,203
Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.

450
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:36,473
Thank you.
You won앖 regret it.

451
00:44:40,955 --> 00:44:44,721
According to Phillip,
a man has come to town to kill you?

452
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:49,585
You say he압 alone and that he압
a professional robber. Correct?

453
00:44:49,797 --> 00:44:53,699
Yes, sir. He does payroll jobs,
banks, stuff like that.

454
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:57,427
-What압 his name?
-Porter.

455
00:44:58,272 --> 00:44:59,569
What압 his first name?

456
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:09,705
l don앖 know. He never called
himself anything but Porter.

457
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:24,796
Where did you get the $ 1 30,000?

458
00:45:29,537 --> 00:45:32,301
That압 why this man
has come to town, huh?

459
00:45:32,873 --> 00:45:34,966
The $ 1 30,000 you paid us back.

460
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:38,402
Yes, sir.
But only $70,000 of it was his.

461
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:43,709
We never asked you where you got it.
lt압 none of our business.

462
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:47,114
Now it appears
it has become our business.

463
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:52,686
Here압 his file, Mr. Carter.

464
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:04,161
Do you understand your value
to the organization?

465
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:10,433
Youre a sadist, you lack compunction.
That comes in handy.

466
00:46:12,046 --> 00:46:16,983
But now, an area of your personal life
has become a danger to us.

467
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:24,481
A man in our organization needs
to be tough, self-reliant.

468
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:28,862
Were you to handle this problem
on your own...

469
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:32,955
...there would be no doubt...

470
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:36,135
...youre the kind of man we want.

471
00:46:36,337 --> 00:46:37,463
l want to.

472
00:46:37,872 --> 00:46:40,204
l want to handle it myself.

473
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:41,465
Great.

474
00:46:42,276 --> 00:46:46,508
Until it is handled, l want you
to move out of the Oakwood Arms.

475
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:50,708
l don앖 have a place--

476
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:54,385
l don앖 want any more
unpleasantness at the hotel.

477
00:46:55,623 --> 00:46:56,817
Yes, sir.

478
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:10,393
Excuse me, but it might be easier
if Resnick just disappeared.

479
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,836
l thought about that.

480
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:16,841
But l앐 not worried about Resnick.

481
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:20,172
He wouldn앖 last two minutes
on the street without us.

482
00:47:20,414 --> 00:47:22,780
lt압 that other mutt
l앐 thinking about.

483
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,574
-What압 his name?
-Porter.

484
00:47:26,987 --> 00:47:31,754
Takes a lot of moxie to walk into
the Outfit and whack our guys around.

485
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:34,456
Either that or he압 shit nuts.

486
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:39,024
Frankly, l don앖 understand it
for $ 1 30,000.

487
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:41,401
lt was $70,000, his share.

488
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:44,398
That압 even worse.

489
00:47:44,972 --> 00:47:47,873
l don앖 want
Mr. Bronson hearing about this.

490
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:50,436
He앏l think l앐 getting soft.

491
00:47:50,778 --> 00:47:52,541
His principle has always been:

492
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,749
''lf you don앖 understand it,
get rid of it.''

493
00:47:56,917 --> 00:48:00,114
A stitch in time, so to speak.

494
00:48:01,188 --> 00:48:02,985
Stitch this mutt up, Phil.

495
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:10,559
Any Polaroids or trophies?

496
00:48:10,831 --> 00:48:12,594
No, not this time.

497
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:19,303
They cut me loose, Pearl,
like l thought they would.

498
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:21,436
Hold on one second.

499
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:25,836
Shut up!
l앐 on the fucking phone!

500
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:36,853
Yes?

501
00:48:37,558 --> 00:48:39,992
Did your friends make it to town?

502
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:42,023
Last night, baby.

503
00:48:42,229 --> 00:48:45,460
Did you tell them
Porter took their payroll?

504
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:46,825
l did.

505
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:49,435
And they want retribution.

506
00:48:50,004 --> 00:48:52,336
All right. Here압 what we do.

507
00:49:54,134 --> 00:49:58,230
Yeah, that압 Porter.
He has shit for brains.

508
00:49:58,739 --> 00:49:59,933
Shit.

509
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:27,030
Shit!

510
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:32,930
Next time, Porter.

511
00:50:36,977 --> 00:50:39,138
Porter압 made some new friends.

512
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,894
-Easy, mister.
-l won앖 press charges.

513
00:51:02,136 --> 00:51:04,161
-Who were they?
-l don앖 know.

514
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:06,999
l앐 all right. l don앖 want--
lt압 you guys.

515
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:10,004
Stegman says you got
a line on a load of cash.

516
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:12,609
250 grand, to be exact.

517
00:51:13,347 --> 00:51:14,336
Seventy.

518
00:51:16,216 --> 00:51:18,184
Come on, man, get off of me!

519
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,517
What do you take us for?
ldiots?

520
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:24,617
Nobody앇 go through all this
for 70 grand.

521
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:27,588
You look like a whole bunch
of trouble to us.

522
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:29,954
We found a dead girl full of heroin.

523
00:51:30,164 --> 00:51:33,691
There were signs of a struggle.
Were not sure it was an OD.

524
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:36,526
We got a witness.
A guy with one nostril.

525
00:51:36,804 --> 00:51:38,431
Remember him?

526
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:41,539
Don앖 worry.
We앏l give you immunity.

527
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:44,107
Room to operate,
get-out-of-jail-free card.

528
00:51:44,378 --> 00:51:46,676
All you got to do is get the money.

529
00:51:47,548 --> 00:51:49,311
We can앖 help you, though.

530
00:51:50,084 --> 00:51:52,609
-lt would be against the law.
-Understand?

531
00:51:55,022 --> 00:51:56,785
-lt압 my money.
-Wrong.

532
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:00,824
lt압 our money.

533
00:52:01,061 --> 00:52:04,360
Me and my partner.
You be a good boy, we give you a piece.

534
00:52:04,598 --> 00:52:06,156
lt앏l be easy, Porter.

535
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:08,061
You got it?

536
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:10,703
-He압 got it.
-Understand?

537
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:14,803
-Take it easy. We앏l be in touch.
-Thanks.

538
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:16,574
What a dope!

539
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:18,376
Fuck.

540
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:20,544
Crooked cops.

541
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:23,076
Do they come any other way?

542
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:29,121
If I앇 beenjust a little dumber,
I could았ejoined the force myself.

543
00:53:00,254 --> 00:53:03,553
Jesus Christ, Porter,
you need to see a doctor.

544
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:08,125
-lt압 going to sting.
-Just clean it up, all right?

545
00:53:09,063 --> 00:53:10,621
You hold it there.

546
00:53:23,644 --> 00:53:25,271
l앏l do it.

547
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:32,977
Tell me something, Porter.

548
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:39,282
When did you decide to leave?
That night we slept together?

549
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:41,886
No.

550
00:53:44,198 --> 00:53:46,632
The next day,
when l drove you to work.

551
00:53:52,172 --> 00:53:53,730
Should았e asked me to quit.

552
00:53:58,946 --> 00:54:01,972
You could았e asked me
to drive you somewhere else.

553
00:54:15,896 --> 00:54:17,989
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

554
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:26,869
Thanks.

555
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:28,871
Does it fit?

556
00:54:31,345 --> 00:54:33,006
Like it was made for me.

557
00:54:34,481 --> 00:54:36,278
lt앏l look great in your casket.

558
00:54:47,728 --> 00:54:49,491
You know what l think?

559
00:54:49,897 --> 00:54:54,300
l think that all those stories
about you being dead were true.

560
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:57,197
Youre too thickheaded to admit it.

561
00:55:26,466 --> 00:55:28,195
God, l missed you.

562
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:30,266
l miss you.

563
00:55:38,712 --> 00:55:40,270
Don앖, don앖, don앖....

00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:43,880
l can앖. l got...

565
00:55:46,453 --> 00:55:48,250
...stuff to do.

566
00:56:40,507 --> 00:56:42,099
Where is he?

567
00:56:45,646 --> 00:56:47,978
Porter. Where is he?

568
00:56:48,282 --> 00:56:50,011
He압 in the bedroom.

569
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:07,330
ls he hurt bad?

570
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:11,199
The doctor should be here any minute.

571
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,598
That압 bullshit.

572
00:57:29,323 --> 00:57:31,154
Here l come, pally.

573
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:34,891
Goddamn!

574
00:57:37,397 --> 00:57:38,557
Goddamn!

575
00:57:46,173 --> 00:57:47,663
Get in here!

576
00:57:54,181 --> 00:57:55,239
Where is he?

577
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,710
He압 gone, he압 gone.

578
00:57:58,352 --> 00:57:59,842
Gone?

579
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:06,089
l know you.
Youre that whore from the picture.

580
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,691
How do you know him?

581
00:58:12,299 --> 00:58:13,857
He used to drive me.

582
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:21,173
l앐 driving you now, honey.

583
00:58:22,476 --> 00:58:24,068
You know what you are?

584
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:25,778
Educate me.

585
00:58:26,213 --> 00:58:28,238
An ugly pig who beats up women...

586
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:32,441
...who can앖 get it up because
he압 terrified of his own shadow!

587
00:58:32,886 --> 00:58:33,784
ls that right?

588
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:35,281
ls that right?

589
00:58:35,489 --> 00:58:37,855
Then you must be the lucky girl.

590
00:58:41,161 --> 00:58:44,324
Hubba, hubba, hubba!
l knew l앇 seen that ass before.

591
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:49,128
l am going to fuck you
six ways from Sunday.

592
00:59:18,832 --> 00:59:20,629
l forgot my cigarettes.

593
00:59:31,378 --> 00:59:33,005
All right, Val.

594
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:38,441
This Outfit, or whatever you call it,
it압 got a head man, right?

595
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:40,377
Who is it?

596
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:42,152
They앏l kill me.

597
00:59:42,656 --> 00:59:45,523
What do you think l앏l do?
Worry about me.

598
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:48,985
Names. Come on.

599
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:53,159
Fairfax and Carter.
They run the whole city.

600
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:56,863
Where do l find them?

601
00:59:57,404 --> 00:59:59,201
Fairfax isn앖 in town.

602
01:00:00,006 --> 01:00:01,997
What about Carter?
ls he in town?

603
01:00:04,077 --> 01:00:06,545
Porter, it won앖 do you any good.

604
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,212
Theyre going to--
Jesus!

605
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:15,115
Frederick Carter lnvestments.
1 20 Commerce Avenue.

609
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:31,227
Youre fucking nuts going up

But l앐 going to help you out.

611

Thanks.

613
01:00:42,182 --> 01:00:45,151
l can get you in.
lt압 tighter than a drum.

614
01:00:45,452 --> 01:00:46,419
How many guys?

615
01:00:47,888 --> 01:00:49,253
lt압 tighter than hell.

616
01:00:49,523 --> 01:00:53,755
Only one guy on the outside.
So l got a way around that.

617
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,588
You are crazy!

618
01:00:58,865 --> 01:01:00,730
Youre a crazy son of a bitch!

619
01:01:01,635 --> 01:01:03,432
That압 why l love you.

620
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,264
You got a light?

621
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:08,071
You got a light?

622
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,508
Then what good are you?

623
01:01:14,814 --> 01:01:16,179
Check my pocket!

624
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:45,878
ls your name on the lease?

625
01:01:51,184 --> 01:01:53,584
The Outfit pays for everything.

626
01:01:54,988 --> 01:01:57,957
l want you to gather
everything up that you need.

627
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:00,349
Say goodbye to this place.

628
01:02:25,151 --> 01:02:26,345
lt압 okay, baby.

629
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,276
lt압 okay, puppy.

630
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:30,585
He앏l live. How are you?

631
01:02:38,198 --> 01:02:39,631
Yeah, l know.

632
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:42,494
lt압 not much,
but at least you앏l be safe.

633
01:02:42,702 --> 01:02:45,671
Nobody knows l앐 here.
Sit down. Relax.

634
01:03:00,887 --> 01:03:01,854
What?

635
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:05,820
Nobody has this number.

636
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:52,094
Somebody does know l앐 here.

637
01:03:56,776 --> 01:03:58,869
He압 probably fucking her.

638
01:03:59,112 --> 01:04:02,946
-He압 taking long enough.
-Maybe the dog too.

639
01:04:03,483 --> 01:04:05,178
You think so?

640
01:04:06,419 --> 01:04:08,011
Give it a minute.

641
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:38,041
Okay, let압 give him another bell.

642
01:04:46,593 --> 01:04:47,992
Shit.

643
01:04:48,862 --> 01:04:51,126
He압 behind us.

644
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,291
It압 notjust anybody that gets...

645
01:05:26,499 --> 01:05:29,662
...a hit put on him by a big firm
like the Outfit.

646
01:05:30,036 --> 01:05:32,197
I was moving up in the world.

647
01:05:33,873 --> 01:05:36,603
Maybe it was time
to pay them a visit.

648
01:05:36,876 --> 01:05:39,344
Carter wouldn앖 be expecting that.

649
01:05:40,046 --> 01:05:43,311
And who knows?
I might even get my money back.

650
01:06:13,746 --> 01:06:15,043

651
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:17,044
Give me my goddamn money, please.

652
01:06:19,452 --> 01:06:21,818
-Give me my money.
-You sure that압 him?

653
01:06:22,055 --> 01:06:23,079
Yeah, come on.

654
01:06:24,891 --> 01:06:26,859
Thank you very much.

655
01:06:28,895 --> 01:06:30,260
What you up to, buddy?

656
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,725
Well, our money압 in there...

657
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:35,457
...if youre still interested.

658
01:06:35,668 --> 01:06:38,330
Not in the dough,
but the boat l앏l buy with it.

659
01:06:42,242 --> 01:06:44,210
What압 he doing here?

660
01:06:44,644 --> 01:06:46,509
lt압 a ride-along, Porter.

661
01:06:46,746 --> 01:06:49,510
Your piece of the pie
just got smaller.

662
01:06:49,749 --> 01:06:52,240
But don앖 worry,
l앏l leave you some crust.

663
01:06:54,454 --> 01:06:56,752
What are you waiting for?
Go get it.

664
01:06:57,123 --> 01:06:58,112
Go get our money.

665
01:07:00,727 --> 01:07:01,921
You guys do me a favor?

666
01:07:02,729 --> 01:07:03,957
Were here to help.

667
01:07:05,131 --> 01:07:08,794
They앏l frisk me when l go in.
Would you hold onto this?

668
01:07:11,938 --> 01:07:13,633
Just for a little while.

669
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:16,899
Sure, Porter.

670
01:07:22,815 --> 01:07:24,282
Nice balance.

671
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:29,811
Douche bag.

672
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,795
Can l help you?

673
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:46,505
-l want to see Mr. Carter.
-And who are you?

674
01:07:46,839 --> 01:07:49,467
Tell him l앐 the guy
that whacked Val Resnick.

675
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:51,300
l앐 sorry, l don앖--

676
01:07:52,779 --> 01:07:54,838
Didn앖 copy. Repeat.

677
01:07:58,551 --> 01:07:59,643
Right.

678
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,886
Mr. Carter will see you.
Turn around so l can frisk you.

679
01:08:29,749 --> 01:08:31,683
Bravo. Sit down.

680
01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:40,192
My compliments.
They were two of my best.

681
01:08:40,393 --> 01:08:42,384
They lull too easy.

682
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:53,934
You want something from me.

683
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:58,333
Val Resnick gave you $ 1 30,000.

684
01:08:58,845 --> 01:09:00,745
He paid us.
lt was a debt.

685
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:03,977
$70,000 of it is mine.
l want it back.

686
01:09:06,052 --> 01:09:09,317
l앐 sorry, but l seem to have
misplaced your name.

687
01:09:09,722 --> 01:09:10,586
Porter.

688
01:09:10,857 --> 01:09:11,915
Porter. Right.

689
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,722
l won앖 forget it again.

690
01:09:15,361 --> 01:09:18,057
The Outfit is not unreasonable.

691
01:09:18,564 --> 01:09:22,159
But no corporation would agree
to what youre asking.

692
01:09:22,402 --> 01:09:24,734
Will Fairfax give me my money?

693
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:31,707
Resnick told you quite a bit.
Fairfax will say the same thing l have.

694
01:09:32,045 --> 01:09:34,741
Were not authorized
to do things like this.

695
01:09:34,981 --> 01:09:36,676
Who is?
Who makes the decisions?

696
01:09:37,283 --> 01:09:39,513
A committee would, in this case.

697
01:09:39,752 --> 01:09:43,119
You go high enough, you always come
to one man. Who?

698
01:09:55,968 --> 01:09:59,062
Mr. Bronson,
I have Mr. Carter on the line.

699
01:09:59,305 --> 01:10:01,102
Put him through.

700
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,637
Go ahead, sir.

701
01:10:02,909 --> 01:10:04,376
Carter, how압 business?

702
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,976
-Good till now.
-You want to see me, Dad?

703
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,943
Hang on, Carter.

704
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:11,906
Look in that green box, Johnny.

705
01:10:25,331 --> 01:10:27,094
Are you kidding me?

706
01:10:28,534 --> 01:10:30,001
ls it the convertible?

707
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:31,293
You thought l forgot.

708
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:35,965
Happy birthday, son.

709
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:40,405
This car? And Nick압 got us ringside
at the fight tonight.

710
01:10:40,646 --> 01:10:41,476
It앏l be good.

711
01:10:41,714 --> 01:10:43,272
My money압 on Rankin.

712
01:10:43,516 --> 01:10:45,347
No, Hicks is favored.

713
01:10:46,185 --> 01:10:48,847
-That압 got nothing to do with it.
-l got to go.

714
01:10:50,723 --> 01:10:51,951
Thanks.

715
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:53,349
Happy birthday.

716
01:10:54,193 --> 01:10:56,753
-Drive safe.
-You got it.

717
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:58,995
Sorry. What is it?

718
01:11:00,233 --> 01:11:04,431
l have a problem. There압 a man
in my office with a gun...

719
01:11:04,804 --> 01:11:07,637
...who says he앏l kill me
if we don앖 pay him...

720
01:11:07,874 --> 01:11:11,366
...$ 1 30,000 that one of our guys
stole from him.

721
01:11:12,044 --> 01:11:15,605
It압 70. How much is
this guy Carter worth to you?

722
01:11:15,882 --> 01:11:16,871
What do you mean?

723
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,480
Either l get my money
or l앏l kill Carter.

724
01:11:19,986 --> 01:11:21,613
Are you threatening me?

725
01:11:21,888 --> 01:11:24,721
I앐 not threatening you.
I앐 threatening Carter.

726
01:11:26,025 --> 01:11:28,789
An audacious man. Who are you?

727
01:11:31,364 --> 01:11:33,025
My money, yes or no?

728
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:34,797
No.

729
01:11:39,572 --> 01:11:40,539
Carter?

730
01:11:47,947 --> 01:11:49,915
What압 going on there?

731
01:11:50,216 --> 01:11:54,482
You just don앖 get it,
do you, you dumb fuck?

732
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,745
Carter, talk to me.

733
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:03,084
Call Fairfax and tell him
Ijust croaked Carter.

734
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:06,661
And he압 next. After that,
l앐 coming to get you.

735
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,493
Are you out of your fucking mind?

736
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:12,731
You just dug your own grave.

737
01:12:20,313 --> 01:12:23,077
-l don앖 see any cash.
-They write you a check?

738
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:26,074
l have to go and see another guy.

739
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:27,374
Last one.

740
01:12:27,587 --> 01:12:31,546
Then we got a dead woman and assault
to talk to you about.

741
01:12:31,824 --> 01:12:35,260
That means more paperwork.
And we don앖 like paperwork.

742
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:37,288
Damn shame, Porter.

743
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:40,225
But don앖 let the bastards
get you down.

744
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,962
That압 right. Don앖 give up.

745
01:12:46,939 --> 01:12:48,236
Can l have my piece?

746
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,543
Nice roscoe.

747
01:13:00,686 --> 01:13:02,381
Heavy enough to be a nutcracker.

748
01:13:02,622 --> 01:13:04,954
We앏l be in touch, Rocky.

749
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:08,923
lKeep up the good work.

750
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:14,932
Nobody likes a monkey on their back.
I had three.

751
01:13:15,468 --> 01:13:17,902
And they were cramping my style.

752
01:13:18,137 --> 01:13:20,731
I was going to
have to lighten the load.

753
01:13:58,911 --> 01:13:59,969
Where have you been?

754
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:03,376
l was taking care of business.
Evening up the odds.

755
01:14:05,017 --> 01:14:08,009
They won앖 stop until they kill us,
will they?

756
01:14:10,723 --> 01:14:11,690
No.

757
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:18,991
l앐 sorry.

758
01:14:19,999 --> 01:14:21,694
l앐 sorry l got you involved.

759
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:27,004
So why did you?

760
01:14:29,008 --> 01:14:32,637
Youre a clever guy.
You didn앖 need me.

761
01:14:35,047 --> 01:14:36,742
So why did you?

762
01:14:38,884 --> 01:14:40,909
Yeah, youre right.

763
01:14:43,089 --> 01:14:47,423
When l came back,
l came back here with nothing.

764
01:14:50,296 --> 01:14:52,355
No life. No hope.

765
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,494
You were the only good thing
that hadn앖 been taken.

766
01:15:01,207 --> 01:15:03,107
l couldn앖 stay away.

767
01:15:05,211 --> 01:15:08,408
l had to see you to make sure
l wasn앖 in hell.

768
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:13,051
So why don앖 we get out of here?

769
01:15:14,253 --> 01:15:15,777
-We can앖.
-Why?

770
01:15:16,055 --> 01:15:19,081
They won앖 stop until they bury us.

771
01:15:22,261 --> 01:15:23,125
So?

772
01:15:23,662 --> 01:15:26,187
So we bury them first.

773
01:16:11,944 --> 01:16:13,775
l should have quit.

774
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:23,347
l should have driven you
somewhere else.

775
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:16,072
That압 me!

776
01:17:31,524 --> 01:17:33,992
Happy birthday, Johnny.

777
01:17:39,298 --> 01:17:41,732
-You are the man!
-This is your night.

778
01:17:50,142 --> 01:17:52,076
l앐 your birthday present.

779
01:17:53,245 --> 01:17:55,907
-Who압 that?
-You sons of bitches!

780
01:17:56,148 --> 01:17:58,275
We didn앖 do it.

781
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:00,618
Dude, she압 so hot.

782
01:18:00,819 --> 01:18:03,879
Oh, man, she압 so fine.
Youre all over it. Go!

783
01:18:04,156 --> 01:18:06,750
Look at this guy!
Dad압 really hooking him up.

784
01:18:06,992 --> 01:18:10,086
Boy, you are cute, aren앖 you?

785
01:18:11,397 --> 01:18:15,265
You must have some pretty
wonderful friends, Johnny.

786
01:18:15,834 --> 01:18:18,598
Wealthy too, because l앐 not cheap.

787
01:18:23,142 --> 01:18:25,133
Don앖 wait up, boys.

788
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:28,812
l promise he won앖 be home
before midnight.

789
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:32,948
See you!

790
01:18:34,954 --> 01:18:35,978
Damn!

791
01:18:49,168 --> 01:18:50,157
That압 a good boy.

792
01:18:52,605 --> 01:18:54,505
Yeah, right there.

793
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:07,909
Relax.

794
01:19:08,554 --> 01:19:11,148
Who압 the professional here?

795
01:19:11,624 --> 01:19:13,751
So go with it.

796
01:19:13,993 --> 01:19:16,985
l promise you won앖 regret it.

797
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:19,493
There, baby.

798
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:37,479
Relax, kid,
no one앏l get hurt.

799
01:19:41,086 --> 01:19:44,283
Get hurt?
What압 he talking about?

800
01:20:00,105 --> 01:20:02,369
Good to have you back, Mr. Fairfax.

801
01:20:02,608 --> 01:20:07,045
l wish l could say the same. l was
swimming with dolphins this morning.

802
01:20:08,614 --> 01:20:12,380
Easy! lt압 genuine alligator.
What압 the matter with you?

803
01:20:12,618 --> 01:20:14,586
Sorry, Mr. Fairfax.

804
01:20:16,588 --> 01:20:18,522
How압 it going, Charlie?

805
01:20:20,292 --> 01:20:24,558
Porter and Fairfax.
That앏l be a short conversation.

806
01:20:29,268 --> 01:20:33,728
Between us and our neighborhood cops,
l앇 say we got him well covered.

807
01:20:36,108 --> 01:20:37,097
Walter, wake up.

808
01:20:41,547 --> 01:20:42,673
Wake up!

809
01:20:43,816 --> 01:20:45,875
lKeep those bags up, boys.

810
01:20:46,118 --> 01:20:47,210
Come on.

811
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,915
Who the hell are you?

812
01:20:50,656 --> 01:20:53,124
l앐 the reason youre home early.

813
01:20:54,993 --> 01:20:55,891
Youre Porter?

814
01:20:56,462 --> 01:20:59,693
That압 it. lKeep them up
or l앏l drill you.

815
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:07,471
What will you have me do?
Stand on my head?

816
01:21:10,576 --> 01:21:14,103
l want you to do me a favor.
Call Mr. Bronson.

817
01:21:14,313 --> 01:21:16,941
See what we can do
about getting my money back.

818
01:21:18,851 --> 01:21:20,876
He let Carter die.

819
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,718
That poor bastard압
better off dead anyway.

820
01:21:26,091 --> 01:21:27,956
He앇 probably let me die too.

821
01:21:28,193 --> 01:21:30,661
With Carter,
he thought l was bluffing.

822
01:21:31,797 --> 01:21:35,324
Try him. He might be more
receptive than you think.

823
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,833
All right.

824
01:21:40,172 --> 01:21:41,503
You two are fired.

825
01:21:46,779 --> 01:21:48,178
Well, it압 like this.

826
01:21:48,547 --> 01:21:51,778
l앐 in my living room.
There압 a man named Porter...

827
01:21:52,017 --> 01:21:55,009
...who says that
he expects you to pay him.

828
01:21:57,689 --> 01:21:59,281
Of course.

829
01:21:59,525 --> 01:22:01,152
He wants to talk to you.

830
01:22:01,393 --> 01:22:02,758
Put it on the speaker.

831
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:10,700
-This is Porter.
-You got balls, Porter.

832
01:22:11,236 --> 01:22:14,467
You았e proven to be a pain
in the ass. A mosquito.

833
01:22:15,407 --> 01:22:17,932
To get rid of you,
l앏l swat you with 1 30 grand.

834
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:21,042
lt압 not a hund--

835
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:26,373
-What the hell are you doing?
-Fairfax?

836
01:22:26,652 --> 01:22:30,019
lt압 all right. He압 just
killing my alligator bags...

837
01:22:30,222 --> 01:22:32,782
...and shooting holes in my suits.

838
01:22:33,392 --> 01:22:35,053
That압 mean, man!

839
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,692
You aren앖 listening.
lt압 not 1 30--

840
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:38,794
No, you listen.

841
01:22:39,164 --> 01:22:42,622
You앏l get your money,
but you앏l never live to enjoy it.

842
01:22:42,835 --> 01:22:44,735
You let me worry about that.

843
01:22:44,937 --> 01:22:47,804
l want you to deliver
the money yourself.

844
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,039
Youre one hell of an optimist.

845
01:22:51,243 --> 01:22:54,212
What makes you think
l앏l deliver it myself?

846
01:22:54,847 --> 01:22:57,338
lf you don앖,
you앏l never see Johnny again.

847
01:22:59,017 --> 01:23:01,349
Didn앖 come home last night, did he?

848
01:23:01,553 --> 01:23:04,545
He압 a good-looking kid,
but you indulge him too much.

849
01:23:04,756 --> 01:23:06,314
I told him so.

850
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,719
Bullshit. You haven앖 got him.

851
01:23:10,128 --> 01:23:13,825
-Youre not that stupid.
-My dad never bought me a Ferrari.

852
01:23:14,066 --> 01:23:16,261
l had to steal my first one.

853
01:23:16,568 --> 01:23:19,196
Nice inscription on the key chain.

854
01:23:19,438 --> 01:23:21,099
A little sappy.
Want me to read it?

855
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:25,574
Youre dead.
Nobody fucks with my family.

856
01:23:25,878 --> 01:23:26,742
You hear me?

857
01:23:27,813 --> 01:23:29,178
Youre a dead man.

858
01:23:29,448 --> 01:23:33,214
That압 Johnny, unless you
turn up with the money.

859
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,387
ls that a yes?

860
01:23:37,723 --> 01:23:39,384
What? Cat got your crotch?

861
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:43,854
Some decisions are hard, Mr. Bronson.

862
01:23:44,096 --> 01:23:44,960
Where?

863
01:23:46,331 --> 01:23:47,229
l앏l let you know.

864
01:23:47,633 --> 01:23:49,692
I앏l be in touch.

865
01:23:55,974 --> 01:23:59,000
You just signed your own
death warrant for $ 1 30,000.

866
01:23:59,211 --> 01:24:01,406
l don앖 get that. What is it?

867
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:03,871
The principle or something?

868
01:24:05,417 --> 01:24:09,217
Stop it, l앐 getting misty.
And tell him it압 70.

869
01:24:11,023 --> 01:24:13,924
Seventy?
What do you mean, it압 only 70?

870
01:24:14,192 --> 01:24:15,955
Only 70,000?

871
01:24:16,628 --> 01:24:18,892
My suits are worth more than that!

872
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:22,498
Oh, man!

873
01:24:22,801 --> 01:24:26,601
Listen to this:
''Ocean Ray Sundancer.

874
01:24:27,272 --> 01:24:30,435
lcemaker. Camper canvas.

875
01:24:30,943 --> 01:24:32,774
Vacuum-flush head.

876
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:35,344
Eighty thousand bucks.''

877
01:24:37,382 --> 01:24:39,145
He ain앖 going to have it.

878
01:24:39,451 --> 01:24:40,475
You want to bet?

879
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,917
No, l don앖 want to bet.
l앐 out 1 50 already.

880
01:24:46,124 --> 01:24:48,786
1 50 ain앖 getting my damn boat.

881
01:24:49,027 --> 01:24:51,427
He better come down with something.

882
01:24:52,664 --> 01:24:54,154
Hicks. Leary.

883
01:24:54,499 --> 01:24:58,299
Were Holland and Van Owen.
lnternal Affairs.

884
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,365
Back off.
Were on a stakeout.

885
01:25:04,476 --> 01:25:06,171
Step out of the car, please.

886
01:25:06,845 --> 01:25:07,675
What for?

887
01:25:07,913 --> 01:25:10,108
Step out of the car, detectives.

888
01:25:23,729 --> 01:25:25,356
What the hell압 going on?

889
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:26,994
l don앖 know.

890
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:29,061
ls this your badge?

891
01:25:29,701 --> 01:25:32,067
The one you reported missing?

892
01:25:34,072 --> 01:25:35,130
Where앇 you find it?

893
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,973
Where did you lose it?

894
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:42,974
Does this belong to you?

895
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:50,582
lt압 Porter. Follow him.

896
01:25:51,523 --> 01:25:52,820
l got that motherfucker.

897
01:26:14,446 --> 01:26:15,572
Get in.

898
01:26:22,721 --> 01:26:23,619
Close the door.

899
01:26:28,393 --> 01:26:30,054
Set the roscoe on the floor.

900
01:26:32,531 --> 01:26:33,361
Slow!

901
01:26:38,437 --> 01:26:41,770
l앐 going to turn you in
to the Outfit for a reward.

902
01:26:42,474 --> 01:26:46,968
Maybe they앏l ask me to join,
and l앏l be on easy street.

903
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:49,606
Medical. Dental.

904
01:26:50,649 --> 01:26:52,776
l앐 going to walk you right in.

905
01:26:53,318 --> 01:26:55,718
Porter on the hoof.

906
01:26:56,788 --> 01:27:00,588
Unless you get rambunctious.
Then l앏l take care of you--

907
01:27:05,063 --> 01:27:07,122
Youre not going to kill me, are you?

908
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:16,573
Let him go!

909
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:19,008
Now.

910
01:27:25,016 --> 01:27:26,483
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

911
01:28:56,808 --> 01:28:58,901
Who are you?
What are you doing?

912
01:28:59,110 --> 01:28:59,940
Fat boy!

913
01:29:01,313 --> 01:29:03,076
Yeah, l앐 talking to you.

914
01:29:32,277 --> 01:29:34,643
Stop it. Stop it.

915
01:29:35,146 --> 01:29:36,773
l hate this. l hate it!

916
01:29:41,086 --> 01:29:45,216
Look at this stinking place!
Porter, what압 the matter with you?

917
01:29:46,191 --> 01:29:48,819
Tell us where he is
so we can get out of here.

918
01:29:49,294 --> 01:29:50,420
Come on.

919
01:30:00,105 --> 01:30:01,163
Too late now.

920
01:30:05,377 --> 01:30:07,607
He doesn앖 want to say anything.

921
01:30:08,013 --> 01:30:11,107
He just wants to get himself beat up,
that압 all.

922
01:30:16,121 --> 01:30:17,520
Here it is.

923
01:30:17,789 --> 01:30:19,416
1 30,000.

924
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:25,827
That압 as close as
you앏l ever get to it.

925
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:27,823
l앏l make you a deal.

926
01:30:28,533 --> 01:30:31,661
Tell me where John is,
and l앏l finish you quick.

927
01:30:31,903 --> 01:30:35,464
You won앖 have to find out
what your left ball tastes like.

928
01:30:39,311 --> 01:30:43,975
But if there압 even a bruise on him,
l앏l make this last three weeks.

929
01:30:44,716 --> 01:30:48,652
l앏l give you a blood transfusion
to keep you alive.

930
01:30:52,924 --> 01:30:53,948
Where is he?

931
01:31:26,191 --> 01:31:27,249
l앐 waiting.

932
01:31:32,464 --> 01:31:34,329
This piggy went to the market.

933
01:31:48,947 --> 01:31:49,845
l앐 listening.

934
01:32:01,493 --> 01:32:02,755
This piggy stayed home.

935
01:32:08,199 --> 01:32:10,258
Starting to look like roast beef.

936
01:32:13,838 --> 01:32:15,396
Eight to go.

937
01:32:16,074 --> 01:32:17,564
Then it압 your knees.

938
01:32:18,009 --> 01:32:20,443
You can guess where we go from there.

939
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:22,309
Where is he?

940
01:32:34,692 --> 01:32:36,250
Twenty-four....

941
01:32:37,362 --> 01:32:39,057
Twenty-four Fielding.

942
01:32:40,665 --> 01:32:41,791
Apartment 1 1 .

943
01:32:45,537 --> 01:32:48,199
You앏l understand
if l don앖 trust you.

944
01:32:51,109 --> 01:32:54,237
Put him in the trunk.
We앏l take him along.

945
01:32:55,447 --> 01:32:56,846
Let압 go, tough guy.

946
01:33:24,742 --> 01:33:26,710
You two watch the front.

947
01:33:39,257 --> 01:33:41,191
Fuck! Come on, Porter.

948
01:33:48,867 --> 01:33:50,391
Hey, give me a light.

949
01:35:11,149 --> 01:35:15,108
-What the hell압 going on?
-You were right not to trust me.

950
01:35:41,012 --> 01:35:42,570
Help me.

951
01:35:44,882 --> 01:35:46,179
Get out!

952
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:31,324
Come on, Porter.
lt압 been fun. See you later.

953
01:36:31,729 --> 01:36:32,593
Get back here!

954
01:36:32,864 --> 01:36:34,229
You bitch!

955
01:36:35,066 --> 01:36:36,624
Come on, Porter.
Let압 go.

956
01:36:37,101 --> 01:36:38,796
What took you so long?

957
01:36:41,506 --> 01:36:42,939
Come on, Porter.

958
01:36:45,777 --> 01:36:46,709
Get in.

959
01:36:47,445 --> 01:36:48,844
Good boy.

960
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:53,675
What happened?

961
01:36:54,952 --> 01:36:56,078
l got hammered.

962
01:36:57,188 --> 01:36:58,052
You okay?

963
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,198
You got it.

964
01:37:10,768 --> 01:37:12,497
Piece of cake.

965
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:18,072
Where to?

966
01:37:20,478 --> 01:37:22,776
Just drive, baby.

967
01:37:26,984 --> 01:37:29,452
We were going for breakfast...

968
01:37:30,054 --> 01:37:32,022
...in Canada.

969
01:37:33,091 --> 01:37:34,922
We made a deal:

970
01:37:35,159 --> 01:37:37,252
If she앇 stop hooking...

971
01:37:37,495 --> 01:37:39,895
...I앇 stop shooting people.

972
01:37:41,966 --> 01:37:44,264
Maybe we were aiming high.
