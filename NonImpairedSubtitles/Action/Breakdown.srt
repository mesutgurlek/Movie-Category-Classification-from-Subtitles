1
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:16,802
Jesus!

2
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:20,868
Asshole.

3
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:25,172
Man, did you see that?
I mean, he pulled right out in front of me.

4
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:28,809
I took my eyes off the road for a second,
but, I mean, come on.

5
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:32,345
Maybe it's time we take a little break.

6
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,789
We'll pull over the next chance we get.

7
00:04:17,197 --> 00:04:17,925
Nice car.

8
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,362
Thanks.

9
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,266
You got your air, CD.

10
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:28,103
Leather.

11
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:34,376
Looks to me like you sprung forth whole nine yards.

12
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,244
I guess so.

13
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:40,854
But that rig of yours is what you really need out here.

14
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,853
Why would you want this piece of shit
when you got this ride?

15
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,600
What a man needs out here is a C.B. Radio.

16
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,164
Is that right?

17
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:05,074
Yours could be "Shit-for-Brains."

18
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:08,740
Do you even care that you damn near killed us?

19
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,613
I didn't even see you.
You kind of pulled out in front of me.

20
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:14,721
Like hell I did.

21
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:16,112
Let's just forget this.

22
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm sorry. I don't want any trouble.

23
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:23,691
No, I'll bet you don't.

24
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:28,929
Howdy, Ma'am.

25
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:31,268
You should be more careful who you ride with.

26
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:35,670
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

27
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:39,312
He thinks I tried to hit him.

28
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:45,182
Let's go.

29
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:46,849
Should I drive?

30
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:48,182
Later. Just get in.

31
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:54,155
What if I promise not to sidewipe anyone?
- Just get in.

32
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:56,118
I'm kidding.

33
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:23,782
Getting ready forth Grand Prix?

34
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:29,619
What'd you get?

35
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:32,958
A junk food fiesta.

36
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,197
Let's see.

37
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,196
Sno Balls.

38
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,095
Yoo Hoo.

39
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:40,905
And Moon Pies.

40
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,975
Can you believe they still make this stuff?

41
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:47,109
Gourmet cuisine around here.

42
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:58,754
This is crazy. Look at this.

43
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:08,399
It says if you win this mail-in contest...

44
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,103
you can choose between $90,000 or 90,000 donuts.

45
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:18,571
What would you do with 90,000 donuts?

46
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:23,947
I don't know.
Sell then for 30 cents each and pay off this car.

47
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:25,382
No kidding.

48
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,486
$90,000.

49
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,118
That'd solve some problems.

50
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,197
What the hell?

51
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:42,564
What did you do?

52
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:43,863
Nothing.

53
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,570
Hang on. I can't steer.

54
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:38,614
Perfect.

55
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:40,088
Outta range?

56
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,687
So much fortaking the scenic route.

57
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,532
The baffle gasket's burned out.

58
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:51,363
What?

59
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,131
It's connected to the connecting rod.

60
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:56,467
Shut up.

61
00:08:57,677 --> 00:09:00,202
Can you believe this?

62
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,412
This could be our worst decision ever.

63
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:04,850
What are you doing?

64
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:06,044
Just listen.

65
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:08,812
We're changing jobs.

66
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,884
Our finances are pretty fucked.

67
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,427
And we're in the middle of the nowhere.

68
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:18,564
I'd say this is our worst decision ever.

69
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:21,189
Get out of here. You're bugging me.

70
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:23,093
Okay, sweetie.

71
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:25,733
Good luck. I'm going to California.

72
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:27,840
Just leave me the Moon Pies.

73
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:30,373
- Jeff?
- And the donuts.

74
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,410
No, there's a car.

75
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,480
Christ, not these guys.

76
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,527
Assholes.

77
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,701
Jeff.

78
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:18,484
What the hell...

79
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,121
- what's he doing?
- I don't know.

80
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:30,230
This isn't good.

81
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:03,531
Are you okay?

82
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,499
Fine. Except our car broke down.

83
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,504
I saw that.

84
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:09,575
Can I give you a hand?

85
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:10,503
Thanks.

86
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:11,611
Honey, you steer.

87
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:21,481
Massachusetts plates. You folks on vacation?

88
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,779
No, we're moving.

89
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:26,019
Oh yeah? Whereabouts?

90
00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:27,720
San Diego.

91
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:33,059
Do you think we can use your C.B. To radio a tow truck?

92
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:39,233
I wish I could, but I blew a fuse on it this morning.
I'll fix it at the truck stop.

93
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:40,268
How far is that?

94
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,472
About 60 miles.

95
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:45,634
I was just driving along and she quit on me.

96
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,841
Belts... Battery's working.

97
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:51,145
You used to just give...

98
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:55,084
these things a kick and a holler and they'd start.

99
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:56,081
It is a new car.

100
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,283
Have you been riding it pretty hard?

101
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,025
Yeah, I admit a little...

102
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:09,961
Tell you what.

103
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,574
I'll give you a ride to Belle's Diner.

104
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,370
You can call a tow truck from there.

105
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:23,506
That's nice of you to offer, but I think you got it.

106
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:25,150
We'll just let her cool off.

107
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:27,444
Thanks. We appreciate it.

108
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:30,019
Good luck starting it.

109
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:31,180
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

110
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:33,117
Honey.

111
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:35,520
It's probably just overheated.

112
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,193
What if it's not? We don't want to be stuck out here.

113
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:43,996
No, but if we just let it cool off, we'll be okay.

114
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,598
It's getting pretty toasty.
Are you sure you want to blow this ride?

115
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:52,979
No, but...

116
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,872
I don't want to leave the car.

117
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:02,886
What if I go, call the tow truck,
and order a nice cold iced tea?

118
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:05,413
And I stay with the nice hot car.

119
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:06,825
Right.

120
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,922
Right.

121
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:12,496
You'll be okay?

122
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:13,563
I'll be fine.

123
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,194
Excuse me.

124
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:21,606
Can I take you up on that ride?

125
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:23,570
Sure. Step up.

126
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,944
Sure your husband doesn't want to come?

127
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,677
No, he'll stay with the car.

128
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,009
What the hell?

129
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:01,897
Tow truck, my ass.

130
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:08,273
Belle's Diner

131
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:47,613
Excuse me. I'm supposed to meet my wife here.

132
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:52,120
She's dark-haired, about 5'5"...

133
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,728
wearing a whit Benetton sweater.

134
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:57,454
White what?

135
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:58,661
Benetton sweater.

136
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:00,490
Hank!

137
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,357
Your order's up.

138
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,169
I'm busy here. People come and go.

139
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:08,298
This was within the last half hour.
She might have been with a trucker.

140
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,066
Trucker?

141
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:16,212
Doesn't ring a bell.

142
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:18,841
You sure?

143
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:22,921
This man's looking for his wife.

144
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:25,919
Dark hair, a white button on sweater.

145
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:28,860
Traveling with a trucker. Anybody seen 'em?

146
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:36,257
Looks like she got away from you. Cowboy.

147
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:44,370
Maybe she left a message with one of your employees.

148
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:47,971
Impossible. I'm the only one that works here.

149
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:53,743
Is there another Belle's Diner?

150
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:57,355
No siree. Definitely not.

151
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:42,729
Excuse me.
She and I must have gotten our signals crossed.

152
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,001
How far is the next town?

153
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:45,936
20 miles.

154
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:48,638
Do me a favor.

155
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:50,771
If my wife, Amy comes in...

156
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:54,708
tell her I was here and to stay put till I get back.

157
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:56,277
Would you do that, please?

158
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,442
- Okay.
- Thanks.

159
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:10,054
Hey! Pull over!

160
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,156
I don't believe it.

161
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:23,458
Jesus!

162
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:58,401
Hey, man.

163
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:02,331
What are you doing?

164
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,768
I wanted you to pull over. Didn't you see me?

165
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,841
Well?

166
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,805
Never mind. I'm looking for my wife.

167
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:10,815
What?

168
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,145
Where's my wife?

169
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:14,485
How should I know?

170
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,714
I'm the guy with the Jeep.

171
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,986
You gave my wife a ride to Belle's Diner.

172
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,285
Not me. Sorry.

173
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:25,592
Sorry? This was a half hour ago. You don't remember?

174
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:29,535
I've never seen you before in my life.

175
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:33,500
What are you doing?

176
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:37,574
Amy!

177
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,215
I don't know what you want...

178
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:50,454
I want my wife back.

179
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,667
Officer, I need your help.

180
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:03,859
What's the problem?

181
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,937
I think he's done something with my wife.

182
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:09,040
Calm down. What's going on?

183
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:10,266
I don't know.

184
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:13,645
Last I saw her, she was in this guy's truck.

185
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:18,672
- Now he says he never saw her.
- I don't know what he means.

186
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:19,909
You son-of-a-bitch!

187
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:22,887
Calm down. Tell me exactly what happened.

188
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:26,992
Our car broke down.

189
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:30,225
He stopped and offered to help.

190
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,998
He took my wife to a pay phone. Whenever show up.

191
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:35,894
What do you have to say?

192
00:21:37,403 --> 00:21:38,370
I don't know.

193
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:42,302
I'm driving along and he runs me off the road,

194
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:43,669
starts hollering about his wife.

195
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:45,844
I swear I've never seen him before.

196
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:49,973
He's lying.

197
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:56,715
May I search your truck?

198
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,518
Hell, yes. Go ahead.

199
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:01,122
My name's Barr - Red Barr.

200
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,254
My permits are current. Take a look.

201
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:06,727
Stand back behind the line. Both of you.

202
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:48,231
License and registration, please.

203
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:13,194
Are those yours?

204
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:17,029
My personal stuff.

205
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:18,068
Want to look?

206
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:27,008
I think we're done.

207
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:29,205
You can go.

208
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:32,510
Wait. You're not going to question him anymore?

209
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:36,715
I've searched the truck.

210
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:41,326
Maybe you confused my truck with another.

211
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:43,017
Go to hell! Let me see that.

212
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:46,323
Hold on. Your want to get arrested?

213
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,165
The man has a point.

214
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:53,060
This is a plain looking truck.
Looks like a lot of trucks.

215
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:55,471
Maybe you got them mixed up.

216
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,843
Stay put.

217
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,188
Mr. Taylor?

218
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,402
It was him.

219
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:27,535
It was this truck.

220
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:29,039
I can see that.

221
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,205
- Did you get a license plate number?
- No.

222
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:36,012
How about the information on that door?

223
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:38,481
I wasn't paying attention.

224
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:45,215
Mr. Taylor, did you have a beef with your wife today?

225
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,790
What's that got to do with anything?

226
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:53,261
Is there a possibility she could have left you?

227
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,767
I don't believe this.

228
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,634
My wife did not leave me!

229
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:03,906
I've seen it before.
Put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it.

230
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,067
Lovers, married couples, gay guys.

231
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:08,942
They dump their mates on the side of the road.

232
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:10,640
Officer.

233
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:15,285
I'd like to help, but I have a long haul to Fresno.

234
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:21,659
This is insane. Officer. Please.

235
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:25,128
I have his information if I need to find him.

236
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:32,932
Much obliged.

237
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:39,538
No hard feeling. I really hope you find your wife.

238
00:25:48,554 --> 00:25:49,919
Mr. Taylor, come with me.

239
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,581
I believe you that your wife's missing.

240
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:27,859
Maybe you got confused and maybe you didn't.
I'm just trying to help.

241
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:30,653
The town of Brackett is 31 miles that way.

242
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:33,294
My deputy's name is Len Carver.

243
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,726
He'll help you if you want to report your wife missing.

244
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:42,968
Mrs. Gilbert's locked out of her trailer again.
Can you help her?

245
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:46,406
I'm on my way.

246
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:47,403
Will do.

247
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,609
Mr. Taylor, do yourself a favor.

248
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:53,385
Go see my deputy.

249
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,214
It's a couple months old.

250
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:27,180
Is her hair still like this?

251
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:35,994
We'll certainly do your best, Mr. Taylor.

252
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:41,194
Over 100,000 people go missing in this country every year.

253
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:43,762
Runaways, deadbeat dads...

254
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:46,497
dropouts, folks hiding from the I.R. S...

255
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:49,266
All vanishing without a trace.

256
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,473
We get these kinds of pictures all the time.

257
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:56,447
I'm not saying your wife if one.

258
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:58,181
I sure hope not.

259
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:02,951
But unless there's a ransom demand
or evidence of forced abduction...

260
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:06,616
the F.B.I. Won't look at your case
until it's been 24 hours.

261
00:28:08,427 --> 00:28:10,861
Nevertheless, we'll keep our eyes peeled.

262
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,437
Mr. Taylor.

263
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:24,305
Why don't you go to Belle's?

264
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,370
Get a cup of coffee, wait for your wife.

265
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,545
If anything comes up, I'll contact you.

266
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:32,548
How's that sound?

267
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:00,577
Did my wife come in?

268
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:03,578
Didn't see her.

269
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,107
She didn't come in?

270
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:09,352
Like I said, maybe she was in, maybe she wasn't.

271
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:12,622
I'm saying I didn't see her.

272
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,731
It ain't my business, but if I was you...

273
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:26,895
I'd check the ladies' room.

274
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:43,182
Amy!

275
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:49,858
I'll be right with you, cowboy.

276
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,571
Let me see your order slips.

277
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:38,467
What?

278
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:40,506
You write down the names.

279
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,174
Are you nuts? I don't have to show you jack-shit!

280
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:49,151
If my wife was here, her name's in that pile.

281
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,382
You calling me a liar?

282
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:55,992
Let me see the fucking slips!

283
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:06,735
I've had just about enough of you.

284
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:38,936
Get me the Sheriff's office.

285
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:43,703
My name's Billy.

286
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:48,279
You the fella looking for his wife?

287
00:31:56,188 --> 00:31:56,950
Have you seen her?

288
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,814
If you know something, tell me.

289
00:32:00,192 --> 00:32:02,592
I saw her, maybe.

290
00:32:02,995 --> 00:32:03,962
Where? When?

291
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:07,258
Inside a little while ago.

292
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,331
She came in on a truck.

293
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,031
- A big semi.
- Then what?

294
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:19,367
Then she left on another truck.

295
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:21,243
With who?

296
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,443
With some men.

297
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:28,277
They think I'm a dummy, but I ain't.

298
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:31,082
I'll get my trucker's license one day.

299
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:34,683
This is important.
Did you see where they took my wife?

300
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:41,392
Route 7 North up by the river.

301
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:42,500
By the river? Where?

302
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:51,475
They don't tell me that kind of thing.

303
00:32:52,077 --> 00:32:53,942
Who doesn't? The bartender?

304
00:32:54,746 --> 00:32:55,713
The men in the truck?

305
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:59,242
I ain't talking to you no more.

306
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:04,082
Come with me to the police
and tell them what you saw.

307
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:07,081
Now you're the dummy.

308
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,190
What does that mean?

309
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:13,697
Don't you get it? The police are in on it.

310
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:32,278
Work, god damn it.

311
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,657
Hello, Steve, this is Jeffrey Taylor.

312
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,824
Please don't put me on hold.

313
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:49,058
I need a favor.

314
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:52,069
I have to talk to your friend at the F.B.I.

315
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:55,899
Right. It's about Amy.

316
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:57,742
Something's happening...

317
00:33:58,243 --> 00:34:01,178
I thing she's been... She's missing.

318
00:34:07,386 --> 00:34:10,150
Steve? No, don't call me back.

319
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,789
Don't, Steve.

320
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:39,642
Get out of the car now!

321
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,374
What do you want?

322
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:31,994
He's getting away!

323
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:39,413
What the hell's going on?

324
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,324
He went down the river.

325
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:21,527
We're pulling it out now.

326
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:24,726
Careful. Don't let it come loose.

327
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:25,661
I got it.

328
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:31,943
This is what happens
when you get one without the other.

329
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:33,906
How will we explain this to Boyd?

330
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:34,740
I ain't.

331
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:44,019
You all right?

332
00:39:57,302 --> 00:39:59,668
According to your wife...

333
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:03,097
you have a lot of cash in your bank account. True?

334
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:05,807
There's some.

335
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,535
"Some' doesn't cut it.

336
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,005
She gave us an exact amount.

337
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,085
There are different accounts.

338
00:40:18,723 --> 00:40:20,020
The balance fluctuates.

339
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:21,351
Fluctuates my ass.

340
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:26,991
A hotshot fuck like you always watches his bottom line.

341
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:31,764
What do you think?

342
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,131
I think we've been lied to.

343
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:36,303
He ain't a goddamn donut king.

344
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:38,973
The slut lied to save her ass.

345
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:40,105
Piece of shit.

346
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:41,103
I'll do him.

347
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,007
$90,000!

348
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:45,808
$90,000.

349
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:54,691
Crawl your ass out of there.

350
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:17,608
You're a tough man to reach.

351
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:20,280
What do you want?

352
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,350
It's not what I want, it's what you want.

353
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:27,387
How bad do you want it? It will cost you.

354
00:41:28,493 --> 00:41:29,892
I can't show it to you now...

355
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:33,019
It's about 5'5". 115lbs.

356
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:35,266
Three or four of that is pure tit.

357
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:38,759
Nice curly brown hair upstairs and down.

358
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:41,197
Nice curly brown hair upstairs and down.

359
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:43,436
Interested?

360
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:46,936
Why?

361
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:50,178
What does this... why us?

362
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:02,589
Bring him up here.

363
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:05,930
The town of Brackett.

364
00:42:07,665 --> 00:42:08,927
It's a shit-hole in the middle of nowhere.

365
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,905
See that bank?

366
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:17,974
You're going to tell the manager to express wire...

367
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,206
$90,000 from your bank account in Boston.

368
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:24,681
How do I know she's still alive?

369
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,349
Shut up!

370
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:31,783
Come on, Jeff.

371
00:42:32,624 --> 00:42:34,091
Pay attention.

372
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:41,288
See the building with the flag pole on top?

373
00:42:44,135 --> 00:42:45,329
That's the sheriff's station.

374
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:48,898
There are two cops. One has desk duty,

375
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:50,938
the other is patrolling the foothills.

376
00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:52,769
A minute ago, Billy...

377
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:55,877
called in an accident on the l-40 connector.

378
00:42:57,882 --> 00:42:59,850
See? There he goes.

379
00:43:02,554 --> 00:43:06,923
It will take him 20 minutes to get there,
spend 10 minutes there,

380
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,486
200 minutes back.

381
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,687
That's 50 minutes.
Exactly the time you have to get my money.

382
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:21,869
Before you get any half-baked ideas
about calling in the cavalry...

383
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,041
remember, we'll be watching you.

384
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,478
We'll be listening on those scanners.

385
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:30,978
If we see anything unusual...

386
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,009
an unmarked car, a plane,

387
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:35,482
anyone who even smells like a cop...

388
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:39,283
you can just keep your fucking money.

389
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:42,959
I'll send you pieces of her from time to time.

390
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:47,593
Billy.

391
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:49,897
Give him the jacket.

392
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:55,632
Put it on, Jeff.

393
00:43:56,141 --> 00:43:58,439
Can't go into a bank looking like that.

394
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:05,140
We don't have to do this. I'll get you the money.
I swear.

395
00:44:06,384 --> 00:44:08,909
I promise. Just let my wife go, please.

396
00:44:10,488 --> 00:44:11,716
49 minutes, Jeff.

397
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,952
Time to get the show on the road.

398
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,671
My driver's license and credit card.

399
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:14,545
My bank account number.

400
00:45:14,986 --> 00:45:16,010
How long will this take?

401
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:19,922
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

402
00:45:20,058 --> 00:45:21,923
I only have $5,000 in that account.

403
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,423
How much can you advance me?

404
00:45:25,697 --> 00:45:26,356
Excuse me?

405
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:29,364
Can you advance me the $6,000 limit on my credit card?

406
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,927
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

407
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,799
The limit for non-customers is $500 a day.

408
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:40,943
Sir, are you sure you're all right?

409
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:43,943
Yeah, I'm fine.

410
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,916
Just transfer the money, okay?

411
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:09,498
I'll tell you something.

412
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:14,408
What I'm about to tell you...

413
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:19,149
you can't tell anyone. Understand?

414
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:27,881
Whatever happens, just keep writing on that pad.

415
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,889
Please, just keep writing.

416
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:37,462
They're probably watching me right now.

417
00:46:38,736 --> 00:46:40,465
The town's under surveillance.

418
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:46,172
If I don't walk out of here with...

419
00:46:49,147 --> 00:46:50,705
Excuse me. You the manager?

420
00:46:51,616 --> 00:46:52,708
Yes, I am.

421
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:55,244
That lady said to see you about a car loan.

422
00:46:56,187 --> 00:46:57,313
Certainly.

423
00:46:57,989 --> 00:46:59,923
If you would take a seat.

424
00:47:24,148 --> 00:47:29,586
Just forget it. I had a car accident... a miner one.

425
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:31,512
I'm just kind of...

426
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,050
How long will this take?

427
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:39,354
It will take a few minutes.

428
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:57,780
Yeah, I um, I'm calling regarding account number
98258103.

429
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,242
Jeffre Taylor.

430
00:48:05,523 --> 00:48:07,491
Well, he'd like to liquidate his account.

431
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:30,038
Shit.

432
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:40,972
It's me.

433
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,404
No shit. I can see that. How much do you have?

434
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:51,114
The whole thing. $90,000.

435
00:50:52,423 --> 00:50:53,117
That's good.

436
00:50:53,758 --> 00:50:56,022
Start walking toward the main road

437
00:50:56,193 --> 00:50:58,093
and get in the first car that stops.

438
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:01,461
When do I see my wife?

439
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:04,325
Soon enough. Just start walking.

440
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:19,643
Throw the money on the seat.

441
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,947
First tell me where she is.

442
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:27,082
Wrong, asshole. First you give me the money.

443
00:52:28,452 --> 00:52:31,649
Unless you want me to shoot your ass dead right here.

444
00:52:51,142 --> 00:52:52,006
Turn around.

445
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:55,373
Do it!

446
00:53:02,486 --> 00:53:03,976
Put your hands behind you.

447
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:20,501
Get in the truck. On your knees.

448
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:22,237
Get in here.

449
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:43,587
I gave you the money, now let her go.

450
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:48,325
What the hell...

451
00:54:00,377 --> 00:54:01,309
It's a done deal.

452
00:54:02,379 --> 00:54:03,175
I'm heading in.

453
00:54:12,923 --> 00:54:15,221
You're the dumbest mother fucker yet.

454
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:19,262
Think we picked you out of the clear blue?

455
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:21,355
Shiny new car.

456
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,967
Massachusetts plates.

457
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:26,527
Probably be a week before anybody misses you.

458
00:54:27,671 --> 00:54:30,071
I gave you the money, now let her go.

459
00:54:31,942 --> 00:54:34,137
"Rich Assholes Looking for Trouble?"

460
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:55,232
I wish I had been there to see your face
when your car seized up.

461
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:58,534
Maybe you'll learn not to leave your hood open...

462
00:54:58,669 --> 00:54:59,636
when you go in the store.

463
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,992
These are goddamn singles!

464
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:38,131
Where is she?

465
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,237
Fuck you.

466
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,329
No, fuck you!

467
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,707
You like that? How about this?

468
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:49,411
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

469
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:51,715
The fuck you don't know.

470
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,582
Stop.

471
00:56:58,656 --> 00:57:00,453
What? You want me to stop?

472
00:57:00,624 --> 00:57:01,648
Want me to stop?

473
00:57:01,825 --> 00:57:04,157
I'll bet this baby stops on a fucking dime!

474
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:20,176
What the hell?

475
00:57:28,786 --> 00:57:29,445
Where is she?

476
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,687
She's with Billy.

477
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:31,444
Where?

478
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:32,853
Driving around.

479
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:33,513
Bullshit!

480
00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:38,662
I'm in pursuit of a black Ford pickup truck.

481
00:57:39,063 --> 00:57:40,394
Contact the State Police.

482
00:57:40,597 --> 00:57:44,533
We're headed north on Highway 31. I need backup.

483
00:57:45,269 --> 00:57:47,829
- Where were you headed?
- The truck stop.

484
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:48,903
Where exactly?!

485
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:51,303
On the main highway. The Texaco.

486
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,070
Help me. My wife's been kidnapped.

487
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:01,771
Drop the gun!

488
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:03,505
Get down!

489
00:58:03,716 --> 00:58:05,013
I know where she is.

490
00:58:07,786 --> 00:58:09,651
I'm down. Listen to me.

491
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:10,883
He's in on it.

492
00:58:11,223 --> 00:58:12,918
They kidnapped my wife.

493
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:16,855
They have her at the Texaco truck stop.

494
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:18,727
Shut up!

495
00:58:20,332 --> 00:58:21,492
You in the pickup, you okay?

496
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:25,828
Yes, sir, I'm okay.

497
00:58:26,438 --> 00:58:27,097
Can you get out?

498
00:58:27,473 --> 00:58:29,373
Yes. Please don't shoot.

499
00:58:29,842 --> 00:58:32,402
There's a bag of money in there!

500
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:34,376
Face down and shut up!

501
00:58:36,615 --> 00:58:37,479
Get out, damn it!

502
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:40,482
God damn it, listen to me!

503
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:42,150
Shut up!

504
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,759
Shit-for-Brains.

505
00:59:18,123 --> 00:59:19,055
Shots fired.

506
00:59:21,493 --> 00:59:22,460
Officer down.

507
00:59:28,367 --> 00:59:29,493
Suspect identified.

508
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:36,303
This is dispatch. What is your 20?

509
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:40,111
Send an ambulance.

510
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:41,440
Who's this?

511
00:59:42,748 --> 00:59:43,510
Can you respond?

512
00:59:43,649 --> 00:59:44,479
They're coming.

513
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:51,751
We'll get you an ambulance.

514
00:59:55,594 --> 00:59:59,121
All units. Officer down. Repeat. Officer down.

515
01:01:19,111 --> 01:01:21,739
He was supposed to be here a half hour ago.

516
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:25,473
I heard a report about a cop down.

517
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:30,881
There's too much heat around here,
so stay off the airwaves.

518
01:01:31,056 --> 01:01:34,992
Get his wife and meet me at the barn,
even if you have to drive all night.

519
01:05:36,134 --> 01:05:37,158
Daddy, you're home!

520
01:05:38,336 --> 01:05:39,360
- Miss me?
- Yeah.

521
01:05:40,238 --> 01:05:41,762
Deke, get back to bed.

522
01:05:42,207 --> 01:05:44,141
I expected you back next wee.

523
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:46,769
I finished early and now I'm home.

524
01:05:47,045 --> 01:05:49,240
Al and Billy are coming over.

525
01:05:49,514 --> 01:05:52,244
It's 6:00A.M. Can't they come another time?

526
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:55,486
We have stuff to do. It'll take a couple hours.

527
01:05:55,854 --> 01:05:57,014
Would you make breakfast?

528
01:05:57,923 --> 01:05:58,617
Hey, Deke!

529
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:00,985
- Will you open the barn?
- Okay.

530
01:06:34,226 --> 01:06:35,887
Hey, Dekey. Thanks.

531
01:06:36,995 --> 01:06:37,859
I have something for you.

532
01:06:40,899 --> 01:06:41,831
Here, son.

533
01:06:42,334 --> 01:06:42,959
Look at that.

534
01:06:43,802 --> 01:06:44,598
Cool!

535
01:06:44,769 --> 01:06:47,636
A real Swiss Army knife.

536
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,668
Good boy.

537
01:07:32,984 --> 01:07:33,609
Deke?

538
01:07:35,487 --> 01:07:36,613
Deke, you back there?

539
01:09:31,503 --> 01:09:36,440
I hope I never see another couple from Massachusetts.

540
01:09:36,908 --> 01:09:39,001
We have a lot of work to do.

541
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,541
Any word on Earl?

542
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:41,473
Not a thing.

543
01:09:41,813 --> 01:09:42,438
Me neither.

544
01:09:43,948 --> 01:09:46,212
We have to get this stuff off the truck.

545
01:09:58,897 --> 01:10:00,125
None of this would have happened...

546
01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:02,358
if you'd gotten them at the same time.

547
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:04,198
He wouldn't get in the truck.

548
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:09,031
I suppose you'd chase him down with a gun.
Fucking idiot.

549
01:10:09,107 --> 01:10:10,165
I'm just saying...

550
01:10:10,475 --> 01:10:13,842
we should have gotten rid of them like that Ohio couple.

551
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:16,972
So we stay out of the area for a few months.

552
01:10:18,783 --> 01:10:19,477
Al!

553
01:10:21,219 --> 01:10:21,947
Come on.

554
01:10:28,393 --> 01:10:29,985
Okay, homey. Time to get up.

555
01:10:31,463 --> 01:10:33,897
- Let's go!
- Come on, move it.

556
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:35,661
Get up!

557
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:38,865
Dead?

558
01:10:40,638 --> 01:10:43,266
Must have died from the exhaust. Suicide!

559
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:46,401
Couldn't be any cleaner than that.

560
01:10:48,012 --> 01:10:51,140
We'll bury her out back.

561
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,550
Jesus! Goddamn!

562
01:11:04,662 --> 01:11:05,686
Scared me to death!

563
01:11:07,232 --> 01:11:09,700
Let me do her. I'll cut her head off.

564
01:11:10,268 --> 01:11:11,599
Warren?

565
01:11:11,803 --> 01:11:12,963
Shit, it's my wife.

566
01:11:13,571 --> 01:11:15,630
Cover her. Put her in the freezer.

567
01:11:36,728 --> 01:11:38,252
She's a feisty one, isn't she?

568
01:11:52,944 --> 01:11:54,104
Don't give me any trouble.

569
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:57,409
God damn it! Cut your fucking squirming!

570
01:11:57,682 --> 01:11:59,741
Come on, it's not as bad as it sounds.

571
01:12:00,485 --> 01:12:03,852
It will take you 10 minutes to suck all that air out.

572
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:14,688
Come on, fellas.

573
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:19,829
Let's go eat!

574
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:34,083
Hey, Mrs. C.

575
01:12:34,118 --> 01:12:36,643
Are coming to breakfast?

576
01:12:36,754 --> 01:12:37,584
I've been calling you.

577
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:39,486
We could use some pancakes.

578
01:15:10,742 --> 01:15:12,505
This rooster must have weighed 10 lbs.

579
01:15:13,344 --> 01:15:16,472
It's reaching out forth highway patrol cop.

580
01:15:24,022 --> 01:15:24,852
Give me the key.

581
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:27,814
Mister.

582
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:29,517
You son-of-a-bitch!

583
01:15:30,428 --> 01:15:33,454
My wife is locked up in your fucking barn!

584
01:15:33,865 --> 01:15:37,562
Give me the key or I'll blow your fucking head off!

585
01:15:37,769 --> 01:15:38,793
What's going on?

586
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,935
I don't know. Stay calm.

587
01:15:41,072 --> 01:15:44,701
- Your husband's a murderer and a kidnapper.
- Give me the fucking key!

588
01:15:45,743 --> 01:15:46,573
Freeze, Mister.

589
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:00,923
Just keep that gun on him.

590
01:16:03,494 --> 01:16:05,655
My daddy's rifle is always loaded.

591
01:16:06,264 --> 01:16:08,732
So I can protect Mommy when he was away.

592
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,724
I won't hurt your mom.

593
01:16:10,968 --> 01:16:11,866
He's lying, Deke.

594
01:16:13,504 --> 01:16:14,471
Go on, son.

595
01:16:16,374 --> 01:16:17,773
Squeeze that trigger.

596
01:16:19,077 --> 01:16:20,237
Don't listen to him.

597
01:16:20,511 --> 01:16:21,307
Go on, Deke.

598
01:16:21,446 --> 01:16:22,845
Don't listen to him.

599
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:25,306
Do what I say. Squeeze that trigger.

600
01:16:26,117 --> 01:16:28,677
Put it down, Deke. Nothing will happen.

601
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:31,721
Do it!

602
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:38,128
Don't move.

603
01:16:41,332 --> 01:16:42,230
Nobody move!

604
01:16:44,102 --> 01:16:46,570
Get over by you mom.

605
01:16:50,241 --> 01:16:52,038
Get over there!

606
01:16:54,312 --> 01:16:54,937
Shit!

607
01:17:01,185 --> 01:17:03,676
Stick together and get out out that door.

608
01:17:03,921 --> 01:17:05,445
Move it!

609
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:09,023
Turn around! Turn around!

610
01:17:15,233 --> 01:17:15,790
Open it.

611
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:30,842
Open that freezer.

612
01:17:33,818 --> 01:17:35,649
Warren, what is this?

613
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,544
Pull the chain, Arieen.

614
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:45,185
Open it!

615
01:17:51,669 --> 01:17:54,433
You'd better pray she's alive.

616
01:18:01,112 --> 01:18:01,703
Amy.

617
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:03,905
Jeff.

618
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:08,043
You made it, baby.

619
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:10,454
Get away from me!

620
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,784
Come on, honey.

621
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:23,196
You son-of-a-bitch, get down there!

622
01:18:24,068 --> 01:18:25,092
All of you!

623
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:36,409
You remember this.

624
01:18:36,781 --> 01:18:37,907
You fuck!

625
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:51,256
It's all right. It's okay.

626
01:18:51,796 --> 01:18:54,856
Listen to me, Amy. Honey, listen to me.

627
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,795
There's one still out there.

628
01:18:59,937 --> 01:19:00,995
We need to get out of here.

629
01:19:15,519 --> 01:19:16,076
Shit!

630
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:29,496
Can you get to that truck?

631
01:19:32,703 --> 01:19:33,260
Come on.

632
01:20:20,318 --> 01:20:22,081
My name is Jeffrey Taylor. This is an emergency.

633
01:20:23,954 --> 01:20:26,047
Someone's trying to kill me and my wife!

634
01:20:26,891 --> 01:20:28,483
We're on a farm.

635
01:20:30,394 --> 01:20:31,725
Start tracing this call.

636
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:34,720
Got them!

637
01:20:40,905 --> 01:20:41,462
Move!

638
01:20:49,714 --> 01:20:50,339
Come on.

639
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:55,716
Give me the keys!

640
01:21:08,099 --> 01:21:08,690
Come on!

641
01:21:10,835 --> 01:21:11,426
Go!

642
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:30,611
Do you see him?

643
01:21:31,956 --> 01:21:32,581
- Do you see him?
- No.

644
01:21:46,003 --> 01:21:46,560
Are you okay?

645
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:00,846
Want some?

646
01:22:30,514 --> 01:22:30,946
Hang on!

647
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:24,926
Shit.

648
01:23:26,203 --> 01:23:26,794
I'm out.

649
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:21,622
- Let's go.
- I can't get out!

650
01:26:53,043 --> 01:26:53,566
Don't move.

651
01:26:54,211 --> 01:26:54,768
Don't move.

652
01:27:07,291 --> 01:27:08,189
I'll get you out.

653
01:27:10,461 --> 01:27:12,986
Come here. Come on.

654
01:27:17,334 --> 01:27:18,596
Pull!

655
01:27:19,536 --> 01:27:20,730
That's it!

656
01:27:21,071 --> 01:27:21,730
Pull!

657
01:27:30,981 --> 01:27:31,572
Are you okay?
