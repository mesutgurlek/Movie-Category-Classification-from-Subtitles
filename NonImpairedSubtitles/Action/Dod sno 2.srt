1
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:51,876
It all started out so nice.

2
00:00:57,042 --> 00:01:00,792
A bunch of kids going
to a cabin in the mountains.

3
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,209
Drinking, laughing,

4
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,626
having fun.

5
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,959
And then a horde
of Nazi zombies shows up.

6
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:19,251
I know. Sounds like a cliche,
but that's what happened.

7
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,834
You see, we found something...

8
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,126
something we shouldn't have.

9
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,709
Old Nazi gold.

10
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:36,417
And then...

11
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,459
all hell broke loose.

12
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,626
They took us out...

13
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:54,751
one...

14
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,667
...by one.

15
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,376
One of them bit me,

16
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,084
but I knew how to fix that.

17
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,334
And my girlfriend,

18
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,792
Hanna”.

19
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:21,626
She...

20
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:25,792
She didn't make it.

21
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,834
I found the gold...

22
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:33,501
gave it back...

23
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,209
and I was free to go.

24
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:44,584
I was safe.

25
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:07,876
Turns out...

26
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,542
I was wrong.

27
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,001
Take your fucking coin!

28
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:13,834
Crawl back to the hell you came from! Huh?

29
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:22,959
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit,

30
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,792
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

31
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,417
Okay. Okay. Okay.

32
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,251
Fuck.

33
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,209
I told them not to touch that shrine.

34
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,751
Radio.

35
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,876
Always something good on the radio.

36
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,167
The Arctic Tern is a sea bird

37
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,501
of the Tern family Sternidae.

38
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,751
The species is strongly migratory,

39
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:56,626
seeing two summers each year,

40
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:59,001
as it migrates from
its northern breeding grounds

41
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,042
along a winding route

42
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:04,542
to the oceans
around Antarctica and back,

43
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,834
a round trip of about 70,000...

44
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:12,459
The Tern flies as well as glides...

45
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,834
Gruppe...

46
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,876
Sieg Heil!

47
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:37,334
- Doctor?
- Yes.

48
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:45,501
Oh,good.

49
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,001
Let's see what we got here.

50
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,167
Martin, can you hear me?

51
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,417
Martin, are you there?

52
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,501
Welcome back.

53
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,751
Martin, you crashed your car.

54
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,251
Badly.

55
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,292
You're lucky to be alive.

56
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,084
More than you can say about your friends.

57
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:11,917
Did you see them?

58
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,084
The things?

59
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:17,042
The creatures?

60
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,667
Did the police take them?

61
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:24,792
Or the Army?

62
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,292
Erlend?

63
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,542
Roy?

64
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,334
Hanna?

65
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,917
We found your friends. All of them.

66
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:36,834
Dead.

67
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:39,959
Hanna-- is that your girlfriend?

68
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:44,667
We found her too,
with an ax jammed into her throat.

69
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,917
With your fingerprints all over it.

70
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,251
Any idea how that happened?

71
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:54,292
The things...

72
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:58,209
They came up-- came from up--

73
00:09:58,209 --> 00:09:59,459
from the snow.

74
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,251
Nazis. I had an ax, and I...

75
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,876
The little Nazi creatures came up from the earth?

76
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,376
Are you certain he didn't suffer any brain damage?

77
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,001
Okay, call his family, tell them he's awake,

78
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,792
and get the DA, tell him to send a car

79
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,792
and four extra guys, out of here.

80
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:21,334
They will kill again if we don't stop--

81
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,709
Martin, Martin, Martin, Martin.

82
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,959
Calm down. I've seen what you've done.

83
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,167
I was there.

84
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,876
The only place you're going is jail.

85
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:32,209
Nobody knows exactly what happened up there.

86
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,167
Only you do.

87
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,376
Besides, it's not only bad news.

88
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,334
When we found you, you were hurt.

89
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:43,251
Your right arm was ripped off by the elbow.

90
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:45,834
- Yeah, I--
- It was cold when we found you.

91
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,084
The snow kept you cool, which was good.

92
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:49,792
You understand?

93
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,167
And so, we found your arm in the car.

94
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,667
Yeah, it was a bit bruised and pale,

95
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,959
but the operation was a success.

96
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,876
We managed to put your arm right back on.

97
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,751
Huh?

98
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:23,959
What have you done?

99
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,292
What have you done?

100
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,501
Please calm down, my friend. Martin, please--

101
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,001
This is Satan's arm!

102
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,876
Martin, calm down, please.

103
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:36,584
Hey, he)!-

104
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:00,251
I'm so-- It is not me! It's not-- I'm sorry!

105
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:01,792
"'M sorry!
<i>'</i> Stop it!

106
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:00,876
Emma?

107
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:06,542
I think you have to remove your teeth tonight,

108
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:09,959
'cause I'm in the mood for some head.

109
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,959
Von der einer der entkommen ist.

110
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,584
Boden.

111
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,959
Warm.

112
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,126
Manner...

113
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:53,167
sind verratten.

114
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:58,334
Wir brauchen mehr Manner.

115
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,626
Ah, Jesus!

116
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:28,959
You scared me, Nils.

117
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:32,667
I'm telling you, I'm not in the mood for this.

118
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,292
I had a long day today.

119
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,667
Two funerals and two weddings.

120
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,209
And one of the girls getting married today--

121
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,501
she was so fucking hot.

122
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,126
What I wouldn't give to be 15 years younger,

123
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:46,751
and, yeah, not a priest, of course.

124
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,417
Nils?

125
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,459
Sieg...

126
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,126
Heil.

127
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:58,792
Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil,

128
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:03,209
Sieg Heil,

129
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:08,501
Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil...

130
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,542
They're down from the mountain.

131
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,626
They're gonna kill us all.

132
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,459
Fuck!

133
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:25,876
Hey!

134
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,917
They're down from the mountain!

135
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,251
Get me the fuck out of here!

136
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:32,709
Get me out!

137
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,709
They're coming!

138
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,292
They're gonna kill us all!

139
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,459
They're gonna kill us all!

140
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,876
Psst! Hey! Hey, you.

141
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,042
Psst! Yeah, you.

142
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:53,792
Hello.

143
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:58,667
I saw your arm. Looks really cool.

144
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,376
Took some pictures, too.

145
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,542
Looks sick, but still cool.

146
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:05,542
I'm not supposed to be in here,

147
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,834
but I snuck in here like a ninja.

148
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:09,917
- Ninja?
- Yeah.

149
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:13,751
Oh, I'm Bobby.

150
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,834
I'm here on vacation with my mom.

151
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,709
She ate some bad fish yesterday, so, yeah...

152
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:23,042
Hmm. Cool. Seriously cool.

153
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:27,417
It looks burned and old,

154
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,959
like a zombie arm.

155
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,334
Zombies are cool.

156
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,042
Zombies?

157
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,584
Sorry, gotta take this.

158
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:38,334
They're wondering if I can get some more info.

159
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,834
More than just a picture of the arm.

160
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,501
Who? What?

161
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,417
The Zombie Squad.

162
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,126
They're wondering if I can get some more info.

163
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,876
They're experts on zombies. They lived in America.

164
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:51,501
They've trained for this for years,

165
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,292
just waiting for a zombie outbreak to happen.

166
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,542
So they can come here?

167
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:57,667
Just tell them to come here
right now to get the zombies!

168
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,709
If they're experts,
they can kill the zombies for us.

169
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:01,417
- I know. You've seen the zombies?
- Yeah.

170
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,876
- 'Cause they're real, right?
- Yeah.

171
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,542
- Yeah.
- Can you help me get loose?

172
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,334
I'm not sure if I should. I mean, you're...

173
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,751
- I have chocolate.
- You do?

174
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,042
- Yeah.
- Nice.

175
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,334
Yeah, I have chocolate.

176
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,917
'Cause I could get it for you, but, you know...

177
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,501
- Yeah.
- So...

178
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:22,126
- Double-triple fudge.
- Oh, my God!

179
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:23,042
Yeah.

180
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,959
Let me get this right here...

181
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,667
Come on! You can do it.

182
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,792
Come on-- Yeah.

183
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,667
Help me with the other.

184
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:45,334
- Can I have my chocolate now?
- There's no chocolate, kid.

185
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,459
- No chocolate?
- Shut the fuck up!

186
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:48,584
What?

187
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:53,792
I gotta get out.

188
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,126
What are you--

189
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:06,709
Hey!

190
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,334
It's not what it looks like.

191
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:15,626
Stop!

192
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:10,792
Hello?

193
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,001
This is Daniel Heffernan,
leader of the Zombie Squad.

194
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,834
Can I please speak to Bobby?

195
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,209
Bobby”.

196
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,042
Bobby,uh”.

197
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,542
I don't speak the language of Thor.

198
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:25,751
Is Bobby there?
Bobby was killed by zombies.

199
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:27,334
My God!

200
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,834
Is this the Zombie Squad?

201
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:32,209
That is a 10-4, Martin.

202
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:33,959
We will be heading your way shortly.

203
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:38,001
Before we go, we need as much
information as you can give us.

204
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,042
Anything you have.

205
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:40,751
Well...

206
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:47,417
We came up to the cabin
and there was a bunch of...

207
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,626
Nazi zombies there, and...

208
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:55,042
You know, they killed us all, and...

209
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,542
Except me. Yeah, and...

210
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:01,459
I sawed my arm off, but it's...

211
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,876
Yeah, the arm is-- And...

212
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:08,001
I think they wanted treasure, or a coin, and...

213
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,501
Were any of you bitten?

214
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:10,959
We were all bitten.

215
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:15,084
But we didn't become one of them, we just...

216
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:20,501
We just died, so...

217
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:25,459
Listen, Martin, and listen good.

218
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:28,501
These are not your classic, textbook zombies

219
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:31,292
just hungering to feast on the flesh of man.

220
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:34,084
No, these are most likely
cursed zombies,

221
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:37,209
awakened to reclaim something
that was stolen from them,

222
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:39,876
or to complete a task given to them.

223
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:41,917
They called him Herzog.

224
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,834
They called him Herzog.

225
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,167
Martin of the North,

226
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,084
we will be on our way shortly.

227
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,542
And we will take care of this infection.

228
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:56,709
We are professionals. But until then,

229
00:25:56,709 --> 00:26:00,334
find out what they seek, their purpose.

230
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:01,959
Bye.

231
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,126
Zombie Squad.

232
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,042
Zombie Squad is coming. They'll be...

233
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:16,084
They're professionals.

234
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:18,542
Okay, girls.

235
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:22,084
Looks like we're going to Norway.

236
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:28,834
Norway?

237
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:30,584
We can't go to Norway.

238
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:32,292
That's on the other side of the world!

239
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:35,667
Yeah, and how do we know it's for real?

240
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,542
Daniel, that's a long way to go
to find out if it's a hoax.

241
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,917
You guys saw the picture.

242
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:42,126
This is a bona fide infected arm.

243
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:43,709
You know this. This is...

244
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,709
All the signs are there, guys.

245
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:48,042
The decayed skin, the rotten hair, the dark blood.

246
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:49,667
This is real, guys. It's real.

247
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,126
This could be dangerous!

248
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,126
No shit. It's fucking zombies!

249
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:55,126
Of course it'll be dangerous!

250
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,251
But this is what we've been waiting for.

251
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:01,001
This is our chance to prove
to everyone that we were right.

252
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:03,751
We've been telling everyone for years

253
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,501
that it's just a matter of time

254
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,292
before the first outbreak happens.

255
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,626
And what have we seen in return?

256
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:11,709
Laughter.

257
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:13,876
Ridicule.

258
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:16,959
Wedgies.

259
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:20,417
Well...

260
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,292
Guess who was right?

261
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:25,917
Guess who's laughing now?

262
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:29,084
- I guess we're laughing now.
- You're damn right, we are!

263
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:32,126
What did we start the Zombie Squad
for if it wasn't for this?

264
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,167
He's right. Damn right, I'm right.

265
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,167
Besides, if we don't do this,

266
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,626
if we don't go there and help these people,

267
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:41,292
who the hell will?

268
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,417
Yeah.

269
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,626
- So what do we do?
- Yes!

270
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,542
Okay. We need as much information

271
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,126
as we can get on this Herzog character,

272
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:55,001
on Martin, the north of Norway, everything.

273
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,042
Oh, wait, hold on!

274
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:58,876
Guys, we can't let our landlords know about this.

275
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,209
- You mean our parents?
- Yes, our parents, but--

276
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:04,376
- We just can't tell them what's happening.
- Got it.

277
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,251
All right. Official members
of the Zombie Squad USA...

278
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:09,667
Oh, my God!

279
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:11,751
It's time to go hunting.

280
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,042
That was farther than usual!

281
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:51,834
I poured you a coffee.

282
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:58,376
- Hell, this is cold!
- Because you're 40 minutes late.

283
00:28:58,917 --> 00:28:59,626
I'm still on wintertime.

284
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:01,376
The winter time, summer time system...

285
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:03,584
is stupid.

286
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:05,917
What do you got?

287
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:10,042
Not much. Petra's son
been at it again, shoplifting.

288
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,792
Just do what they do in Iran. Cut his hands off.

289
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:14,917
That will teach him.

290
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:17,001
And Jack's dog is on the loose again.

291
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:19,001
He pooped in Mr. Olsen's yard.

292
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:21,167
Shoot him. Shoot Mr. Olsen?

293
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,084
Not Mr. Olsen. The dog!

294
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,959
Otherwise, we have the lecture at the school

295
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,001
about the dangers of smoking marijuana.

296
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,126
Oh. Boring!

297
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,834
Oh, there was one other thing.

298
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:34,084
From Oxfjord.

299
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,876
Oxfjord? No, no, no, no, no.

300
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,209
That's not our jurisdiction.

301
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:41,001
Martin Hykkerud escaped from the hospital--

302
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:42,042
Whoa, wait.

303
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:43,417
Martin Hykkerud?

304
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,584
Is that the same Martin Hykkerud

305
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,334
that killed his friends up in the mountains?

306
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,126
He escaped from the hospital yesterday,

307
00:29:50,126 --> 00:29:52,042
killed a kid and a policeman

308
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,292
by, um...

309
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:57,001
throwing a Mercedes star into his face.

310
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,751
- He cut off a Mercedes star?
- Yeah.

311
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:02,209
- What does Oslo say?
- About the Mercedes star?

312
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:05,042
Not the Merced-- The Hykkerud case!

313
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,584
They said to stay alert, get in extra people,

314
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:10,959
and keep it tight until they send a team up.

315
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,376
Ah, "extra people." Hmm.

316
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:14,834
Do we have the money? No, we don't.

317
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:17,876
I don't even have money
to buy new batteries to the car.

318
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:22,167
<i>Okay-</i>

319
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:25,542
Uh...

320
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,376
What?

321
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,459
Didn't we agree to be more casual around here?

322
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:38,126
Okay, go.

323
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:45,917
My God!

324
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,709
I was expecting something like the Hoth-systems,

325
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:50,376
but this is more like Endor.

326
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:53,084
Monica, can you reference anything other than
Star Wars?

327
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,209
What, like Star Trek?
Maybe if I can't sleep.

328
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:57,417
- Yeah, at least it's based on scientific theories

329
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,584
and a dog isn't running a starship.
- Guys, guys!

330
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:00,251
I have a lock on Martin.

331
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:01,417
- Oh.
- Where is he?

332
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,584
Ice Bay.

333
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:04,501
Ooh. Okay, let's go! Come on!

334
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,834
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

335
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:08,751
First, there's something we need to do.

336
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:10,542
Oh, yeah, I really have to pee.

337
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,959
- No, guys!
- I'm hungry.

338
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:14,292
- Arm up.
- Oh.

339
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:16,084
- You really fuckin' ruined that.
- Yeah.

340
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,292
It would be a lot easier
if you could buy weapons here.

341
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:17,001
I know. What the fuck's
the matter with this country?

342
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,584
Can I help you?

343
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:11,084
No, I'm sorry. Just, uh-- Just--

344
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,792
- Back away, please. I like you.
- Like you.

345
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,126
This is a war museum, right?

346
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:36,126
Yeah.

347
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:39,084
Do you have information on the Germans?

348
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,001
Help! Help me!

349
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,751
Listen to me! Listen!

350
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,709
Please don't hurt me. I have two kittens.

351
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:51,917
Help me! Help!

352
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,042
Shut up! Shut up!

353
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:58,959
Do you have any information on the "Einsatz"?

354
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:03,334
Yeah. Second floor.

355
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,001
Show me.

356
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,334
Where are you?

357
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,334
Fuck.

358
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:24,001
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

359
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:32,667
Best buddies with Hitler.

360
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:34,584
Isn't that cute?

361
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,251
You're not supposed to touch the display.

362
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:43,834
"Herzog was made commander of Einsatz in 1942

363
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,792
"and sent to the far north of Norway

364
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,042
"in order to protect the warships that

365
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:50,709
"the German Navy was hiding in the fjords.

366
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:55,126
"He was on duty in Oxfjord doing a routine inspection

367
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:58,834
on the ship Scharnolsht, when..."

368
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,417
Scharnholst.

369
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,167
"...when Tirpitz,

370
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:07,792
"the German fleet's biggest warship,

371
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:11,792
"was attacked by English bombers in Talvik,

372
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:15,042
"after getting vital information
on the ship's location

373
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,876
"from Norwegian spies.

374
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,959
"Hitler, humiliated by the attack on Tirpitz,

375
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,834
"ordered Herzog to wipe out

376
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,042
"all of the 800 men and people

377
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,209
who lived in Talvik at the time."

378
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:31,126
So, he was on his way...

379
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:33,584
to Talvik...

380
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,709
that night when and his men

381
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:38,001
were butchered down in Oxfjord?

382
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,667
On a mission given to them by Hitler, himself.

383
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,542
Yeah.

384
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,834
A mission that was never accomplished.

385
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,292
He's going to destroy Talvik.

386
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,417
He came from Oxfjord.

387
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:09,292
Here.

388
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,001
Going to Talvik.

389
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:13,876
Talvik is here.

390
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:15,917
Where are we?

391
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,751
Where are we?!

392
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,251
We're here.

393
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:23,876
Ice Bay.

394
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:30,792
That means...

395
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,459
That's just in-between.

396
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,084
They're recruiting.

397
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,917
They're recruiting new zombies.

398
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:24,501
They can do that too, now?

399
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,126
- They're coming here.
- I don't want to die.

400
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:31,001
I don't want to die here in a museum!

401
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,334
With you!

402
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,459
You're gonna die.

403
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:37,667
But not today.

404
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,501
Jesus.

405
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,292
Let's see what this thing can do.

406
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:37,834
What thing?

407
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:04,751
What are you doing? How did you do that?

408
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,751
You just-- killing all of them--

409
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:09,501
You didn't even break a sweat? Jesus.

410
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:10,584
It's my arm.

411
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,709
Somehow, I'm controlling it.

412
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:16,001
It reacts to what I'm thinking.

413
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,626
What arm? What are you talking about?

414
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:19,792
It's Satan's arm.

415
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:22,251
It's a long story.

416
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:28,542
He's building an army.

417
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:30,917
It's growing in numbers.

418
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:37,584
There'll be too many. Even with the arm, I can't--

419
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:01,001
All this death.

420
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:41,292
- You--
-  He--

421
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:42,459
- You did that!
- He <i>was--</i>

422
00:43:42,626 --> 00:43:44,917
You did what the bastard did earlier.

423
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:46,667
I...

424
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,126
It's the arm.

425
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:19,209
He's not attacking.

426
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:34,251
Did you see that? Did you see that? I hit it!

427
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:37,709
I hit it! Oh, my God, I did it, I fucking did it!

428
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:39,001
I hit it right in the eye!

429
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:42,334
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Take a picture, please.

430
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,501
Take of picture of me.

431
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:45,501
First Zombie Squad kill.

432
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,167
One, two...

433
00:44:47,209 --> 00:44:48,292
Cheese.

434
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:51,126
Did you get it?

435
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:54,501
Oh. We spoke on the phone.

436
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:56,792
I'm Daniel, this is Blake and Monica.

437
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:58,959
Hi. We are the Zombie Squad.

438
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,667
- Goddammit.
- They're real.

439
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:05,751
These are real dead people.

440
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:08,334
And that's a real zombie. You killed him.

441
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,542
I can't believe it.

442
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,501
Can we just focus for one second, guys?

443
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,542
I'm so sorry. We are more professional than this.

444
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:19,292
- You're the Zombie Squad?
- Yup.

445
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,167
- Yeah.
- You're the Zombie Squad.

446
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,501
Yeah, we are the Zombie Squad.

447
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,959
Yeah, I'm sorry. I was...

448
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:26,626
just expecting something different.

449
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:29,959
So was this guy when he woke up this morning!

450
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:34,959
Because I hit him in the face with an ax.

451
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,167
Yeah. How did you find me?

452
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,459
We tracked your iPhone, of course.

453
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:41,876
We're fuckin' nerds.
This is what we do. Technical shit.

454
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,584
Let's cut the chitchat. What did you find out?

455
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:47,042
What do the creatures want?

456
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,501
Revenge.

457
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:59,251
This is insane!

458
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,167
YOU?

459
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:03,209
You have the gift?

460
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:06,834
The force is strong with this one.

461
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:07,709
<i>Okay-</i>

462
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:14,917
Martin, this is how we defeat them.

463
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:16,376
This is how we take them down.

464
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,001
What do you mean?

465
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:19,751
I mean...

466
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:23,501
We create an army of our own.

467
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,792
I tried to get as much information as I could

468
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:27,917
on the trip over.

469
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:29,626
Especially about Herzog.

470
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,042
To defeat your enemy, you must know your enemy.

471
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:35,667
This is Lieutenant Stavarin of the Soviet Army.

472
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,334
He and his battalion were captured

473
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,292
during the battle of Kursk,

474
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:42,251
And brought here to the north of Norway as POWS.

475
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:46,292
In '44 they were all sent to Kven Mountain

476
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:48,417
to build a road through the mountain pass,

477
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:50,584
but it was after they built the road,

478
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:51,959
that shit got ugly.

479
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:56,542
All of the prisoners were shot.

480
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,167
Shot to death!

481
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,584
No survivors.

482
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:03,542
And the man in charge?

483
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:06,917
Herzog.

484
00:48:08,376 --> 00:48:11,084
Those bodies are still buried there.

485
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,751
Buried in the frozen soil.

486
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:17,001
Preserved. Waiting.

487
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,084
Waiting for what?

488
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:23,876
For the same thing that drives Herzog.

489
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:25,126
Revenge!

490
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:28,417
And guess who's gonna give it to them?

491
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:32,584
The man who can raise the dead?

492
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:34,834
Kafucking...

493
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:37,209
You guys go after Herzog. Try and slow him down.

494
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,292
Give us as much time as possible, okay?

495
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,917
What if this doesn't work?

496
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:44,042
It has to. All we have
to do is get to Kven mountain,

497
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:46,876
find Stavarin, wake him back from the dead,
then bring him back to Talvik

498
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:48,584
so he can help us fight Herzog and his men.

499
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:50,584
Easy.

500
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,126
Besides...

501
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,376
We got help.

502
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:02,709
Here we go.

503
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:15,126
He is our last hope.

504
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:32,001
Look! A tank!

505
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:53,584
Visitors, now?

506
00:49:54,084 --> 00:49:55,251
That's early.

507
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:12,459
Hello?

508
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:23,626
Look. His army is growing bigger.

509
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:28,001
Glenn, are there any more towns or villages

510
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,792
before he reaches Talvik?

511
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:31,667
Maybe a few houses, but that's it.

512
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:34,834
Good. 80 what he has now he'll use for his attack.

513
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:36,917
Yeah, pretty much, that is, until he starts

514
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:39,542
killing the people of Talvik,
making them join him as well.

515
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:41,167
How many people live in Talvik?

516
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:42,876
About 3,000.

517
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:44,126
What? Holy shit!

518
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:45,792
All the more reason for us to slow him down

519
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:47,042
as much as we can.

520
00:51:47,876 --> 00:51:50,709
Look. Do you know how to use one of those things?

521
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:53,126
Of course. I'm from Northern Norway, aren't I?

522
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:57,376
- I don't know what that means.
- Okay, guys, pack light.

523
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:00,167
We're moving out. Now!

524
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:08,792
What in the name of God has happened here?

525
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:12,959
What does the forensic team say?

526
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:16,876
That's not the forensic team.
That's just Tom and Ole.

527
00:52:16,876 --> 00:52:18,459
They put on white suits today.

528
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:20,251
They thought it looked more professional.

529
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:22,042
Nice.

530
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:24,959
The real forensic team
is gonna be here this evening.

531
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:27,751
Do we have any witnesses?

532
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:31,376
Not unless you can get the seagulls to talk.
Doesn't look good.

533
00:52:31,376 --> 00:52:35,334
Seagulls, yeah, well.
That's an amazing invention, isn't it?

534
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:38,667
You know, the guy, the person
who can come up with a thingy

535
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:42,751
that could translate seagull language
into human language.

536
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:43,917
The guy who come up with that thing,

537
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:45,542
he would make a fortune, you know.

538
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:49,917
Okay, let's get these bodies up to Talvik,

539
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:53,376
before the Seagulls eat them,
and let us take lots of photos,

540
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:55,084
or else the creepers will have my balls.

541
00:52:55,459 --> 00:52:59,584
Hey, boss, here's a picture
from the surveillance camera.

542
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:05,167
Isn't that...?

543
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:12,626
Would you eat my little man-pussy?

544
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:16,001
<i>Okay-</i>

545
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:19,417
All right, all right, all right. Let's move.

546
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:22,042
Let's move! Come on, hurry up.

547
00:53:22,126 --> 00:53:25,292
Listen up, we gotta hurry. Move out!

548
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,376
- There they are.
- And they have a tank, I see.

549
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:32,501
Yeah, they stole it from the museum.

550
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,626
Ah, fuck!

551
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:37,959
What is that?

552
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:41,709
A large-ass tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

553
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:42,834
No,no,no,no.

554
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,959
- That. What is that?
- Oh.

555
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:47,251
These are replicas of the binoculars

556
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:49,334
that Han and Chewie used on the planet Hoth.

557
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:51,042
Did you guys know-- Fun fact--

558
00:53:51,042 --> 00:53:52,792
- All of the Hoth scenes...
- Shh!

559
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:55,084
Were filmed here in Norway.

560
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:56,917
This place called Finse.

561
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:59,501
Girls, can we please maybe focus on,

562
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,917
you know, the Nazi zombies instead?

563
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,292
What do we do?

564
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:06,167
Well, Daniel told us to slow them down,

565
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,751
so that's what we're gonna do.

566
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:09,001
Look.

567
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,876
We need to get out there, get their attention

568
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,626
and lure them into the swamps, right?

569
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:16,834
And then, when they get stuck,

570
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:18,834
we can use the fertilizer bombs we made

571
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:20,542
and blow them into bits and pieces.

572
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:22,334
That sounds basically impossible.

573
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:24,501
And how are you planning on luring them out there?

574
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:25,876
We need bait. Live bait.

575
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:30,376
Yes, we need someone to attract their attention.

576
00:54:30,376 --> 00:54:33,959
Someone who is light on their feet,

577
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:35,209
who knows these swamps

578
00:54:35,209 --> 00:54:38,001
and can move through them without getting stuck.

579
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:45,126
What?

580
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:46,834
No.

581
00:54:47,959 --> 00:54:51,167
No. That's a swamp. I'm not getting out there!

582
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:53,376
Who says I won't get stuck?
And one more thing,

583
00:54:53,376 --> 00:54:56,584
Those things are fucking zombies

584
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,584
who want to rip my face off!

585
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:01,501
Hey, Talvik is your hometown, am I right?

586
00:55:01,751 --> 00:55:02,334
Yeah.

587
00:55:02,584 --> 00:55:04,626
You must have people you love there.

588
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:07,209
Yeah. Especially one ma...

589
00:55:07,626 --> 00:55:10,542
...woman that I love.

590
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:12,501
With long hair and big breasts.

591
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,626
Do it for...

592
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:15,792
"her".

593
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:19,709
You just bring them here, and we'll do the rest.

594
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:20,792
Capisce?

595
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:30,501
Hey, man.

596
00:55:31,334 --> 00:55:32,001
Martin?

597
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:33,667
Yeah?

598
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:35,709
Are you okay?

599
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:37,542
Yeah.

600
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:43,251
First we wake up a battalion of Nazi zombies,

601
00:55:43,251 --> 00:55:44,626
And now I'm supposed to...

602
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,417
wake up a bunch of dead Russian guys.

603
00:55:47,417 --> 00:55:49,876
- Martin, look,
- your arm, your power,

604
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,001
is the only thing that can
take down Herzog at this point.

605
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:56,126
Remember that. If we don't succeed,

606
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:01,292
his power will keep growing
until he's unstoppable.

607
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:07,542
That, my friend, is a big bowl of shit

608
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:09,709
that we don't want to live in.

609
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:17,959
Oh!

610
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,376
Oh, my God. That's-- That's--

611
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:23,334
That is vile-smelling.

612
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:26,667
How did it fill up the car so fast? That smell...

613
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:28,959
No, it's all right.
He's just carsick, or something.

614
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:30,834
That smells foul!

615
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:32,876
No,no,no,no!

616
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:35,292
Fuck! That's disgusting!

617
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:40,751
That smells!

618
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:26,917
I didn't know
there was supposed to be

619
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:29,292
an "ugly face" convention in town.

620
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:36,417
Well, come get me, then.

621
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:38,626
Come get me.

622
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:43,376
Come get me, if you dare!

623
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:02,167
Go!

624
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:08,001
Halt!

625
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:12,334
It's working. They're following him!

626
00:58:12,334 --> 00:58:14,834
But not Herzog, and most of his men. Shit.

627
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:16,959
No, no, no. It's okay. We've got their attention.

628
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:19,542
If we take these guys out,
he'll come for us himself.

629
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,334
Come on, Glenn!

630
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:31,376
- Run faster!
- Faster!

631
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,209
Yes!

632
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,167
- Come on, Glenn!
- Go, go, go, go!

633
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,084
Yes. yes!

634
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:16,834
- Run, Glenn!
- Faster!

635
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:19,126
Run, run!

636
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:27,834
Please, God...

637
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,542
<i>'</i> Yes!
<i>'</i> Yes!

638
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,626
Oh, my God, Blake!

639
00:59:40,501 --> 00:59:43,876
<i>'</i> USA!
<i>'</i> USA!

640
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,292

641
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:49,709
Schuss!

642
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:01,751
- Hey.
- Hey!

643
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:03,417
That tank is moving.

644
01:00:06,126 --> 01:00:07,251
That can't be good.

645
01:00:22,209 --> 01:00:23,667
- Run!
- Run!

646
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:07,376
Talvik. Jetzt.

647
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:01,376
<i>He'!-</i>

648
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:05,542
Where are we?

649
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:07,209
We're getting close.

650
01:02:08,209 --> 01:02:09,542
But we're also stuck.

651
01:02:14,376 --> 01:02:15,292
Can I push it?

652
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:17,751
I don't think that would help.

653
01:02:18,626 --> 01:02:21,292
Is it far? We could walk.

654
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:22,876
We don't have that kind of time.

655
01:02:25,751 --> 01:02:29,376
If only we could find something
to put under the car.

656
01:02:29,376 --> 01:02:31,626
You know, something that would give us traction.

657
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:34,459
Then I could get us out of here.

658
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:25,834
Oh, there she is.

659
01:03:26,626 --> 01:03:29,001
It was a bloody nightmare trying to find space
for all the bodies.

660
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:31,042
I mean, the fridge is completely full,

661
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:33,667
so we just had to put all the rest
of them on the garage floor

662
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:35,709
and throw a shitload of ice cubes on top.

663
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:38,126
That sounds like a perfect solution.

664
01:03:38,126 --> 01:03:38,834
Thanks.

665
01:03:39,459 --> 01:03:43,459
Ah, you know, mostly Germans, French people.

666
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:46,459
Don't think they pictured
this when they ordered a trip to Norway.

667
01:03:46,459 --> 01:03:48,417
No, getting their heads and arms hacked off

668
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:49,709
and their intestines ripped out?

669
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:53,792
- Doubt it.
- Well, unless they're into that kinky shit.

670
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:00,042
Should you be doing that?

671
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:03,126
Where's the-- you know, the special force?

672
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:04,292
It was really windy down in Alta,

673
01:04:04,292 --> 01:04:05,959
so the plane couldn't land,

674
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:07,376
but they should be here tomorrow afternoon.

675
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:11,126
That's perfect.

676
01:04:12,459 --> 01:04:13,167
What?

677
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:16,834
Yeah. This is our chance.

678
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:20,501
We're gonna show people
what we're really made of, here.

679
01:04:20,876 --> 01:04:21,709
What are you talking about?

680
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:26,834
We are gonna find Martin Hykkerud ourselves.

681
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:30,084
We're gonna bring him in.
We're gonna be heroes,

682
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:33,917
not those fancy, dressed-up,
stuck-up, sushi-eating

683
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:35,459
dickweeds from the south.

684
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,626
Beef the boys...

685
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:40,251
Brief the boys.

686
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,459
Send a picture out to every cop
and citizen in Talvik.

687
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:46,584
If he so much as stops to make a piss,

688
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:49,459
I want to know both color and scent of that urine.

689
01:04:49,459 --> 01:04:50,376
Color and scent.

690
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:52,292
Get the shotguns ready.

691
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:57,001
We're gonna shoot something else
than seagulls for a change.

692
01:05:02,626 --> 01:05:04,251
Do you really think this is going to work?

693
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:07,751
I mean, say we actually manage to wake

694
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:09,251
these Russians back to life...

695
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:11,959
What's stopping them from killing us?

696
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:15,751
I don't know what's gonna happen.

697
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:17,792
But judging based on him...

698
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:21,042
He treats you like you're his master.

699
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,667
So, hopefully they do the same.

700
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:24,584
Hopefully.

701
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:26,417
Hope-- Look, what-- I don't know, man.

702
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:29,126
This is some unprecedented, unheard of,

703
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:32,084
mysterious, voodoo-zombie shit, man.

704
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:34,709
I've never seen this before.

705
01:05:34,709 --> 01:05:36,542
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,

706
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:39,001
and this is not in any of them.

707
01:05:40,334 --> 01:05:42,459
You've created a whole new genre here, man.

708
01:05:44,376 --> 01:05:48,667
Look, I mean, if we're gonna go up against
a battalion of Nazi zombies,

709
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:51,001
we could do a whole lot worse than teaming up

710
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:53,001
with a battalion of Russian zombies.

711
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:56,959
He has to die, you know.

712
01:05:57,334 --> 01:05:58,459
Herzog.

713
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:00,584
For what he did.

714
01:06:01,126 --> 01:06:02,501
We have to kill him.

715
01:06:04,584 --> 01:06:06,042
I have to kill him.

716
01:06:07,376 --> 01:06:08,501
For Hanna.

717
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:13,292
This is it.

718
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:14,959
Yeah.

719
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:17,876
This is definitely it.

720
01:06:20,584 --> 01:06:25,292
Herzog killed Stavarin and 50 of his men here.

721
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:26,959
So they've gotta be buried...

722
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:29,001
in this frozen ground.

723
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:33,209
How do we do this?

724
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:38,126
You do it just like you did with him.

725
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:40,876
I put my hand on his head.

726
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:44,917
Okay. Right?

727
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:45,792
Yeah?

728
01:06:47,626 --> 01:06:50,501
We can't dig up everyone. It'll take weeks.

729
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:52,834
You have to wake them up one way or another.

730
01:09:17,626 --> 01:09:21,792
Master...

731
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,042
Fuck,yeah!

732
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:05,584
First, he was seen here.

733
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:08,792
In Oxfjord.

734
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,292
Next, here.

735
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:13,209
By the museum at Ice Bay.

736
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:16,042
Then it looks like he's turning south.

737
01:10:20,626 --> 01:10:22,167
Gunga, we have a situation.

738
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:23,667
So what they said on the phone--

739
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:25,084
there was a bunch of guys

740
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:27,584
dressed up as German soldiers going crazy?

741
01:10:27,584 --> 01:10:30,209
If by crazy, he means slaughtering
a bunch of people, then, yeah.

742
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:32,667
What the hell is going on?
We haven't had

743
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,042
a decent murder here since 1974.

744
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:35,251
And now this?

745
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:37,709
Okay, guys, listen up!

746
01:10:38,459 --> 01:10:41,209
Shoot first, ask questions later!

747
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:24,667
Hey!

748
01:11:26,626 --> 01:11:27,792
You're too late.

749
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:29,876
There's nobody here.

750
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:32,084
We sent them away.

751
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,167
Since there's nobody here,

752
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:37,667
maybe you should forget about your assignment and

753
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:41,167
return to your little snow cave.

754
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:14,501
Somebody's grown. Gotten bigger!

755
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:21,751
I hope you don't mind,
but I invited some friends to tag along.

756
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:05,501
Don't you just hate it

757
01:13:06,084 --> 01:13:08,542
when somebody that was supposed to be dead

758
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:10,334
comes back to kill you?

759
01:13:38,459 --> 01:13:39,709
Let's kill 'em.

760
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:41,792
Truppen!

761
01:13:45,084 --> 01:13:46,792
Anfall!

762
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,792
Let's kill 'em all!

763
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,209
What the hell is going on?

764
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:08,792
Is there a carnival in town?

765
01:16:02,126 --> 01:16:03,459
Is that a tank?

766
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:20,209
Get out of the car!

767
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:22,001
Ah! Get out!

768
01:16:45,042 --> 01:16:46,001
Daniel!

769
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:47,709
The tank.

770
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,167
- Shouldn't we help them?
- Help who?

771
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:04,751
The guys with rotten skin in Russian uniforms?

772
01:18:04,751 --> 01:18:07,667
Or the guys with rotten skin in German uniforms?

773
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:39,584
Okay...

774
01:18:53,126 --> 01:18:54,126
Good boy.

775
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:14,334
- What the fuck is going on?
- It looks like a computer game.

776
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:16,167
Gunga, look! Look, it's him!

777
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:17,542
It's Martin Hykkerud!

778
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:21,917
- Should we go get him?
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

779
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:24,959
This is technical police work.

780
01:19:51,001 --> 01:19:53,417
Zombie Squad. It's about time!

781
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:55,251
- It's a long story.
- There was a tank.

782
01:19:55,626 --> 01:19:57,126
A GUY took my jacket.

783
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,459
Looks like you found Stavarin and his men, I see.

784
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:02,792
Yeah, but there's still more than us.

785
01:20:03,376 --> 01:20:06,084
I guess it's time we even out the odds a bit, huh?

786
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:52,251
- Guys!
- What?

787
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:53,459
We're losing!

788
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:54,959
Look!

789
01:20:57,709 --> 01:20:58,667
Shit!

790
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:10,751
<i>No, no, no...</i>

791
01:21:12,209 --> 01:21:13,501
No!

792
01:21:22,626 --> 01:21:23,709
Wait!

793
01:21:25,209 --> 01:21:26,292
We have to kill him!

794
01:21:27,584 --> 01:21:30,209
They're all bound to him
like the Russians are to you.

795
01:21:30,209 --> 01:21:32,376
If he dies, the others will too.

796
01:21:35,792 --> 01:21:37,084
Let's finish this.

797
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:43,459
Untermensch.

798
01:22:59,376 --> 01:23:01,459
Guys, come on. No seat belts?

799
01:23:02,876 --> 01:23:04,209
You're just askin' for it.

800
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:37,251
Fucking hell, how many more of these are there?

801
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:44,167
Is this it?

802
01:23:47,834 --> 01:23:50,459
Monica, is this how it's gonna end?

803
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:51,501
No.

804
01:23:53,126 --> 01:23:54,501
Are we gonna die now?

805
01:23:54,584 --> 01:23:55,417
No.

806
01:23:58,084 --> 01:23:58,917
Fuck it.

807
01:24:01,209 --> 01:24:03,376
Fuck it, I'm just gonna say it.

808
01:24:03,376 --> 01:24:04,292
What?

809
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:06,376
I...

810
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,126
Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, am...

811
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,042
No!

812
01:24:14,167 --> 01:24:16,209
Blake! Glenn?

813
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:18,292
Monica?

814
01:27:26,126 --> 01:27:28,626
Why didn't you just stay on the mountain?

815
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:34,626
You got what you wanted.

816
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:39,126
You got your gold, your treasure.

817
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:44,917
But it wasn't enough, was it?

818
01:27:47,959 --> 01:27:49,292
You got greedy.

819
01:27:51,084 --> 01:27:52,417
You wanted more.

820
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,167
Monica. Watch out!

821
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:06,042
- Monica!
- Blake!

822
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:12,376
Blake! No!

823
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:25,792
That's why you lost the war.

824
01:28:31,792 --> 01:28:33,126
Did you know?

825
01:28:35,667 --> 01:28:37,376
You lost the war.

826
01:28:40,126 --> 01:28:41,584
You got greedy.

827
01:28:45,459 --> 01:28:46,876
Guess what?

828
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:50,917
You lose again.

829
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:00,959
No!

830
01:29:15,209 --> 01:29:16,001
My God!

831
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:20,292
He did it!

832
01:29:21,626 --> 01:29:23,834
He killed Herzog. It worked!

833
01:29:25,584 --> 01:29:26,667
I knew it!

834
01:29:28,376 --> 01:29:29,667
Herzog is dead.

835
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:31,959
He's dead!

836
01:29:32,251 --> 01:29:33,376
Yes!

837
01:29:48,584 --> 01:29:50,084
Holy cow, that was close.

838
01:30:03,209 --> 01:30:05,751
You did it! You killed Herzog!

839
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:07,334
Uh-huh.

840
01:30:07,876 --> 01:30:10,876
I can't believe that that actually worked.

841
01:30:11,876 --> 01:30:13,167
Of course it did.

842
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:15,792
You doubted the Zombie Squad?

843
01:30:18,251 --> 01:30:20,376
Glenn Kenneth, is he...?

844
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:24,584
He didn't make it.

845
01:30:36,667 --> 01:30:39,501
It's been a true honor
killing zombies with you guys.

846
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:42,501
You too, Martin.

847
01:30:48,501 --> 01:30:49,876
What is it?

848
01:30:51,209 --> 01:30:52,292
<i>Okay-</i>

849
01:30:53,376 --> 01:30:55,459
- You can say it.
- Go for it.

850
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,292
May the force be with you.

851
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:09,376
Really? That one? Of <i>all--</i> You chose that one?

852
01:31:09,584 --> 01:31:11,417
There's like a million to choose from.

853
01:31:11,417 --> 01:31:13,126
Why would you choose that one?

854
01:31:37,126 --> 01:31:38,126
Where are they?

855
01:31:38,959 --> 01:31:40,167
They were just here.

856
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:41,709
I don't know.

857
01:31:44,084 --> 01:31:45,126
Bjarne!

858
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:47,251
Are you in a coma?

859
01:31:48,084 --> 01:31:49,459
Go and find them!

860
01:31:53,459 --> 01:31:56,001
I was supposed to solve this murder case,

861
01:31:56,751 --> 01:31:59,126
not end up with a hundred new bodies.

862
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:01,459
Yeah, I don't know where we're gonna put them all.

863
01:32:01,459 --> 01:32:04,084
Both the garage
and the freezer are completely packed.

864
01:32:04,584 --> 01:32:07,167
I don't know. I don't know!

865
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:13,376
The seagulls again.

866
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:16,167
They haven't eaten this well since the war.

867
01:32:16,626 --> 01:32:19,084
We should've had that machine, you know.

868
01:32:19,084 --> 01:32:21,459
That seagull translator machine.

869
01:32:21,459 --> 01:32:23,292
We could've cracked this case like an egg.

870
01:32:24,626 --> 01:32:25,792
Like an egg.

871
01:32:33,126 --> 01:32:34,959
"Turn around"

872
01:32:34,959 --> 01:32:38,334
"Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely"

873
01:32:38,334 --> 01:32:40,584
"And you're never coming round"

874
01:32:40,584 --> 01:32:42,459
"Turn around"

875
01:32:42,459 --> 01:32:45,751
"Every now and then
I get a little bit tired"

876
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:48,209
"Of listening to the sound of my tears"

877
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:49,834
"Turn around"

878
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:53,292
"Every now and then
I get a little bit nervous"

879
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:55,459
"That the best of all the years have gone by"

880
01:32:55,459 --> 01:32:57,459
"Turn around"

881
01:32:57,459 --> 01:33:00,626
"Every now and then I get
a little bit terrified"

882
01:33:00,626 --> 01:33:03,042
"And then I see
the look in your eyes"

883
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:06,709
"Turn around, bright eyes"

884
01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:08,876
"Every now and then I fall apart"

885
01:33:08,876 --> 01:33:12,251
"Turn around, bright eyes"

886
01:33:12,251 --> 01:33:15,376
"Every now and then I fall apart"

887
01:33:15,501 --> 01:33:22,542
"And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever"

888
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:29,792
"And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever"

889
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:33,584
"And we'll only be making it right"

890
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,834
"'Cause we'll never be wrong"

891
01:33:35,834 --> 01:33:39,542
"Together we can take it to the end of the line"

892
01:33:39,542 --> 01:33:43,042
"Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time"

893
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:44,917
"All of the time"

894
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:48,501
"I don't know what to do
and I'm always in the dark"

895
01:33:48,501 --> 01:33:52,126
"We're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks"

896
01:33:52,417 --> 01:33:55,167
"I really need you tonight"

897
01:33:55,167 --> 01:34:01,292
"Forever's gonna start tonight"

898
01:34:01,376 --> 01:34:04,751
"Once upon a time I was falling in love"

899
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:07,626
"But now I'm only falling apart"

900
01:34:10,209 --> 01:34:14,876
"There's nothing I can do A total eclipse of the heart"

901
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:50,167
"Turn around, bright eyes"

902
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,959
"Every now and then I fall apart"

903
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:55,542
"Turn around, bright eyes"

904
01:34:55,542 --> 01:34:58,542
"Every now and then I fall apart"

905
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:02,251
"And I need you now tonight"

906
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:05,584
"And I need you more than ever"

907
01:35:05,584 --> 01:35:09,292
"And if you only hold me tight"

908
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:12,751
"We'll be holding on forever"

909
01:35:12,751 --> 01:35:16,417
"And we'll only be making it right"

910
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:18,584
"'Cause we'll never be wrong"

911
01:35:18,584 --> 01:35:22,126
"Together we can take it to the end of the line"

912
01:35:22,126 --> 01:35:25,626
"Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time"

913
01:35:25,626 --> 01:35:27,334
"All of the time"

914
01:35:27,334 --> 01:35:28,709
"I don't know what to do"

915
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:30,709
"I'm always in the dark"

916
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:34,542

"But now I'm only falling apart"

921
01:35:54,126 --> 01:35:56,084
"Nothing I can say"

922
01:35:56,084 --> 01:36:00,751
"A total eclipse of the heart"

923
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:08,251
"A total eclipse of the heart"

924
01:36:10,959 --> 01:36:15,167
"A total eclipse of the heart"

925
