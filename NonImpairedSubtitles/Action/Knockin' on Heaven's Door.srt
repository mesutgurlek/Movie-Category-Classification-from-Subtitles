1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
Turn it off!

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Turn it off!

3
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,100
OK, that's it for today!

4
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,100
This is a brothel,
not a chorus line!

5
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,600
You don't have to make the people think -

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
You have to make them fuck!

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
Now then -

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,000
The doctor says to the man:

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You got two different testicles.

10
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
One is made of wood,
and the other one is metal.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,400
The man is quite surprised,

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,700
and the doctor doesn't know what to say either.

13
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,700
But then he asks:
"Do you have children?"

14
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,500
The man says: "Yes, two -

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Pinocchio is 3 and
Terminator will be 7 soon.

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,000
That's the joke?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Yes, damit!

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,400
Who is "Ponocchio"?

19
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,200
"Pinocchio" is a marionette
- made of wood.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,200
And "Terminator" is made of metal.

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
- I don't understand your joke!
- Because you don't listen right!

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
- I did!
- No, you didn't!

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,700
I have to explain every joke to you
three times and you still don't get it!

24
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
I understood your fucking joke!

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,700
"Terminator" is a machine!

26
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
- made of metal!

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,700
But why is a child a marionette?

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
Now, that's it!

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll never tell you a another 
goddamned joke again!

30
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,900
You will drive this car to Curtis,
give it to him and piss off.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,300
- OK, Boss!
- No, not OK!

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,200
"Driving" means: You don't stop even once!

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,600
But what if we have to take a piss?

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,500
Then one of you morons will take a piss
and the other one stays in the car!

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
You are never to take your eyes off the car!
Understood?

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,300
Understood, boss - understood!

37
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,200
Abdul, did you get that?

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Yes, no problem, boss! - No problem!

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,300
OK, Hank, let's toss a coin:
If it's heads, I drive...

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Abdul!

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Hank will drive the car first!

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,900
You can switch later,
but Hank will start now!

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Always Hank!

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Hey! Maybe you can wait until I get in?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Be careful!
Idiots!

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Good day!

47
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I am here for the checkup.

48
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,000
- Am I allowed to smoke?
- No, it is strictly forbidden!

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
Damn...

50
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Mr. Wurlitzer?

51
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Rudi Wurlitzer?

52
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Come with me!

53
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,300
- Please take off your clothes!
- Underwear too?

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
No!
That's enough!

55
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,600
Time for a urine sample!

56
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,200
Nurse?

57
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I need a new cup -
this one is full!

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,900
- Sorry, I can't.

59
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
- Either you pee or I'll use a catheder!

60
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Take a deep breath
And...

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hold it!

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,500
No!

63
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I can't believe it!

64
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Yes, I always say:
Preventive Checkup!

65
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,100
Where is it?
Here?

66
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,300
Cut it out!

67
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,700
We can do that

68
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,100
What do you mean:
"We can do that"?

69
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,000
That means that the tumor in your head
is already quite big.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,400
It is still growing and it's pressing on
your brain. It doesn't look good.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You've come too late.

72
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,500
How much time do I have left?

73
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,600
Perhaps only days

74
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,700
My father died of bone cancer, too.

75
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,300
They disected him piece by piece.

76
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
- but it didn't help

77
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,800
He died in the end.

78
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,300
How long ago was that, Mr. Wurlitzer?

79
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,000
20 years.

80
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Medicine has made some progress
in the last 20 years.

81
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Maybe technology is better now -

82
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,300
- but you still can't cure
cancer or HIV.

83
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Yes, there will always be an
illness we can't cure.

84
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,000
I understand that you are worried.

85
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,000
Worried?

86
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,700
You know, it's just the fact that -

87
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,800
Death is a very unpleasant form of life.

88
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Come on!
Come on!

89
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Oh no!

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,500
You are not allowed to do
whatever you want Mr. Brest!

91
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,100
This is a hospital
and not an amusement park!

92
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,000
Mr. Wurlitzer, this is your bed.
You can put your things in the locker.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The doctor will stop by later.
You can rest now.

94
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,600
The doctor will find out about the cigarettes
and you'll be in deep trouble!

95
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,300
Nurse?

96
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,400
Can you give me a blowjob?


97
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Or maybe bring me some tea?

98
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,100
Franky said we can switch,
and now I want to drive!

99
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Goddamn it we're not even halfway there yet!

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Move over, or shall I blow you?

101
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,300
God damn it!!

102
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,800
- Hank, why do I always have to flip?
- It's "flip out"...

103
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,200
This is automatic transmission.
You have to put it in "D"!

104
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I know!

105
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
- Put it in "D"!
- I know!

106
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,500
And it is "blow one's brains"
and not just "blow someone"!

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,500
I know!

108
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
What is going on?

109
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,600
I just wanted to see if everything is alright.

110
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
"If everything is alright"?

111
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You looked dead.
I don't want share a room with a dead man.

112
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,000
I am not dead.

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I am still alive.

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Good for you!

115
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,000
I've got a tumor in my head
as big as a tennis ball.

116
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I only got a few days left.

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
They told you?

118
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I've got cancer -

119
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,400
bone cancer.

120
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This must be the bite-the-dust section.
Some kind of broom closet.

121
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,500
Maybe we should have asked?

122
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Oh sure! "Nurse, we need salt and lemons,
because we want to get drunk with Tequila!"

123
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,900
Salt!

124
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,500
Well done, Abdul!
It was a red light!

125
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I know!

126
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,400
If you scratched the paint, Franky will kill us!

127
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
You are completely nuts!

128
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,100
Where did you come from?

129
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,900
You assholes ran me over!

130
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,500
My leg!

131
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,600
Does it hurt?

132
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Yeah, Achmed!

133
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,700
But nothing happened!

134
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,900
Are you a fucking doctor?

135
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Come on boy, everything looks fine.

136
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Do you want a banana?

137
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I want you to take me to the hospital
with this car. Motherfuckers!

138
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
This car has only two seats.

139
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Then ride in the trunk,
you can't drive anyway!

140
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
Smoking!

141
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Smoking helps.

142
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Smoking?

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No, that's dangerous to your health!

144
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Do I have lung cancer?

145
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:11,400
You stand on the beach and taste the salty
smell of the wind that comes from the ocean,

146
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,000
and inside you feel the warmth
of never ending freedom,

147
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:30,100
and on your lips the bitter,
tear-soaked kiss of your lover.

148
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I have never been to the ocean.

149
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,900
That can't be true!

150
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,100
You have never ever been to the ocean?

151
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Never - ever!

152
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,600
Both of us are knocking on heavens door,
drinking tequila-

153
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,200
-we are biting-the-dust experts-

154
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,100
-and you have never - ever been to the ocean!

155
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Never - ever!

156
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,700
Don't you know how it is
when you arrive in heaven?

157
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,500
In heaven that's all they talk about -
the ocean - and how wonderful it is.

158
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:29,800
They talk about the sunsets they have seen.
They talk about how the sun turned blood-red
before it set.

159
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,000
And they talk about how they felt
when the sun was loosing its power,

160
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,800
- and the cold that was coming from the ocean,
while the rest of the fire was still glowing.

161
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,200
And you -

162
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,500
You can't talk about it with them,
since you have never been there!

163
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,800
You will be a fucking outsider up there!

164
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,400
And there is nothing we can do about it?

165
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,400
How did this happen?

166
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,300
These two morons went through a red light
and hit me.

167
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,600
Can you do me a favor please?
Don't let them go!

168
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,000
- There will be trouble with the insurance.
- Sure.

169
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,700
- We are in a hurry and the boy is fine, anyway.
- The doctor will decide that for himself.

170
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
Let's smash the window!

171
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
First you run over a kid and then you run away?

172
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Don't let these idiots go!

173
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,700
- We've got a very important job to do!
- Everybody shut up! We're leaving now!

174
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,500
- What the hell is this?
- What did you say, bitch?

175
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,700
Hank says we are in a hurry and
Abdul says we go! Understand?

176
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,000
Are you stupid? Don't let these idiots go!

177
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,400
You gotta hit it!

178
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
On the ignition?

179
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,600
Tell me... how is your leg?

180
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
It's OK.

181
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,000
The pain is gone?

182
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,500
Yeah, the pain's gone!

183
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,200
Good!

184
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Little motherfucker!

185
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
- Step back!
- Don't move, assholes!

186
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Is the surgery over?

187
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,200
Yeah, you're in heaven.
I'm god and this is Petrus.

188
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,700
Salam Aleikum!

189
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh shit!

190
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,400
Excuse us, can you tell us where the exit is?

191
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Over there on the left.

192
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Did you see that?
They've got the same car as us!

193
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,600
Where did you get the gun?

194
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
It was in the glove compartment.

195
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Glove compartment?

196
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,700
What car is this, anyway?

197
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
That is a Mercedes 230 SL baby-blue.

198
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,800
I mean who does it belong to?

199
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I have no idea - we stole it!

200
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,100
You mean I was involved in the theft of a car?

201
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,600
You could say that.

202
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,800
- I can't remember anything!
- You helped pick it out.

203
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,200
- Martin Brest, right?
- Yes, the one from the hospital.

204
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,500
Shouldn't we get going?
We are on our way to the ocean.

205
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,000
You have never been there,
so we decided to go.

206
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
I think I don't want to go.

207
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,900
Then you can't talk about it up there!

208
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Yes, I know, I also want to go to the ocean,
but...

209
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,300
... I am afraid.

210
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Let me tell you:

211
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,000
You don't have to be afraid.

212
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,400
Didn't I tell you:
Nobody was to leave the fucking car?

213
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,500
Didn't I tell you idiots
not to take your eyes of the car?

214
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,000
Didn't I?

215
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,600
Yes, you did, boss!

216
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Why didn't you do it, then?

217
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,700
There was this boy...

218
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,600
I don't want to hear any more bullshit!

219
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,600
I could kill both of you!

220
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
I mean, I have the right to do so!

221
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,000
But I want my car back and
therefore I'm giving you another chance.

222
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,400
Bring the car back and the
two motherfuckers that stole it!

223
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
And make it quick!

224
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Do you understand?

225
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Good morning!

226
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,300
85.70 please!

227
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,200
I know, but unfortunately I have no money
with me.

228
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,300
Oh, you are driving a big Mercedes,
but you don't have any money?

229
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Then give me your pajamas!

230
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,100
It seems we've got a problem here.

231
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,900
Should I be afraid or something?

232
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,700
Martin! Don't be stupid!

233
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,500
Finally there is someone with a good idea!

234
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,800
Put the gun away! I don't want to be
involved in this. It's armed robbery!

235
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Oh no!  Just forget what I said!

236
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,700
- Rudi, go back to the car!
- No, I won't!

237
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,700
At this moment it is just armed -something-,
since I didn't take anything!

238
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,900
But you plan to do it!

239
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,800
Boys!

240
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,800
- Just a second! 
- We don't have money...

241
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Boys!

242
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
- One moment!  We shouldn't do it!
- Why not?

243
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,700
It's against the law!

244
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,700
BOYS!

245
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,800
WHAT?

246
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Just a hint - before my fingers fall asleep -
maybe you should plan your robberies beforehand!

247
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,600
You're starting to get on my fucking nerves! 
This gun is real!

248
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
I believe you, but what can you
really do to me anyway?

249
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:09,100
It is now 10:58am. At 11am, my friend will 
come by and he is a policeman.

250
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,100
He always comes at 11am.

251
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:20,800
He walks in and checks if everything is alright,
drinks a "Jaegermeister" and then he leaves again.

252
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
IF everything is alright...

253
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Where is Klaus?

254
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,700
Who is Klaus?

255
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Every morning at 11am I come in here
and  Klaus is there instead of you.

256
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,900
Oh, Klaus!

257
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,900
He's sick.

258
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,500
Perhaps you are telling the truth
and he really is ill-

259
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,000
-what car is this?

260
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,500
That is a Mercedes 230 SL baby-blue.

261
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,100
Baby-blue?

262
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Who owns it?

263
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,800
You're a tough customer!

264
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Hey, wait a sec!

265
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,000
Me and Rudi stole this car yesterday!

266
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
Who is Rudi?

267
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,600
Rudi Wurlitzer!

268
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,100
We want to go to the ocean and we didn't 
have a car. What could we have done? Walk?

269
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,200
And Klaus is really not ill.

270
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Well, maybe up there, since he wanted my pajamas!

271
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,400
But now he is sitting down here
with a gun pointed at his head!

272
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,400
That's a good one!

273
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Really good!

274
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,900
My drink is on the house, like always!

275
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,600
No, it's 2.50!

276
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Maybe you can get away with this withKlaus, 
since he is your friend. But with me you gotta
to pay 2.50.

277
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,600
Good day, gentleman!

278
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
What can I do for you?

279
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,000
How much is this car?

280
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,800
That is a Mercedes 230 SL - 170 HP.

281
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
How much is it?

282
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,300
The way it is now?

283
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,800
Leather seats, special paint,
stereo radio - with CD player!

284
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,700
How much?

285
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Since you are a foreigner
and foreigners have a hard time in Germany...

286
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,100
75,000!

287
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,600
Are you playing us for a sucker?
That is a used car!

288
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,100
I know, but it's a rare item
and rare items cost a lot.

289
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,200
But first we sign the papers.

290
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,200
Do you have money?

291
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Not enough!

292
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,300
Lets bump this motherfucker!

293
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,800
Bump him OFF!

294
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,400
Bump him off and take the car!

295
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,900
Can you hold the car until tonight?

296
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,900
Sure!

297
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,700
That looks great on you, Rudi!

298
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,900
Maybe you should try on the red one again?

299
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,900
I will, but I think I will take this one!

300
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,700
If you plan to rob this shop too, I'm
outta here! Got it?

301
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Sure!

302
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
- Am I allowed to smoke here?
- Of course!

303
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,500
How much for all of this?

304
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Your suit alone is 2,300.

305
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
2,300?

306
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,700
I'll have to pick up some cash first.

307
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But this is... about...

308
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,300
3,000 - for now

309
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,000
These are most amazing clothes I have ever worn.

310
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,200
Just a few Marks from the gas station -
they are a gas company, they won't even notice!

311
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
Right!

312
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I'll go and get some money now, ok?

313
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,300
Sorry, we're on lunch break.

314
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Lunch break is canceled today!

315
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,400
You have to say something or
nothing will happen here!

316
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,400
You got 3 seconds:
Someone will tell me what I want or...

317
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Let's just say that this is 
not a water pistol!

318
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
You want all the money!

319
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,400
100 Marks for you, the rest goes in the bag!
Hurry up!

320
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Excuse me...

321
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,300
What?

322
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,700
I know it's a stupid question, but
usually my customers don't turn up in pajamas...

323
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Without shoes even!

324
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Hi, my name is Martin Brest!
As you can see I am robbing your silly bank!

325
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,100
And just because I picked out this suit,
but I can't affort it!

326
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,100
You can stop babbling:
They don't record the audio anyway.

327
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
80,000!

328
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Hank! Look at that guy!

329
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,400
What about him?

330
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Look at the amazing suit he is wearing!

331
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,400
Come on!

332
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,100
I'll take the black one!

333
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,600
That should be enough!
Come on, Rudi!

334
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
You can keep the rest!

335
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,100
I think we can lower our hands now...

336
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,900
Hands up!
This is a robbery!

337
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,900
What are you looking at assholes?
Gimme all your money or you're dead!

338
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,900
You've arrived too late, by one minute...

339
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,900
- This red thing looks completely silly!
- Stop bitching...

340
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Red is your color!

341
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,500
What's in the bag?

342
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,200
Just come on!

343
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,700
Tell me what's in there,
or I'll stay right here.

344
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
60... 70...

345
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,300
75!

346
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,300
75,000!

347
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,400
And I am wearing this ridiculous red thing!

348
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,800
We'll buy you a new one.

349
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,800
What? We'll buy you a new one!

350
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Or two?

351
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Trinidad! Tierra del Fuego! Bora-bora! Hawaii!

352
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Even some places we can't pronounce!

353
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Actually, I only want to go to the ocean.

354
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Do you really believe we will be sitting on
a cloud and talk about the ocean?

355
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Yes, I  really do!

356
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,100
Boss!

357
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,300
This just came in from Wiesbaden!

358
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,500
Martin Brest is a Snow White!

359
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,300
Oh, you mean...

360
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,100
No, he is not in our files!

361
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,100
So why did he crack up then?
He's never done anything and now:

362
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,100
bank robbery, gas station...

363
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,200
And what about the car, this Mercedes...?

364
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,500
Nothing.

365
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
And now guess why!

366
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Just put out a search warrant, Keller!

367
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,100
OK, boss!

368
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,100
And, Keller?

369
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Nothing...

370
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
One million!

371
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,700
And you, like an idiot, are robbing banks!

372
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,700
One million! This is a lucky car!

373
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,700
And now?

374
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,600
If you need something else,
just ring for me.

375
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,900
What?

376
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Oh, yes.

377
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Thank you. I hope you enjoy your stay!

378
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Thank you very much!

379
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,500
Hey! Where are you going?

380
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
I quit!

381
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,000
Is there something you can tell me?
Except that you turned this place upside down?

382
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Of course!
Look what I found!

383
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,400
This is for a check-up in the hospital. 
In half an hour. We can make it there!

384
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
- That was yesterday!
- Oh, we might be late then.

385
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Two number fifteens, please.
Is there anything else you can recommend?

386
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,600
Oh yes - what is it?

387
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
I see. Two ice-creams then.

388
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And, one bottle of...

389
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
No, two bottles of "Cuvedom Pericnon" -
and two glasses please!

390
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Ten minutes?

391
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,900
Okay, thanks.

392
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Oh, and a French dictionary please!

393
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,300
Of course, boss!

394
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,100
Yes Franky...

395
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,100
The cops are after the car, too...

396
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,400
We are listening to the cops radio...

397
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,500
You can rely on us, Franky - 120 percent!

398
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Yes, 120 percent...

399
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Yes, today.

400
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,400
What did Franky say?

401
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Franky says: "If you morons don't find the car
before the cops do -

402
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,500
-something bad will happen to you!"

403
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,400
But what can happen? Franky is harmless!

404
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,500
Are you kidding?

405
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,500
I heard Franky once bit someones balls off,
that owed him money.

406
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
And he swallowed them!

407
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,000
Ahhh! That was delicious!

408
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Now tell me: What was it?

409
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Bull testicles!

410
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,600
- You are saying we ate the balls of a bull?
- Seems so...

411
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Let's hope the ice cream was
really ice cream!

412
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,400
- How many do you have?
- Eight.

413
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,800
- Eight?
- Yes, how many do you have?

414
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,600
Twenty

415
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Do you remember that the doctor said that
you only have a few days left?

416
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Maybe we should pick just one wish -
the most important one!

417
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That's difficult... I don't want to decide.

418
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,000
Let's do it this way: You pick a number from 
my list and I pick one from yours.

419
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,300
- Okay. Who starts?
- You!

420
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,300
You have twenty... then I take number...

421
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,700
One! I take number one!

422
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,400
That's the Cadillac for my mother.

423
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,400
- "Cadillac for your mother"?
- Yes.

424
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,500
A Cadillac Fleetwood -
like the one Elvis bought for his mother.

425
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,900
My mother is the biggest Elvis fan in the world.

426
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:45,100
When I was a small boy I was sitting in front of the TV
with my mother, when we saw it.

427
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,700
My mother was sitting there and she cried.

428
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,800
And since then it was my biggest wish
to buy one for her, too.

429
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,900
But I never had the money...

430
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
That is a good wish

431
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,800
I like it.

432
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Now it's your turn. Pick a number.

433
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,800
You had eight - so I take seven -

434
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,800
No, I'll take number one, too.

435
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Can't we pick something else?

436
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,000
That's your wish?

437
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,600
Your number one wish?

438
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Yes, it's not as good as the
Cadillac for your mother, but...

439
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
"Fuck two women at once".

440
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,600
No: "Sleep with them"!

441
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,600
"Fuck"! - You want to "fuck" them.

442
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,500
- That's how you say it in your language!
- That's how you say it in every language!

443
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,300
"To sleep": That is to close your eyes
and turn around.

444
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,300
The thing you want to do is: "Fuck"!

445
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Martin! Wake up!

446
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,500
What's wrong?

447
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
The police!

448
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,900
Put your guns away, or
I will kill the hostage!

449
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,700
Take off your clothes!

450
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,300
Did you catch the bandits?

451
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,400
Do I look like Batman?

452
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,000
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

453
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
They want to blow up the entire hotel. 
We'll call the SWAT team!

454
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Nice car, isn't it?

455
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,000
This is our car!

456
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,500
- Your car?
- Yes, officer, it was stolen.

457
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,700
- Too bad.
- Yes, bad things happen...

458
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,700
Things happen? The two motherfucking 
thieves are probably in that hotel!

459
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Probably!

460
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,200
Is this your car?

461
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,700
Here is the key!
Never leave it on the sun visor again!

462
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,900
See?

463
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,400
I am coming soon, lads!

464
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,900
That were nice fucking cops!

465
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,100
I knew that I could rely on you!

466
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,500
Well done!

467
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Where is the case?

468
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,500
Which case?

469
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,500
The case with my money is gone!

470
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,900
We don't know anything about a case.

471
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:48,900
There was a case with a million that I owe to
Curtis and now you motherfuckers owe it to me!

472
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,600
But where can we get a million?

473
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,100
Why are you asking me? Go to the bank!
Play the lottery! Ask your mothers!

474
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:00,100
But the fucking cops stole it.
They are all borrupt!

475
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,700
Corrupt!

476
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,700
- See?
- I know!

477
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,300
- Is something wrong?
- Your driver's license and registration, please!

478
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,900
registration...

479
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,300
driver's license.

480
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,100
- The car is almost new?
- Not even one year old.

481
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,900
- How many kilometers?
- Less than 30,000.

482
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,100
- Have you been in the army?
- 4 years.

483
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
- Yes or No?

484
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,200
Yes, sir!

485
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,700
Are there problems with the radiator?

486
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,200
- Who?
- The car!

487
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,200
No. Everything's fine.

488
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,700
I think everything is fine here, too.
He is destined for the mission!

489
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,700
What mission?

490
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,700
Get out of the car!

491
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
Come with me.

492
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,600
This is a special mission. We picked you
because we think you are destined to do it.

493
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Really?
Can I get some money out of it?

494
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,100
We are doing it for the government.

495
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,200
Yes, sir!

496
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,900
Mr. Schneider! Hello, Mr. Schneider!

497
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,900
Inspector Schneider!

498
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:37,200
Well, Mr. Inspector Schneider, I just wanted to
tell you that Brest now stole a police car!

499
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,100
Couldn't you wait until I am back in the office?

500
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,100
And there is something else!

501
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,800
What is it? Should I guess?

502
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,900
- You'll never guess!
- Keller!

503
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,900
- The other one - Wurlitzer - he is a hostage!
- Hostage!?

504
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,900
Yes, he threadened him with a gun!
He wanted to kill him!

505
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,400
How did you get to the police, by the way?

506
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,900
I used the bus!

507
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,300
Authorization...

508
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,300
Document...

509
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,800
Allowing for all possibilities,
they couldn't have gotten further than this!

510
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,600
Well done, Keller!

511
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,200
Do you want to earn some points?

512
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,200
- Sure, boss!
- Initiate a police search there!

513
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,500
Keller, you will get us a hubi.
We'll fly there!

514
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,900
Heli!

515
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,600
Sorry?

516
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,900
The official abbreviation for
"helicopter" is "heli"!

517
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,900
I don't fucking care what it is called
as long as it flies!

518
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Put your hands behind your head and
step back from the car!

519
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,200
What?

520
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,600
Your hands! Behind your head!
I am a police officer!

521
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,700
Me too!

522
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,800
Come here - I need your help!

523
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,500
I have a small problem with
the radiator...

524
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,500
I filled it with water, but the engine is overheated!

525
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,600
I havn't got a clue about cars!
Can I see your police ID, please?

526
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,600
Listen to me: I am a special representative
of the Department of the Interior.

527
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,600
I am delivering a document
to the chancelor's office!

528
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,600
It would be best for everyone, if you
would let me use your helicopter, now!

529
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Can I see the authorization?

530
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,600
I thought that police cars never break down...

531
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,800
...never go bust...

532
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,000
Everything alright, colleague?

533
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Everything alright!
You can join us in the helicopter!

534
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,200
There will be consequences!

535
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,400
Rudi!

536
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,300
Do you have this!?

537
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,300
Excuse me, please!

538
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,000
You will need a prescription.

539
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,500
Don't be ridicidulous!
It's a matter of life and death!

540
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,500
- I'll pay as much as you want!
- I can't, it's a very strong drug!

541
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,400
Load your weapons!
Take your stand!

542
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
Off you go!

543
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Boss, you have to see this!

544
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,600
"...we don't know if people
were injured or killed..."

545
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,600
"...we will now switch to our reporter,
she is on the scene..."

546
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,200
Do you want to marry me, Keller?

547
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,200
"I am knockin' on heavens door!
I've got nothing to loose!"

548
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,300
This guy is sick!

549
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,300
"Fuck off!"

550
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,500
"Hey, I want you to fuck off!
You got two minutes!"

551
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,200
"That was about 10 minutes ago."

552
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:10,200
"The police withdrew and the kidnapper
Martin Brest fled into this turkish diner."

553
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,900
Why do I learn this from TV?

554
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:18,900
"The psychopathic Martin Brest kidnapped
Rudi Wurlitzer on Monday night from a hospital."

555
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,400
She doesn't have any tits!

556
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,700
Snipers!

557
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,200
They probably got snipers on the roof!

558
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
If they had snipers,
you wouldn't be standing there!

559
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,800
But I am the hostage!

560
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,400
They wouldn't kill the hostage - would they?

561
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,800
That's happened before.

562
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,900
[Turkish]

563
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:21,100
The "Helsinki Syndrome" describes a change
in the relationship between the hostage and 
the kidnapper.

564
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:26,700
A radical, unconscious change
of the hostage's survival strategy.

565
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:35,100
After some time in panic, the hostage starts to
seek the trust and friendship of the kidnapper.

566
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,100
But he is still violently following his goals.

567
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,100
What goal?
That's bullshit!

568
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,100
Mr Schneider, please let me do the 
psychological study!

569
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:53,300
You can study whatever you want, but these
two guys are playing us for a sucker!

570
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,600
It's OK, you don't have to pay!

571
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,700
Listen, I can't give you change for that...
This is not a bank.

572
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,200
That's alright

573
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
They are coming out!

574
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,500
I am sorry, but I need your car!

575
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,500
- Get into the car, baby face!
- Don't ever call me baby face again!

576
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,500
In the other side!

577
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,300
Get closer!

578
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
We're on air!

579
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,500
"When leaving the diner, Brest threatened
a woman and took her car."

580
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:57,500
"Brest, who seems to be ready for anything,
robbed a bank the other day for 80,000 Marks."

581
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,900
Not to mention my million!

582
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,700
"We do not know what he did to Wurlitzer,
but we hope that the hostage is ok."

583
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:11,700
"We will be back as soon as there are more news.
Celia Sarto for TVL2."

584
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,500
Corrupt cops, yes...

585
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,300
SHIT!

586
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,700
The guy had my suitcase!

587
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,500
Get Carlos and the Rodrigez brothers and...

588
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,500
GET MY MONEY BACK!

589
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,500
Boss, they stole a car and
are heading for the Dutch border now.

590
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Tell our people to follow and observe them,
but without attracting attention!

591
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Are they stupid?
Aren't they afraid that you could kill me?

592
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,500
You just lost your driver's license!

593
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,100
If I knew this would happen,
I would have gone to school for another job!

594
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,100
You went to SCHOOL for this shit???

595
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,200
We lost them!

596
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,200
We really lost them!

597
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,500
They're gone!
These idiots are lucky, too!

598
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,500
Too much luck for my taste!
You will now take over from here!

599
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,500
You are now responsible here, Keller!
Now you have to show me that you are a cop!

600
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Yes, boss!
I'll get them!

601
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,400
I'll get you motherfuckers!

602
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,200
Boss! Boss!

603
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,600
Hello!

604
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,500
What are you doing! Get out of my car!
If there is a problem come to my window!

605
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,500
That's not possible,
since everybody could see my gun then!

606
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,100
Don't make a mistake!

607
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,100
You can put your hands down.

608
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,900
Do you know me?

609
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,900
No.

610
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,300
Open this!

611
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:54,200
I am married, we don't have children yet,
but my wife is pregnant...

612
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Hey, that's good for you!
Congratulations!

613
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,500
Now listen to me: This is 80,000 Marks,
which I robbed from the bank.

614
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:08,800
And this is about 3,000 Marks,
which I robbed from the gas station.

615
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,300
I want you to give the money back!
Can I count on you?

616
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,200
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

617
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,200
That should clarify the situation
with your people.

618
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,600
If I see a cop from now on -

619
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,200
I will kill the hostage!

620
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,000
Everything fine?

621
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
- Yes, we are debt-free!
- That sounds good to me!

622
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,400
Off you go, TJ!

623
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,600
If you need a taxi again: 2727!

624
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Good day, gentlemen!
What can I do for you?

625
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,000
Have we met before?

626
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,200
No.

627
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,200
We want to buy a Cadillac!

628
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,800
Just like the one that Elvis bought
for his mother.

629
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
No problem!

630
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,300
"HOSTAGE-DRAMA:

631
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,800

- What's the street?

632
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:12,800
- I told you: Huehnerbeinstrasse!
- Ha, that's a strange name for a street...

633
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,100
OK, put the letters in the mail now.

Hey, what are you planning?

A Cadillac for you, two women for me...
At least I have to invite them for dinner!

01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,700
My boy!

639
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,900
What happened to you?

640
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,400
Where have you been for so long?

641
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,800
Look at what I brought for you!

642
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,900
It's beautiful!

643
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,300
I don't even have a driver's license!

644
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:39,300
And you're not even Elvis...

645
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,400
Come on Brest! The game is over!
Drop the gun!

646
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,100
Get inside mom!

647
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,100
- What is going on?
- Drop the gun, Brest!

648
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,100
Or I'll shoot!

649
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,800
- Martin, do what he says!
- I can't do that, Rudi!

650
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,800
Drop the gun!

651
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,600
The ocean is not so important now!
I will see it eventually!

652
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,600
Yes, you will see it! But what about me!?

653
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,900
Well done, Brest!

654
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,900
Let me go!

655
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:48,100
You are a liar! You tell me about the ocean,
but you have never been there yourself!

656
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:53,100
- Arrest the son-of-a-bitch!
- What? This man is dying! He is seriously ill!

657
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:58,100
Get an ambulance, or you
will have to arrest him in heaven!

658
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I will go with him.

659
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,800
What? You are going with him?
After all he has done to you?

660
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:19,800
I know the doctor! I know the hospital!
He is my friend and I will take care for him!

661
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Helsinki Syndrom!

662
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You go with them!

663
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:44,400
- Is that a brothel or a chorus line?
- Nobody else knows either...

664
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,100
It's a brothel!

665
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,000
What?

666
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
A brothel!

667
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,700
What about you?

668
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Hey, it's your wish, Rudi!

669
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,000
Can I have two...?

670
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,100
You can have them all -
when you got enough money!

671
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,700
Are you done already?
Then take care of the toilettes now!

672
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,400
No, I don't think we will
clean the toilettes today, boss!

673
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,100
You don't think so?

674
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,100
And why don't you think so, Abdul?

675
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,400
They are here!

676
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,700
Didn't you like it, Rudi?

677
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Oh, I did...

678
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,500
But you look so sad.

679
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,700
There are so many undone things in my life,

680
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,700
so many things unsaid...

681
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,700
You know...

682
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,200
That was probably the greatest fuck of my life!

683
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,300
And your last!

684
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,900
Good! Now, that we're all together...

685
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,700
Where is my money?

686
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,600
What money?

687
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,600
Don't fuck with me!
Tell me where my money is!

688
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And I will spare your life!

689
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,400
What's so funny?

690
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,500
Actually nothing...

691
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,500
I see...
Where did we leave off?

692
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,600
Yes... the money.

693
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,800
We mailed it to various people.
There is nothing left.

694
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,700
Why are you making it so hard for me?

695
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,500
Unfortunately I have to kill you now!

696
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:37,500
Go for it! I will die soon anyway.
I've got a cerebral tumor, I don't care!

697
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,200
Then I will kill you!

698
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,300
I don't want to piss you off, but...

699
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:50,700
I've got bone cancer, late stage,
I don't care either!

700
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,200
SHUT UP!

701
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,200
I'll kill you now!

702
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Here we are...

703
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,200
Can you taste the salt?

704
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,200
Rudi?

705
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,900
I've got to tell you something!

706
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,800
I know.
But let me tell you something:

707
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,800
You don't have to be afraid!

708
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:55,000

Spread your legs!

711
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,200
Hey, what's going on?

712
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,800
Where did this come from?

713
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,900
From Santa Claus?

714
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,900
From Santa Claus?  No!
There was a letter in my mailbox!

715
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,100
In your mailbox?

716
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,100
From Rudi and Martin!

717
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,500
- From Rudi and Martin?
- That was written on it!

718
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,600
I don't even know them!
I promise!

719
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:59,700
Supposed you are telling the truth
and this was in your mailbox-

720
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,300
-who the fuck are Rudi and Martin?
