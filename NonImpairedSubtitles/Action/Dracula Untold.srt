1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:24,432
In the year of our Lord. 1442.

2
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:30,136
The Turkish Sultan enslaved
1,000 Transylvania boys.

3
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:34,181
To fill the ranks of his army.

4
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:40,618
These child slaves were
beaten without mercy.

5
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:43,728
Trained to kill without conscience.

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,595
To crave the blood... of all
who would fight...

7
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:49,539
the Turks.

8
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:58,466
From among these boys...

9
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:02,743
one grew into a warrior, so fearsome...

10
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:05,282
that entire armies would
retreat in terror...

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,480
to the mention of his name

12
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:12,682
Vlad the Impaler.

13
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:16,712
Son... of the Dragon.

14
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:22,380
sickened by his monstrous act...

15
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,409
Vlad came to bury his past with the dead.

16
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:28,477
And returned to Transylvania
to rule in peace.

17
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,775
His subjects called him Prince.

18
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,144
I call him Father.

19
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,750
But the world would come to know him as...

20
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:40,247
Dracula.

21
00:01:58,739 --> 00:01:59,994
I left it...

22
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:02,080
where I found it.

23
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,027
What do you think, Vlad?

24
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:12,622
Bring it to me.

25
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,771
This belongs to a scout.
One of Hamza Bey's men.

26
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:32,000
What the hell is a lone
Turk doing out here?

27
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:37,264
Turkish scouts never travel alone.
If there is one, there is more.

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,442
And whatever they scout...
they conquer.

29
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:50,801
This is washed downstream.

30
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,008
It came from up there.

31
00:02:58,424 --> 00:02:59,723
Broken Tooth Mountain.

32
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:04,679
Soon it will be night.
They'll seek refuge.

33
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:10,670
Dumitru, I need you to return to the castle.
Alert the guards and double the sentury.

34
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,305
What? I'm not leaving you here.

35
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:15,431
The Turks to cross into my land,
unannounced, is a sign of war.

36
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,010
What are you going to do
if you find them?

37
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:16,089
What are you going to do
if you find them?

38
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,309
What are you going to do
if you find them?

39
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:20,296
I'll do what Princes do best - negotiate.

40
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,271
Nicolai, Andre, with me.

41
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,647
[...]

42
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:55,285
Anything?

43
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:11,647
It smells like your feet.

44
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,479
They are inside.

45
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:27,149
How do you know?

46
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:30,924
Bats don't come out during the day.
Something's disturbed them.

47
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:35,658
Come on.

48
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:24,189
What is it, my Lord?

49
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,075
The floor.

50
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,182
It's crushed the bone.

51
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,591
The Turks didn't do this.

52
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:45,967
What's that&

53
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:52,613
We leave. Now.

54
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,945
The creature you encountered
was no accident, my Prince.

55
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:06,656
Four nights ago every brother of our order
awoke from an identical dream.

56
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:11,918
I would not have thought it possible, had I not
suffered the same vision myself that night.

57
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:16,693
every  creature lands siege
to this holy place.

58
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:23,417
The Romans mystics prophecized
the coming of a great evil.

59
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:25,857
A vampire.

60
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:30,243
From the Greek word, '<i>Vα πίνουν</i>'

61
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:32,495
'To drink'.

62
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,951
The beast was once a mortal man,

63
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:38,732
who summoned the demon
from the depths of hell,

64
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,014
to trade for his dark power.

65
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:45,491
The demon tricked the man,
granting his wish.

66
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:49,717
But his price was eternity condemned
the darkness of that cave.

67
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:53,182
Where he remains until he finds another...

68
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:55,881
to set him free.

69
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,810
Now you know it's true face.

70
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,649
The people of Transylvania are living
in a fear the Turks return.

71
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,692
Promise me you'll guard
this secret, brother.

72
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,137
Papa!

73
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:25,089
I've missed you.

74
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:26,558
And I - you.

75
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:30,450
My big soldier.

76
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,219
What, an embrace, but no kiss?

77
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,458
Are we going to argue?
- You always leaving [...]?

78
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:44,750
I've missed you.

79
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:49,918
Something troubles you, what is it?

80
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:54,579
Only the impossible depths of your beauty.

81
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,375
Puts the rest of the world to shame.

82
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,668
Pay no attention to your father, Ingeras.

83
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,974
Flattery is a cheap distraction from truth.

84
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:04,793
[<i>whispers</i>] Ah, she knows all my tricks.

85
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:08,447
You're a terrible liar.
It's one of your most endearing qualities.

86
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,503
You're just in time for bed.

87
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:23,521
- Can we go riding tomorrow, Papa?
- Of course we can.

88
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:25,783
- You most certainly cannot!
- Why not?

89
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,181
Because tomorrow is the
day of our recent Lord.

90
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,521
- Ah, of course.
- That's Easter.

91
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:33,938
What was I thinking...

92
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:40,879
So, what attacked you?

93
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,331
Wolves?

94
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,048
I suppose.

95
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,886
All I know... is that I've
lost two good men today.

96
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,224
There is something more...

97
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,270
I was the same age as Ingeras,
when I was sent to live with the Turks.

98
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,274
To fight for them.

99
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,430
If I never saw another,
it would be too soon.

100
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:37,489
You're home now.

101
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,270
For almost as many years as you were gone.

102
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:45,776
I just want peace...

103
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,303
that's all.

104
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:16,425
My fellow Transylvanians, an Easter toast.

105
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:19,236
Ten years of peace and prosperity,

106
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,496
ever since our Prince came back to us.

107
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,670
My old friend, it's 20 more.

108
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,610
Hamza Bey... welcome.

109
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:03,175
We were not expecting you so soon.

110
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:07,527
Sultan Mehmed The Second offers
his salutations to you and your son.

111
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:10,434
Thank you. I have his tribute ready.

112
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:22,098
I am afraid... there is something more
than the tribute to discuss.

113
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,052
The Turks have no enemies here.

114
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:27,139
Did you not think we would not notice
the battalion of our scouts?

115
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:29,485
- Missing?
- I did not kill them.

116
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,627
The Sultan's tribute. Take it and leave.

117
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,802
There is one last thing.

118
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:13,971
The Sultan requires 1000 boys
to join his Janissary Corps.

119
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:17,981
NO! NEVER!!

120
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:22,517
Janissaries! He ended
that practice years ago.

121
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:26,648
If a soldier is plucked as a child...

122
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,126
and raised to know no other life...

123
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,039
he will kill without question,
and die without complaint.

124
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:39,301
Any who are 15 years of age or older,
will fight in Hungary.

125
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:43,361
And those from 10 to 14 will be
made ready for the siege of Vienna.

126
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,716
The Sultan expects obedience.

127
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:52,306
After all... it was your own father
to give you up, without a fight.

128
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:02,407
Don't, please.

129
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,098
It must be gone.

130
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:40,423
Courage, anger, even love,
none of this can matter to a Prince.

131
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:44,158
All that matters is his
duty to these people.

132
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,695
What does it mean to be a royal hostage?

133
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,875
My father gave me to the Sultan,
to prove his loyalty.

134
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,047
Were you scared there? With them?

135
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:00,985
I wanted to make my father proud.

136
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,689
Do you have to give me to the Sultan?

137
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:10,243
That was a long time ago.

138
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:17,957
You have nothing to worry about.
Do you understand?

139
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,962
Good.

140
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:40,377
If I defy the order they'll kill 100
for every one I save.

141
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,782
You told me you and Mehmed
were once like brothers.

142
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:46,984
Why didn't you ask...

143
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,886
Isn't it possible he might
show you some mercy?

144
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,567
Have you ever seen the like of it?

145
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,679
Soon the entire world will be Turk.

146
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:37,938
Lord Impaler...

147
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,371
My oldest of friends.

148
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:45,180
I miss that days together.

149
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,221
All I miss from my time with you...

150
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:48,741
is the coffee.

151
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,950
It's true that my father's palace was a
cruel place for a young boy far from home.

152
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,857
But soon you talked like us,
prayed like us, fought like us...

153
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,562
speakig of which... I am owed 1,000 boys.

154
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:07,889
Why have I not seen them?

155
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:10,783
Mehmed, my brother.

156
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,906
- I will grant you anything El...
- I need soldiers...

157
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:17,984
brother.

158
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,039
Then take me.

159
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:30,316
I'm worth a 1,000 boys and you know it.

160
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:34,201
- Those kings would tremble if they knew.
- Then accept my offer.

161
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,210
When we were boys, how I longed
to fight side-by-side.

162
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,697
But now I'm Sultan, what need have I
for one more soldier?

163
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,866
I will have my 1000 boys.

164
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,390
And one more.

165
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:52,559
Your son will be raised under my roof.

166
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:56,233
Just as you were raised
under the roof of my father.

167
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,853
You may retain your throne.

168
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:04,199
But General Ismail will remain to see
that my orders are fulfilled.

169
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:08,999
What is one son?

170
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:13,214
If you're virile, you'll make plenty more.

171
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:49,414
You promised this would never happen.

172
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,931
- Marina, listen...
- The day you asked for my hand,
do you remember what I said?

173
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,387
You said: 'No, stay my only friend..."

174
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,652
I knew what happens to
the sons of the Queen.

175
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,588
You said tings would be different.

176
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,383
You said if I loved you I should trust you.

177
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,203
- And I love you!
- Then trust me! It's this or we start a war!

178
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,765
- It's fine, boys.
They just saying the goodbyes and all..

179
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,613
[...] promise me to my family!

180
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:18,412
Stop it, don't touch me!

181
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:21,720
I won't let them do that!!

182
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:32,297
I'll GO!!

183
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:44,528
I can do it.

184
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,027
Proud of me, aren't you?

185
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,700
Of course, I am.

186
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,764
You have chosen wisely.

187
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,794
I have to say, we are a little...
disappointed, frankly...

188
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,719
I expected more resistance... from you.

189
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:32,181
- Run to your mother.
- What?

190
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:33,706
Now!!

191
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,915
Mehmed will punish all of Transylvania
for what you have done.

192
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,828
It's not a child's place
to save his country.

193
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,944
Get my family to the castle.

194
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,185
Mehmed will be sending others soon enough.
War will come!

195
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:40,634
You can't protect us.

196
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:45,033
I'll find a way.

197
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:48,429
Vlad, where are you going?

198
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:52,268
Whatever horror in Broken Tooth.
I know it kills Turks.

199
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:11,212
It seems no one has ever had
the privilege of leaving [...]

200
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:15,265
Neither will you.

201
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:57,180
Those are meant to reek of fear.

202
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:02,085
In you... I sense hope.

203
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,456
Your silver offends me,
[...] it from my sight.

204
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:21,359
What kind of man crawled into his own grave
in search of hope, hm?

205
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:23,753
A desperate one.

206
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:27,291
The Turks threaten to destroy my kingdom.

207
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,108
Power like yours... I could stop them.

208
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,133
Save my people. Save my family.

209
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,871
How supremely noble, Lord Impaler.

210
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:43,657
How is 'Dracula, son of the devil'?

211
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,291
You are mistaken.

212
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:51,258
It means 'Son of the dragon,
protector of the innocent'.

213
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:56,876
Do your people how many innocents...
you have killed?

214
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,749
Was it... Hundreds?

215
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,548
Yes.

216
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:11,018
Lie to me again, and I open you
from your belly to your brain...

217
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:13,083
and feed you your intestines.

218
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:14,630
- Thousands.

219
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,264
And when you put them to the stake,
what did you feel?

220
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:20,982
Shame, horror, power?

221
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:24,837
- ANSWER ME!!
- Nothing!

222
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:29,623
I felt nothing.
A greater crime than the act itself.

223
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:33,357
Then why spill blood, if not
for the pleasure of it?

224
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:38,592
Because men do not fear swords...
they fear monsters.

225
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:44,946
They run from them.by putting one village
to the stake, I spare ten more.

226
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:48,893
Sometimes the world no longer needs a hero.

227
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:53,254
Sometimes what it needs... is a monster.

228
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:58,233
And you believe you know what it is,
to be a monster? Hm?

229
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:28,088
You have no idea.

230
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:33,380
But I am going to show you.

231
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:39,397
For centuries these mouldering walls
have been my gallows.

232
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:43,679
Now I'm bound to this cave,
condemned by one who turned me.

233
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:48,145
Oh, I've waited an eternity
for a man of your strength.

234
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:52,747
Your gifts, your will.
A man, worthy of the dark...

235
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,731
and all it's powers.

236
00:26:56,541 --> 00:27:00,350
For if I am your salvation,
you are mine.

237
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,363
Drink, you will have a taste of my power.

238
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:15,596
The strength of a 100 men.

239
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:17,987
The speed of a falling star.

240
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:24,283
Dominion over the night and all it's creatures
to see and hear through their senses.

241
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:31,323
- Even heal grievest wounds...
- At what price?

242
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:36,839
Once you drink, your thirst for human blood
will be insatiable.

243
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:41,566
But if you can resist for three days...

244
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:46,399
you will return to your mortal state,
having sampled my power.

245
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,682
And perhaps saved your people.

246
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:52,981
- And if I feed?
- The price will be worse than if
you'd never stepped in here..

247
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:59,855
Well, I will be set free, having
granted the darkness a worthy offering.

248
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,848
You will become it's vessel, as I am.

249
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,436
A scourge on this Earth.
Destined to destroy...

250
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:12,286
everything you hold dear: your lands, your
people... even your precious wife and son.

251
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:16,112
- I would die before I harm them.
- Indeed you will, I'm afraid.

252
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:22,420
I, however, would at last be free to unleash
my wrath against the one who betrayed me

253
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,759
And one day I will call on you to serve me, my
pawn. Ending the mortal game... of revenge.

254
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,462
- This is not a game!
- Ahh, won't better way to endure eternity?

255
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:38,072
This, oh Prince, is the ultimate game.

256
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,419
Light versus dark.

257
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,485
Hope versus despair.

258
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:48,374
And all the world's fate hangs,
in the balance.

259
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:52,465
And it will be my great pleasure
to disappoint you.

260
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:54,471
Drink.

261
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:01,552
Let the games begin.

262
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,069
What now?

263
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:30,145
Now...

264
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,264
you die.

265
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:56,792
Papa!

266
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:24,856
FIRE-E-E!!!

267
00:32:53,947 --> 00:32:56,574
- You came back.
- I always will.

268
00:32:58,024 --> 00:33:01,250
- Where were you?
- Searching for the strength I needed.

269
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:03,154
You're back.

270
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:22,554
A good Prince would had given them up!

271
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,691
A good Prince would have
paid that price for peace.

272
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:29,912
But I give you my word...

273
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:33,297
we will NOT be defeated!

274
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,270
They brought war to our land!

275
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:39,434
They will pay dearly for it.

276
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,579
Fire!

277
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:11,886
Negotiations failed.

278
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,997
Do not ask me what happened
on this field tonight.

279
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:19,322
Trust only that I will use all I have
to keep us safe.

280
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,369
But we will not be safe if we stay here!

281
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:28,638
We must leave directly for Cosia monastery.
It's high in the mountains.

282
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:30,444
Too remote for cannon fire.

283
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:33,147
It's our best chance of survival.

284
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:37,227
We'll take a half of our people,
it's not that our absence is noticed.

285
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:41,084
That way, when Mehmed learns
what has happened here...

286
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:44,223
he'll come hunting for us.

287
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,347
Word, from Castle Dracula.

288
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:49,458
Vlad has defeated a 1000 of our men.

289
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:54,473
Then send a 100,000.
I will lead them.

290
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:59,608
When I march into Europe,
I will have his head upon my spear.

291
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,786
And his child? At my side.

292
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:06,768
We can fight the way our great
grandfathers fought.

293
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:10,660
Use the forests, the mountains around
the Burgo Pass.

294
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,971
- Four or five months of that.
- Not months.

295
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,620
I'm [<i>glowing?</i>] this war in three days.

296
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,491
Why not two?
That'd really impress us.

297
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:54,324
What is it?

298
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:58,999
I need some air.

299
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:01,080
I'm sorry.

300
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:23,080
Don't think I haven't noticed
you following me.

301
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:25,339
You're mistaken.

302
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:30,721
I follow them. They recognize
one of their own.

303
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,396
The night is their kingdom...

304
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:37,860
blood - their sustenance.

305
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:44,065
And some many say - have lived for as long
as there have been prey to devour.

306
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,352
Spare me your [<i>reavings?</i>].

307
00:40:48,253 --> 00:40:51,098
They say that one, who
escaped the mountain,

308
00:40:51,472 --> 00:40:54,295
hides behind the face of a man.

309
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:58,305
Well, if that man is me...

310
00:40:58,994 --> 00:41:01,230
you know a knife would not
do you any good.

311
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,172
Of course not.

312
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,599
Why do you think I stayed?

313
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,810
I know there is only...

314
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:18,084
so far on this Earth... we can run.

315
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:23,466
And it is not... far enough.

316
00:41:27,248 --> 00:41:29,077
Let me serve you.

317
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:43,948
Stay away from me.

318
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,418
Yes, Master.

319
00:42:05,517 --> 00:42:08,115
Fulfill your destiny.

320
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:11,766
Set me free...

321
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:32,489
We found him, in the field.
He asked for you.

322
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,696
A message f-from Prince Vlad.

323
00:42:40,944 --> 00:42:43,228
He hopes... you enjoy the view.

324
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:35,580
Your scars are gone?

325
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:41,194
What's happening to you?

326
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,233
I met [...] fear on Broken Tooth.

327
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:56,638
Not a ghost... something else.

328
00:44:07,677 --> 00:44:12,228
No! Stop it! May God strike down
[...] who did this to you.

329
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:13,670
I chose this.

330
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:18,299
This is the strength you sought?

331
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,191
But why?

332
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:28,007
Because I sent corpses back to Mehmed.

333
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:30,443
Instead of our son.

334
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:35,718
- You did this for us?
- In two days I'll be restored.

335
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:39,516
I just have to resist.

336
00:44:42,108 --> 00:44:43,416
Resist what?

337
00:44:47,196 --> 00:44:49,131
Resist what, Vlad? Tell me!

338
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:51,961
The thirst.

339
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:55,133
For blood.

340
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:02,260
And if you are to give in?

341
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:05,961
Then I become this for eternity.

342
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:14,751
You will not do this, won't you?

343
00:45:16,035 --> 00:45:19,041
I swear, I will not give in.

344
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:22,244
So God will forgive you.

345
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:24,825
Vlad!

346
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:28,368
Mehmed is getting closer.
You might want to move out soon.

347
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:32,457
I need you to get to the monastery
as quickly as you can.

348
00:45:32,714 --> 00:45:34,354
- Mehmed's men will be close behind.
- No!

349
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:35,091
Listen to me.

350
00:45:35,728 --> 00:45:37,590
I will reach you after sundown.

351
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:38,995
I promise you.

352
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:48,789
I love you.

353
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:05,487
My husband agrees with your council.

354
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:09,074
We will depart now,
under your temporary command.

355
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:13,284
- What? Where is Vlad going to be?
- Spying on the Turks.

356
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:17,006
- He insists on doing a reconnaissance.
- No.

357
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:20,843
- I won't allow it.
- It's too late. He's already gone.

358
00:46:24,953 --> 00:46:27,922
All right, everyone.
Prepare to move out!

359
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:48,870
Tell the Sultan where his
enemies will be buried.

360
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:18,266
Listen.

361
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,968
We are nearly there.

362
00:47:39,604 --> 00:47:41,720
COVER THE REAR!!

363
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:18,655
Couldn't these monks put the gate
a little bit closer?!

364
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:31,078
Stay behind me.

365
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:54,635
Didn't the Turks teach you anything, eh?
I saw your blade coming from...

366
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:00,318
Ingeras, run!

367
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:02,798
Where is your Prince now?

368
00:49:03,995 --> 00:49:05,298
My Lady?

369
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:41,772
It's OK.

370
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,083
It's OK.

371
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,670
Dumitru, listen. Listen!

372
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:19,616
Come here.

373
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:24,307
Never leave us again, Papa.

374
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,543
Never.
I will always watch over you.

375
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:36,767
To the gate!!

376
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:43,536
Keep moving on! This way!

377
00:50:57,947 --> 00:50:59,962
You should never have strayed from us.

378
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:02,189
- Whatever your reasons for leave were.
- Quiet!

379
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:09,774
- Get these men off their knees!
- Stand up, do you hear me?! Stand up!

380
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:15,256
The Turks are coming!
Prayers will not defend these walls!!

381
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,991
Do you believe we can do this?

382
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:27,747
Mehmet's men will be coming from the North.

383
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:31,016
Double the sentries on
the perimeter walls. Go!

384
00:51:33,147 --> 00:51:34,145
What's in there?

385
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:39,486
Something I hoped to never use again.

386
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,114
Come now.

387
00:51:52,805 --> 00:51:55,324
The men say that Vlad has become a monster.

388
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,937
I fear this will only inflate the rumors
of the Prince's dark magic.

389
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:01,643
Only if we allow it.

390
00:52:03,196 --> 00:52:05,493
Men cannot fear what they cannot see.

391
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,662
Remember when you first joined my army?

392
00:52:16,324 --> 00:52:19,001
You wanted to pick up your sword and fight!

393
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:23,831
When my generals blindfolded you...

394
00:52:24,738 --> 00:52:29,192
you did not believe that you could
march without seeing.

395
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,119
But you could.

396
00:52:34,144 --> 00:52:39,752
Now march with me!
Your Sultan will guide you!

397
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:43,109
Prince Vlad, the vampire is
vulnerable to daylight.

398
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:49,247
And... to pure silver.

399
00:53:56,092 --> 00:53:58,741
Yet the Holy Cross exerts
no power over you.

400
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:02,649
That can only mean you have yet
to seal your fate with human blood.

401
00:54:04,262 --> 00:54:08,035
Let me kill you now, my Prince.
Please!

402
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:12,908
Before your people do.
Rumor has spread of what you have become.

403
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,483
You can still repent.

404
00:54:17,162 --> 00:54:18,903
You do will to run, Lucien.

405
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,148
It's true! He's a vampire!!

406
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:46,998
Listen! He is your Prince!
Please give him a chance to explain!

407
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,530
- Please! Stop, please!
- KILL THE MONSTER!!

408
00:54:52,442 --> 00:54:54,305
SATAN LIVES IN HIS HEART!!

409
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:20,853
Try to save his soul!

410
00:55:33,828 --> 00:55:37,344
Take him to my room and shut the door.
Do not let him not look outside.

411
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:38,673
- OK.
- Mama!

412
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:11,524
This is your loyalty?!
Your gratitude?!

413
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:14,031
Fools.

414
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,702
Do you think you're alive
because you can FIGHT?!

415
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:24,884
You are alive because OF ME!!

416
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,432
Because of what I did to save you!!

417
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:41,337
This is NOT who you are.

418
00:56:58,022 --> 00:56:59,516
Return to your stations.

419
00:57:01,158 --> 00:57:04,781
Believe me, there is still more to fear!

420
00:57:09,522 --> 00:57:10,600
Lord.

421
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:13,255
If you've not yet forsaken me.

422
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:16,874
[...] me your strength that I may
resist the darkness.

423
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,457
Allow me to endure this test one more day.

424
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:26,328
I beg you.

425
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,553
Please...

426
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:48,678
Are you sick?

427
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:56,690
If you are sick, thought
[...] make you feel better.

428
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,266
Thank you. Come.

429
00:58:14,626 --> 00:58:16,296
You'll make a great leader some day

430
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,583
You think of others before yourself.

431
00:58:22,261 --> 00:58:26,140
When the Turks came to take me...
you stopped them.

432
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:32,425
That's why you got sick, isn't it?
To save me?

433
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:39,521
And I would do it all again.

434
00:59:13,878 --> 00:59:15,522
They're almost here.

435
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:22,577
Dawn will be breaking soon.
And with it the loss of my powers.

436
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:28,935
- If we've not won this war by then...
- I will fight beside you until death.

437
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,031
Your death would end my fight.

438
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:34,105
We have done the duty of any good parent.

439
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:36,603
Protected our child.

440
00:59:36,924 --> 00:59:38,789
Protected all the children in the kingdom.

441
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:42,736
Perhaps our destiny was not to rule
in this life.

442
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:46,961
Do you remember our wedding vow?

443
00:59:49,928 --> 00:59:52,465
Why think separately of
this life and the next?

444
00:59:52,765 --> 00:59:54,407
Then one is born from the last.

445
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:58,788
Time is always too short
for those who need it .

446
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:03,861
But for those who love... last forever.

447
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,671
STAND YOUR POSITION!!!

448
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,829
FIRE!!!

449
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:54,956
WHERE IS HE?!!

450
01:03:55,394 --> 01:03:56,826
FIRE!!

451
01:04:08,102 --> 01:04:10,932
Find your father, [...]!

452
01:04:22,956 --> 01:04:24,069
Where is he?

453
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:35,575
You can keep running, if you like.

454
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:46,363
MAMA!!

455
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:49,068
- Let me go!
- NO!!

456
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:22,249
Please stay with me.

457
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:25,748
I can not do this without you.

458
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:51,333
There is still time for you to stop them.

459
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:55,934
Drink my blood.

460
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:00,217
No... I cannot take your life.

461
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:03,910
My life is lost already.

462
01:07:06,529 --> 01:07:08,676
But our son's is not.

463
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,780
I love you.

464
01:07:18,739 --> 01:07:20,082
Do it now!

465
01:07:26,831 --> 01:07:27,707
Please.

466
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,364
Do it now.

467
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:56,446
Do you want vengeance?

468
01:09:06,885 --> 01:09:07,804
Drink.

469
01:09:49,045 --> 01:09:51,212
I now know that hell is real.

470
01:09:51,915 --> 01:09:54,141
So I know there is a heaven.

471
01:09:55,795 --> 01:09:58,284
Neither this world nor the next
shall keep us apart.

472
01:10:01,033 --> 01:10:05,098
I will honor your sacrifice and I vow
that our son will be safe.

473
01:10:12,218 --> 01:10:16,557
Of all my worlds, this is the world
I like the least.

474
01:10:20,774 --> 01:10:21,976
Look to the East.

475
01:10:23,328 --> 01:10:26,284
The sun should be risen by now,
should it not?

476
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:37,814
What IS that?

477
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:46,043
It is the Prince.
He's coming.

478
01:11:33,971 --> 01:11:36,587
I used to think there were
too many of you.

479
01:11:37,108 --> 01:11:38,858
Now this not enough.

480
01:12:37,026 --> 01:12:39,191
I understand you have a weakness.

481
01:12:40,295 --> 01:12:41,320
For silver.

482
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:52,674
Papa!

483
01:12:55,923 --> 01:12:57,187
He is waiting for you.

484
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,316
You're slower, brother, and weaker.

485
01:13:48,898 --> 01:13:51,312
Go on, take it.

486
01:13:52,576 --> 01:13:55,306
Is this the monster that terrified my men?

487
01:13:59,074 --> 01:14:01,153
You grow more weary by the moment.

488
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:07,864
Tell me, how long can you
bear it in here? Huh?

489
01:14:10,486 --> 01:14:13,190
Long enough to strike your name
from the history books.

490
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:49,313
PAPA!!

491
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,039
Take a last look at your father, Ingeras.

492
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:59,474
- NO!!
- Look how pathetic he is.

493
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:01,641
STOP! PLEASE!!

494
01:15:09,747 --> 01:15:12,961
If I put a stake... through your heart...

495
01:15:15,004 --> 01:15:16,170
it will KILL YOU!!

496
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,428
Like any other man.

497
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:26,978
- A fitting death for Lord... Impaler...
- No!

498
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,424
Papa!

499
01:15:51,682 --> 01:15:53,623
That is no longer my name.

500
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:56,177
My name is Dracula.

501
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:00,280
Son of the Devil.

502
01:16:39,738 --> 01:16:42,425
It's all right..
I'm here.

503
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:15,988
- You old goat.
- I don't feel old.

504
01:17:18,545 --> 01:17:22,884
- How many are left?
- None... except for your son. Of course.

505
01:17:23,593 --> 01:17:27,348
A distraction we can now... dispense.

506
01:17:33,402 --> 01:17:34,815
What have I told you?

507
01:17:35,876 --> 01:17:39,599
Repeated, over and over,
since you were a boy?

508
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:44,419
All that matters is a Prince's duty
to his people.

509
01:17:46,053 --> 01:17:47,542
Don't you realize?

510
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:51,699
They are all our enemies now.

511
01:17:52,097 --> 01:17:55,216
When he is gone, you'll be free.

512
01:18:03,173 --> 01:18:06,540
You forget - who I am?

513
01:18:44,568 --> 01:18:45,752
Leave him.

514
01:18:52,489 --> 01:18:54,018
Come with me, child.

515
01:18:58,509 --> 01:18:59,336
Please.

516
01:19:00,109 --> 01:19:01,917
GET BACK!!

517
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:08,045
A time to stop. Please. Please, [...]

518
01:19:10,115 --> 01:19:11,953
I do not want to leave you.

519
01:19:12,909 --> 01:19:15,224
- You have to go with him.
- No!

520
01:19:15,882 --> 01:19:17,508
Do not leave his side.

521
01:19:20,952 --> 01:19:23,435
I will always love you.

522
01:19:23,815 --> 01:19:24,681
Always.

523
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:33,136
- No!
- Go.

524
01:19:34,295 --> 01:19:36,822
- NOO!!
- You take care of him.

525
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:42,469
NOO!! PAPA!!

526
01:19:57,178 --> 01:19:59,060
He is safe now, Marina.

527
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:25,575
The Turks never conquered
The capitals of Europe.

528
01:21:32,165 --> 01:21:34,776
Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero.

529
01:21:37,952 --> 01:21:42,780
But... there are no pictures...
or statues of him.

530
01:21:48,339 --> 01:21:50,559
I... am his legacy.

531
01:21:52,334 --> 01:21:56,576
His sacrifice taught me,
that even after the darkest night...

532
01:21:57,038 --> 01:21:58,428
the sun will rise again.

533
01:21:59,896 --> 01:22:01,620
Drink, master.

534
01:22:03,694 --> 01:22:08,846
For if the heart is strong enough...
the soul is reborn.

535
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,950
With each new day.

536
01:22:16,058 --> 01:22:18,380
In life after life.

537
01:22:20,907 --> 01:22:23,254
Age after age.

538
01:22:27,358 --> 01:22:29,064
For ever.

539
01:22:54,605 --> 01:22:55,539
It's beautiful.

540
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:00,976
The flowers, my lady.

541
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:03,183
My lady?

542
01:23:05,097 --> 01:23:08,900
- Where are you from?
- A long way from here.

543
01:23:15,298 --> 01:23:16,570
Good night.

544
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:20,371
Why think separately
of this life and the next?

545
01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:23,489
When one is born from the last.

546
01:23:29,932 --> 01:23:31,854
It's my favorite poem.

547
01:23:32,365 --> 01:23:36,545
Speaks still of yearning. Of one soul
pleading for another.

548
01:23:41,888 --> 01:23:42,550
I'm Mina.

549
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:46,067
Vlad.

550
01:24:21,677 --> 01:24:24,673
Let the games begin.

551
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,782
