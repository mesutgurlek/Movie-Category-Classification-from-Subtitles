Ma'am, I already said
it was not indigenous.

00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:32,024
It was a derelict spacecraft.
It was an alien ship.

137
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,651
It was not from there.

00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:36,686
Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

that those things exist.

That will be all.

will be filed against you
at this time...

and you are released

check out LV-426?

VAN LEUWEN:
Because I don't have to.

about any hostile organism.

00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:58,458
I love the Corps!

326
00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:00,467
HUDSON:
Man, this floor is freezing!

327
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:02,560
APONE:
Want me to fetch your slippers?

328
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:04,669
Gee, would you, sir?
I'd like that.

329
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:06,394
Look into my eye.

330
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:07,961
Fall in, people!

331
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,405
Come on, let's go.

332
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,409
FROST: I hate this job.

333
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:14,934
APONE: Crowe, Wierzbowski,
on your feet.

334
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:20,475
FROST: I'm talking about
breathing, not this frozen shit.

335
00:29:20,518 --> 00:29:22,315
DIETRICH:
Yeah, Top, how about it?

336
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:29,181
APONE: First assembly's
in fifteen, people. Shag it.

337
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:34,127
VASQUEZ: Hey, mira.
Who's Snow White?

338
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:37,464
FERRO: She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

339
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:39,868
Apparently,
she saw an alien once.

340
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,963
HUDSON: Whoopee-fucking-do!

341
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:43,132
Hey, I'm impressed.

342
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:44,903
VASQUEZ: Qué bonita.

343
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,602
HUDSON: Hey, Vasquez.

344
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:51,706
Have you ever been
mistaken for a man?

345
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,842
No. Have you?

346
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:55,750
DRAKE: Ha ha! Oh, Vasquez.

347
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,749
You're just too bad.

348
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,935
HUDSON: Hey, Top, what's the op?

349
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,267
APONE: A rescue mission.
You'll love it.

350
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:15,966
There's some juicy
colonists' daughters...

351
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:18,134
we have to rescue
from their virginity.

352
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,474
SPUNKMEYER: Dumbass colonists.

353
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:26,916
SPUNKMEYER:
What's this crap supposed to be?

354
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,919
FROST: Cornbread, I think.

355
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,921
HICKS:
lt's good for you, boy. Eat it.

356
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:34,482
FROST: I wouldn't mind getting
more of that Arcturian poontang.

357
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:36,220
Remember that time?

358
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,423
SPUNKMEYER: Yeah, but the one
you had was a male.

359
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,761
FROST: lt doesn't matter
when it's Arcturian.

360
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,427
HUDSON: Hey, Bishop,
do the thing with the knife.

361
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,765
BISHOP: Oh, please.

362
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,670
HUDSON: Come on. All right!

363
00:30:48,706 --> 00:30:50,674
APONE: I don't want to see that.

364
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,642
HUDSON: All right!

365
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:55,737
What are you doing, man?

366
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,873
Quit messing around, Drake.

367
00:30:57,915 --> 00:30:59,542
Bishop. Hey, man.

368
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,643
- Do it.
- Hey, not me, man!

369
00:31:01,686 --> 00:31:04,246
DRAKE: Yeah, you. Don't move.

370
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:05,585
Trust me.

371
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:19,167
Aah!

372
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:21,296
APONE: All right, knock it off.

373
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,533
Thank you.

374
00:31:23,608 --> 00:31:25,838
[Laughter]

375
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,867
DRAKE: Enjoy your meal.

376
00:31:27,912 --> 00:31:30,039
That wasn't funny, man.

377
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:35,852
BISHOP:
Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?

378
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:37,410
BURKE: Yeah, thanks.

379
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:41,619
Looks like the new lieutenant's
too good to eat with us grunts.

380
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,222
FROST: Boy's definitely
got a corncob up his ass.

381
00:31:48,265 --> 00:31:50,597
BURKE: I thought you
never missed, Bishop.

382
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:57,106
You never said anything about
an android being on board.

383
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:00,736
It never occurred to me.

384
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:04,441
It's common practice
to have a synthetic on board.

385
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:06,950
I prefer the term
"artificial person."

386
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:08,918
Right.

387
00:32:08,953 --> 00:32:10,477
Is there a problem?

388
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:13,547
BURKE: I'm sorry. I don't know
why I didn't even...

389
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:15,218
Ripley's last trip, the syn...

390
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:17,227
the artificial person
malfunctioned.

391
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:18,455
Malfunctioned?

392
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:22,159
There were problems,
and a few deaths were involved.

393
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,461
I'm shocked.

394
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,401
Was it an older model?

395
00:32:25,436 --> 00:32:27,461
Yeah.
The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.

396
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:30,838
That explains it. The A-2s
always were a bit twitchy.

397
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,605
That could never happen now
with our behavioral inhibitors.

398
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:35,441
It is impossible for me
to harm...

399
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:38,312
or allow to be harmed
a human being.

400
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:40,476
Sure you don't want some?

401
00:32:40,518 --> 00:32:42,611
[Crash]

402
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:45,247
Just stay away from me.
You got that straight?

403
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:50,323
FROST: Guess she don't like
the cornbread, either.

404
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:07,341
APONE: Squad, ten-hut!
Officer on deck!

405
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:08,868
GORMAN: As you were.

406
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:10,107
APONE: Quickly, quickly.

407
00:33:10,147 --> 00:33:11,705
Settle down.

408
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:13,011
All right, listen up!

409
00:33:14,318 --> 00:33:15,751
GORMAN: Good morning, Marines.

410
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:19,745
I'm sorry we didn't have time
to brief you before we left...

411
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,155
HUDSON: Sir!

412
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:22,625
What is it, Hicks?

413
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,127
HUDSON: Hudson, sir.

414
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:25,788
He's Hicks.

415
00:33:27,164 --> 00:33:28,791
What's the question?

416
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:32,667
Is this gonna be a stand-up
fight or another bug-hunt?

417
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:36,833
All we know is there's still
no contact with the colony...

418
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:39,274
and a xenomorph may be involved.

419
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,301
APONE: Excuse me, sir. A what?

420
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:42,539
GORMAN: A xenomorph.

421
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,480
HICKS: lt's a bug-hunt.

422
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:46,676
What exactly
are we dealing with?

423
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:48,082
GORMAN: Ripley.

424
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:51,316
RIPLEY:
l'll tell you what I know.

425
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:54,714
We set down on LV-426.

426
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:57,091
A crew member
was brought back on board...

427
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:58,823
with something attached
to his face...

428
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:00,922
some kind of parasite.

429
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,832
We tried to get it off.
It wouldn't come off.

430
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:06,803
Later, it seemed to come off
by itself and die.

431
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,203
Kane seemed fine.

432
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,504
We were all having dinner.

433
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,375
It must have laid
something inside his throat...

434
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:15,901
some sort of embryo.

435
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:18,779
He started... Um, he...

436
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:23,048
VASQUEZ: Look, man,
I only need to know one thing...

437
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:24,918
where they are.

438
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:26,422
DRAKE: Vasquez, kick ass.

439
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:27,924
VASQUEZ: Anytime, anywhere.

440
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,926
HUDSON:
Right. Somebody said "alien..."

441
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,929
she thought they said
"illegal alien" and signed up.

442
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:34,954
- Fuck you, man.
- Anytime, anywhere.

443
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:36,626
RIPLEY: Are you finished?

444
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:45,533
I hope you're right.
I really do.

445
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:50,303
GORMAN: Yeah, OK. Right.
Thank you, Ripley.

446
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:53,839
We have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

447
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,249
RIPLEY: Because just one
of those things...

448
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:58,881
wiped out my crew
in less than twenty-four hours.

449
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:00,686
If the colonists
have found that ship...

450
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,090
there's no telling how many
have been exposed.

451
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:04,492
Do you understand?

452
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:10,964
GORMAN: Anyway, we have it
on disk, so look at it.

453
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,593
Any questions?

454
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:16,172
What is it, Private?

455
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:19,267
How do I get out
of this chickenshit outfit?

456
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,039
You secure that shit, Hudson.

457
00:35:23,314 --> 00:35:24,508
All right.

458
00:35:25,883 --> 00:35:27,817
Now listen up.

459
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,617
I want this thing to go smooth
and by the numbers.

460
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:39,455
I want DCS and tactical database
assimilation by 0830.

461
00:35:39,496 --> 00:35:41,293
Ordnance loading,
weapons strip...

462
00:35:41,332 --> 00:35:44,062
and drop-ship prep details
will have seven hours.

463
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,228
Now move it, people!

464
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:50,240
You heard the man,
and you know the drill.

465
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,571
Assholes and elbows!

466
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:54,333
Hudson, come here.
Come here!

467
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,642
APONE: I don't care if you are
short, Hudson. Get it done.

468
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:14,311
HUDSON: You'll get lip cancer
smoking those.

469
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:17,811
APONE: I want this loading lock
sealed. Now!

470
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:19,983
- How many more, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

471
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:21,356
Good. Take it away.

472
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:40,868
SPUNKMEYER: Clear behind.

473
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,017
APONE:
Did you check number three?

474
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:54,389
Hi. I feel like a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?

475
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:56,860
I don't know.
Is there anything you can do?

476
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,556
Well, I can drive that loader.

477
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,660
I have a Class Two rating.

478
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:07,934
Be my guest.

479
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:55,180
Where you want it?

480
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,957
Bay twelve, please.

481
00:38:57,316 --> 00:39:01,013
APONE: We're a team, and there's
nothing to worry about.

482
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:03,453
We come here,
and we gonna conquer...

Is that understood?

That's what we gonna do.

some hull ionization.

All right, gear up.

of the complex.

Set down on the landing grid.

this time.

Looks like hits
from small-arms fire.

00:52:14,688 --> 00:52:15,814
HUDSON: Affirmative.

646
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:18,017
Hicks,
meet me at the south lock.

647
00:52:18,058 --> 00:52:19,389
We're coming in.

648
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:21,189
HUDSON: He's coming in.

649
00:52:21,228 --> 00:52:23,196
I feel safer already.

650
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,907
VASQUEZ: Pendejo jerkoff.

651
00:52:44,892 --> 00:52:48,885
HUDSON: Sir, we got
the CPU on-line. No problem.

652
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,262
GORMAN:
Good. Stand by in Operations.

653
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:54,735
OK, let's go.

654
00:53:15,456 --> 00:53:16,753
Are you all right?

655
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:19,626
Yes.

656
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,002
DRAKE: Sir...

657
00:53:37,745 --> 00:53:40,976
they sealed off this wing at
both ends, welded the doors...

658
00:53:41,015 --> 00:53:44,382
and blocked off the stairs
with heavy equipment.

659
00:53:44,418 --> 00:53:47,353
But it looks like
the barricade didn't hold.

660
00:53:47,388 --> 00:53:49,913
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

661
00:53:49,957 --> 00:53:51,891
FROST: Last stand.

662
00:53:51,926 --> 00:53:53,450
DRAKE: Must have been
a hell of a fight.

663
00:53:54,428 --> 00:53:56,419
HICKS: Looks that way.

664
00:53:58,432 --> 00:54:01,094
GORMAN:
All right, Drake, this way.

665
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:04,263
We should be able to cut through
the med lab to Operations.

666
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,989
HICKS: Lieutenant.

667
00:54:59,393 --> 00:55:00,917
Gorman.

668
00:55:18,346 --> 00:55:20,405
Are those the same ones?

669
00:55:33,628 --> 00:55:34,686
Careful, Burke.

670
00:55:45,273 --> 00:55:47,969
HICKS: Looks like
love at first sight to me.

671
00:55:49,277 --> 00:55:51,336
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

672
00:55:51,379 --> 00:55:54,314
BISHOP: Two are alive.
The rest are dead.

678
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:13,127
I think we got something here.

00:56:18,072 --> 00:56:19,198
HICKS: Behind us.

Apone, where are your people?

682
00:56:23,244 --> 00:56:24,905
Anybody in D-Block?

APONE: Negative.
We're all in Operations.

DRAKE: Which way?

Come on. We won't hurt you.

Shh. It's all right. It's OK.

Concentrate.

01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:29,853
Where are your parents?

Look, Rebecca, you have to try...

Gorman, give it a rest,
why don't you?

01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,457
That good, huh?

740
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:17,433
Uh-oh.

741
01:01:17,468 --> 01:01:19,663
I made a clean spot here.

742
01:01:19,703 --> 01:01:21,102
Now I've done it.

743
01:01:21,138 --> 01:01:23,402
Guess l'll have to do
the whole thing.

Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

745

And a pretty one, too.

746
01:01:45,629 --> 01:01:47,256
You don't talk much, do you?

747
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,408

you're scanning for.

I don't know how you
stayed alive...

What's his name?

ls Timmy around here, too?

771
01:02:59,069 --> 01:03:01,264
Maybe hiding like you were?

01:03:05,009 --> 01:03:06,237
Any sisters?

773
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:11,843
Mom and Dad?

Newt, look at me.

775
01:03:17,788 --> 01:03:18,982
Where are they?

776
01:03:19,023 --> 01:03:22,049
They're dead, all right?
Can I go now?

777
01:03:25,095 --> 01:03:26,528
I'm sorry, Newt.

778
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:30,260
Don't you think you'd be safer
here with us?

779
01:03:34,004 --> 01:03:36,302
These people are here
to protect you.

780
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,274
They're soldiers.

781
01:03:38,308 --> 01:03:41,175
It won't make any difference.

782
01:03:54,591 --> 01:03:56,752
SPUNKMEYER:
Need anything else?

783
01:03:59,229 --> 01:04:02,198
Hello, Bishop.
Do you need anything else?

784
01:04:04,401 --> 01:04:05,561
No.

01:04:08,205 --> 01:04:10,366
Nice pet you got there.

01:04:10,407 --> 01:04:13,561
Magnificent, isn't it?

01:04:13,694 --> 01:04:17,061
Yo! Stop your grinnin'
and drop your linen!

a goddamn town meeting.

Let's saddle up, Apone.

796
01:04:35,683 --> 01:04:37,014
APONE: Aye, sir.

797
01:04:38,185 --> 01:04:43,145
Let's go. They ain't payin' us
by the hour. Head 'em out.

798
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:45,055
OK, Frost, you're driving.

799
01:04:56,871 --> 01:05:00,272
It's OK. Don't worry.
It'll be OK.

800

GORMAN: I want
a straight "V" deployment...

801
01:05:42,983 --> 01:05:45,144
second team on left flank.

802
01:05:45,186 --> 01:05:47,416
Advance on axial six-six-four.

803
01:05:47,454 --> 01:05:52,084
Tracker on-line. Set the V-gain
to filter R-F ambient.

804
01:05:52,126 --> 01:05:55,892
APONE: Hudson, tracker on-line.
Left and right, little buddy.

805

GORMAN: Forty meters in,
bearing two-two-one...

806
01:05:59,567 --> 01:06:01,933
there should be a stairwell.

807
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:03,266
APONE: Check. Got it.

808
01:06:05,206 --> 01:06:07,265
GORMAN:
You want sub-level three.

809
01:06:09,276 --> 01:06:10,538
APONE: Let's go, people.

810
01:06:10,578 --> 01:06:12,205
Hudson, you got the point.

811
01:06:12,246 --> 01:06:14,043
Hicks, watch our tails.

812
01:06:14,081 --> 01:06:16,049
Nice and easy.

813
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:17,414
Check those corners.

814
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:19,442
Check those corners.

815
01:06:23,057 --> 01:06:24,752
GORMAN: Watch your spacing.

816
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:27,693
APONE: You heard the man.
Don't bunch up. Stay loose.

817
01:06:27,728 --> 01:06:30,663
GORMAN: Your transmission's
showing a lot of break-up.

818
01:06:30,698 --> 01:06:33,394
HUDSON: Probably getting some
interference from the structure.

819
01:06:33,434 --> 01:06:34,924
APONE: Use those lights.

820
01:06:37,071 --> 01:06:41,701
GORMAN: Next one down,
and proceed on a two-one-six.

821
01:06:41,742 --> 01:06:43,767
APONE: Roger.
That's a two-one-six.

822
01:06:46,046 --> 01:06:47,604
GORMAN: I'm not
making that out too well.

823
01:06:47,648 --> 01:06:49,513
What is it, Hudson?

824
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:52,212
HUDSON:
You tell me. I only work here.

825
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:09,294
What is that?

826
01:07:09,336 --> 01:07:11,566
I don't know.

827
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:14,534
Proceed inside.

828
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:33,994
APONE: Watch your fire
and check your targets.

829
01:07:34,028 --> 01:07:36,519
Remember, we're looking
for civvies in here.

830
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:48,034
APONE: Easy.

831
01:07:48,075 --> 01:07:51,044
HICKS: Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.

832
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,409
APONE: Nice and easy.

833
01:07:57,051 --> 01:07:59,246
DIETRICH: Looks like
some sort of secreted resin.

834
01:07:59,286 --> 01:08:03,120
HICKS:
Yeah, but secreted from what?

835
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:05,887
APONE: Nobody touch nothing.

836
01:08:05,926 --> 01:08:08,952
BURKE:
Busy little creatures, huh?

837
01:08:08,996 --> 01:08:11,260
FROST: Hot as hell in here.

838
01:08:11,298 --> 01:08:13,027
HUDSON: But it's a dry heat.

839
01:08:13,067 --> 01:08:14,728
APONE: Knock it off, Hudson.

840
01:08:23,177 --> 01:08:26,169
Lieutenant,
what do those pulse-rifles fire?

841
01:08:26,213 --> 01:08:29,046
GORMAN: Ten millimeter
explosive-tip caseless.

842
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,176
Standard light
armor-piercing round. Why?

843
01:08:31,218 --> 01:08:33,379
RIPLEY: Look where your team is.

844
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,583
They're right under
the primary heat exchangers.

845
01:08:36,623 --> 01:08:37,783
So?

846
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:41,352
So if they fire their weapons
in there...

847
01:08:41,395 --> 01:08:42,623
won't they rupture
the cooling system?

848
01:08:42,663 --> 01:08:45,689
BURKE: Oh, ho ho. Yeah.
She's absolutely right.

849
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:46,995
So what?

850
01:08:47,034 --> 01:08:51,266
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor.

851
01:08:52,506 --> 01:08:53,734
Right?

852
01:08:53,774 --> 01:08:56,709
So she's talking about
a thermonuclear explosion...

853
01:08:56,744 --> 01:08:58,473
and, "Adiós, muchachos."

854
01:08:58,512 --> 01:09:01,174
Oh, great. Wonderful.

855
01:09:01,215 --> 01:09:03,740
Shit!

856
01:09:05,753 --> 01:09:07,220
Look.

857
01:09:07,254 --> 01:09:09,848
Uh... Apone.

858
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:14,752
We can't have any firing
in there.

859
01:09:14,795 --> 01:09:18,424
I want you to collect
magazines from everybody.

860
01:09:18,465 --> 01:09:19,955
HUDSON: ls he fuckin' crazy?

861
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,594
FROST:
What do we use, harsh language?

862
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,570
GORMAN: Flame units only.
I want rifles slung.

863
01:09:24,605 --> 01:09:25,765
APONE: Sir, I...

864
01:09:25,806 --> 01:09:28,536
GORMAN: Just do it, Sergeant.
And no grenades.

865
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:32,007
APONE: You heard the man.

866
01:09:32,046 --> 01:09:34,276
Pull 'em out. Let's have 'em.

867
01:09:35,315 --> 01:09:37,715
Come on, Vasquez.
Clear and lock.

868
01:09:41,221 --> 01:09:42,381
Damn!

869
01:09:43,257 --> 01:09:45,418
You, too. Give it up, Ski.

870
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:48,451
Crowe, I want it now.
Give it up.

871
01:09:48,495 --> 01:09:49,928
DRAKE: Right on, Vas.

872
01:09:51,765 --> 01:09:53,699
APONE: Let's go. Give it up.

873
01:09:53,734 --> 01:09:55,895
Frost, you got the duty.
Open that bag.

874
01:09:55,936 --> 01:09:57,494
FROST: Thanks a lot, Sarge.

875
01:09:57,538 --> 01:09:58,937
APONE: Hicks, cover our ass.

876
01:09:58,972 --> 01:10:00,803
Head 'em out, people.

877
01:10:02,743 --> 01:10:06,702
HICKS: I like to keep this handy
for close encounters.

878
01:10:06,747 --> 01:10:08,544
FROST: I heard that.

879
01:10:17,591 --> 01:10:19,354
GORMAN: Any movement?

880
01:10:19,393 --> 01:10:20,883
HUDSON: Nothing.

881
01:10:20,928 --> 01:10:22,122
Zip.

882
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:37,541
APONE: Holy shit.

883
01:10:50,224 --> 01:10:52,590
RIPLEY: Newt, go sit up front.

884
01:10:52,626 --> 01:10:53,957
Go on!

885
01:10:53,994 --> 01:10:55,222
Now!

886
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,518
APONE: Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

887
01:11:26,556 --> 01:11:29,923
We're still Marines,
and we got a job to do.

888
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,450
Keep it moving.

889
01:11:32,462 --> 01:11:33,827
Easy.

890
01:12:05,929 --> 01:12:07,453
- Top!
- What?

891
01:12:07,497 --> 01:12:09,192
DIETRICH: We got a live one!

892
01:12:09,232 --> 01:12:10,699
You're gonna be all right.

893
01:12:10,734 --> 01:12:13,567
Please... kill me.

894

DIETRICH:
Stay calm. We'll get you out.

895

It's gonna be all right.

896

We've got to get her
out of here.

No!

What's the position?

01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:16,459
I can't lock in!

909
01:13:16,499 --> 01:13:18,831
Talk to me, Hudson!

01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:21,337
Multiple signals.

911
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:22,998
They're closing.

912
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:27,674
APONE: Go to infrared, people.
Look sharp!

913
01:13:27,711 --> 01:13:30,976
GORMAN: What's happening, Apone?
We can't see anything in here.

I don't see shit.

01:26:43,693 --> 01:26:47,220
HICKS: Yeah. It's only
half-full, but it's functional.

1130
01:26:47,263 --> 01:26:48,855
And another one's damaged.

1131
01:26:48,898 --> 01:26:51,059
I don't know about that one.

1132
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,364
But the good news...

1133
01:26:53,403 --> 01:26:55,963
we got four of these
robot sentries...

1134
01:26:56,973 --> 01:27:00,067
with display
and scanners intact.

1135
01:27:00,109 --> 01:27:03,078
They really kick ass.
They'll come in handy.

1136
01:27:03,112 --> 01:27:06,775
How long after we're declared
overdue can we expect a rescue?

1137
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:12,014
Seventeen days.

1138
01:27:12,055 --> 01:27:14,387
Seventeen days?

1139
01:27:14,424 --> 01:27:17,393
Hey, man, I don't wanna
rain on your parade...

1140
01:27:17,427 --> 01:27:19,520
but we're not gonna last
seventeen hours.

1141
01:27:19,562 --> 01:27:23,259
Those things are gonna come here
like they did before, and...

1142
01:27:23,299 --> 01:27:25,494
Hudson! Hudson!

1143
01:27:26,469 --> 01:27:28,835
This little girl
survived longer than that...

1144
01:27:28,871 --> 01:27:31,237
with no weapons and no training.

1145
01:27:31,274 --> 01:27:32,673
Right?

1146
01:27:36,012 --> 01:27:38,139
Why don't you put her in charge?

1147
01:27:38,181 --> 01:27:39,944
You better just start
dealing with it, Hudson.

1148
01:27:39,983 --> 01:27:43,942
Deal with it,
because we need you...

1149
01:27:43,987 --> 01:27:46,012
and I'm sick of your bullshit.

1150
01:27:46,055 --> 01:27:50,617
Now get on a terminal
and call up a floor plan file.

1151
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,491
Construction blueprints.
I don't care.

1152
01:27:52,528 --> 01:27:54,155
Anything that shows the layout.

1153
01:27:54,197 --> 01:27:56,461
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

1154
01:27:56,499 --> 01:27:59,866
RIPLEY: I need to see air ducts,
electrical access tunnels...

1155
01:27:59,902 --> 01:28:01,494
sub-basements...

1156
01:28:01,537 --> 01:28:03,903
every possible way
into this complex.

1157
01:28:05,341 --> 01:28:07,241
We don't have much time.

1158
01:28:07,276 --> 01:28:08,641
OK.

1159
01:28:09,779 --> 01:28:11,076
OK, I'm on it.

1160
01:28:11,114 --> 01:28:12,274
RIPLEY: Hudson!

1161
01:28:12,315 --> 01:28:14,044
Just relax.

1162
01:28:20,523 --> 01:28:21,956
l'll be in med lab.

1163
01:28:22,525 --> 01:28:25,494
l'll check on Gorman,
continue my analysis.

1164
01:28:25,528 --> 01:28:26,927
Fine.

1165
01:28:26,963 --> 01:28:28,794
You do that.

1166
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:35,967
RIPLEY: This service tunnel...

1167
01:28:36,005 --> 01:28:38,530
must be how
they're moving back and forth.

1168
01:28:38,574 --> 01:28:39,700
HUDSON: That's right.

1169
01:28:39,742 --> 01:28:41,209
It moves from
the processing station...

1170
01:28:41,244 --> 01:28:43,712
right into the sub-level.

1171
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:46,780
Come down on that.

1172
01:28:46,816 --> 01:28:49,011
OK, come over.

1173
01:28:49,052 --> 01:28:50,519
Hold it. Go back.

1174
01:28:50,553 --> 01:28:52,043
Punch that in there.

1175
01:28:57,093 --> 01:28:58,754
HICKS: No. It's back here.

1176
01:28:58,795 --> 01:28:59,955
RIPLEY: OK.

1177
01:29:01,431 --> 01:29:04,161
There's a pressure door
at this end.

1178
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,863
Couldn't we put a remote
sentry unit in the tunnel...

1179
01:29:07,904 --> 01:29:09,201
then seal that door?

1180
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:10,432
HICKS: That'll work...

1181
01:29:10,473 --> 01:29:12,873
but we gotta figure on them
getting into the complex.

1182
01:29:12,909 --> 01:29:14,137
RIPLEY: That's right, so...

1183
01:29:14,177 --> 01:29:16,873
we repair the barricades
at these two intersections...

1184
01:29:16,913 --> 01:29:18,073
HICKS: Right.

1185
01:29:18,114 --> 01:29:21,880
...and weld plate steel over
these ducts here and here...

1186
01:29:21,918 --> 01:29:23,681
and here.

1187
01:29:23,719 --> 01:29:27,314
Then they can only come at us
from these two corridors.

1188
01:29:27,356 --> 01:29:31,417
HICKS: Right. Then we put
the other sentry units here...

1189
01:29:31,461 --> 01:29:33,156
and here, right?

1190
01:29:33,196 --> 01:29:34,823
- Right.
- Outstanding.

1191
01:29:34,864 --> 01:29:37,765
Now all we need
is a deck of cards.

1192
01:29:39,869 --> 01:29:42,201
Let's move
like we've got a purpose.

1193
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:43,705
HUDSON: Affirmative.

1194
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:45,229
NEWT: Affirmative.

1195
01:30:00,256 --> 01:30:02,087
HUDSON: Do your thing, baby.

1196
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:04,685
Come on, Vasquez,
let's get out of here.

1197
01:30:04,727 --> 01:30:07,093
"A" and "B" sentries
are in place and keyed.

1198
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:10,327
HICKS: Roger.
Stand by. Arming now.

1199
01:30:10,366 --> 01:30:11,890
Test it, Hudson.

1200
01:30:11,934 --> 01:30:14,334
- Do it.
- Fire in the hole!

1201
01:30:17,907 --> 01:30:20,603
HUDSON: Great.
Let's get the hell out of here.

1202
01:30:20,643 --> 01:30:22,440
We're sealing the tunnel.

1203
01:30:22,478 --> 01:30:23,877
Come on, baby.

1204
01:30:35,858 --> 01:30:37,519
HICKS: For what it's worth.

1205
01:30:39,862 --> 01:30:42,228
I want you to put this on.

1206
01:30:43,366 --> 01:30:44,594
RIPLEY: What's it for?

1207
01:30:44,634 --> 01:30:45,828
It's a locator.

1208
01:30:45,868 --> 01:30:49,463
Then I can find you anywhere
in the complex on this.

1209
01:30:50,873 --> 01:30:52,864
It's just a precaution.

1210
01:30:53,876 --> 01:30:55,343
Thanks.

1211
01:30:55,378 --> 01:30:58,347
Doesn't mean we're engaged
or anything.

1212
01:30:58,381 --> 01:31:00,313
All right, what's next?

1213
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,099
RIPLEY: Last stop.

1214
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,082
Get in.

1215
01:31:37,116 --> 01:31:39,107
Scoot down.

1216
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,087
That's good.

1217
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:44,681
Now lie here and have a nap.

1218
01:31:44,724 --> 01:31:46,191
You're very tired.

1219
01:31:46,225 --> 01:31:49,592
I don't want to.
I have scary dreams.

1220
01:31:51,831 --> 01:31:55,198
Well, I bet Casey
doesn't have scary dreams.

1221
01:31:55,234 --> 01:31:57,202
Let's take a look.

1222
01:31:57,236 --> 01:31:59,568
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

1223
01:31:59,605 --> 01:32:00,867
See?

1224
01:32:00,907 --> 01:32:03,307
Maybe you could just
try to be like her.

1225
01:32:03,342 --> 01:32:06,709
Ripley, she doesn't
have bad dreams...

1226
01:32:06,746 --> 01:32:09,681
because she's just
a piece of plastic.

1227
01:32:09,715 --> 01:32:11,410
Right.

1228
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:13,441
I'm sorry, Newt.

1229
01:32:19,926 --> 01:32:21,587
RIPLEY: There.

1230
01:32:21,627 --> 01:32:25,154
My mommy always said
there were no monsters...

1231
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:28,565
no real ones, but there are.

1232
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:31,832
Yes, there are, aren't there?

1233
01:32:33,706 --> 01:32:36,300
Why do they tell
little kids that?

1234
01:32:38,377 --> 01:32:40,072
Most of the time it's true.

1235
01:32:40,112 --> 01:32:43,604
Did one of those things
grow inside her?

1236
01:32:44,617 --> 01:32:46,346
I don't know, Newt.

1237
01:32:46,385 --> 01:32:48,546
That's the truth.

1238
01:32:48,588 --> 01:32:51,022
Isn't that how babies come...

1239
01:32:51,057 --> 01:32:53,252
I mean, people babies?

1240
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:54,850
They grow inside you.

1241
01:32:54,894 --> 01:32:56,862
No. That's very different.

1242
01:32:56,896 --> 01:32:58,864
NEWT: Did you ever have a baby?

1243
01:32:58,898 --> 01:33:00,365
Yes, I did.

1244
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:02,333
I had a little girl.

1245
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:04,336
Where is she?

1246
01:33:05,404 --> 01:33:06,928
She's gone.

1247
01:33:08,574 --> 01:33:10,667
You mean dead.

1248
01:33:12,144 --> 01:33:13,634
Here.

1249
01:33:15,147 --> 01:33:16,637
Take this.

1250
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:19,645
For luck.

1251
01:33:22,922 --> 01:33:24,412
How's that?

1252
01:33:27,593 --> 01:33:29,083
Don't go, please.

1253
01:33:29,128 --> 01:33:31,494
Newt, I'm gonna be
right in the next room.

1254
01:33:33,099 --> 01:33:34,862
And you see that camera?

1255
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,733
I can see you
through that camera...

1256
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,034
to see if you're safe.

1257
01:33:44,477 --> 01:33:47,173
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

1258
01:33:47,213 --> 01:33:49,511
I mean that.

1259
01:33:49,548 --> 01:33:51,209
That's a promise.

1260
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,808
You promise?

1261
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:56,313
I cross my heart.

1262
01:33:56,355 --> 01:33:58,118
And hope to die?

1263
01:33:59,225 --> 01:34:00,692
And hope to die.

1264
01:34:14,974 --> 01:34:16,965
Now go to sleep...

1265
01:34:17,009 --> 01:34:20,069
and don't dream.

1266
01:34:23,983 --> 01:34:25,348
Sneak.

1267
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:36,828
BISHOP:
The molecular acid oxidizes...

1268
01:34:36,862 --> 01:34:39,057
after the creature's death,
completely neutralizing it.

1269
01:34:39,098 --> 01:34:42,829
Bishop, that's interesting,
but it gets us nowhere.

1270
01:34:42,868 --> 01:34:45,336
I'm trying to figure out
what we're dealing with.

1271
01:34:45,371 --> 01:34:46,838
Let's go through it again.

1272
01:34:46,872 --> 01:34:49,841
They grab the colonists,
they move them over there...

1273
01:34:49,875 --> 01:34:53,834
and they immobilize them
to be hosts for more of these.

1274
01:34:53,879 --> 01:34:57,508
Which means there would have
to be a lot of these parasites.

1275
01:34:57,550 --> 01:35:00,383
One for each colonist.
That's over a hundred, at least.

1276
01:35:00,419 --> 01:35:02,387
Yes. That follows.

1277
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:06,221
Each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

1278
01:35:09,228 --> 01:35:10,991
So who's laying these eggs?

1279
01:35:12,098 --> 01:35:13,463
I'm not sure.

1280
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:16,195
It must be something
we haven't seen yet.

1281
01:35:16,235 --> 01:35:18,533
Hey, maybe
it's like an ant hive.

1282
01:35:18,571 --> 01:35:21,870
- Bees have hives.
- You know what I mean.

1283
01:35:21,907 --> 01:35:24,876
There's, like, one female
that runs the whole show.

1284
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,810
BISHOP: Yes. The queen.

1285
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,336
HUDSON: Yeah. The mama.

1286
01:35:28,381 --> 01:35:30,815
And she's badass, man.
I mean big.

1287
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,410
- These things ain't ants.
- I know that.

1288
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:37,315
Bishop, I want

about it, Burke. From me.

and didn't even warn them.

Why didn't you warn them, Burke?

What if that ship
didn't even exist?

Did you think about that?
I didn't know.

01:44:15,313 --> 01:44:17,781
OK, what do I do?

1445
01:44:23,121 --> 01:44:25,589
HICKS: Pull it in tight here.

1446
01:44:25,623 --> 01:44:28,285
- Right.
- Lean into it.

1447
01:44:28,326 --> 01:44:30,123
HICKS:
All right, it will kick some.

1448
01:44:31,863 --> 01:44:35,094
When the counter
reads zero here, you...

1449
01:44:35,133 --> 01:44:36,725
- I press this up?
- That's right.

1450
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:42,198
Get another one in quick.
Slap it in hard.

1451
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,004
Now you're ready
to rock 'n' roll.

1452
01:44:45,543 --> 01:44:48,478
- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.

1453
01:44:48,513 --> 01:44:51,175
I don't think you want
to mess with that.

1454
01:44:51,216 --> 01:44:55,016
You started this.
Show me everything.

1455
01:44:55,053 --> 01:44:57,044
I can handle myself.

1456
01:44:58,723 --> 01:45:00,789
Yeah, I noticed.

1457
01:45:10,565 --> 01:45:12,533
RIPLEY: How do you feel?

1458
01:45:12,567 --> 01:45:17,027
GORMAN: All right, I guess.
One hell of a hangover.

1459
01:45:17,072 --> 01:45:19,370
Look, Ripley, I just want...

1460
01:45:19,407 --> 01:45:22,399
RIPLEY: Forget it. Excuse me.

1461
01:46:14,062 --> 01:46:16,860
[Newt moaning]

1462
01:46:16,898 --> 01:46:19,025
RIPLEY: Shh, shh, shh.

1463
01:46:19,067 --> 01:46:22,400
It's OK. It's OK.

1464
01:47:32,272 --> 01:47:35,241
[Whispering]
Newt. Wake up.

1465
01:47:35,275 --> 01:47:37,743
- What?
- Be quiet.

1466
01:47:37,778 --> 01:47:39,769
We're in trouble.

1467
01:47:57,664 --> 01:48:00,258
- No!
- Aah!

1468
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,631
Move, Newt!

1469
01:48:23,523 --> 01:48:24,683
RIPLEY: Hey!

1470
01:48:24,725 --> 01:48:26,454
[No sound]

1471
01:48:33,633 --> 01:48:35,828
NEWT: Help!

1472
01:48:35,869 --> 01:48:38,337
Help!

1473
01:48:38,371 --> 01:48:40,066
RIPLEY: Hicks!

1474
01:48:40,107 --> 01:48:41,665
HICKS: Say again, Bishop?

1475
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:44,006
You've got it
into auto-refuel mode...

1476
01:48:44,044 --> 01:48:45,341
and it's sequencing right?

1477
01:48:45,378 --> 01:48:46,504
BISHOP: That's right.

1478
01:48:46,546 --> 01:48:48,605
HICKS: Good. Stay on it.

1479
01:48:48,648 --> 01:48:53,608
Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.

1480
01:48:53,653 --> 01:48:55,621
He's at the uplink tower.

1481
01:48:55,655 --> 01:48:57,145
BURKE: Terrific.

1482
01:48:59,993 --> 01:49:03,952
- Hicks! Hicks!
- Help! Help!

1483
01:49:03,997 --> 01:49:05,624
Hicks! Help us!

1484
01:49:05,665 --> 01:49:07,326
Break the glass!

1485
01:49:07,367 --> 01:49:09,392
Break it, break it.

1486
01:49:09,436 --> 01:49:11,427
RIPLEY: l'll try.

1487
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:34,651
Ripley, I'm scared.

1488
01:49:34,694 --> 01:49:36,685
Me, too.

1489
01:49:42,269 --> 01:49:43,759
Stay here.

1490
01:49:52,946 --> 01:49:55,881
[Alarm sounds]

1491
01:49:55,916 --> 01:49:59,044
HICKS: lt's the med lab.
Hudson!

1492
01:49:59,085 --> 01:50:02,543
Vasquez! Meet me in med lab.
We got a fire.

1493
01:50:02,589 --> 01:50:04,250
HUDSON: We're on our way.

1494
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,557
They're coming, Newt.
Oh, please.

1495
01:50:15,769 --> 01:50:16,895
Aah!

1496
01:50:16,937 --> 01:50:18,370
Uh!

1497
01:50:24,511 --> 01:50:25,739
Aah!

1498
01:50:32,953 --> 01:50:35,444
Aah!

1499
01:50:35,488 --> 01:50:36,750
Aah!

1500
01:50:41,928 --> 01:50:43,555
Shoot it out!

1501
01:50:48,034 --> 01:50:49,934
- Hudson!
- Jesus!

1502
01:50:51,872 --> 01:50:53,464
Oh!

1503
01:50:53,506 --> 01:50:55,167
Christ, kid, look out!

1504
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:04,783
Fucking die!

1505
01:51:15,862 --> 01:51:17,830
- Over there!
- Yeah!

1506
01:51:17,864 --> 01:51:19,855
- Ready?
- Yeah!

1507
01:51:24,371 --> 01:51:25,429
HICKS: Hudson!

1508
01:51:25,472 --> 01:51:28,032
HUDSON: Yeah, all clear.
Nailed the other one.

1509
01:51:28,074 --> 01:51:29,666
It's history, man.

1510
01:51:30,877 --> 01:51:31,969
HICKS: Jesus.

1511
01:51:33,546 --> 01:51:37,107
RIPLEY: Burke. It was Burke.

1512
01:51:38,685 --> 01:51:43,019
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.

1513
01:51:43,056 --> 01:51:45,752
HICKS: lt just doesn't make
any goddamn sense.

1514
01:51:47,861 --> 01:51:50,853
RIPLEY: He figured
that he could get an alien...

1515
01:51:50,897 --> 01:51:55,994
back through quarantine
if one of us was impregnated...

1516
01:51:56,036 --> 01:51:59,301
whatever you call it...

1517
01:51:59,339 --> 01:52:02,172
and then frozen
for the trip home.

1518
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:06,872
Nobody would know about
the embryos we were carrying...

1519
01:52:06,913 --> 01:52:08,380
me and Newt.

1520
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,241
Wait, now. We'd all know.

1521
01:52:12,285 --> 01:52:16,153
Yes. He could only do it by
sabotaging certain freezers...

1522
01:52:16,189 --> 01:52:19,386
on the way home, namely yours.

1523
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:24,956
He could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

1524
01:52:24,998 --> 01:52:27,626
HUDSON: Fuck! He's dead.

1525
01:52:27,667 --> 01:52:29,897
You're dog meat, pal.

1526
01:52:31,271 --> 01:52:35,970
This is so nuts.
Listen to what you're saying.

1527
01:52:36,009 --> 01:52:39,877
It's paranoid delusion.
It's really sad.

1528
01:52:41,581 --> 01:52:43,310
It's pathetic.

1529
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:46,513
Burke, I don't know
which species is worse.

1530
01:52:46,553 --> 01:52:50,580
They don't fuck each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

1531
01:52:50,623 --> 01:52:53,649
HICKS: All right, we waste him.
No offense.

1532
01:52:53,693 --> 01:52:55,820
RIPLEY:
No, he's got to go back...

1533
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:58,697
They cut the power.

1534
01:52:58,732 --> 01:53:01,997
HUDSON: What do you mean "they"
cut the power? They're animals.

1535
01:53:02,035 --> 01:53:04,526
I want you two with trackers
checking the corridors! Move!

1536
01:53:04,571 --> 01:53:06,698
- Gorman, watch Burke.
- I got him.

1537
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:08,970
Newt, stay close.

1538
01:53:11,911 --> 01:53:14,744
- L'll go this side.
- You do that, man.

1539
01:53:39,339 --> 01:53:40,499
Anything?

1540
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:42,201
HUDSON: There's something.

1541
01:53:42,242 --> 01:53:45,473
- [Beeping]
- It's inside the complex.

1542
01:53:45,512 --> 01:53:47,377
You're just reading me.

1543
01:53:47,414 --> 01:53:50,440
- [Beeping]
- No, it ain't you.

1544
01:53:52,252 --> 01:53:55,551
They're inside the perimeter.
They're in here.

1545
01:53:55,588 --> 01:53:58,751
RIPLEY: Hudson, stay cool.
Vasquez?

1546
01:54:03,663 --> 01:54:06,154
[Beeps louder]

1547
01:54:06,199 --> 01:54:08,190
Hudson may be right.

1548
01:54:08,234 --> 01:54:10,065
RIPLEY: Get back.

1549
01:54:10,103 --> 01:54:11,400
HUDSON: The signal's weird.

1550
01:54:11,438 --> 01:54:15,431
Must be some interference
or something.

1551
01:54:15,475 --> 01:54:17,443
There's movement
all over the place.

1552
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:20,911
Get back to Operations.
It's game time.

1553
01:54:21,044 --> 01:54:22,136
Newt.

1554
01:54:24,147 --> 01:54:27,605
RIPLEY: Seal the door. Hurry!

1555
01:54:27,651 --> 01:54:31,087
HICKS: Come on.
Come on, get back.

1556
01:54:31,121 --> 01:54:32,611
Work fast.

1557
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:39,823
Cover your eyes, Newt.
Don't look at the light.

1558
01:54:39,863 --> 01:54:43,765
Movement. Signal's clean.
Range, twenty meters.

1559
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,201
RIPLEY: They found a way in,
something we missed.

1560
01:54:47,237 --> 01:54:49,137
HICKS: We didn't miss anything.

1561
01:54:49,172 --> 01:54:52,573
HUDSON: Eighteen.
Seventeen meters.

1562
01:54:52,609 --> 01:54:55,510
RIPLEY: Something under
the floor, not in the plans.

1563
01:54:55,545 --> 01:54:57,672
- Fifteen meters.
- Ripley!

1564
01:54:57,714 --> 01:54:59,739
Definitely
inside the barricades.

1565
01:54:59,783 --> 01:55:01,216
Let's go.

1566
01:55:02,886 --> 01:55:05,354
RIPLEY: That's right outside
the door. Get back!

1567
01:55:05,388 --> 01:55:07,549
HUDSON:
This is a big fucking signal.

1568
01:55:07,591 --> 01:55:10,822
- How you doing, Vasquez?
- Almost there.

1569
01:55:12,429 --> 01:55:13,896
That's it.

1570
01:55:14,898 --> 01:55:16,092
HUDSON: Twelve meters.

1571
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:20,228
Eleven. Ten.

1572
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:23,205
- They're right on us.
- Nine meters.

1573
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,140
Remember...
short, controlled bursts.

1574
01:55:25,175 --> 01:55:26,540
Eight meters.

1575
01:55:29,012 --> 01:55:30,172
Seven.

1576
01:55:32,249 --> 01:55:33,443
Six.

1577
01:55:33,483 --> 01:55:36,782
- That's inside the room.
- It's reading right!

1578
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:38,378
You're not reading it right.

1579
01:55:40,924 --> 01:55:45,657
HUDSON: Five meters, man.
Four. What the hell?

1580
01:55:48,165 --> 01:55:50,099
HUDSON: Oh, my God.

1581
01:55:50,133 --> 01:55:51,794
HICKS: Give me the light.

1582
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:07,845
Aah!

1583
01:56:09,586 --> 01:56:11,781
There they go! Get them!

1584
01:56:14,391 --> 01:56:16,518
- Come on!
- Get them!

1585
01:56:17,627 --> 01:56:19,151
BURKE: Do something, Gorman!

1586
01:56:21,064 --> 01:56:23,191
HUDSON: Look out! Look out!
Look out!

1587
01:56:23,233 --> 01:56:24,825
There's more of them!

1588
01:56:24,868 --> 01:56:26,597
Medical! Get to medical!

1589
01:56:26,636 --> 01:56:29,469
Do it! Now!

1590
01:56:29,506 --> 01:56:30,939
HICKS: Hudson, look out!

1591
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:36,145
Aah!

1592
01:56:36,179 --> 01:56:37,578
Now!

1593
01:56:39,649 --> 01:56:41,446
Burke!

1594
01:56:43,186 --> 01:56:47,623
Open this door!
Burke! Open it!

1595
01:56:47,657 --> 01:56:49,625
Aah!

1596
01:56:49,659 --> 01:56:51,524
Come on! Let's go!
Fall back!

1597
01:56:54,064 --> 01:56:55,258
HICKS: Go!

1598
01:56:55,298 --> 01:56:58,290
HUDSON: Die, you bastards!
Die, motherfucker!

1599
01:56:58,335 --> 01:56:59,734
GORMAN: Burke!

1600
01:56:59,769 --> 01:57:01,999
HICKS: Hudson!

1601
01:57:02,038 --> 01:57:03,403
Hudson!

1602
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,907
HUDSON: Motherfucker!

1603
01:57:04,941 --> 01:57:08,308
Come on! Come on!
