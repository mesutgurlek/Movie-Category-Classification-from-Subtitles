1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,500
No questions about the layout, right?
No questions.

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,900
Let's go over this shit again.

3
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,900
They got a small dinger on the door.
I'll get 'em to open it.

4
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,000
Then me and Levine go in. Giolito
and Pederson, block this door.

5
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,900
OK? Rondell and Leppert,
hit the back door.

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,800
No problem. It's a piece of cake.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,700
McKee and Cline, you're outside
in case we get some jump-outs...

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
- Foley.
- Excuse me a sec.

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,600
Where in the hell is SWAT?

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,700
- Boss, I cancelled the SWAT team.
- You what?

11
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,500
I wouldn't raid
a church bingo game without SWAT.

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,200
These guys are carjackers.
They're mechanics.

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,400
We don't need SWAT
blowing holes in my evidence.

14
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,100
Besides, they might shoot somebody.
Let's do this.

15
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,500
This is your operation. I'm just
an observer, but I'll be watching.

16
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,000
Just observe how I don't have
to use SWAT, and trust me.

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,500
Everybody's ready?
Nobody need to take a nervous piss?

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,700
Let's mount up.

19
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,200
This is Dick Burton.
We've got 55 degrees this morning.

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,000
Here's Diana Ross and the Supremes,
Come See About Me.

21
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,500
What are you doing?

22
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,800
Bobby, they're here.

23
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,400
Any trouble with the hijack?

24
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,200
- Right where you said.
- Piece of cake.

25
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,700
- Anybody hurt?
- No.

26
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,700
Good. I don't like to see
people unnecessarily injured.

27
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,400
Nobody got hurt, boss.

28
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,000
- Keys?
- Ain't yours till we see money.

29
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,100
I just want to look in the back.

30
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,400
- Where's our money?
- Pay him.

31
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,800
You think we should have used SWAT?

32
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,700
- Fuck SWAT.
- That's what I say. Fuck SWAT.

33
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,100
- Some guy. What should I do?
- Kill him.

34
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,600
How you doing? Is this the illegal
chop shop where they chop up cars?

35
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,300
I got my wife's Buick. I want it
chopped, the bitch ain't been right.

36
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,200
Go, go, go!

37
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,500
Go!

38
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,000
They got fucking machineguns.

39
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,500
- You said they had no guns!
- They must have changed their view.

40
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,400
Get the 12-gauge.

41
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,200
We should've called SWAT.

42
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,000
Police! Hands in the air!

43
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
Move it! Go! Go!

44
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
What the...?

45
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,500
Daniel, come on!

46
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Cover me. I'm going in with Todd.

47
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Axel, you on a coffee break?

48
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,600
Go get that son of a bitch.

49
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,600
Boss. Hey, man! Shit!

50
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,100
We got a tail.

51
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,500
Wax that clown.

52
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,900
God damn it!

53
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,800
Help me, man.

54
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Police officer!
Trying to catch a killer. Move it!

55
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,800
- Get out of my way! I'm a cop!
- Take it easy.

56
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,900
Get the fuck out of here,
all right?

57
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,400
Thank you. My name's Steve Fulbright.
Could I see some ID, please?

58
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,300
I am a Detroit police officer.
My name is Axel... Where's my shit?

59
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm a police officer chasing
a killer who's getting away now.

60
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,500
- We know.
- You know what?

61
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,200
We know.

62
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,200
What's happened is you're in the
middle of a federal investigation.

63
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,100
What, income tax? The fucking guy
just shot a police officer!

64
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,600
It's very important
he not be apprehended at this time.

65
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,700
We want to know where he's going
and who he's selling it to.

66
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,800
- It's drugs?
- We're not DEA.

67
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,100
We appreciate
your co-operation on this.

68
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,800
I checked with Washington,
Fulbright's kosher.

69
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,700
He's working
on something classified.

70
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,700
If they want these guys loose
we should close the investigation.

71
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,600
Fuck them. I want the man
that killed Todd. What you got?

72
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,100
Not a hell of a lot.
The dead mechanics were executed.

73
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,700
Only one was strapped,
he was still holstered.

74
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,600
The bodies of the shooters
had 30,000 cash.

75
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,100
- High-price heat.
- San Diego drivers' licenses.

76
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,100
San Diego PD's sheet says enforcers
for hire for Tijuana drug dealers.

77
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,900
It's about drugs?

78
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,100
An attaché case had a towel from
the Wonder World Hotel, California.

79
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,800
Wonder World? Did you check out
that car they shot Todd from?

80
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,600
Rental from the airport.
The renter's a Dr Oliver Hirsch.

81
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,500
- A stolen ID?
- Yeah.

82
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,000
Doctor said it was lifted
while in an amusement park.

83
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,700
- I hope the park was Wonder World.
- Yeah.

84
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,600
- Excuse me.
- Wonder World.

85
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,700
I understand
that you were with him at the end.

86
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Yeah. His last words were about you.

87
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,100
That does not sound
like my Douglas, Axel. Try again.

88
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,700
Actually, his last words were,

89
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,000
"Axel, are you on a coffee break?
Go and get that son of a bitch."

90
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,100
Those were his last words.

91
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,700
- That sounds like my Douglas.
- It sounds like a good idea, too.

92
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,800
Hello, I'm looking
for Billy Rosewood.

93
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,600
Welcome to Beverly Hills Police.

96
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,000

97
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,900

the riot rumour hotline, press 17.

98
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,500
Which button for Billy Rosewood?

99
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,100
Monsieur Rosewood? In the house?

100
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,400
Le Rosewood. Moi le Rosewood.

101
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,100
"Monsieur était beau.
Le crayon. La table."

102
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,900
Come in.

103
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
It's open.

104
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,500
- Axel Foley!
- Billy, how you doing?

105
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,400
- I don't believe it.
- Look at your office! Look at this!

106
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,000
You got three windows,
venetian blinds, and a ficus.

107
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,500
One of them big, healthy
ficus in your office.

108
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Not just the ficus. Look.

109
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
You got a refrigerator
in your office?

110
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,300
J Edgar Hoover
didn't have a refrigerator.

111
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,800
Just some hair curlers or something.

112
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,200
- Did they promote you to captain?
- I'm DDO-JSIOC.

113
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,200
The JG-Joe-Joe-C? What is that?

114
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
Deputy Director of Operations

115
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,600
for Joint Systems Interdepartmental
Operational Command.

116
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,600
Here we are. Los Angeles. one of the
greatest cities in the world, Axel,

117
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,500
divided by its unique geography.

118
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,000
- Geography?
- LA is a vast metropolis

119
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,900
with social and economic imbalances
spread over an enormous distance.

120
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,300
A criminal hits Beverly Hills,
then West Hollywood, then downtown.

121
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,100
Whose responsibility is it?
Everybody's?

122
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,700
Impossible. So it comes here. Every
crime that crosses the green line.

123
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
- The green line?
- Green lines of jurisdiction.

124
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
Beverly Hills,
West Hollywood, Santa Monica.

125
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Officers respect these green lines,
but the criminal doesn't.

126
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,400
Whenever a criminal crosses green
lines, the DDO-JSIOC goes to work.

127
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,400
Very impressive, Billy.

128
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I control the green lines,
and Axel...

129
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,100
whoever controls the green lines
controls Southern California.

130
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,100
You wanted to see me, Billy?

131
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,100
The sheriff's department nabbed
two guys pulling a stall-and-hook.

132
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,200
It's the same MO
as those jobs on Melrose.

133
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,600
I'll run out there and talk to them.

134
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,100
They're in Van Nuys.
I'll tell them you're coming.

135
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,800
Jon, I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

136
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
Axel Foley. Axel, Jon Flint.

137
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,800
How are you? I've heard about you.
You're from Detroit, right?

138
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,300
- Taggart talked about you.
- Taggart! Where is he?

139
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,700
Taggart's retired to Phoenix.

140
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,800
Spends his days lost in the woods
looking for his golf balls.

141
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,500
That's a dream
I'm not too far from myself.

142
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,000
What brings you to California?
Vacation?

143
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,700
- I'm looking for a killer.
- In Beverly Hills?

144
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,300
- No. Wonder World.
- Wonder World?

145
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,400
You mean Rufus Rabbit
has gone berserko?

146
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,700
No. My boss got gunned down.

147
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,300
The killer escaped
in a cream-coloured Ford truck.

148
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
- I think it's here.
- Plates?

149
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,600
Plates were phoney. Some evidence
points to Wonder World.

150
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,100
I want to go to Wonder World
and ask some questions.

151
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,600
- Would y'all know somebody there?
- Ellis DeWald, head of security.

152
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,000
Biggest private
security force in America.

153
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,900
- Can you introduce me to him?
- Soon as I get back from Van Nuys.

154
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,800
You go on out. I'll call DeWald,
tell him you're coming.

155
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,800
- He's a pal of mine. I'll meet you.
- Great. Thanks.

156
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,900
You'll love Wonder World,
it's a great place.

157
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,800
Axel, don't forget,
we play by the rules around here.

158
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,600
I've heard Taggart's stories.

159
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,300
Which one of those green lines
is Wonder World behind?

160
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,600
Welcome to Wonder World. Can I help?

161
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,700
Yes, I'd like to talk to a park
executive, a Mr. Ellis DeWald.

162
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,400
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm supposed to. Axel Foley.

163
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,600
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have you on the list.

164
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Maybe they haven't called yet.

165
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,100
A Detective Flint was supposed
to call and get me squared away.

166
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,100
If you don't have an appointment
you'll need a ticket.

167
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,900
- How much is a ticket?
- $35.

168
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,600
That allows you access
to all rides and attractions.

169
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,600
Wait a minute.
I don't want to go on any rides.

170
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,300
All I wanna do
is talk to the director of security.

171
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,300
Excuse me, sir,
would you step out of line?

172
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,200
- What line?
- Just step over here, please, sir.

173
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Thank you.

174
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,800
- Is there a problem, sir?
- $35, that's the problem.

175
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,300
If the admission seems high,
try Fantasy Park.

176
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,700
You might find
their ticket price to your liking.

177
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,100
I'm here to see Ellis DeWald.
Is he your boss?

178
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,100
Yes. Mr. DeWald
is head of guest relations.

179
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,400
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm supposed to.

180
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,800
Supposed to is not having,
is it, sir?

181
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,700
Excuse me.

182
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,700
- One, please.
- There you go. Thank you.

183
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,300
Thank you.

184
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,800
You should have your tailor
cut the jacket a little wider.

185
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,100
That way your gun
won't bulge in the back.

186
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,400
Thank you.

187
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,900
Uncle Dave.

188
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,100
What's going on?

189
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,900
"Alien Attack"?

190
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,000
Can I help you?

191
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,700
I was just curious
what Alien Attack is.

192
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,100
Watch.

193
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,500
Attention! This is a red alert.
Aliens are invading the city.

194
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,300
Board the subway trains
for immediate evacuation.

195
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,800
This is wild.

196
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,800
Yes. It's one of
our more popular attractions.

197
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,300
Excuse me,
but what are you doing in here?

198
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,700
You're right. I gotta go. I have
a meeting, but thanks for the show.

199
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,700
Tunnel nine. Take a look.

200
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,900
- What should we do?
- I'll send Cooper. Get him.

201
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Excuse me.

202
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,600
- That's not fair.
- Maintenance. Gotta grease a chain.

203
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,500
- Hear how dry it sounds?
- Sorry.

204
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,400
Come on. Let's go.

205
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,300
- Hi, Mom!
- Up here!

206
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,400
- Hi, Mommy! Up here!
- We're here!

207
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,200
- Bring that man down.
- I can't until it goes all...

208
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
- Bring it down, damn it.
- Don't...

209
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,100
Don't. Don't! Jesus!

210
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,000
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!

211
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,900
Code red on The Spider.

212
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,200
Wonder World? Axel!

213
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,700
Help!

214
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,700
Help! Please!

215
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,500
Shit!

216
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,100
My God. Look!

217
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,900
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK, just don't let go.

218
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,300
All units near Wonder World,

219
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,300
proceed to assist
in emergency rescue.

220
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,200
You see this rope? We're gonna
slide down it to the ground.

221
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,500
- We are?
- We're gonna try.

222
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,500
Come up and hold on to my neck.

223
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,100
Come on. It's OK.

224
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,100
You gonna grab onto my neck really
tight. Come on. Hold on really tight.

225
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,600
Not too tight!

226
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,200
Give me your hand.

227
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Come on. None of that.
Give me your hand. Come on. It's OK.

228
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,000
Come on.

229
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,100
Hang on tight!

230
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,100
Come on. Come on up.

231
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,400
Our head of security confirmed your
identity with the Detroit police.

232
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,100
But neither they nor l...

233
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,500
..understand what
you're doing at Wonder World.

234
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,100
I'm investigating a crime.

235
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,600
I've been here 10 minutes
and I've already been shot at.

236
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,000
Yes. Some of our
guest relations people, you said.

237
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Miss Perkins is here
with the surveillance tapes.

238
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,500
Send her right in.

239
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,500
This starts in The Spider
maintenance tunnel.

240
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,600
There I am,
coming down the tunnel.

241
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,100
- What is that?
- Tracking. The monitors are looped.

242
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,700
- I don't see any gunmen, Mr. Foley.
- So who was I shooting at?

243
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You better think about a lawyer.
The tapes don't show your gunman.

244
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,400
They don't show something else,

245
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,700
Mr. Foley's courage when the ride
malfunctioned. He risked his life.

246
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,500
They don't show that.

247
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,000
That would be very impressive,
if you didn't cause the malfunction.

248
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,300
- Mr. DeWald.
- Send him in.

249
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,700
Mr. Foley, Mr. DeWald.

250
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,500
You fuck! Motherfucker...
That's him!

251
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,200
That's the fucking guy
I'm looking for!

252
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
What's going on here?

253
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,100
He shot a Detroit police officer
last weekend!

254
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,000
Last weekend? I was at my
beach house in Laguna last weekend.

255
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,200
Your beach home in Laguna?

256
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,700
Wait. I think I got the wrong guy.

257
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,800
I'm sorry.
This is a big misunderstanding.

258
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,900
You were at your beach...

259
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,000
Fuck! Beach house in Laguna!
You motherfucker!

260
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,200
- Miss Bruce, call the police.
- They just walked in.

261
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,900
- That guy! That's the killer!
- Ellis DeWald?

262
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,500
We really appreciate this, Ellis.

263
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,100
Your friend is lucky Mr. Sanderson
doesn't want any publicity.

264
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,500
You just keep him and his delusions
out of my face and out of my park.

265
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,600
No problem. You got it. By the way,
are we still on for Sunday?

266
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,900
Bring your money, sucker.

267
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,200
All right. When you have
some time, I'd like to...

268
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,600
Not right now. Later, perhaps.

269
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Thanks.

270
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Here we go.

271
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,700
Thank you.

272
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,500
And the usual for you, Billy.

273
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,000
- Thanks a lot.
- Isn't it possible you're mistaken?

274
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,600
That Ellis DeWald
just resembles Todd's killer?

275
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,500
I made the guy in Detroit.
It was DeWald.

276
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:41,200
He's the head of the largest private
police department in California.

277
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,000
He works with us, with the governor's
office. Everybody loves him.

278
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,900
He's getting an award from the
Association of Security Agencies.

279
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,600
It's understandable
that you're distraught

280
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,100
and looking for justice,
not to mention revenge.

281
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,200
But isn't it just possible
that you want it so much

282
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,000
that you saw your killer in a man
who bore a slight resemblance?

283
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,600
We run into this
all the time in police work.

284
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,700
- Where's he getting that award?
- Don't!

285
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,500
Flint, your friend DeWald is foul.
I know he's foul,

286
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,700
and I'm going to this awards show
to put some pressure on him.

287
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,800
Maybe panic him
into doing something stupid.

288
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,300
Axel, if you go
to that dinner tonight...

289
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,300
- I'm going with you.
- Pick me up at the Sunset Motel.

290
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,100
Freeze, motherfucker!

291
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,500
- Detective Foley?
- You're Uncle Dave!

292
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,600
Oh, my God. I almost shot Uncle Dave!

293
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,200
I'm so embarrassed. I'm sorry.
Nice to meet you! Uncle Dave!

294
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,400
The front desk let us in.
I hope that's OK.

295
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,800
No, it's fine. It's Uncle Dave!

296
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,100
Uncle Dave! Have a seat.

297
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,800
- Thank you.
- I was such a fan of yours.

298
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,300
- Thank you, son.
- Uncle Dave...

299
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:48,000
You're very kind. Detective Foley,
what's going on at my park?

300
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,500
- There's something going on?
- I have no doubts.

301
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,900
- What?
- I have no doubts,

302
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,300
nor do I have any ideas.

303
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,100
Exactly two weeks ago,
Detective Foley,

304
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,900
Roger Fry, the park's
chief operating officer...

305
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,800
and my friend, disappeared.

306
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,400
Roger Fry designed the park, from the
landscaping to the concession stands.

307
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,700
- What do you mean, disappeared?
- Show him the note.

308
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,400
I received this interoffice
the day Roger disappeared.

309
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,600
"This is important,
life and death. Roger"

310
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,100
- What was so important?
- I don't know.

311
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,800
What was he doing
the day he disappeared?

312
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,200
He was probably doing
one of his usual inspections.

313
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,700
- This guy designed the whole park?
- Yes.

314
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,000
- And he knew the place cold?
- Of course.

315
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,200
So what are you thinking?

316
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,000
He must've found something
someone didn't want him to find.

317
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,900
At Wonder World?
What on earth could that be?

318
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,100
It's a place
of childhood innocence and fun.

319
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,400
And life and death.

320
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,400
You met Uncle Dave? Uncle Dave.

321
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,900
I don't believe it. I'd give
anything to have been with you.

322
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,700
- Did he do the Oki-Doki Shuffle?
- No.

323
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
Outstanding.

324
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,300
- William Rosewood, DDO-JSIOC.
- I beg your pardon?

325
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,100
This is me. Thank you.

326
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,900
What you gonna do with this shit?

327
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,700
No way.
I don't believe this! Ackwell!

328
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,900
Ackwell Folee! Ackwell Folee, you
crazy thing. What you doing here?

329
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,500
- "Surge."
- Serge.

330
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,300
Look at your head!
I love it short!

331
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,200
- Yeah, Serge.
- Turn around. Turn around.

332
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,500
You look perfect! And finally
you have black "Hush Poopies",

333
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,400
which are totally retro.
You put a good package together.

334
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,800
- You remember Billy Rosewood.
- Billy, I remember you.

335
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,000
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

336
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,900
I made you an espresso at
the art gallery with a lemon twist?

337
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,800
It was the last one I ever made.

338
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,600
It's terrible, espresso.
You know why?

339
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,300
It stain your teeth. I won't
show you mine. Show me your teeth.

340
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,500
They're so pretty.
Can I see your teeth?

341
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,900
And you got healthy gums.

342
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
- Do you do colonics?
- Excuse me?

343
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,600
- Do you do colonics?
- No. Never...

344
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,400
- It's my new favourite!
- You dig colonics?

345
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,700
- They stick a hose up inside you...
- I know...

346
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,800
No, you've got to understand.

347
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,600
Out comes a candy bar
from when you were five!

348
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,500
- What happened to your art gallery?
- It is completely bankrupt,

349
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,000
in the toilet. Why?

350
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,100
Because we had an owner who was
obstinate and stupid and ignorant.

351
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,200
- You shot him, remember?
- Yes. I shot him.

352
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,300
- What are you doing now?
- I'm doing guns. Come!

353
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,100
This is my booth.
The Survival Boutique.

354
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,500
We are doing weapons and protective
devices and products for survival

355
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,400
in the helter-skelter world of today.

356
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,000
One thing's very important.
At the Survival Boutique,

357
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,400
it's my philosophy that everything
must conform to the three P's.

358
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,000
Which is protection,
prestige and pretty.

359
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,900
Why should you look ugly
if you're just trying to survive?

360
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,800
You should maintain your style
and be safe. Guess what this is.

361
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Is look like a key chain,
but it's so much more.

362
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,200
It's called a stunner.
It is designed by an ex-Navy SEAL.

363
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,200
Very serious individual,
I never see him smile.

364
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,000
Also I never see him
in pants that fit.

365
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,000
Someone comes up to you
who is a carjacker.

366
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,500
Do you want to die for your Camry?
I don't think so.

367
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,600
So you say -
a little bit of deception -

368
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,400
"l want to separate
my house and car keys.

369
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,000
"I'll just push this button, OK?"
And he says, "OK."

370
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,600
And then you push this button,
and out it comes from the mechanism,

371
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,300
the brightest, blinding light
ever that you seeing.

372
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,600
He cannot see. He's like this.

373
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,200
Everyone is come running
to help you.

374
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,300
And once again,
you have survived with style.

375
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,600
That's cool.

376
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,700
Billy, I want to give you one
for a present.

377
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,700
Thank you.

378
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,400
And, Ackwell, I want to give you one
because I worry about you.

379
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,300
- I want you to be safe.
- Thanks.

380
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,000
Now I'll show you something that
is going to blow your rocks off.

381
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,800
It's absolutely orgasmic
and my most thing that I'm proud of.

382
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:30,700
It's the most up-to-date, the
ultimate survival tool for today.

383
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,100
A new generation of luxury personal
weaponry, the Annihilator 2000

384
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,000
is America's premier survival,
home and travel security unit.

385
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,000
The Annihilator 2000
is a high-performance weapon

386
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,600
that meets the demands
of upper income urban survivalists.

387
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,700
The Annihilator 2000
has the conveniences

388
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,800
of a cellphone,
fax and microwave oven.

389
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,500
Night-vision goggles,
microprocessor,

390
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,700
verbal alarm systems,
compact disc player, digital radio,

391
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
video camera and playback functions
are just a few features

392
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,700
of the extraordinary
Annihilator 2000.

393
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,000
You think those are real?

394
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,400
Stopping power
is a matter of convenience.

395
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:26,100
That's Dodi, my personal trainer.
She can bench-press 200lbs.

396
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,000
She's working on reducing
my body fat, but it's difficult

397
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,700
because I keep sneaking goat cheese.
I don't care. I wear suits.

398
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,500
The Annihilator 2000
is constructed of aluminium alloy

399
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,200
combined with polymer technology,
totally resistant to corrosion.

400
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,500
A new generation in luxury personal
weaponry, the Annihilator 2000

401
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,500
is America's premier survival,
home and travel security unit.

402
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,500
Who's gonna buy that shit?

403
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,200
Are you joking? This is LA.
I'm selling hundreds of these.

404
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,100
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No, because I am telling you,

405
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,200
I sell 10 of these
to Jackie Stallone.

406
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,500
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Sly bought 14.

407
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,300
Zsa Zsa Gabor has one...

408
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,700
- We gotta go, Surge.
- Thanks.

409
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,100
Ackwell, try to say Serge.
It's not so difficult.

410
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,900
"Surge" sounds like a detergent.

411
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,000
What are you gonna do?

412
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,500
Nothing.
I just wanna hear the man speak.

413
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,100
To keep a park like Wonder World
a safe, wholesome, family environment

414
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,400
in difficult times like these
is an enormous challenge.

415
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,600
But my friend Ellis DeWald
has done just that.

416
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,300
Couple that with Ellis' work
with underprivileged kids,

417
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,700
some of whom are seated at the
head table right now with Ellis...

418
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,400
..and you can understand
why he's our award winner.

419
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,800
So let's bring him up here.
Head of security at Wonder World

420
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,200
and private law enforcement's
Man of the Year award winner,

421
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,700
my dear friend, Ellis DeWald.

422
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,100
- Congratulations. You deserve it.
- Thank you, Orrin.

423
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,800
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mike.

424
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,900
You're not gonna do nothing.
You never do nothing.

425
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,100
Thank you very much.
You know, a lot of nice things happen

426
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,600
when you work at a nice place
like Wonder World,

427
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,000
especially when your bosses
are people like Orrin Sanderson

428
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,400
and Uncle Dave Thornton. I don't
think that Uncle Dave would mind

429
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,700
if I said that this is
the nicest thing yet.

430
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Thank you very much.

431
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,200
Please don't do this, Axel.
Please don't do it. Don't do it.

432
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,700
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Don't do it.

433
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,900
Bravo, Ellis DeWald! Ellis DeWald!

434
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,600
Ellis DeWald, ladies and gentlemen!

435
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,100
Ellis DeWald! Y'all keep it going!

436
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,800
Keep it going for Ellis DeWald!
Come on, it's Ellis!

437
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,500
You're not clapping loud enough!
This is Ellis DeWald!

438
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've travelled from Detroit

439
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,400
to be with this man tonight,
to honour this man tonight.

440
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,000
My name is Axel Foley.
I'm a Detroit police officer.

441
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,400
It is a tremendous surprise
for Mr. DeWald to have me next to him.

442
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,600
I can feel his body tingling!

443
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,000
But, ladies and gentlemen,
there's not a night that goes by

444
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,900
that I don't think about
what I owe Ellis DeWald.

445
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,100
And there's not a night that passes
that I don't think about

446
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,000
what the people of Detroit
owe Ellis DeWald.

447
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,600
And I'd like to say,
when I see y'all give him this...

448
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,500
What's this? That's beautiful...

449
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,700
"With gratitude
for community service."

450
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,700
And I'm going to do
the community a service

451
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,900
because I'm going
to pay back Ellis DeWald

452
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,900
everything we owe him with interest!

453
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,000
Go on, smile.
Get them last few smiles in.

454
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,200
What's the matter? You mad at me
for shooting your boyfriend?

455
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,000
I got him! I got him! I got him!

456
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,000
You and Billy
disturbing the peace? No!

457
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,100
Just make your phone call
and get us out of here.

458
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,300
Sure. Who do I know
down there? Let's see.

459
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
Don't fuck with me right now.

460
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,000
Keep your shirt on.
I'll get you out.

461
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,300
Incidentally,
we found that truck you wanted.

462
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,800
- Where?
- By the Santa Monica pier.

463
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,100
I'm headed there now.
I'll pick you up on the way.

464
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,500
In the meantime,
don't take any showers.

465
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,900
I'm all washed-up. Dead in the water.

466
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,300
Stop worrying.
Flint's going to get us out.

467
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,200
I really liked that office.

468
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,300
- Foley! You're out of here.
- That was quick.

469
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,900
Not him, just you.

470
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,100
Come in.

471
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,400
Thank you, officer.

472
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,700
I ran a check on you, Foley.

473
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,400
You're a hell of a detective,
but something of a maverick.

474
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,900
I know what you're doing.
I know the drill.

475
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,900
You hassle DeWald, you get him
to panic, make a rash move...

476
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,400
But God damn it, Foley,
we do not want to panic this man.

477
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,900
We want him doing business as fucking
usual. Do you copy me, Foley?

478
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,700
Ticket to Detroit, first class,
courtesy of the Federal Government.

479
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,200
Also, my card.

480
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,900
Should you have any more thoughts
about DeWald, let us handle it.

481
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,400
I give you my word as a gentleman
I'll be on that plane.

482
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Truck was spotted
by an LAPD traffic officer.

483
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,900
It's a different colour
but the same make and model.

484
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,100
Read you. Out. Beach leader, over?

485
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,700
Negatory, SWAT,
hold for our arrival.

486
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,000
ETA...11 minutes. Out.

487
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,100
Billy, who were you talking to?

488
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,800
Truck was inside
the county green line,

489
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,500
so I co-ordinated
with the SMPD, BHPD,

490
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,200
LAPD, sheriff of Los Angeles County,
Parks and Recreation,

491
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,600
Highway Patrol, district attorney's
office and US Naval Shore Patrol.

492
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,300
Beach leader to team one. Proceed.

493
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,300
All teams standing ready...

494
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,600
Go! Go! Go!

495
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,600
Area secured.

496
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,900
Lab says these are the same
fibres as the truck upholstery.

497
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,100
No help there. Some sand, probably
blew in after it was abandoned.

498
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,200
I just had a very unpleasant
conversation with my superiors.

499
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,200
- About being busted?
- No.

500
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,600
There was some objection to my use
of manpower on Operation Truck Siege.

501
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,500
- What is it?
- You got a $50 bill?

502
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,700
I'm married with kids.
I haven't seen a 50 in 12 years.

503
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,300
- You got a $50 bill?
- When do I get it back?

504
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,200
Man, give me $50!

505
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,900
It's all I got.

506
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:07,800
This is part of a $50 bill like
Billy's with the hidden barcode.

507
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,500
The corner tore.
Happens all the time.

508
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,400
No, the barcode's going up,
so it comes off this corner.

509
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,900
If it comes off this corner
it should have ink on it.

510
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,400
It's too big to be blank.

511
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,800
Look! It's Oki-Doki!

512
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,600
Don't let your brother get away.
I got to load my camera.

513
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,700
Oki-Doki!

514
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,500
Nice little kid.
How you doing? Good to see you.

515
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:12,600
- I love you, Oki-Doki!
- Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.

516
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,000
That's not right! It's like this.

517
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,800
Listen, I changed the steps.
You got a problem with that?

518
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,100
You're supposed to be nice,
no matter what!

519
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,700
You little motherfucker...

520
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,000
Grandma! Grandma!
Oki-Doki pushed me!

521
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,000
You take it already.

522
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,900
Come on, Sheldon.
You playing or what?

523
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,000
Who ate garlic?

524
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,100
When's lunch?
I want a pastrami on rye.

525
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,200
See that move, Rufus Rabbit?

526
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,700
- Axel?
- What?

527
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,500
Coffee. Would you like some coffee?

528
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,800
Louis, how's it going?

529
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,600
- Fine, fine.
- Say hi to Irene.

530
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,000
- Will do.
- Louis?

531
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,800
Follow me.

532
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,800
I wouldn't mind giving her a massage.

533
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,800
When DeWald took over
he stuck me down here

534
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,400
on what he calls park safety watch.

535
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,400
He thinks he took me
out of the loop,

536
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,900
but as long as I have a computer

537
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,800
I can still access
most of what's in the mainframe.

538
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,800
- Is this the tunnel system?
- Yes.

539
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:52,600
Do any of these tunnels lead to
somewhere only DeWald's boys can go?

540
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,000
No. All park accesses are
unrestricted to park personnel.

541
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,400
Except for the Happy Forest.
That's being redone.

542
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,600
Show me the Happy Forest.

543
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,100
That would be right here
at the end of corridor B.

544
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,400
It's right after...

545
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,600
It's right after...

546
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,800
- How long's it been closed?
- Too long.

547
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,100
I'm talking about
the Happy Forest ride?

548
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,800
The Forest.
Yes, about a couple of weeks.

549
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,800
It wasn't very popular
so they're trying some new ideas.

550
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,100
I think they found one.
Can I have this?

551
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,700
- Sure.
- Thanks.

552
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,600
There you go.

553
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,300
You know...
when this thing is over...

554
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,200
Would you like to get together
and have some dinner or something?

555
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,400
- That would be nice.
- Can you put that in here?

556
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,900
Sure. There you go.

557
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,800
- We have a date.
- A date.

558
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,300
All right.
Can you help me with this?

559
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
There you go.

560
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,700
Remember, an elephant never forgets.

561
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,800
All right.

562
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,300
- Louis, how goes it?
- Fine. Nice to see you.

563
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,600
- Say hello to Irene.
- You bet. See you.

564
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,600
Everything on schedule?

565
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,800
I had to tweak the image a little
bit, but it's under control now.

566
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,800
Foley's up there.

567
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,900
Get him!

568
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,600
Will the DeWald family
please come to Tiny Town?

569
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,100
The DeWald family to Tiny Town.

570
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,200
But, honey,
the Happy Forest is closed.

571
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,400
OK, I'll meet you
at the main gate at 5:00.

572
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,300
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

573
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,500
This is Detective Axel Foley. I'd
like to speak with Agent Fulbright.

574
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,300
Could you patch me into his radio?
It's an emergency.

575
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,200
Fulbright, Foley.

576
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,400
I found what you're looking for.
I'm at Wonder World.

577
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Fuck! Get out here now!

578
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,700
Get me 911.

579
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
All cars in the vicinity
of Wonder World.

580
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:43,700
Proceed there immediately.
10-19, 10-45, and 12-22 in progress.

581
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,400
Why am I not surprised?

582
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,200
All right, don't shoot!
I'll put my gun down.

583
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:41,100
I put my gun on the ground,
and I'm unarmed. Don't shoot.

584
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,300
This is great.

585
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:51,000
You caught him. Good.
He broke into a security area.

586
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,800
Relax. Save that shit
for new talent night at San Quentin.

587
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,800
- I'm on to your operation.
- My operation?

588
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,600
God damn it, Axel,
what have you done now?

589
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,100
He went berserk.
He was firing a weapon in the park.

590
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,900
There are hundreds
of children around.

591
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:14,200
- They don't give Oscars in prison.
- Fuck you!

592
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,300
There's someone here from...

593
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,600
Fulbright, Secret Service.

594
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:34,800
- I put you on a plane to Detroit.
- You're gonna be glad I stayed.

595
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,500
I know what you're investigating.
It's right here.

596
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,300
Yeah? And what am I investigating?

597
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,100
Paper, US Mint quality.
That's what was in that truck.

598
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:50,000
You wanted to follow the truck
back to LA to find his print shop.

599
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,800
- It's right here in Wonder World.
- What is he raving on about?

600
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,100
- He's insane! He's proved that.
- In Wonder World?

601
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:01,100
This place is as high-tech
as NASA and Nintendo combined.

602
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,500
They got a hidden room under
this closed ride. I was in there.

603
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,700
That's why they were chasing me.

604
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,900
My men were pursuing Mr. Foley

605
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:13,000
because he's delusionary
and potentially dangerous.

606
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,600
This room, delusionary also?

607
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,700
No. There is a closed ride,
which we use to...

608
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:24,400
- I'd better take a look at it.
- Maybe we'd better look at it.

609
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,800
Right here. Counterfeit bills,
out of this machine.

610
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:39,000
- Is this true?
- 'Fraid so, officer.

611
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,600
'Fraid we've been
caught red-handed, right, Ellis?

612
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,200
'Fraid so.

613
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,700
Would you like to see them?
First quality. Make a run, Donald.

614
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,300
We call them Wonder World dollars.

615
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,600
Redeemable for admission,
rides, souvenirs.

616
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,000
It's our big Christmas promotion.

617
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:19,200
We're giving it away to elementary
schools across the country.

618
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,400
You must be in on this.

619
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,900
You supply equipment,
he supplies paper, right?

620
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,800
They changed it
to this shit after I left.

621
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,500
- After we leave they'll put it back.
- What's this paper?

622
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,300
- Ordinary rag.
- They switched it.

623
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,400
I am tired
of these accusations, officers.

624
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,900
I want this man
arrested for public endangerment.

625
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,000
Could I speak with you a moment?

626
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,100
God damn it, we spent a fucking year
with our noses up DeWald's ass!

627
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,700
We're this close to locking this up,
and you piss all over us!

628
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,100
Our case is blown.

629
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:06,500
You're going back to Detroit,
and if you weren't a cop,

630
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,600
I'd have you doing dead time
in Leavenworth for life.

631
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,900
Detective Flint, he's yours.

632
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,400
Let's go, Axel.

633
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,000
Make sure he doesn't
get on the plane.

634
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:32,800
I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage
and a pension that won't cut it.

635
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That job at Wonder World
is my retirement plan.

636
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,300
We're being followed.

637
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,300
It's the security guards
at Wonder World.

638
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,300
They probably want to make sure
you get on that plane.

639
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,800
Because of you, my future
is in real fucking jeopardy.

640
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,900
DeWald is pissed. Sanderson
won't think too highly of me.

641
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,000
Hold up! Stop the car!

642
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,200
- That liquor store. Stop!
- What?

643
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,800
- Oh, shit!
- Wait!

644
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:19,200
It's all right. Don't worry. I'll
get him. When I do, I'll kill him!

645
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,700
Axel, I left as soon
as I got your call. Are you OK?

646
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:36,800
I'm fine, but I want you to think
back to the night Fry disappeared.

647
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,800
- Maybe you forgot something.
- No. Why would you think that?

648
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:46,400
Because this note by itself...
it just don't make no sense.

649
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,000
"This is important. Life and death."
Why would he even send that?

650
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:57,400
Not "help, I need to talk to you,"
nothing. Just this.

651
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:19,800
Oh, shit. Fry must have found
some sample paper.

652
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,100
He knew they'd kill him
so he sent it to you.

653
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,900
- There's a barcode.
- What does that mean?

654
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,000
It used to belong to Uncle Sam.

655
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,300
Now we got evidence. We can put
Sanderson and DeWald's ass in jail.

656
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,300
I don't think so.

657
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,500
I figured you'd call Uncle Dave
here, so we followed him.

658
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:45,900
I actually was a real cop once
so I know how you assholes think,

659
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,500
which is to say, slowly.

660
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,700
Very slowly.

661
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:59,000
So you were carrying the evidence
the whole time, Sherlock?

662
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,900
Here's the real ending of the story.
Let's see if you like it.

663
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,700
We heard you were loose.
You had a grudge against the park.

664
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,300
I feared you might try
to harm our beloved Uncle Dave,

665
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,800
so I raced over here as fast
as I could to try and stop you,

666
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,300
but alas, it was too late.

667
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,000
Get him all the way in the car.

668
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,500
Take it.

669
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:47,400
Take it.
You worried about fingerprints?

670
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:51,000
Forget it.
Look at the gun. It's yours.

671
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,400
Give me your weapon.

672
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:06,000
Throw that gun in the street!

673
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,700
Close the door and get over there!

674
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,500
Hold on, Uncle Dave. Damn it!

675
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,900
Don't you die on me, man.

676
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,000
I got an emergency out here.
It's a gut shot. Come on!

677
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,500
That was Uncle Dave.

678
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,200
- Pressure?
- 90 over 40 and dropping.

679
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,600
I got to get his pressure up.
Let's go, guys.

680
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,100
I need oxygen. Let's go.
On three. One, two, three.

681
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,700
Get an arterial line in him.
Any medical history?

682
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,700
I've been shot before,
but it's no big deal.

683
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
- Where's the coffee machine?
- Down the hall.

684
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,500
This is an all-city alert for
a suspect in the Thornton shooting.

685
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,600
Suspect is an
African-American male...

686
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,400
You hear some black guy
shot Uncle Dave?

687
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,200
- No?
- Come on, let's get out of here.

688
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,200
Did you hear?
Somebody shot Dave Thornton.

689
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,400
- Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Is there a TV here?

690
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,600
Yes, of course.

691
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,500
Authorities believe
that Foley attacked Uncle Dave

692
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,700
in retaliation
for some personal rejection.

693
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,500
The much-loved Uncle Dave is
undergoing surgery at this moment.

694
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,200
According to hospital sources,
the prognosis is bleak.

695
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,100
How does a psycho like that
live with himself?

696
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,000
Janice, Axel. Get out of the park.

697
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,700
They're going to kill whoever
knows about Roger Fry's note.

698
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,300
Janice can't come to the phone
right now. Can I take a message?

699
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,200
- If you do anything...
- It'll be your fault.

700
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,100
I want you at Wonder World
within the hour.

701
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,900
Come to the main gate
alone and unarmed.

702
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,200
- And bring the Mint paper.
- Then you let us go?

703
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,000
If you don't show up here
in a half-hour,

704
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,600
alone, unarmed and with no cops,
I kill your friend.

705
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,600
And it wouldn't
be the first time, would it?

706
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,000
We have an amateur video
of the incident this afternoon

707
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,900
involving Uncle Dave's assassin,
Axel Foley.

708
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,100
All right, don't shoot.
I'm putting my gun down.

709
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:01,400
I'm putting it on the ground.
I'm not armed. Don't shoot.

710
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,800
That was an amateur video
shot earlier today by a tourist.

711
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,600
Would you please
take special care of my car?

712
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,100
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

713
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,200
- Shit!
- Ackwell...

714
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,500
Serge, I need a weapon.

715
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,700
I don't have any weapon.
I take all back.

716
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:53,100
- What about this?
- This is the floor model.

717
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,600
People been breathing on it,
coughing on it...

718
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,600
Serge, I need a weapon now.

719
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,900
Donny. Donny, Ackwell
in some kind of rush, OK?

720
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:10,300
So take the Annihilator
and wash it off with some cologne,

721
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,100
and take the case and make sure
it's nice and pretty.

722
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,500
It's Corinthian leather.

723
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:22,400
- Billy, Axel calling.
- Axel, listen. Am I your friend?

724
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,100
I'm sure you can explain,
or maybe you can't explain,

725
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,600
but you've got to turn yourself in.

726
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,200
- I'm going to Wonder World.
- No! Wait for me! Axel!

727
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,600
Put your arms out
and hold for a pat-down.

728
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,700
Foley just arrived, sir.

729
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,800
Take him to control.
We have Foley.

730
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,000
Come on.

731
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,300
- How much do you want run?
- All of it.

732
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,400
- Are you OK?
- Let's have the paper.

733
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,800
There's a Porsche by the front gate.
There's a phone inside.

734
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,300
When she calls, I'll give you it.

735
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,900
- I don't think so.
- Then we got a stalemate.

736
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,000
Not quite. Orrin...

737
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,000
We kill you both.
The paper don't mean jack shit.

738
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,500
How you know I didn't mail
it to the Secret Service?

739
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,200
- He's bluffing.
- You think so? Call me.

740
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:04,600
Orrin, I know how cops think.
The note is in the car.

741
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,000
The keys, Foley.

742
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,000
Give me the fucking keys.

743
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,800
- Drop that fucking gun!
- Again?

744
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,900
Drop it!

745
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,100
Axel, what are you doing here?

746
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,200
- What happened?
- It's the coolant safety system.

747
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,000
Protects the mainframe
in case of fire.

748
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:35,800
- How do we get it open?
- We can't. Not from this side.

749
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:34,300
He's trying to use an outside line.
Do something!

750
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,200
Hello, police?

751
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,300
Shit!

752
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,200
Foley's loose in the park!

753
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,800
I repeat...
Foley's loose in the park! Get him!

754
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,800
Mr. DeWald!

755
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,200
We gotta do something.
Call for help!

756
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,500
There's just the modem line
for the computers.

757
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,600
I got it!
Just let the computer dial...

758
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:07,600
The phone would just ring and ring.
That's it. What good would that be?

759
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,800
A lot of good.
We can call Flint's pager.

760
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:28,500
Foley is in Hometown Square. Repeat,
Foley is in Hometown Square.

761
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,900
Foley is heading for Alien Attack.

762
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:34,000
Attention. This is a red alert.
Aliens are invading the city.

763
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,800
Board the subway trains
for immediate evacuation.

764
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,500
He ran up those stairs.

765
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,900
I need that right away!

766
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,700
Damn it. Not again. Excuse me.

767
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,500
Dispatch, this is Flint.

768
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:10,600
Trace that number
that keeps calling me. 555-4085.

769
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,400
It's a computer line
at the Wonder World theme park.

770
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,500
Call and tell them
their computer's broken.

771
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,600
We tried,
but all the voice lines are down.

772
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,100
Must be that Uncle Dave shooting.

773
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:28,500
- Jesus! Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Some fool named Axel Foley.

774
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:00,100
Where the fuck is he?

775
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:54,400
Get to a phone and call the police.
I'll try and find Axel.

776
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,400
All right!

777
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,800
There you are. Foley's...

778
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,500
Name's Wild Bill Rosewood.
I'm the sheriff of this town.

779
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,100
What the hell happened here?

780
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,200
Shit!

781
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,800
Damn it!

782
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,400
Turn that fucking song off!

783
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,900
Foley? You all right?

784
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:30,300
- Hello, Fulbright.
- You hurt bad?

785
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:38,500
Look, Foley, I guess I owe you
an apology. You were right.

786
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,900
I got Sanderson handcuffed
in the car. He was in on it, right?

787
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:47,400
I found out about another partner
that was in on it.

788
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,400
So long, Foley.

789
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,100
You OK?

790
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,300
Any chance you can explain
any of this to me?

791
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,100
Like why the fuck am I shot?

792
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
You guys OK?

793
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,300
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

794
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:46,000
I wonder what time the park opens.

795
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,100
He needs medical attention.

796
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,900
- Does this hurt?
- Don't touch it.

797
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:24,400
I am so happy to introduce to you
our new character in Wonder World,

798
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,700
named after a man who's most
responsible for my being here today.

799
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:36,600
Axel Fox!

800
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:04,900
I don't think you've seen
the Tunnel of Love ride, have you?

801
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:10,100
I didn't know y'all had a
Tunnel of Love ride in Wonder World.

802
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,500
There will be shortly.
