1
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:08,803
SHARKS

2
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:15,196
There must be some mistake. No one
has mentioned collegial indifferences.

3
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:19,082
Ask anyone.
I'm the best salesman.

4
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:24,805
You're good, Laura.
But I have to fire you.

5
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:28,761
- Why?
- I'm sure you know why.

6
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,161
No.

7
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:35,157
A lot of money has disappeared
from the expense account.

8
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:38,996
- What does that have to do with me?
- You had access.

9
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:45,601
- Sune, I'm not a thief.
- You and I have sole access, Laura.

10
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:51,439
I won't listen. And I won't work here
if people don't trust me. I resign.

11
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:56,516
- Be glad we don't report you.
- I have three months' notice.

12
00:01:56,727 --> 00:02:02,802
I have to ask you.
Is this because I won't fuck you?

13
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:07,523
- No.
- I bloody well thought so.

14
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:12,198
- No, for Christ's sake.
- You're a creep. Bloody disgusting.

15
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,527
Yuck!

16
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:52,523
500 kroner
on the old lady crossing first.

17
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:58,757
- What?
- The old lady before the kid.

18
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:03,518
500. Before the light
turns green. It's the final heat.

19
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:09,085
Mrs. Zimmerframe is out in front,
followed closely by the homeboy.

20
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:15,283
Funky homeboy is trying to pass.
Yes! Mrs. Zimmerframe is an old pro.

21
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:21,676
- I just won 500. Good for me.
- Watch where you're going!

22
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,722
I can teach a beginners' class.

23
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:37,358
I can float like a butterfly!

24
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:41,321
Have you ever seen a butterfly? It
flies like it drank a bottle of vodka.

25
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,643
Now what?

26
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:48,363
- You owe us money, Willy.
- You can't just come barging in.

27
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:52,401
- I'm doing business.
- Fine. Here's a business tip.

28
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,885
The next time you need money,
don't go to Holger, go to the bank.

29
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:01,797
They may ask dumb questions, but
afterwards you can fuck them over.

30
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:06,876
- I'm not fucking anyone over.
- They just send you a letter.

31
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:10,921
- But Holger sends us.
- Things haven't...

32
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:16,964
- You said I couldn't box.
- I was talking to him.

33
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:21,922
- I gave him a right cross.
- You did not. It wasn't a right cross.

34
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:25,915
You used your left.
So it wasn't a right cross.

35
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:29,756
- No teaching for you.
- Beginners don't learn a right cross.

36
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:33,198
- They just jump rope, man.
- Fine!

37
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:42,603
Skalle?
Skalle, for Christ's sake.

38
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:47,358
- Skalle!
- Okay. Enough, Willy.

39
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:52,163
You've got till tomorrow.
Come on, Kaje.

40
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:57,885
You're fucking crazy, man!
He was strangling me!

41
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:01,796
It's no use floating like a butterfly
if you can't sting like a bee.

42
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,838
- But I do.
- No, you don't.

43
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,759
Has someone taken my owl?

44
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:22,803
Christ, Laura. You can't
bet on the dogs with a stuffed owl.

45
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:27,876
- It's worth a lot of money.
- So your winnings will be 500 owls?

46
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:31,397
Lend me a thousand.
I'm feeling lucky.

47
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:34,485
Nope. Your account is closed.

48
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:39,681
Look. Here's a check in American
dollars that's worth 15,000. Take it.

49
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:46,003
- No wa y.
- Then I'll cash it in the bank.

50
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,767
Regards to your consultant.

51
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:55,960
- What the hell are you up to?
- I just won 15,000.

52
00:05:56,167 --> 00:06:01,719
That's my machine. I put a lot of into
it, so technically that's my money.

53
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:04,487
- Not yours.
- What?

54
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:08,077
- It's my machine.
- Harry, who owns this machine?

55
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:12,439
Leave me out of this.
Laura, remember your eagle.

56
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:16,196
You don't pla y
on other people's machines.

57
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:22,164
I'll remember that.
Chocolate milk all round. 15,000!

58
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:29,205
You can't do that! You cheated me,
you fucking dumb-ass machine!

59
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:32,081
Take that!

60
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:38,842
- Move!
- What the hell's going on?

61
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:47,124
- So is Holger upstairs?
- Why?

62
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:48,760
- What?
- Why?

63
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,764
Tonny, shut up.
Is he upstairs?

64
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:54,317
Watch your language.
I was polite to you.

65
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:58,679
- Is he up there?
- Why? Go on up, Claus.

66
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:27,395
I'm thinking of signing that band.
What do you think?

67
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,996
I know nothing about music.

68
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:35,122
People in the business aren't
the only ones that can spot a hit.

69
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:40,526
It's really up to the audience.
So what do you think?

70
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,444
- It's good.
- Oka y, boys!

71
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:55,525
Shut up for a minute.

72
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:04,838
- From the restaurant guy?
- Yes. That's all he had.

73
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:09,518
Yes.
I'd hate to be paid a visit from you.

74
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,403
I was thinking that
I should pay what I owe you.

75
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:19,362
Oh, you've got money for me.
How much did that boxing place cost?

76
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,286
- 225,000.
- 225,000.

77
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:26,116
I borrowed 100,000 from you,
and I've paid it.

78
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:32,516
Give me 30 grand in interest,
and that's the end of it. Alright?

79
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:37,243
If you get the restaurant guy
and the gambler to pa y -

80
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:40,359
- I'll only take 20% of your take.

81
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:45,436
- 20%? Forever?
- It's a bloody good deal.

82
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,243
Play!

83
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,201
By the way, I disagree.
That song is crap.

84
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,961
- Your deal with Holger is cool.
- It's shitty.

85
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:09,399
As long as I owe Holger,
this place will never be mine.

86
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:13,566
- Welcome to Claus' Gym.
- Is that the name?

87
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:19,558
It's stupid.
It's that S. Clauses Gym.

88
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,840
- It's with an apostrophe.
- Why not call it Skalle's Gym?

89
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:27,835
- Because my name is Claus.
- It's stupid. It doesn't sound cool.

90
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:32,484
- What would you suggest?
- Kaje and Skalle's Gym.

91
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,406
- You can't even box.
- Can too!

92
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,962
- Can too!
- Cannot.

93
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:41,876
No, I'm doing this on my own.

94
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:44,482
Knock it off, man.

95
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:50,205
- How much are we collecting?
- No idea. Look in the book.

96
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:55,124
Christ!

97
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,524
Go around, you fat fuck!

98
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:04,356
- Let me just park this heap.
- Don't bother.

99
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,123
Idiot!

100
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:14,037
- Andersen...
- Just go in. The door's open.

101
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,522
See.

102
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:36,881
God! I'm so sorry.
Are you oka y?

103
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:40,716
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

104
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,078
- Can I help you?
- I said I'm fine.

105
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:54,359
- Is it Soren?
- My name is Claus.

106
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:58,685
Yes, but is it Soren
you're looking for?

107
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:03,085
- I think so.
- Okay. He's not home.

108
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:08,480
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Of course I am.

109
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:15,604
- Can I give him a message?
- Yes. Tell him he owes us money.

110
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,926
- Soren?
- Need help?

111
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:29,247
No, I'm just toasting the bread.
400 says the left one pops up first.

112
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,164
Yes! The French bread came first!
I won. You owe me 400.

113
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,996
- That's nice, dear.
- Yes. You owe me 400.

114
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:42,563
- Let's eat.
- I'll be right there.

115
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:49,161
1000 says the whole-wheat
in the third slot pops up first. Now!

116
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:57,440
- Are you coming soon?
- In a minute. I'm really behind.

117
00:11:57,647 --> 00:12:00,878
Okay, I'm bushed anyway.

118
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:05,046
You go ahead and finish
whatever you're doing.

119
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:53,237
Good morning.

120
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,640
Hi!

121
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,886
What are you doing?

122
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:09,320
- Why aren't you at work?
- I had a cancellation.

123
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:17,679
- So when are you off?
- In a minute. Unfortunately.

124
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,403
- What are you watching?
- You scared me!

125
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:32,997
- What is that?
- I'm looking for a weather forecast.

126
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:37,086
I have to check the weather
for work. Can you find it?

127
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:42,315
- No. Aren't you going to work?
- Not till later.

128
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,724
It's like that
almost every da y now.

129
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:51,526
- Is there something wrong?
- No.

130
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:56,721
I just can't find that damn forecast.
It's irritating.

131
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,117
Thanks.

132
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,156
What?

133
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:17,002
- I just want you to be happy.
- I am.

134
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:19,402
Good.

135
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:22,326
I'm off.

136
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:26,440
- Do you want a cheese kiss?
- Yes. Bye.

137
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:35,282
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

138
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:55,682
- Should I thrash that gambler woman?
- Woman? No, I'll do it.

139
00:14:57,607 --> 00:15:01,680
Sa y that bit about the bank.
It sounds cool.

140
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:07,680
You owe us money.

141
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:12,123
Hey! You owe us money!

142
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:34,163
The next time you refuse
to pay back a loan, go to the bank.

143
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:38,519
If you miss a pa yment,
they send you a nice little letter.

144
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:48,961
Are you finished now?
Why don't you break this?

145
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:52,045
Or how about this?

146
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:56,399
More? Come here.

147
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,917
What about all this?
Here's some more.

148
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:07,437
There we go. There's still plenty.
What do we have here?

149
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:12,163
A DVD player.
Where are you going? Take a look!

150
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:16,440
- Did you get the money?
- Let's go.

151
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:20,606
- What happened? Did you get it?
- She's crazy. Just go.

152
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:24,720
- Drive. She's a nutcase.
- Fuck her. Let's rob an armored car.

153
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:28,806
Are you mentally prepared to defend
your title as world champion?

154
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:33,285
Can you read what this sa ys?
Champion of the world. That's me.

155
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:39,198
- How have you prepared mentally?
- I've studied his moves on video.

156
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:42,922
Claus, do you have a minute?

157
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:48,157
I hear you don't like
the work I give you.

158
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,837
- Are you wasting your time?
- A little.

159
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:57,405
You should be fucking glad
you're allowed to work here.

160
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:03,124
You're only here to show the others
what happens to slackers.

161
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:09,641
- I've been sober for two years.
- That could have been you.

162
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:16,647
- What do you think of Omar?
- He has a good technique.

163
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:20,362
He's an idiot. No self-discipline.
No respect for anything.

164
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:23,206
His American trainer went home.

165
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:27,639
- He's overrated if you ask me.
- Why?

166
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,920
He hasn't had a strong opponent
since he won the title. He's sloppy.

167
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:35,005
His punches are too predictable.

168
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:38,199
So I guess
you wouldn't be his trainer.

169
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:41,399
Are you asking me
to be the champion's trainer?

170
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:46,965
Yeah, but since he's overrated,
you'd rather sweep the floors.

171
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,876
He's has a good technique.

172
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:31,521
- Hey! Wait a minute...
- Oka y. That'll do.

173
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:35,606
- Two more days.
- Too late. Stick your finger out.

174
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:38,924
- Stop it, Kaje.
- I don't give a fuck.

175
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:44,440
I said stop it. You owe Holger
money. When will he get it?

176
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:47,958
Thanks.

177
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:52,441
Holger?

178
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:59,800
- You know I'm going to be a trainer?
- Has your gym already opened?

179
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:05,684
No, not yet. I've been offered
to be Omar Halim's trainer.

180
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:10,165
- The world champion.
- Awesome. Congratulations.

181
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:16,283
It's legit,
so I can't keep this job.

182
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:21,519
- You make me sound like a gangster.
- I didn't mean to.

183
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:26,005
Haven't I always helped you
with money when you were broke?

184
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:31,122
- Been patient about the payments?
- Yes, but...

185
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:35,639
I'd like to keep the two separate,
since it's my boxing club.

186
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:39,886
Then pa y what you owe me. Play!

187
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,318
Can I have a pa yment plan?

188
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:51,325
- You don't want that.
- I do.

189
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:54,360
- No.
- Yes.

190
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:58,480
Remember that client
you visited last week?

191
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:02,202
- With the bad habit?
- Yes.

192
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:06,525
He has a pa yment plan.
He owes less than you.

193
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:11,243
Didn't he end up in the hospital?
I'd hate to be paid a visit by you.

194
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,998
- I'll get you the money.
- No.

195
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,119
I'll rob a gas station.
They're loaded.

196
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,922
- They don't even take 1000 notes.
- They do.

197
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,039
- A 7- 11?
- Shut up.

198
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:37,966
Ramming a car in a storefront?

199
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:42,718
We've had a burglary.
They stole all my CD's and watches.

200
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:46,203
- They were worth a fortune.
- Flip the switch.

201
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:53,124
The damage is worth a fortune.

202
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,443
...I'm Omar Halim.

203
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:58,844
You have a worthy opponent,
so there is a risk.

204
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:01,515
It doesn't mattter
with Diamond Jackson.

205
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:08,161
Stop.
You have to mix it up.

206
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,645
Otherwise you're
too predictable. Try to block.

207
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:19,358
- Knock it off.
- Block!

208
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:24,643
- Block.
- My blocks are fine.

209
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:29,159
My biggest problem is
the two weeks before a match -

210
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:32,359
- when I can't have any pussy.

211
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:40,646
- Have you lost your mind?
- Why weren't you blocking?

212
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:44,237
- Fucking idiot!
- Chill. Why didn't you block?

213
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:47,519
- Your aim really sucks.
- What are you doing here?

214
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:52,482
- Hello there! I'm Omar.
- How unexpected to find you here.

215
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,918
Where people beat each other up.

216
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:02,243
- Nice place. Is this your office?
- What do you want?

217
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:07,077
A Cartier and an Omega watch.
They're worth over 80,000 each.

218
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:11,041
It's called style.
Something you know nothing about.

219
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:16,077
I still owe you 70,000.
You'll get it in two weeks.

220
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:22,442
In the meantime you leave me
and my boyfriend alone. Deal?

221
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:31,519
- If you're doing me over...
- Would I come down here then?

222
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:36,118
You must be crazy.

223
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:42,646
- No wa y a watch is worth 80,000.
- It's called style, you loser.

224
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:47,159
- She's fucking you over.
- No, I can handle it.

225
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:51,246
- You never could with the ladies.
- I can.

226
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:55,565
All you ever talk about is boxing,
and the bitches couldn't care less.

227
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:59,282
- Talk about their interests.
- Like what?

228
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:04,163
Astrology. Let's sa y you find
a chick you want to fuck.

229
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:09,521
And she says she's an Aquarius.
You go, "Do you feel like one?"

230
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:14,437
And off she goes.
"I'm so sensitive and impulsive..."

231
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:18,162
- What do I care if she's an Aquarius?
- You don't, man.

232
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:22,406
The important thing is to get
her to reveal intimate secrets.

233
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:28,876
That saves you three pints
and small talk. Works like a charm.

234
00:23:29,087 --> 00:23:36,516
- Can I come over for a cup of tea?
- Yes. You're alwa ys welcome, dear.

235
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:40,436
- Fine. I'll see you in 20 minutes.
- Great. Bye.

236
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:45,323
- When is she coming?
- In 20 minutes.

237
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:56,042
I'll get the stereo in the kitchen.
Take the napkin rings in the drawer.

238
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:58,715
Don't forget the cell phone.

239
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:02,203
Are you fucking crazy?

240
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:06,798
Not you. Keep pla ying.
Are you crazy?

241
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:10,886
- They're worth 80,000 each.
- A couple of watches?

242
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:16,480
- They're very classy.
- What the hell do you know? Claus.

243
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:21,966
- Can you get the money or not?
- Of course I can.

244
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:24,635
Thank you!

245
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:31,124
- How are you, Laura?
- Hi, postman Pat. Better than ever.

246
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:34,524
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

247
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:40,877
- Have you come to borrow money?
- Not at all.

248
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:45,319
- Sure?
- Can't I come by for a cup of tea?

249
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:50,840
- I suppose so. Come in.
- Hi, Dad.

250
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:55,598
- Hi, Laura. Long time no see.
- Do you have any?

251
00:24:57,207 --> 00:25:01,246
I promise to pay you back.
We're really broke.

252
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:06,760
Soren has trouble at work, and the
kitchen costs more than we thought.

253
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:12,246
- You must come and see it soon.
- Yes, we must. We must.

254
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:18,238
- 5000. That's all we can afford.
- That's terrific. Thanks, Mom.

255
00:25:20,007 --> 00:25:23,920
You haven't started
betting again, have you?

256
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:26,561
No.

257
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:32,125
I really... no.
Why do you ask?

258
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:44,238
No, it's because of the kitchen.

259
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:50,283
You know? That damn kitchen
just won't get finished.

260
00:25:57,887 --> 00:26:03,996
- What's the matter, honey?
- Damn workmen.

261
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:19,879
ARCADE
CASH PAYMENT

262
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:27,923
- Now what?
- The watches weren't any good.

263
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:31,676
- I want cash.
- You'll have to wait.

264
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:35,766
We've been robbed, but
we'll get money from the insurance.

265
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,195
When?

266
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:41,122
- Maybe in a month.
- I can't wait that long.

267
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:43,477
Too bad.

268
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:55,918
You can have the mail bag. It's leather.
There might be checks inside.

269
00:26:56,127 --> 00:27:01,759
- I don't want some damn mail bag.
- Then take this.

270
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:06,882
- 5000.
- Thanks, but it's not enough.

271
00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:11,239
- It's all I have.
- There aren't any checks inside.

272
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:15,042
- And it's not leather.
- No.

273
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:21,516
How much do you need to leave
me alone? We'll make a deal.

274
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:28,556
You'd better wait here.
Because I said so.

275
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:33,887
- Hi, Laura.
- Hi, Sille. You look great!

276
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:42,440
- Hi, Laura!
- How nice to see you.

277
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:47,004
- Were you in France?
- Yes. Sune, do you have a minute?

278
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,563
- Not really.
- Just two seconds.

279
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:56,205
- Who is that guy?
- Nobody. Just a quick word.

280
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:06,327
- You really think we owe you pa y?
- Yes, I had three months' notice.

281
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:13,000
It's not normal to spend 100,000
at a casino. Forget it, Laura.

282
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:28,079
- You milked your expense account.
- But we got the client.

283
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:39,600
- It's normal to treat new clients.
- At a casino?

284
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:44,005
- That was after the client left.
- Yes, but...

285
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:54,242
Thug methods don't work on me.
Not at all.

286
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:03,603
Oka y, you win.
Just get him out of here.

287
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:07,197
30,000.
And then you leave.

288
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:17,163
- 40,000. But not a penny more.
- They have cash in the reception.

289
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:29,644
- What sign are you?
- Gemini.

290
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:36,959
- Do you feel like one?
- Christ, I don't know.

291
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:40,318
I don't believe in astrology.

292
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,117
Okay.

293
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:49,440
- It's no good.
- What?

294
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:53,720
Astrology's no good.
Soren and I are the same sign -

295
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:58,364
- and we're completely different.
I'm very romantic.

296
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:03,197
He thinks he is too, but since when
it is romantic to get a DVD pla yer -

297
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:08,162
- and the complete works
of Kieslowski? I'm very spontaneous.

298
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:13,964
But he wouldn't fart without
getting the council's permission first.

299
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:18,558
- Who's Soren?
- Would he save me from drowning?

300
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:23,522
I'd probably drown because he'd fold
his clothes neatly before jumping in.

301
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:29,836
- Don't you know how to swim?
- Excuse me?

302
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:35,724
- I'm only violent if people don't pay.
- And otherwise they get beaten.

303
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:40,079
- I never hit people. I threaten them.
- And you're good at that.

304
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:44,963
Threatening with violence
is the same as physical violence.

305
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:50,685
No, it isn't. It's like a lawyer
threatening with distraint.

306
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:55,517
- So you're like a lawyer.
- Yes. No.

307
00:30:55,727 --> 00:31:03,077
- People shouldn't borrow money.
- Listen... This guy can be difficult.

308
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:07,678
- In what wa y?
- He denies owing me money.

309
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:12,597
- Really?
- He might be tough to convince.

310
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:17,476
- Hello.
- Hi.

311
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:20,281
- You owe us money.
- No.

312
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:23,797
- Laura Andersen. 15,000.
- No.

313
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:29,957
- You owe me 15,000.
- Laura, we talked about this. I don't.

314
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:34,285
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Pay what you owe now.

315
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:37,957
- I can't be bothered with you now.
- Okay.

316
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:55,162
- Go away! I'm not giving you any.
- It's no use. Give it up.

317
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:59,997
- I refuse to give you any.
- Open the door, or I'll have to...

318
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,639
- Here.
- Thanks.

319
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:28,362
- 15,000.
- How the hell did you do that?

320
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:31,684
- I have a place I want you to see.
- Alright!

321
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:41,557
- What is this place?
- It's mine.

322
00:32:43,807 --> 00:32:48,642
- Do you live here?
- Yes. Not here, upstairs.

323
00:32:56,807 --> 00:33:04,282
- It's a great room, isn't it?
- Yes. It's lovely... a bit run down.

324
00:33:04,487 --> 00:33:09,607
- Yes, it's a perfect room.
- What's it for?

325
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:19,082
- I see. You're going to train boxers.
- I already do.

326
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:26,398
When you build it yourself, you know
the quality is good. This is mine.

327
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:35,605
But you can't be a boxing trainer
without... are they called clients?

328
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:41,962
- Students.
- People want to learn to box.

329
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:46,558
I want to be a good trainer.
I want to do something decent.

330
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:50,442
People can learn to give
a decent punch and not...

331
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:53,002
No.

332
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:56,882
- It sounds stupid.
- Not at all.

333
00:33:57,087 --> 00:34:01,205
You want to do something decent
and for other people. That's good.

334
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,362
Yes.

335
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:06,037
- That's great.
- Yes.

336
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:20,965
- Do a series.
- What?

337
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,766
Punch a series.

338
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:31,756
Put them up.
Cover your whole body.

339
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:36,836
Arms together, so I can't hit
your body. Otherwise...

340
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:40,323
Put them up. Hit me.

341
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:45,647
- Do you want me to hit you?
- It's oka y. Come on. Hit harder.

342
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:49,886
Corner me.
Back me into the corner.

343
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:55,400
Hit as hard as you can.
Upper cut or one to the liver.

344
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:57,837
Under my block.

345
00:34:58,047 --> 00:35:02,484
Psych me out. Come on!
That's not psyching me out.

346
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:06,441
Psych me out.
That's it. Do it!

347
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:12,355
And now I grab you and hold on.

348
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:36,042
I got it!
Psych you out and blam!

349
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:40,445
Psych you out and then an uppercut.

350
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:45,675
Yes. If you put the tap back,
I'll hook it up later.

351
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:15,045
What?

352
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:20,275
Don't you snore a lot
with a broken nose?

353
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:26,196
How can you breathe through it?

354
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:30,320
Does your girlfriend get any sleep?

355
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:37,043
- How did you break it?
- At 17 I was a cowboy in Oklahoma.

356
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:41,684
A heifer took off and was
heading for a bus full of little kids -

357
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:47,917
- and I had to throw myself at it,
and it kicked me in face.

358
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:53,406
- But I got it.
- Holy shit! Were you a cowboy?

359
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:58,522
- Yes. Hell no.
- Then how did you break it?

360
00:36:58,727 --> 00:37:03,926
The district championship in 89,
Arizona in 90 and the regional in 93.

361
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:08,086
- So you broke it three times?
- No, nine.

362
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:11,324
I think it looks cool.

363
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:17,841
It suits a thug who collects money.
That was a joke. Sorry.

364
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:22,996
- I think it looks cool.
- Don't you live around the corner?

365
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,880
Yes.

366
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:30,558
- Do you think I'm a pain in the ass?
- No.

367
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:35,318
I've alwa ys been told that.
Am I irritating? A little?

368
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:37,961
- No.
- You can tell me.

369
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:41,876
- You're not irritating at all.
- Yes.

370
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:46,638
- Just a little? Once in a while?
- A little.

371
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:55,519
Hell no. You're not.
I would tell you if you were.

372
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:05,276
- Not at all. I don't think so.
- I had a good time today. It was fun.

373
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,399
It was great.

374
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:18,042
What?
Did you want to say something?

375
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:23,720
Take care.

376
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:28,125
Your broken nose suits you.
You look good.

377
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:47,597
- Laura.
- Hi, Mom. What are you doing here?

378
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:50,879
You poor thing.

379
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:03,397
- What have you been doing?
- Did you call my mom and dad?

380
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:08,727
- What is this, Laura?
- Did you call my mom and dad?

381
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:13,045
Do you realize
how much money you owe?

382
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:23,196
- What's going on, dear?
- Nothing. Move, please.

383
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:30,040
- It's an awful lot of money this time.
- Laura, what the hell are you doing?

384
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:35,404
- Laura...
- We need to figure this out.

385
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,883
- Not now.
- You have over 36 accounts.

386
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:45,686
You owe more than 456,000. You
even opened an account in Sweden.

387
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:51,439
I can't take your female tantrums.
I'm here to help you. Help me.

388
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:57,039
- What's gotten into you?
- Why do you need a bank in Sweden?

389
00:39:57,247 --> 00:40:02,765
- Why won't you let me help you?
- You're always at the damn PC.

390
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:07,006
- You haven't got a new kitchen.
- When did we sleep together?

391
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:10,279
- Yesterday.
- No, we didn't.

392
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:17,563
Do you know what yesterda y was?
It was our third anniversary. Idiot.

393
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:22,676
I'm sorry. I apologize.

394
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:30,997
No, it wasn't. Our third
anniversary isn't for months.

395
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:36,486
Laura!
Why won't you let me help you?

396
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,565
Laura. Fuck!

397
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:10,676
Go on home. If she comes back,
I'll call you. She has nowhere to go.

398
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:48,967
- Hi.
- Hi.

399
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:56,077
- I'm sorry...
- No, come in.

400
00:41:56,287 --> 00:42:02,635
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.
- It's okay.

401
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:06,601
But I don't have
anywhere else to go.

402
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:13,485
I fucked everything up.
And no one can stand me.

403
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:18,602
- I can't even stand myself.
- There, there.

404
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:27,840
It'll be okay.

405
00:42:39,047 --> 00:42:44,599
I'm sorry. That's not what I wanted.
That wasn't meant to happen.

406
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:49,927
- Sorry.
- It was my mistake.

407
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:54,439
I'm glad you came here.
Come here. It'll be oka y.

408
00:42:57,087 --> 00:43:02,525
While you're here with me,
nothing can happen to you.

409
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:11,958
- I'll take care of you. Are you oka y?
- Yes.

410
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:15,125
Let me see.

411
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:24,917
Okay.

412
00:43:26,247 --> 00:43:29,956
Come on in.
I'll close the door.

413
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:40,722
- Do you want to wipe your nose?
- Can I use this?

414
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:53,435
Is that you? Wow!

415
00:43:57,527 --> 00:44:01,122
- Yes.
- Don't you box anymore?

416
00:44:01,327 --> 00:44:08,483
I'm not allowed to. I was alwa ys
dead drunk. I can't remember a thing.

417
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:17,125
- But now you're a trainer.
- Only because I'm on Antabuse.

418
00:44:17,327 --> 00:44:22,082
Otherwise they won't let me. No...

419
00:44:23,847 --> 00:44:27,601
It's best to have your own place.

420
00:44:29,607 --> 00:44:35,204
So you're on Antabuse now?

421
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:41,801
After just one drop of alcohol,
I'm sick like a dog and want to die.

422
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:47,479
- I'd like a pill like that.
- Do you drink?

423
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:52,238
- No.
- You can have one.

424
00:44:52,447 --> 00:44:57,999
I wish there were a pill against me.
All I do is ruin other people's lives.

425
00:45:00,007 --> 00:45:05,718
- No...
- I don't have any money or a job.

426
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:12,036
I don't have a family or a boyfriend
anymore. I'm my own worst enemy.

427
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:44,039
About toda y, you know?
I had a really good day.

428
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:50,959
When you said
I'd given you a good day...

429
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:56,287
I don't think I've done that
for anyone else before.

430
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,480
Not ever. I mean...

431
00:46:16,927 --> 00:46:19,885
So how does it feel?

432
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:25,559
Good.
Really good.

433
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:19,002
What's wrong with you, Claus?
I try to help you, and what do you do?

434
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:22,643
- You ruin my business.
- No, I don't.

435
00:48:22,847 --> 00:48:28,638
I help people who can't get help.
I only have one rule.

436
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:34,797
Stick to the agreement or else. Break
that rule, you ruin my business.

437
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:41,037
- I've honored our agreement.
- Good, Claus.

438
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:44,284
The money from
that girl is in the drawer.

439
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:47,638
That's good, son.

440
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:03,601
- Is it a joke?
- What do you mean?

441
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:08,483
- 20 kroner.
- The rest is in the top drawer.

442
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:13,317
There's more here. 25 kroner.

443
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:21,436
- Shit. She took my money.
- Now what?

444
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:27,677
- I'll get it back.
- No. She is being taken care of.

445
00:49:30,207 --> 00:49:35,156
Halim, the boxer you're training,
stands to win tomorrow, right?

446
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:40,646
We can make a killing if he loses.
Make sure he does, Claus.

447
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:44,760
- I can't do that.
- Yes, because then we're quits.

448
00:49:50,207 --> 00:49:55,645
Then you can get your own
boxing place going. That's nice, son.

449
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,760
Christ...

450
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:18,361
- That's the last game.
- Can you lend me 5000?

451
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:23,687
- We're closing now.
- You're a bunch of pussies.

452
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:26,884
- I'm done.
- You're kidding!

453
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:31,325
- Hi.
- Hi.

454
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:45,956
- Hi, Laura.
- Move, jerk.

455
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:54,837
Move. Let me go!

456
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:01,401
Damn!

457
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:08,197
Laura?

458
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:12,446
You have a gambling debt.
What are you doing to pa y it?

459
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:16,435
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

460
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:20,481
- You've already been paid.
- You mean the watches?

461
00:51:20,687 --> 00:51:24,316
- They're not worth a damn.
- They're worth over 80,000 each.

462
00:51:24,527 --> 00:51:30,762
- Claus says you have over 50,000.
- It's in the safe at the Arcade.

463
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:35,119
In the safe? All of it?

464
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:40,447
- You let her use Holger's money?
- I wasn't working last night.

465
00:51:42,487 --> 00:51:46,799
How can you do that to Skalle?
He's crazy about you.

466
00:51:52,087 --> 00:51:54,760
There we go.

467
00:51:56,727 --> 00:52:00,959
I gor is a plumber.
I think he's got the water running.

468
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:05,445
It's only the hot water,
but that's the most important.

469
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:09,799
Boxers want a hot shower.

470
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:18,077
That's disgusting.

471
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:21,324
Hot, isn't it?

472
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:27,122
- What's so funny?
- I've heard about your tactics.

473
00:52:27,327 --> 00:52:31,036
You look dangerous,
but you don't do anything.

474
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:35,798
- Did Skalle tell you that?
- Yes. He sa ys...

475
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:40,806
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sorry.

476
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:48,283
You know what? Skalle is lying.
Men do that to get laid.

477
00:52:54,447 --> 00:53:00,317
- Hey! Have you seen Laura?
- I'm only using this machine.

478
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:04,122
- Only this one.
- Have you seen Laura or not?

479
00:53:04,327 --> 00:53:09,845
- I'm not pla ying on any of the others.
- Where is Laura?

480
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:14,359
Shut the fuck up!
Where is she?

481
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:20,598
- Where is she?
- You mean that Laura?

482
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:26,598
- Where is she?
- Fuck if I know. I gor took her.

483
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:28,957
I gor?

484
00:53:38,207 --> 00:53:41,722
- Tell Holger that I helped you.
- You bet.

485
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:51,283
- Won't she get burnt?
- No, it's only 130 degrees.

486
00:53:52,447 --> 00:53:56,201
- Can you get me collection work?
- Tomorrow night.

487
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:59,717
- I have to work.
- You're sure it won't burn her?

488
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:05,285
- No.
- Fuck! How will you get the money?

489
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:11,722
You're getting burnt.
You bitch, you're ruining everything.

490
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:16,398
- It doesn't work.
- You're ruining your life.

491
00:54:16,607 --> 00:54:20,885
And Skalle's and my boxing club.
Can't you do anything right?

492
00:54:37,247 --> 00:54:40,284
Hi, Skalle.

493
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:45,515
- What the hell are you doing?
- Getting your money.

494
00:54:45,727 --> 00:54:50,482
- Otherwise Holger gets this place.
- You still don't get it.

495
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:55,807
The idea with this place is to get rid
of Holger. I don't care about him.

496
00:54:55,967 --> 00:54:59,801
But Holger does.

497
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:02,567
Shit!

498
00:55:05,687 --> 00:55:09,157
- Could we stop for a minute?
- I'm late.

499
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:13,121
- It hurts really bad.
- It'll be worse tomorrow.

500
00:55:13,327 --> 00:55:17,684
- That makes me feel much better.
- Where's the money?

501
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:22,244
It was a card game. I don't know what
it's called, but you can win a lot.

502
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:26,486
You lost 60,000 in a game
whose the name you don't know.

503
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:33,763
- Do you know what you've done?
- I was going to give it all to you.

504
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:38,961
I didn't know it would go wrong.
It felt like a lucky da y.

505
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:42,603
There's no such thing
as lucky da ys or unlucky days.

506
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:46,766
There are only... days.

507
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:50,960
- Sorry. I'll get the money back.
- Get awa y from me.

508
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:54,716
- I promise to get it back.
- You can't.

509
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:57,680
- You want to bet?
- No.

510
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:03,523
- Sorry I'm late.
- Sa y hello to Sergei Sak...

511
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:08,084
- Zakharov. Sergei Zakharov.
- Hello.

512
00:56:08,287 --> 00:56:13,202
- He's from Russia.
- Kazakhstan.

513
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:17,958
He lives in California.
He's very good.

514
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:22,718
He won Olympic gold in 84 and 88.
He's Omar's new trainer.

515
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:27,159
- What?
- Get real. Omar is the world champ.

516
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:30,518
He deserves the best.

517
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:38,206
Thanks for the clothes.
They fit perfectly.

518
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:43,395
Listen. I'm so sorry about the money.
So what do we do now?

519
00:56:43,527 --> 00:56:48,123
There's nothing we can do.
Unless he takes a dive tomorrow.

520
00:56:48,287 --> 00:56:55,318
- If he loses, we can make a killing.
- Knock him over and break his arm.

521
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:59,804
- But then he can't box.
- We can get him roaring drunk.

522
00:57:00,007 --> 00:57:03,886
You can't get him drunk
the day before a fight.

523
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:08,558
- Yes, I can. Do you want to bet?
- It can't be done.

524
00:57:15,087 --> 00:57:20,241
- Aren't you...?
- Marketing coordinator at Suzuki.

525
00:57:21,727 --> 00:57:27,438
- Nice duds.
- Thanks, it's part of a bet.

526
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:32,596
I think we can get you a sponsor
deal if you're still interested.

527
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:37,640
- My buddy!
- Buddy? Didn't I just get fired?

528
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:42,363
- You're going to be in my corner.
- What about Sergei?

529
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:47,516
There's room for both of you.
What's this about Toyota?

530
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:50,844
No, Suzuki Motors.

531
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:57,759
Since this is a last-minute deal, it's
a bit rough round the edges, okay?

532
00:57:57,967 --> 00:58:03,439
We expect you to wear our logo
whenever the press is present.

533
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:11,804
- What does Omar get?
- A free car and 1.2 million per year.

534
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:14,316
Okay.

535
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:20,557
If you get our logo tattooed on your
shoulder, we're talking big bucks.

536
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:22,678
How about a beer?

537
00:58:22,887 --> 00:58:27,563
- Do you have any coins?
- Are you going to give him a tattoo?

538
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:33,763
No. It's tactical. Let him refuse this,
so he'll agree to something else later.

539
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:37,084
Isn't 1.2 million a little rash?

540
00:58:37,287 --> 00:58:40,962
Thomas Bjorn gets twice that
from Ecco Shoes.

541
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:44,364
Who the hell is Thomas Bjorn?

542
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:50,039
The contracts will be here in a week,
but if we drink to it, it's binding.

543
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:54,399
- No beer for me.
- Don't we have a deal?

544
00:58:54,607 --> 00:58:58,885
- The fight's not till tomorrow.
- I haven't eaten all da y.

545
00:58:59,087 --> 00:59:02,966
You can drink this.
It's a light beer.

546
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:09,487
- You're in great shape, so...
- Just one then.

547
00:59:09,687 --> 00:59:11,962
Cheers!

548
00:59:16,407 --> 00:59:21,276
Okay. How much
will you pa y for the tattoo?

549
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:33,717
- There we go. Take a look.
- My goodness!

550
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:39,604
- It's gorgeous. Now we have a deal.
- Do you like it?

551
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:44,517
- It's beautiful.
- When do I get the check?

552
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:50,962
It's on its way from Japan, but
first they have to confirm our deal.

553
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:55,126
- Confirm it?
- In Japanese.

554
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:59,843
- We drink to it, and it's binding.
- We already did that.

555
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:03,517
It has to be sake,
or it's no good.

556
01:00:03,727 --> 01:00:09,040
- None for me.
- It's like sherry. You can take it.

557
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:16,244
- Can't we draw up a contract?
- This is just like drinking tequila.

558
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:23,603
- What's that green stuff?
- Dip. Glass in the other hand.

559
01:00:23,807 --> 01:00:28,323
You drink the sake first,
then you eat the green thing.

560
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:32,280
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

561
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:41,880
Water!

562
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:47,640
Yuck, the water tastes...

563
01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:54,921
- How's it going?
- Fine.

564
01:00:55,127 --> 01:01:02,522
- What the hell?
- He's fine. I won the bet, right?

565
01:01:03,287 --> 01:01:06,404
- He's wasted.
- Ta xi!

566
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,997
- What did you give him?
- Sake.

567
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:14,041
- Has he been drinking?
- No. I gave him Antabuse.

568
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:19,719
I gave him a pill after he drank
booze. You said that makes you sick.

569
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:24,000
- So now he can't win.
- Where did you get the pill?

570
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:27,404
- From your pocket.
- Has he been drinking or not?

571
01:01:27,607 --> 01:01:29,677
- No!
- Yes!

572
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:33,482
The pills in my pocket are morphine.
15 milligrams.

573
01:01:33,687 --> 01:01:37,123
Boxers get one
when they've broken their jaw.

574
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:42,879
- He didn't get a whole one, did he?
- No.

575
01:01:43,087 --> 01:01:46,841
- I need to know if I can trust you.
- Of course you can.

576
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:53,202
- Bet 70,000 on Omar losing.
- Do you have 70,000?

577
01:01:53,407 --> 01:01:59,004
No, but I know someone who does.
I can get it tomorrow.

578
01:01:59,207 --> 01:02:05,680
But I'm at the match, so can you
get it and bet it on Omar losing?

579
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:08,276
No problem.

580
01:02:08,487 --> 01:02:13,322
Will you come and give it to me
and not spend it on gambling?

581
01:02:13,527 --> 01:02:19,045
- Can you do that?
- Yes, I can.

582
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:27,880
- He doesn't look good. Is he sick?
- No! I told you...

583
01:02:36,327 --> 01:02:39,956
What's going on?
Idiots, turn on the lights!

584
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:43,921
- Well done.
- Can't a person have a smoke?

585
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:47,921
I don't think you should
sit there and smoke, Kaje.

586
01:02:48,127 --> 01:02:52,996
- You're sitting near 24 kilos of C-4.
- Where did it come from?

587
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:56,563
A guy in the armed forces
owed Holger 20 grand.

588
01:02:56,807 --> 01:03:02,086
Plastic explosives aren't
dangerous without detonators.

589
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:07,600
- My uncle...
- Tonny! Get over here!

590
01:03:07,807 --> 01:03:10,446
It's useless without detonators.

591
01:03:10,647 --> 01:03:13,639
- That's true.
- Tonny, what's going on?

592
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:17,357
There are 1,500 MPA detonators
in the box under you.

593
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:20,957
- Get in here!
- You want some coffee?

594
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,522
Please.

595
01:03:23,727 --> 01:03:26,287
That'll do.

596
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:37,522
Don't touch me. If you do,
you'll experience unimaginable pain.

597
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:43,957
Omar will lose tomorrow.
I'm not sure in which round.

598
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:55,726
- That's my boy.
- I guarantee he'll be in bad...

599
01:03:57,847 --> 01:04:00,725
Bad shape.

600
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:08,639
- I can't box.
- Of course you can.

601
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:12,203
- I'm sick.
- No, you're not.

602
01:04:18,807 --> 01:04:21,401
Feel good, champ?

603
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:25,604
I'm going to be sick.

604
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:47,399
I want to talk to Willy.
Claus sent me.

605
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:57,918
Here you go.
Tell Claus that we're even now.

606
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:14,236
We're ready for the IBO
World Championship in 12 rounds.

607
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:18,122
The referee is Soren Sauballe.

608
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:36,116
Tonny sa ys you got the money from
Willy, but Holger hasn't received it.

609
01:05:36,327 --> 01:05:41,845
Tonny sa ys you're fucking Holger
over. Have you lost your mind?

610
01:05:43,367 --> 01:05:47,076
- Tonny is a jerk.
- Do you have Willy's money?

611
01:05:47,287 --> 01:05:51,917
Of course.
I'll get it to Holger.

612
01:05:53,007 --> 01:05:56,317
- What's the matter? Are you sick?
- I feel like shit.

613
01:05:56,527 --> 01:06:00,440
- Do you want to cancel?
- Don't tell them you were partying.

614
01:06:00,647 --> 01:06:04,356
- That'll be the end of your career.
- I wasn't partying.

615
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:09,038
Exactly.
Get in the ring. He's fine.

616
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:16,407
- He's fine. He's just nervous.
- You're in deep shit.

617
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:22,318
- They'll take Kaje and Skalle's Gym.
- Who is this person?

618
01:06:22,527 --> 01:06:27,840
- Now I'll have to get the money.
- Kaje, I have to ask you to leave.

619
01:06:28,047 --> 01:06:32,006
Just keep your fancy job
and your new Dutch friend.

620
01:06:32,207 --> 01:06:38,316
- Leave the dirty work to me as usual.
- He's Russian and not my friend.

621
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:42,202
Get your friend
out of here right now.

622
01:06:42,407 --> 01:06:47,686
Crybaby, crybaby, crybaby...

623
01:07:14,967 --> 01:07:19,165
Omar Halim!

624
01:08:06,327 --> 01:08:12,482
- 75,000 on Jackson in that match.
- 75,000? You can't.

625
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:19,320
- I can spend my money as I like.
- It's too late. They're in the ring.

626
01:08:19,527 --> 01:08:23,361
- No! No! No!
- Too late.

627
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:29,756
No holding, go back after break.
Good luck to both of you.

628
01:08:33,727 --> 01:08:39,438
- Harry, can I bet on the dogs?
- Sure. You can bet on all of it.

629
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:48,762
Box!

630
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:19,117
Get him.

631
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:35,565
I just gave you 75,000,
and you won't lend me a lousy 500?

632
01:09:37,127 --> 01:09:39,595
500.

633
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,559
Fuck!

634
01:11:58,527 --> 01:12:05,000
I'm no expert, but that boxing
match was pretty bad, wasn't it?

635
01:12:05,207 --> 01:12:09,564
Your childish pranks have cost me
a fortune. Where's the money?

636
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:15,000
- I don't have any.
- Willy sa ys he gave you a lot.

637
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:20,918
- Willy doesn't know shit.
- I think he does.

638
01:12:21,127 --> 01:12:25,837
It wasn't him.
It was a lady, but he sent her.

639
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:31,884
- And where might she be?
- I don't know.

640
01:13:25,887 --> 01:13:28,276
Yes.

641
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:33,561
Yes.

642
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:41,483
- Claus, where is she?
- Tell him, for Christ's sake.

643
01:13:41,687 --> 01:13:44,884
- We'll find her anyway.
- I don't know!

644
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,477
- Break his finger.
- It's going to break, Claus.

645
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:50,837
This is unnecessary.

646
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:58,643
- The fuck you doing?
- He won't fess up.

647
01:13:58,847 --> 01:14:02,556
- He was just about to.
- Sorry.

648
01:14:02,767 --> 01:14:05,327
Now he's messed up.

649
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:16,117
Hold it, for fuck's sake.
That's enough. Sit down, Claus.

650
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:23,165
Tonny. What's going on?
Have you all lost your minds?

651
01:14:23,367 --> 01:14:27,804
For the last time,
where is the girl?

652
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:40,037
- Drop the bag.
- No, Tonny.

653
01:14:45,367 --> 01:14:48,803
- How much is there?
- 280,000.

654
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:56,640
Now we're even.

655
01:15:21,927 --> 01:15:26,876
- Claus. We did it. Thanks.
- No problem.

656
01:15:27,087 --> 01:15:30,716
Claus, we have to talk.
I have plenty of work for you.

657
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:33,122
Great.

658
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:38,326
Laura! Laura!

659
01:15:41,407 --> 01:15:43,125
Laura! Laura!

660
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:30,322
- Hi.
- Are you moving?

661
01:16:30,527 --> 01:16:34,998
To my parents'
till I get myself together.

662
01:16:35,207 --> 01:16:37,357
- How's it going?
- My nose?

663
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:44,882
- No, with everything.
- Better. Sorry about Kaje.

664
01:16:45,087 --> 01:16:50,366
- It sucks. How's the honker?
- I'm getting used to it.

665
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:55,243
- But I sure do snore.
- It suits you.

666
01:16:55,447 --> 01:17:02,603
I was wondering... It's a tradition to
drink a beer together after a match.

667
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:07,085
- I don't drink beer.
- Me neither.

668
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:11,360
Since neither of us do,
it's probably not a good idea.

669
01:17:14,287 --> 01:17:20,078
- I've quit my collection job.
- It's not that. It's not you.

670
01:17:20,287 --> 01:17:27,602
I think it's best if I straighten
myself out first. Also in my head.

671
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:30,560
That's all it is.

672
01:17:39,407 --> 01:17:43,639
The beer tradition doesn't exist.
I made it up.

673
01:17:43,847 --> 01:17:47,681
I just wanted to see you.

674
01:17:54,687 --> 01:17:57,838
I was just thinking...

675
01:17:59,327 --> 01:18:05,846
If you need someone
to trust you, I'm willing to try.

676
01:18:09,207 --> 01:18:13,883
- Just a little bit at a time, okay?
- Okay.

677
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:18,683
- I'll call you.
- I'll hold you to it.

678
01:18:19,767 --> 01:18:22,679
A little at a time.

679
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:47,516
- Stop. 29. I won.
- Did you eat 29?

680
01:18:47,727 --> 01:18:52,562
- I don't feel so good. But I won.
- Me neither.

681
01:18:56,927 --> 01:19:00,124
What are you doing?

682
01:19:00,327 --> 01:19:05,242
You want to bet that I can get
the remote in my mouth? Bet?

683
01:19:05,447 --> 01:19:08,883
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

684
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:24,358
Turn back the channel.
Come on, turn it back.

685
01:19:24,567 --> 01:19:28,685
Move your finger,
so I can see it.

686
01:19:31,087 --> 01:19:33,840
Stop it.

687
01:19:44,087 --> 01:19:47,841
I can keep my head
under water for three minutes. I can!

688
01:19:48,047 --> 01:19:51,198
- I don't believe you.
- Watch.

689
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:43,719
Two then.
I managed two.

690
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,602
Where are you?

691
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:47,766
