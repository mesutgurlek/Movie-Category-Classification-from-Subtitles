1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:02,423
As far as I'm concerned...

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:05,134
...you killed 'em.

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:07,437
Previously on "Into the Badlands"...

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,390
What did you take from that boy?

5
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:12,809
Ya ever seen this before?

6
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:13,810
No.

7
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:15,361
I can handle Lydia.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,462
Trust me.

9
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:17,647
You know who else said that?

10
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:18,748
Quinn's second wife.

11
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:20,033
Something's wrong.

12
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:22,368
Find the Widow.

13
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:23,903
I wannna spill her guts.

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,408
M.K.!

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,876
Now you go.

16
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:58,539
Get up.

17
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,791
Sunny, I can't. I'm too tired.

18
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:03,299
You're not tired, you're afraid.

19
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:04,861
We go again.

20
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,792
Sunny, stop. I'm warning you.

21
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:21,177
Or what? You're gonna kill me?

22
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:23,380
Just like you killed
those people on that boat?

23
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:29,135
Do you know how to get to Azra or not?

24
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:31,938
No, I don't. But between
my book and your compass,

25
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,357
we can figure it out.

26
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,393
What happens to you when
you can't control your power?

27
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:39,112
I can. You saw it at the parley.

28
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:41,698
How do I know you weren't lucky?

29
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:46,236
You don't.

30
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,723
Sunny.

31
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,811
Is everything okay?

32
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:04,314
What's that?

33
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,784
Nothing. It's broken.

34
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,323
Sorry for waking you.

35
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:17,711
It wasn't you.

36
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:19,329
It's being pregnant.

37
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:25,335
You know I won't be able
to hide it much longer.

38
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,005
I think I've found a way out.

39
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,394
There's a boat going upriver.

40
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:36,179
But the price is steep.

41
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,183
How steep?

42
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:20,637
<font color="#008000"><b>Synced & corrected by</b></font> <b> kinglouisxx</b>
<font color="#008000"><b>www.addic7ed.com</b></font>

43
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,219
I've been practicing since sunup.

44
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,971
I thought I'd get the
boring stuff out of the way

45
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,523
so we could get to fighting.

46
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,026
What's going on?

47
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,861
Are you still mad about the parley?

48
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,147
I told you, Sunny, I
was cut by accident.

49
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,984
You know you could've
killed that Butterfly,

50
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,035
but you didn't.

51
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,037
Really?

52
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,490
What did I do?

53
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,875
You let her go.

54
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,994
It looked like you were
controlling your power.

55
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,749
I don't know what happened.

56
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:03,385
- So you got lucky?
- Maybe.

57
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,388
Does this mean we get to leave soon?

58
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,391
Quinn wants us to find the Widow.

59
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,926
We leave in an hour.

60
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,576
Quinn and the other barons,

61
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,412
they want you to believe
they're benevolent

62
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,782
because they protect you
from the horrors of the world.

63
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:37,252
I offer you a brighter future,

64
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,337
a real future,

65
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,956
one you can control.

66
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,044
The other barons, they
won't go quickly or quietly.

67
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,879
If you're not up for the fight,

68
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,766
you may leave now without
punishment or consequence.

69
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,937
Here in this sanctuary,
you have your freedom.

70
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,308
All I ask in return is
your unwavering loyalty.

71
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,643
What's your name?

72
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,061
Jolyon.

73
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,446
Welcome, Jolyon.

74
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,947
The other boys are already inside.

75
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,566
Tilda will show you the way.

76
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,488
The Widow struck at the
height of the poppy harvest.

77
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,825
Without our cogs, half the crop will rot

78
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,627
and the other not far behind.

79
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,747
Then inform the barons that the
opium shipments will be reduced.

80
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,382
And what happens the next time
that the Widow or another baron

81
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,968
feels our cogs are ripe for the taking?

82
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,888
Fortify the Clipper force.

83
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,673
She took advantage because she knows

84
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,893
you're stretched over two territories.

85
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,013
Maybe if we treated
the cogs with respect,

86
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,983
gave them a basic education,

87
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,568
that would buy you more loyalty

88
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,103
than a hundred pieces
of the Widow's gold.

89
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,939
We already give those people everything.

90
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,076
Quinn, do you remember
when you were a boy?

91
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,195
Blistering your hands in those fields?

92
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,447
Did you see your baron
as a kindly father?

93
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,666
No, you hated him and
your own situation.

94
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,334
It's just human nature.

95
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,670
Yeah, I pulled myself up
through blood and toil.

96
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:03,288
No one helped me.

97
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,956
Now you want me to educate the weak

98
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,842
so they can plan their revolution.

99
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,426
It's already happening.

100
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,879
Like it or not, the Widow
is stirring that pot.

101
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,964
Oh, you sound like you admire her.

102
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,557
We sit here with the largest
Clipper force and two territories

103
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,609
talking about a woman
who's done more damage

104
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,027
with no army at all.

105
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:27,896
None of this solves
our immediate problem.

106
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,149
I worked the harvest when I was a child.

107
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,868
Give me part of your Clipper force.

108
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,402
I'll show them how it's done.

109
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,906
It will be a bridge
until the new cogs arrive.

110
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,663
I'll gather the men
for your instruction.

111
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:02,013
M.K., right?

112
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:08,186
Where are you headed?

113
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,356
Sunny's taking a crew
to track down the Widow.

114
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,693
She was looking for you
at one point, wasn't she?

115
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,698
Well, I wish you luck.

116
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,785
Could you give me my pendant back?

117
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,627
You mean the one you tried
to steal from my room?

118
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,846
It was stolen from me first.

119
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,132
Wish I could help you out.

120
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,184
It's gone. I traded it.

121
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,105
Why is it so important to you?

122
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,974
My mother gave it to me.

123
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,276
Beautiful craftsmanship.

124
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:50,612
What was the design?

125
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,063
Don't know.

126
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,152
You're a bad liar.

127
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,322
M.K.?

128
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,241
Time to head out.

129
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,101
You all have sworn an oath

130
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,854
to protect our home.

131
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:38,692
Today, the fort does not
require your skills with a sword.

132
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:41,028
It needs your hands.

133
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,949
Our poppy crop will spoil

134
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,585
if it is not harvested immediately.

135
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,205
We can't let this happen.

136
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,709
Now it needs... oh.

137
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,522
Now it needs you to pull together...

138
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,064
Lead them.

139
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,575
Your baron will be fine.

140
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,329
We have work to do.

141
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,554
Okay.

142
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,589
Fetch Veil. Hurry!

143
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,095
- Oh.
- Come on.

144
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:50,431
Come on. Come on.

145
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,444
You're worried about her...

146
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:06,163
Veil, I mean, aren't you?

147
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,998
What makes you say that?

148
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,666
Because I know.

149
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,001
Know what?

150
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,786
You know, that she's pregnant.

151
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,926
Makes sense why you wanna leave now.

152
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,714
- Have you told anyone?
- Of course not.

153
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,803
It must be strange for you

154
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:33,023
to have to care for
someone and not kill them.

155
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:36,393
I'm sure there's times you've
thought about killing me.

156
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,729
It's crossed my mind.

157
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,982
Well, if it's worth anything,
you're not a shitty teacher.

158
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,584
You've given me hope
that I might be able

159
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,652
to control what happens when I'm cut.

160
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:51,492
Why did you lie to me about Azra?

161
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:53,961
I didn't. I know the way,

162
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,163
but it's all jumbled in my head.

163
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,085
That's why I thought the
Widow's book would help.

164
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,670
I got my compass to work.

165
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,672
I put it in the cutout of that book.

166
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:08,091
What happened? Did it point somewhere?

167
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,512
I might have a direction.

168
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:12,846
Maybe.

169
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:17,184
See, I told you I could help.

170
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,783
Off you go.

171
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,376
That was the last one.

172
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,797
Are you sure the boy you're
looking for is one of Quinn's cogs?

173
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,383
He was in the fort.

174
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,218
Perhaps he's a Colt now.

175
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,357
Mother, when you find him,

176
00:12:57,393 --> 00:13:00,194
how exactly do you plan to use him?

177
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,145
You said he was dangerous.

178
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,399
I was just curious if he
was dangerous to everyone.

179
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:08,035
I need to train him, teach him control,

180
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,204
which is that more
difficult without that book.

181
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,206
Does it have the answers?

182
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:15,242
Why the sudden burst of curiosity?

183
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:18,495
Because I want to be more help to you...

184
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,547
now that Angelica and
Valentine are gone.

185
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,085
I was still translating the book.

186
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,671
I believe the answers I
seek are within its pages.

187
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:33,143
Will the boy change?

188
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,729
You know, be different
after he's trained?

189
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,814
Right now every time he's cut,

190
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,317
his life force gets weaker.

191
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,852
Without training, he will die.

192
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,023
What about that boy you brought home?

193
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,743
M.K.? I cut him. You watched me.

194
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:51,945
I also saw you kissing him.

195
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,783
He was kind to me once.

196
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,835
Remember that kindness
is a weapon men use

197
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,420
to get what they want.

198
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,289
Yes, Mother.

199
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,458
Quinn won't take the theft
of his cogs lying down.

200
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,294
Take three of your sisters
and check the traps.

201
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,390
For somebody with just
two toes on your left foot,

202
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,026
you got a steady gait.

203
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,479
I never understood
how you could do that.

204
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,399
Know who it is without turning around.

205
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,451
Well...

206
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,539
you lose one ability,

207
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,292
I guess you just develop another.

208
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:41,044
You can still do it when you walked.

209
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,914
Well, maybe I'm just that damn good.

210
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,833
So how are you feeling?

211
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,885
Heard all about your head.

212
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,505
I'm finally seeing things clearer.

213
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:56,226
Realizing who I can count on...

214
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:57,678
who I can't.

215
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:03,684
Since you've come to see me,

216
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:07,521
am I to assume that I am
still among the chosen few?

217
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,325
Oh, you rescued me, Waldo.

218
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,160
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead.

219
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,112
Oh, no, that took some steel

220
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,914
to survive the hell you endured.

221
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,084
But you didn't come here

222
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,870
to reminisce about the bad ol' days.

223
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,460
I wanted to know that if
things changed around here...

224
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,017
I'd have your support.

225
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:40,887
Sounds ominous.

226
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:45,025
I know my father cast you
aside when you were injured.

227
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,811
I also know you and
Sunny are very close.

228
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,314
Ryder...

229
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,369
I'm on the side that wins.

230
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,656
A man in my position,

231
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,793
which is to say permanently seated,

232
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,661
well...

233
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,798
options get limited.

234
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:12,002
However, I would advise you to
choose your allies with care.

235
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:17,591
Anything else you wanna talk about?

236
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,147
I took it off Sunny's Colt.

237
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,516
My mother knows something about it.

238
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,110
And you wanna know more?

239
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,697
Well...

240
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,616
I think you should go talk to the man

241
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:46,253
who taught Lydia everything she knows.

242
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,038
Go talk to your grandfather,

243
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,290
the preacher, Penrith.

244
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,292
She hasn't spoken to him in years.

245
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,961
I'm talking about you here.

246
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:56,963
I think you should go get acquainted.

247
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,357
I hope we find some Butterflies.

248
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,309
I want my first kill tat.

249
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:10,811
What's the rush?

250
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,113
You've only been a
Colt a couple of weeks.

251
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,784
You already killed
someone for the regent.

252
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,320
Saved his life. You're set.

253
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:24,407
Me, I gotta prove myself to Petri.

254
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,077
If that means killing
some girls, then...

255
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,578
so be it.

256
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,466
Sunny, look.

257
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:48,039
The poppy bulb is very fragile.

258
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:49,741
You need to milk it.

259
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:52,577
And the trick is doing that
without killing the bulb.

260
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:54,245
I know your instinct is to cut deep,

261
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:58,166
but in this case, just
through the top layer of skin

262
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:01,669
one... even... stroke.

263
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:06,257
Let's get to work.

264
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,103
I'm here to help.

265
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:25,243
I appreciate that, but you don't
need to get your hands dirty.

266
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,612
Oh, Veil is looking after Quinn.

267
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:32,750
I can't rattle around that
empty house doing nothing.

268
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:34,252
Please, show me.

269
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:51,769
Are you certain you want to
go through with this, Baron?

270
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:54,222
What happened in front of my men

271
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:56,190
will never happen again.

272
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:04,482
I'm sure you're enjoying this.

273
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:07,819
Watching me suffer must
give you great pleasure.

274
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:11,205
I'm not playing this game with you.

275
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:13,074
What game?

276
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,159
The one where you try and find
enemies where they don't exist.

277
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:17,328
Oh, is that what you think I do?

278
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:22,634
Your resting state is war.

279
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:25,470
It's your nature.

280
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:27,839
I'm not sure if it
infuriates or delights you

281
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,924
that you're now fighting your own body.

282
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:32,510
I think I know what
infuriates you, Veil.

283
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:40,935
Go on, ask me the question
you've been dying to ask.

284
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:45,073
I know Sunny told you what happened.

285
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:47,108
How could he not?

286
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,527
Why?

287
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:54,365
Why did you kill my parents?

288
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,190
You know they would never have
told a soul about your condition.

289
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,374
Well, like you said, it's in my nature.

290
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:10,682
You could turn on that poison.

291
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:14,218
End me now. No one would know.

292
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:30,401
I guess we're both
prisoners of our natures.

293
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:35,490
The truth is...

294
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:39,911
I didn't kill your parents.

295
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,414
You're lying.

296
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:48,052
Ask Sunny. He was there.

297
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:51,589
It was his blade that
ended their lives...

298
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:55,560
not mine.

299
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:07,822
You're lucky you didn't lose your foot.

300
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:09,357
Bite on this.

301
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:23,337
You're no good on this leg.

302
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,589
We're staying here tonight.

303
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:27,425
M.K., you're on first watch.

304
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:31,095
Don't let the fire go out.

305
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,161
The last time I saw you

306
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:06,714
your mother carried you
in here like a broken bird.

307
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:08,749
I don't really have
any memory of that time.

308
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:10,384
Perhaps for the best,

309
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,638
considering what those
nomads did to you.

310
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,139
I told your mother what would happen

311
00:23:15,175 --> 00:23:17,341
if she married a man like Quinn.

312
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:20,511
Willing to sacrifice his own son

313
00:23:20,513 --> 00:23:23,014
over his pride.

314
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:25,016
He should've paid the ransom.

315
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,020
I'm not here to talk about the past.

316
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,690
Ever seen something like this before?

317
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:40,364
Where'd you get it?

318
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:43,534
A boy in the fort.

319
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:47,788
Azra.

320
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,841
That name mean anything to you?

321
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:53,628
No. What is it?

322
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,181
A story they used to tell cog orphans.

323
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:58,850
Make them believe that they were from

324
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:01,886
some faraway place beyond the Badlands.

325
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,724
Paradise.

326
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:08,943
If it's just a story,

327
00:24:08,978 --> 00:24:11,145
then where'd the pendant come from?

328
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:13,531
Who knows? Perhaps it was a maker

329
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:15,733
in the outlying territories.

330
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:18,152
He could've forged it
from a picture he saw

331
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:20,404
from the old world.

332
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:26,077
It's human nature to want to believe

333
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,912
in something greater than yourself.

334
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:30,631
Your father and the other barons

335
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:33,217
certainly have exploited
that for their own power.

336
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:35,169
And what do you do?

337
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:39,557
Have people worship totems.

338
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:42,176
Smash them to answer their prayers.

339
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:45,513
Totems, part of our ritual, yes,

340
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:48,266
but I preach salvation
through acceptance...

341
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:51,352
not fairy tales.

342
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:55,523
To my mother,

343
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:57,775
it seemed like more than just a story.

344
00:24:57,777 --> 00:24:59,944
She's no longer my daughter anymore...

345
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:02,446
She still practices.

346
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:04,365
I've seen the totems in her room.

347
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:10,454
Your mother was never happy here.

348
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:12,790
I didn't recognize it
until it was too late.

349
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:18,963
Then one day a Clipper
rode in hunting for nomads.

350
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,849
She took one look at your father

351
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:24,135
and that's the moment I lost her.

352
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:34,312
I'm always here if you wish to
embark on a different course.

353
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,325
I prefer to make my own salvation.

354
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:57,501
Send word to the abbots we've
got a dark one in the fort.

355
00:25:57,503 --> 00:25:59,503
He'll need to be cleansed.

356
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:19,690
You're not safe here.

357
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,325
You almost got me killed in the cemetery

358
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:22,994
and now you're trying to warn me?

359
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,363
Just listen.

360
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,581
My mother suspects you.

361
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:29,834
- Did you tell her what you saw?
- No.

362
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,423
What did I see, M.K.?

363
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,041
I don't even know.

364
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:40,378
It's like I'm lost inside myself.

365
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:44,598
Sunny told me I didn't hurt you.

366
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:47,685
I thought you were going to, but...

367
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,055
but then you just stared at me.

368
00:26:51,057 --> 00:26:53,557
And for a moment, I saw you, M.K.

369
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:56,694
And then you weren't lost.

370
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,033
- What?
- Sunny told me

371
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:03,901
that when I'm in that state,

372
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:07,955
I need to concentrate on
something that makes me feel safe.

373
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,360
I thought for sure it'd
be my mom, but it's not.

374
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:14,562
It's you.

375
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:18,816
You're the reason I
was able to control it.

376
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:26,157
My mother says the
more that power is used,

377
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:28,209
the weaker you get.

378
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:30,745
Use it too much and... and you'll die.

379
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:33,297
- How does she know that?
- From that black book.

380
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,584
M.K., you need to get as far
away from here as possible.

381
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:39,086
All of these people want to use you...

382
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:41,589
my mother, Quinn, even Sunny.

383
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:44,759
We could run away together.

384
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,476
How long has this been going on?

385
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:11,066
You don't understand.

386
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:12,617
She was trying to warn
me about the Widow.

387
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,152
You know, every time I begin to trust...

388
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:16,121
Sunny.

389
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:19,491
She's the reason I was able to
control myself at the parley.

390
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:25,664
Are you gonna tell me where the Widow is

391
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,382
or am I gonna have to
take you back to the fort

392
00:28:27,418 --> 00:28:29,501
and have Quinn force
it out of you himself?

393
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,804
What's it gonna be?

394
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:38,176
You heard the regent. Speak up!

395
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:42,397
Where is she, huh?

396
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:44,015
Where is she?

397
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:47,853
Where is she, you little bitch?

398
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:09,291
Back to the fort it is.

399
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,182
Sorry.

400
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:20,685
I remember my first harvest.

401
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:22,387
My hands were so blistered,

402
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:25,891
I thought they were going to fall off.

403
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:28,560
I have a whole new
respect for these people.

404
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:32,948
For a woman who's never
worked a day in her life,

405
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:34,900
you did well.

406
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:41,123
I know you and I haven't
always seen eye to eye.

407
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:43,125
Well, how could we?

408
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,077
Quinn has pitted us against each other.

409
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,385
It's hard...

410
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,138
when you build your life with someone

411
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:59,424
and then one day they decide
you're not enough anymore.

412
00:30:01,895 --> 00:30:04,396
- Quinn loves you.
- I know.

413
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:07,349
But he doesn't need me
the way he needs you.

414
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:11,403
And when he wants you that way, it is...

415
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:13,438
the best feeling in the world.

416
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:20,445
How do we do this?

417
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,532
I'm not sure.

418
00:30:24,952 --> 00:30:27,452
But I don't wanna do it as rivals.

419
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:31,039
Neither do I.

420
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,099
Mother.

421
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,634
Over here.

422
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:00,118
Head back to the sanctuary.

423
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:03,121
Send word to our friend in the fort.

424
00:31:03,156 --> 00:31:05,957
I need to gain entry.

425
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:08,627
Mother, are you sure?

426
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:11,296
Tilda would die before she would talk.

427
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:14,082
Of that I have no doubt.

428
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:15,634
Now, go.

429
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:50,869
How long you been sitting there, woman?

430
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:53,955
Long enough.

431
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:56,791
What happened?

432
00:31:56,843 --> 00:32:00,195
Scoring poppy bulbs is
harder than it looks.

433
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:04,432
You're not dying on me, you know that?

434
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:07,035
I'm not going anywhere.

435
00:32:10,374 --> 00:32:13,675
I still remember the first
moment I laid eyes on you.

436
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,177
You were riding through the woods,

437
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:18,680
your blade wet from battle.

438
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:23,551
I don't think I ever
wanted someone so badly.

439
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,278
It's always gonna be me and you, Quinn.

440
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:37,449
I will be by your side when
the wolves reach our door,

441
00:32:37,484 --> 00:32:39,484
howling for your blood.

442
00:32:42,406 --> 00:32:43,738
Sunny.

443
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:04,309
We've caught one of her Butterflies.

444
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:07,262
Finally... progress.

445
00:33:08,598 --> 00:33:10,098
I want you to talk to her

446
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,600
until she spits out
the Widow's location.

447
00:33:14,438 --> 00:33:15,937
What's the matter, Sunny?

448
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:17,605
You getting squeamish again?

449
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:21,026
You do what you have
to do. Are we clear?

450
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:22,660
Yes, Baron.

451
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,947
I'd hate for us to have
another miscommunication.

452
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:31,252
You and Veil...

453
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:34,923
is that serious?

454
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:41,629
No more serious than the
girl I wicked before her

455
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,515
and the one before that.

456
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,183
Good.

457
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:47,469
I don't want you to see her anymore.

458
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:51,056
Since she's treating me,

459
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,192
I'd just feel better
if everyone was less...

460
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:55,977
entangled.

461
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:00,148
As you wish, Baron.

462
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:15,713
She's gonna get exactly
what she deserves.

463
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:17,966
Shut up.

464
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:19,717
What's your problem?

465
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:21,836
You know she would kill any one of us.

466
00:34:23,673 --> 00:34:24,756
What?

467
00:34:24,808 --> 00:34:28,259
I told you to shut up!

468
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:35,183
What are you gonna do with her?

469
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:39,187
Sunny, don't.

470
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:42,190
Stay put, both of you.

471
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:05,713
Give me a reason not to do this.

472
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,081
I'm sick, not an invalid.

473
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,884
Veil thought it would be
easier on your stomach.

474
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:45,720
At least until we know how
the medicine affects you.

475
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:57,182
Why, the kitchen make that?

476
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:59,567
I did.

477
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:02,604
Save the harvest, make the supper, hmm?

478
00:36:02,606 --> 00:36:04,105
Is there anything you can't do?

479
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:10,278
You know, the first time you
brought me soup, you were 16.

480
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,364
Nostromo, my horse had thrown me.

481
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,284
That old brute was
spooked by a copperhead.

482
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:18,870
The doc had me laid up for a week.

483
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:20,622
The highlight of my afternoons

484
00:36:20,624 --> 00:36:22,090
was seeing you walk through that door

485
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,758
with a sweet smile and a bowl of soup.

486
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:29,881
That's when I first
noticed you had blossomed

487
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:32,800
into a beautiful young woman.

488
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:40,975
It's been a long day.

489
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:43,278
I'm gonna turn in.

490
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:45,780
Back in the fields tomorrow.

491
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:48,116
I understand Lydia pitched in.

492
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,618
She stayed until sunset.

493
00:36:50,654 --> 00:36:52,403
Has a real knack for it.

494
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:56,658
Can't believe you two worked together.

495
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,586
Jade?

496
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,561
Help!

497
00:37:16,596 --> 00:37:18,313
Help me!

498
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,634
Tilda.

499
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,087
Tilda, tell him where
the Widow is right now.

500
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:40,505
This can all be over.

501
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:42,174
No, it won't.

502
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,844
We both know Quinn will kill me anyway.

503
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,014
No.

504
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,183
There's only one way she's gonna talk.

505
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,604
Don't worry, Tilda. Mother's here.

506
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:02,194
You're not getting away this time.

507
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,778
Watch me.

508
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:46,715
Come here.

509
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:29,641
No!

510
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:36,014
No!

511
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,774
Tilda!

512
00:42:38,554 --> 00:42:43,554
