Do you want it, fella, huh?
Yeah.

2
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,010
Cos you wanted this yesterday,
brother.

3
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:35,136
You want to do this shit?

4
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:38,973
Let's go.
All right then. Yo, yo, T.

5
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:40,558
Get the pipe out, blood.

6
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:42,727
Are you ready
to become a man, blood?

7
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,772
You ready, yeah?
You know what this shit is, yeah?

8
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,816
- Yeah, man.
- Stone and a glass for you, bruv.

9
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,193
Here, bruv, take it.
Marky, light him up, man.

10
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:54,739
Get that shit up, bruv.
There it is, swallow that.

11
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:57,408
Hold him, hold him,
in case he drops down, bruv.

12
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,744
Take it down, boy.
Take it down.

13
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,329
Don't be sick.

14
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,581
Give me that.
Don't make me lose money, bruv.

15
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:06,459
Hold it, hold it. Hold that shit.
I said hold that shit!

16
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,170
Look at his eyes, bruv.
Look at his eyes.

17
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:12,048
All right, bruv, let it go.
Let it go. Yeah!

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,801
We ain't done yet.

19
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:18,012
Talk about phase two,
our cold boy runs round here.

20
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:20,848
Yo, yo, yo where's the phone at?
You see this?

21
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:23,226
See this shit. This is real shit.
Give him some gloves.

22
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,771
This is how we roll?
Take these gloves.

23
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,774
Listen, when you
put your hands on this gun,

24
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,692
you're a member for life,
you understand?

25
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:35,071
For life.
Take the ting, man.

26
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:36,489
You're done now, hey?

27
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:44,747
Aaah!

28
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,998

How is she today?

66
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,223
She's had a difficult night.

00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,683
Oh.

68
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:27,820
Hello...

69
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:29,947
Kath, my love.

70
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:29,256
Same again, Harry?

71
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,175
Yeah, cheers.

72
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,473
Make it two, Sid.

73
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:41,101
One for my father, here.

74
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:43,020
Thanks, Harry.

75
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,241
Everything all right, Len?

76
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,745
Fine.

77
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:05,751
How's your Kath?

78
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,841
I don't think she knows I'm there, any more.

79
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,597
She knows.

80
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,687
All right, Ken?
Got a twenty bag, yeah?

81
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,105
Yeah.

82
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:31,443
Nice one.

83
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,909
- Did you see that?
- What?

84
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,412
They don't even try to hide it now.

85
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:47,125
I found a needle in the toilets last week.

86
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,127
You think Sid would say something.

87
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,630
What's he gonna do, eh,
call the police?

88
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:53,214

89

Besides, Kenny What's-his-name
slipped him a bung.

90
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:01,097
- Sid? No.
- Yeah, I've seen them at it.

91
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:04,642
That Sid is not who you think he is,
and the other one,

92
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:07,645
he's into selling drugs, guns,
under-age girls, the lot.

93
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:11,107
Christ, Len, why don't you
say that a bit louder?

101

102
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:24,388

Can you phone the ambulance?!

104
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,117
Please, phone the police.

105
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,754
Hello?

106
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:12,806
Bob Creswell.

107
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:17,018
Big Scottish bloke.

108
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,854
We were in the marines together.

109
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:28,488
If it hadn't have been for him,
I wouldn't have met my Kath.

110
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:32,617
It was a service dance,
and Bob's dancing with this girl...

111
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:35,912
And... I dunno, I...

112
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:42,335
I see this...

113
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,462
pretty pair of eyes...

114
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:50,051
...and I guess we just
liked the look of each other, so...

115
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:56,391
I cut in on Bob,

116
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:59,477
and Kath and me,

117
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,107
we spent the rest of the night
dancing together.

118
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:21,040
You've never really talked
about your time in the marines.

119
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,628
Your Kath told me
you had a couple of medals somewhere.

120
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:36,138
Did you ever kill anyone?

121
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:46,107
You can't ask me that, Len.

122
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:51,612
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said anything.

123
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:53,197
It's all right. It's OK.

124
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,618
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- OK. Forget it.

125
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,458
The marines were a lifetime ago.
I was... I was a different man then.

126
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,131
When I met my Kath I knew that all that stuff
had to be locked away.

127
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:13,050
I made that decision,
all those years ago,

128
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,510
and I stuck to it.

129
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:47,418
Harry...

130
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,589
I'm scared, Harry.

131
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:54,299
I'm... I'm scared all the time.

132
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,348
They pushed dog shit
through my letter box.

133
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,560
One of 'em spat in my face.

134
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:08,772
They call me, er...

135
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:12,150
You know the ones.

136
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:14,486
I'm not gonna take it anymore.

137
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:25,038
God in heaven.
What are you doing with that?

138
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,417
- You know what.
- Len, no.

139
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:35,382
- I thought you'd understand.
- I do.

140
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,884
You should talk to the police.

141
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:39,886
I tell you what, we'll go together.

142
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,726
I've already been to the police.

143
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:21,571
Bastards!

144
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:25,116
You fucking bastards!

145
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:42,717
- Mr Harry Brown?
- Yes.

146
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,801
Police.

147
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:56,647
I'm Detective Inspector Frampton.
This is Sergeant Hicock.

148
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:58,816
Is there anyone here with you,
Mr Brown?

149
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:02,236
No, I'm a widower.

150

What's this all about?

151
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:07,074
Do you think we could sit down?

152
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:08,576
Yeah. Yeah.

153
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,173
I'm sorry to have to tell you,

154
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:26,594
but last night Mr Leonard Attwell
was involved in a very serious incident.

155
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:28,387
Len?

156
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:30,097
Wh-Wh-What happened?
Is he all right?

157
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:34,393
No, I'm afraid not, Mr Brown.

158
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,520
Mr Attwell is dead.

159
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:49,533
Sergeant, could you get Mr Brown
a glass of water, please?

160
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:58,125
What happened?

161
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:03,255
He was assaulted.
Late last night.

162
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:05,591
What? Where? Where, at home?

163
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:09,720
No. He was found
in the pedestrian walkway.

164
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:14,266
Thank you.

165
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:19,563
Did you find out who did it?

166
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:23,692
I'm afraid the investigation's
still in progress.

167
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:26,695
When did you last see him?

168
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:28,572
Er...

169
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:31,950
Yesterday afternoon, we...

170
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:37,372
We played...
We played chess in the Barge pub.

171
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,085
Was he distressed
or concerned about anything?

172
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:46,506
No... Well, you know,
just about the kids on the estate.

173
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,342
Did he mention any names?

174
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:50,427
No. He never...

175
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,805
Just kids.

176
00:20:58,185 --> 00:20:59,186
Hello.

177
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,898
Yeah, great, cheers.

178
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:04,316
Thanks, mate. Bye.

179
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:10,197
If there's anything you can help us with,
Mr Brown, please get in touch.

180
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:11,698
Thank you.

181
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,203
Is there anyone we can call
to be with you?

182
00:21:16,286 --> 00:21:19,831
Or I can send Social Services,
if you want?

183
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:22,500
No, no, no.

184
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,836
I don't need anybody.

185
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,131
I'll be all right.

186
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:36,598
OK.

187
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,516
We'll... We'll see ourselves out.

188
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,018
OK.

189
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:14,260
Oh! What a shit hole.

190
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:17,847
You wouldn't want to live round here
if you didn't have to, would ya?

191
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,560
Guv, normally we send uniform
to do the death-o-grams.

192
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,270
There's no need to do it yourself.

193
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,570
Ma'am, can I ask you a question,

194
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:34,989
and you can tell me
to mind me own business, but erm...

195
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:37,408
I heard that you requested
to be transferred here.

196
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,037
Cos most of the DI's would
give their right arm to be in fraud

197
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,581
or a cushy number like that,
do you know what I mean?

198
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,001
Sergeant Hicock,

199
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:49,504
if you refer to a notice of death
as a death-o-gram again

200
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:52,256
I'll have you reprimanded
before the Superintendent.

201
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:17,323
Police!

202
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:28,834
Come on, open the door,
we've got a warrant.

203
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:37,843
Jean, you know how this works,
open the door.

204
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:41,055
Don't make it more difficult
than it has to be.

205
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:49,605
What's all this about?
Where is he?

206
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:51,565
You're always fucking picking on him!

207
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:53,192
Noel?

208
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:57,154
Noel! Sergeant Hicock.
Don't make me come up there!

209
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:01,325
Noel!

210
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,502
What's all the fucking noise about?

211
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,132
Who's this, your new bitch?

212
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:19,343
Noel Winters, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder...

213
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:21,261
I don't know what you're talking about!

214
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:24,640
Are you reading me my rights?
Think I don't know my fucking rights?

215
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:27,267
I know them better than you do,
you muggy cunt.

216
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,352
...may be given in evidence.

217
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:31,230
You get your fucking hands off him!
He ain't done nothing.

218
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:33,649
Mum, give it a rest, will ya?

219
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,904
Sergeant Hicock, can I please
speak to my mum? She's upset.

220
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:40,614
Ma'am?

221
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:43,867
Yeah, go on then.

222
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:48,872
Call my uncle and tell him to
get my brief down the nick, all right?

223
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:53,418
Come on then, pussy'oles.

224
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:55,212
Watch my fucking arm, cunt.

225
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:58,048
You leave him alone.
This is harassment, this is.

226
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,342
About time,
you nasty piece of shit.

227
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:02,177
Yeah, yeah,
yap, yap, yap you old slag!

228
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:18,026
Noel?
You never asked us that one question.

229
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,194
Yeah? What's that, then?

230
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:22,572
You didn't ask who you were
supposed to have killed.

231
00:25:41,132 --> 00:25:42,884
Tell me about Mr Attwell.

232
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:45,637
Who's that?

233
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,389
You know, Mr Attwell,

234
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:50,684
the er, nice old man that you and your mates
murdered in the subway.

235
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:52,936
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

236
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,274
So, Carl...

237
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:00,819
killing a pensioner,

238
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:02,278
it must have been hard work for ya.

239
00:26:06,324 --> 00:26:08,368
No comment.

240
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:13,498
No... comment.
It's like a catchphrase, innit?

241
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:30,974
I know you're scared, Mark,

242
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:33,851
but I can't help you
if you don't tell me the truth.

243
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:35,478
I ain't scared.

244
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,814
What truth? I don't know nothing.

245
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,567
Dean?

246
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,739
Dean?!

247
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:49,409
Earth to Dean!
Hello, mate.

248
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,369
You spend half your life
in that subway

249
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:54,622
scoring and shooting up,
or whatever it is you do down there.

250
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:56,415
Come on, mate, tell us what happened.

251
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:58,167
No comment.

252
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:02,004
That's what your solicitor's told you to say
and that's your right,

253
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:04,215
but if there's something
you don't tell us today,

254
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:08,511
that you later on decide you want
to use in court in your defence...

255
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,307
Dean, can you hear me?
Dean!

256
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:15,810
No comment.

257
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:18,562
You do know
that the jury will be hearing a list

258
00:27:18,646 --> 00:27:20,147
of all your previous convictions

259
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:25,569
for violence, aggravated assault,
wounding with intent,

260
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:27,613
possession of a deadly weapon?

261
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:29,699
It's how it goes, innit?

262
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:32,993
These days you need protection on the roads.

263
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:35,121
But tell me something, though...

264
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:39,917
...when my little brother
got himself cut up,

265
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,961
where the fuck were you lot?

266
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:44,672
Shining your fucking shoes?

267
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:46,257
Where I'm from,
someone comes for you,

268
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,593
you need to be tooled up
or they're going to fucking merc you.

269
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:53,848
So is that what happened, Carl?
You were just defending yourself?

270
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:55,933
Did Mr Attwell attack you?

271
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:58,727
Did he? Was he drunk?
Was he violent towards you?

272
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:01,480
Hey, tell her, firm, tell her
to shut the fuck up, will you?

273
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:03,649
Tell us what really happened.

274
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:05,776
No comment.

275
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,154
Do you realise
how serious this is, Noel?

276
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:12,908
You could be going to prison
for the rest of your life.

277
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,661
Still, you might get to see
a bit more of your old man.

278
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:17,913
My dad was the fucking king
around that estate,

279
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:18,998
and you know it.

280
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,333
Really? What's he now,
the king of a bunk bed?

281
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,127
Fuck you.

282
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,463
Everybody knows you used to shit yourself
around my old man.

283
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:27,589
The day you arrested him,

284
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:29,675
got six of your mates
to put him in the van

285
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:32,845
while you watched,
like the little pussy'ole that you are,

286
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:34,388
Sergeant Hicock.

287
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:37,683
Think you got rid of my old man
off that estate?

288
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:40,144
- Yeah.
- Well, you haven't.

289
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:43,897
He's still out there now doing what
he's always done. Do you know how?

290
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:46,233
I am my old man.

291
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:49,111
So is every other cunt out there
with one of these, you feel me?

292
00:28:50,737 --> 00:28:52,865
I got fucking rights, you pig cunts.

293
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:56,535
If you've got something on me
then fucking charge me. If you don't...

294
00:28:56,577 --> 00:28:58,787
well, you got to let me go, ain't ya?

295
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:04,042
Did it feel good
sticking it to the old man?

296
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:06,044
I don't know
what you're talking about.

297
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:08,839
Oh, I bet it did.
I bet you buzzed off it, didn't ya?

298
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:11,383
Sticking it to some old codger.

299
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:13,677
After all, you've had it stuck into you
all your life, haven't you?

300
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,220
What the fuck is he talking about?

301
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:19,641
I've got a report here
from Social Services, Mark,

302
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:22,644
that tells me
you've been in and out of foster care

303
00:29:22,686 --> 00:29:25,689
since you were six years old.

304
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:28,442
And you've made some pretty
serious allegations of sexual abuse.

305
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:30,193
That's all bollocks.

306
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:32,696
I just made all that shit up,
for my own reasons.

307
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:36,575
No one's ever fucked with me
like that, you get me?

308
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:39,786
I'm fucking sick of this. I've been
stuck in here for fucking hours now.

309
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,080
You ain't got fuck all on me,
so let me go.

310
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:45,417
Noel, if you use abusive language
to myself or my colleague,

311
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,127
or threatening behaviour,

312
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,753
I will have you escorted
back to your cell and...

313
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:52,716
What are they going to do, put me
over the fucking table and spank me?

314
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,136
You'd like that wouldn't you,
you fucking faggot. And you...

315
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:59,139
I'll stick it up your fucking arsehole
and rip your fucking hair out,

316
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:01,641
and you'll fucking love
every fucking minute of it!

317
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:04,144
You're the type, I can tell.

318
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:09,232
Noel, I think you think
you're taking control of this situation.

319
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:11,484
I'll take control of you,
you fucking slag.

320
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:14,738
It seems to me you're losing control,
you're losing it.

321
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:16,823
Is that what happened
with Mr Attwell, Noel?

322
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:20,118
- Did you get angry like you are now?
- Is that your training kicking in?

323
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,787
- Did you lose it?
- Are you a fucking psychologist now?

324
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:24,372
Did you stab him, Noel?

325
00:30:24,414 --> 00:30:26,207
I'll stab you with my fucking cock.

326
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:28,543
Did you kick him?
Did you piss on him?

327
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:30,587
Is that what happened?

328
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,964
Hold on,
I have seen this guy before.

329
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:37,844
Fucking Freddy Krueger, innit?

330
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:16,883
...Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

331
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:19,844
Who shall change the body
of our low estate,

332
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:23,639
that it may be likened
to His glorious body.

333
00:31:23,723 --> 00:31:25,182
We give Thee hearty thanks...

334
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,416
 I hope you find a little more time

335
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:53,294
 Remember we were partners in crime

336
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,173
 It's only two years ago

337
00:31:57,256 --> 00:32:01,385
 The man with the suit and the pace
You know that he was there...

338
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:03,220
And again, Sid.

339
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:06,015
 Now he's in love with you
he's in love with you...

340
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:10,811
Haven't you had enough, Harry?
I don't think I've seen you pissed before.

341
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:12,771
 But you could leave me
standing so tall...

342
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:17,943
Well, you know,
who's gonna complain?

343
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:19,361
 You are gold...

344
00:32:19,445 --> 00:32:21,071
Oh, shit.

345
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:26,452
 You've got the power to know

346
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:28,912
 You're indestructible

347
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:32,333
 Always believe in... 

348
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:27,262
Give me your fucking money, man.

349
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:36,188
Are you fucking deaf?!

350
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,193
Give me your fucking money, man!

351
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:10,800
Mr Brown, DI Frampton.

352
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:16,013
I thought I might drop by for a quick word,
if that's all right?

353
00:36:17,348 --> 00:36:19,099
I'm sorry, is this
an inconvenient time for you?

354
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:21,227
No. Come in.

355
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:38,452
You were in the marines?

356
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:42,122
Yes.

357
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:47,419
Long time ago.

358
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,254
It's quite a chestful of medals.

359
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:56,387
Are you in the middle of a game?

360
00:36:57,805 --> 00:37:00,224
No.

361
00:37:00,307 --> 00:37:05,145
Well, actually I'm studying
the Grandmasters.

362
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:09,775
This was a game between Fischer
and Spassky in Reykjavik, in 1972.

363
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:16,114
In the 7th match, Fischer opened
with what's called a Pirc defence,

364
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:17,908
he'd never used it before.

365
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,744
Black concedes the centre of the board

366
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:24,206
in expectations of a counter play.

367
00:37:24,248 --> 00:37:28,377
Spassky was a rook to knight up when...

368
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:33,715
Anyway, Fischer won.

369
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:38,595
You don't have anyone to play with.

370
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:41,139
No.

371
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,810
Not since Len.

372
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:52,400
You could always get one of those
chess computer game things.

373
00:37:52,442 --> 00:37:55,112
You didn't come here to talk about chess.

374
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,281
No.

375
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:00,158
No, I didn't, I...

376
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:05,830
I'm looking for some background information
on Mr Attwell.

377
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:12,254
We recovered the murder weapon
at the scene.

378
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,048
It had Mr Attwell's fingerprints on it,

379
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:17,717
as well as fibres from his coat,

380
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:19,636
suggesting that the knife
belonged to him.

381
00:38:21,554 --> 00:38:24,683
To be precise,
it was an old military bayonet.

382
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:28,853
Mr Attwell never served in the forces.

383
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:30,772
No.

384
00:38:32,148 --> 00:38:34,067
You didn't give it to him, did you?

385
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,361
No.

386
00:38:36,403 --> 00:38:38,488
But you knew he had it?

387
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:41,157
Oh yeah, I knew.
I think his dad gave it to him.

388
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:43,326
- He showed it to me.
- When?

389
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:47,455
The day he died.

390
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:50,458
Now, before you say another word,

391
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,544
he was using it as protection.

392
00:38:52,585 --> 00:38:55,797
I mean, that man,
he was frightened. Terrified.

393
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,384
These kids on the estate,
they were harassing him.

394
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:00,718
He came to me and asked me for help.

395
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,971
I said, "Why don't you go
and talk to the police?"

396
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:05,223
- That was the right thing to do.
- Oh, was it?

397
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:08,643
He told me he talked to the police
and what did you lot do? Nothing.

398
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:12,313
Well, that may be true,
but I have a problem.

399
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:14,607
Counsel will argue
that whoever killed Mr Attwell

400
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:15,942
did so out of self defence,

401
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:18,820
which means they'll be charged
with manslaughter, not murder.

402
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:21,155
Jesus Christ.

403
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:25,702
You came here to tell me that?

404
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:32,959
I just...
I just thought I...

405
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:35,878
should prepare you for what
might end up in court, that's all.

406
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:37,630
If it ever gets to court.

407
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,596
I won't take up any more of your time.

408
00:39:57,316 --> 00:40:00,653
I'll let you know when there's
some further developments.

409
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:36,492
You look like
a couple of Feds, innit?

410
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,581
See this thing here, blood?

411
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:26,333
Fucking faggot,
you run for it, you're getting this.

412
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:24,892
What the fuck do you want?

413
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:28,270
I'd like to do some business.

414
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,242
Yeah?

415
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,912
I want to do some business.

416
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:48,123
I heard that Kenny, and you,
were the men to see.

417
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:53,003
Well, you better come in then, brother.

418
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:13,315
Put the fucking gun down, Kenneth.

419
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:25,744
So, what do you want?

420
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:27,746
I want what he's got.

421
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:32,042
I want a gun.

422
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,669
He's not coming any more, Granddad.
It's all over with.

423
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,546
Hitler.
Two world wars and one...

424
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,132
Shut the fuck up, Kenneth.

425
00:46:43,553 --> 00:46:45,472
What do you want a gun for, brother?

426
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:49,726
I want to shoot the pigeons,

427
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:52,062
off... off my roof.

428
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:57,525
Yeah.

429
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:01,071
Course you do.

430
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:03,740
Course you do.

431
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:25,696
<i>Dirty little fucking bitch</i>

432
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:33,996
Is... Is she OK?

433
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:38,292
She's having the time of her life.

434
00:48:43,506 --> 00:48:46,467
Ain't ya baby, eh?

435
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:47,927
Eh?

436
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:55,601
Ain't ya, Sharon?

437
00:48:58,437 --> 00:49:01,273
Sharon?

438
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:03,067
Sha-ron. Shar...

439
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:05,110
Sharon! You fuck!

440
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,135
She, er...

441
00:49:30,219 --> 00:49:33,222
She likes to cuddle, this one.

442
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,893
Wanna cuddle her, eh?

443
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:42,606
50 quid, all in, you can do
what you fucking want to her.

444
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:46,652
She won't remember a thing.

445
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,910
What's the matter, eh?

446
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:59,248
Can't you get your cock hard
any more, old man?

447
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:03,252
Is that it?

448
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:06,755
Because we've got plenty
of the little blue tablet there.

449
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,718
Just the gun.

450
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:28,485
Take a seat.

451
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:48,690
Start you off on a Glock 17, right?

452
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,609
Nine-millimetre, semi.
It's easy to load.

453
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:53,027
Easy to shoot.

454
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:57,949
Weapon of choice for every fucking pig force
around the world is that. Have a butchers.

455
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,786
Or, Sig P 226, right?

456
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:05,707
That's state-of-the-art, high-tech,
fucking polymer frame

457
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,250
reinforced with fibre glass.

458
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,751
I don't know what any of that shit means

459
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,796
but it looks fucking cool as crap that,
doesn't it? Look at that.

460
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:15,258
Or if you want to get a bit
old school,

461
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,969
I've got just the thing for ya.

462
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:21,222
Cool shit, that.
Smith & Wesson snub nosed. 38.

463
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,975
That's a beautiful little gun
and a proper fucking stopper.

464
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,228
You can only have five rounds
in the chamber, can you see?

465
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,647
That's because it's a model 36, right?

466
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,066
Fuck me, mate,
each one of them packs a wallop

467
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,194
like a fucking brick
through a plate-glass window.

468
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,779
Ammo?

469
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,156
It's a pound a bullet.
Seven bills for the. 38,

470
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,575
eight and a half for the Glock
and a full grand for that Sig there.

471
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,715
What the fuck are you doing, man?

472
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:59,260
You don't touch the merchandise
until we've seen some fucking coin.

473
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,429
Sorry. I'm sorry.

474
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:13,023
Hey, are you sure she's OK?

475
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:17,111
Maybe we should take her
to the hospital?

476
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,363
What did you just say?

477
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:26,370
Your girlfriend needs a doctor.
Maybe you should call an ambulance.

478
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:32,042
Ain't no fucking ambulance
gonna come here, brother.

479
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,086
Do you understand me?

480
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,840
OK. OK, I'll...
I'll mind my own business. All right?

481
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,094
That's fine.

482
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:47,015
She ain't your business.
She's my business.

483
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,518
Now you pay for your gun

484
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,439
and fuck off
before I hurt you.

485
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,193
And you...

486
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,535
I'm gonna deal with you later, Kenneth.

487
00:54:56,626 --> 00:55:00,964
<i>Yeah, so... so you were saying
700 for the.38?</i>

488
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,049
- Yeah.
- Hey.

489
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,261
I will say, she's got a nice
little set of tits on her.

490
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,971
But you two are a right pair of

491
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,265
cunts!

492
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,734
Look at me.

493
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,528
Oh, yeah...

494
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,993
Pigeons.

495
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:32,054
You failed to maintain your weapon, son.

496
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:44,901
I don't reckon you've got long.

497
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,653
I've seen that before.

498
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:49,071
Gut wound.

499
00:56:50,906 --> 00:56:54,452
The slug's probably torn
right through your liver.

500
00:56:56,162 --> 00:57:01,000
Mate of mine in Ulster
got caught in sniper fire.

501
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,419
The bullet blew his inside out.

502
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:09,592
He screamed for a good ten minutes.

503
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:15,639
You couldn't send a medic in,
the section was too hot.

504
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:20,769
So, we all took cover...

505
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,109
and watched him die.

506
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:34,742
I've never told that

507
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:36,452
to anyone.

508
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:49,757
You should have called an ambulance
for the girl.

509
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:02,728
Put you in here. Ah!

510
00:59:29,564 --> 00:59:30,774
Blimey!

511
01:00:11,689 --> 01:00:13,858
Linda, would you get me a coffee, please?

512
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:22,450
I understand things are going rather slowly
with the stabbing of the pensioner?

513
01:00:23,534 --> 01:00:27,163
You're aware of the shooting
on Curzon Street, two dead?

514
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:30,500
As of now,
we're forming Operation Blue Jay.

515
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:33,961
We'll take a zero-tolerance stand
on gun -related violence.

516
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:37,006
We're gonna come down quick and hard
on the criminal gangs

517
01:00:37,048 --> 01:00:39,759
that control the flow of heroin
on the estate.

518
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:43,763
I have spoken to Division
and they concur.

519
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:47,266
I'll be leading the squad on this one.

520
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:51,437
There'll be a full briefing.
I expect you and DS Hicock to attend.

521
01:00:52,647 --> 01:00:57,485
The death of your pensioner will have to go
on the back burner for a while.

522
01:00:57,568 --> 01:00:59,070
Thank you, Linda.

523
01:01:01,322 --> 01:01:02,823
That'll be all, Inspector.

524
01:01:47,785 --> 01:01:50,162
None of it makes any sense.

525
01:01:51,288 --> 01:01:52,539
You shot two drug dealers,

526
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:55,459
you don't risk being identified
by driving this girl to a hospital.

527
01:01:57,795 --> 01:01:59,630
She had that thousand pound
in cash on her,

528
01:01:59,713 --> 01:02:02,299
I thought,
she must be one of the gang.

529
01:02:02,383 --> 01:02:04,009
What gang?

530
01:02:04,051 --> 01:02:06,762
- Well, Superintendent Childs...
- Superintendent Childs?

531
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:28,843
- Money.
- All right, Troy?

532
01:03:28,885 --> 01:03:30,887
Where's the rest of it?

533
01:03:30,971 --> 01:03:33,765
- Coming, yeah?
- Don't talk to me like I'm a cunt.

534
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:39,229
That fucking uncle of yours
took a ton of gear off me,

535
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:41,982
and now he's gonna pay up.

536
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:45,652
We're going to pay you, man.

537
01:03:45,735 --> 01:03:48,905
He's got one week. One fucking week.

538
01:03:48,988 --> 01:03:51,825
Or I'm going to burn that shit hole of his
down, with him still in it.

539
01:03:51,908 --> 01:03:55,203
Fuck off.
Marky, get in the car.

540
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,290
Marky, get in the fuckin' car!

541
01:04:24,857 --> 01:04:26,943
Yeah.

542
01:04:48,297 --> 01:04:49,340
Fuck off.

543
01:04:55,054 --> 01:04:57,348
Oh, fuck!

544
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:02,019
Shit.
Wait. Fucking wait.

545
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:20,913
What's your name, son?

546
01:05:25,084 --> 01:05:26,210
Tell me your name.

547
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:29,296
Marky.

548
01:05:30,506 --> 01:05:34,885
Tell me what happened
in the subway with Leonard, Marky.

549
01:05:37,096 --> 01:05:39,140
Who's Leonard?

550
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:44,770
He's the man
you and your mates murdered.

551
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,608
So, what happened, son?

552
01:05:51,277 --> 01:05:55,948
You're chatting shit there, bruv,
I don't know what you're talking about.

553
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:05,249
Tell me what happened to Leonard.

554
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,333
Fuck off.

555
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:11,005
Fuckin' hell.

556
01:06:11,046 --> 01:06:12,381
You tell me the truth...

557
01:06:13,632 --> 01:06:15,926
...and I won't hurt you anymore.
- Fuck off, all right?

558
01:06:15,968 --> 01:06:19,346
Fucking Jesus!

559
01:06:22,558 --> 01:06:25,477
Fucking Jesus.

560
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:27,563
Oh fuck, no way.

561
01:06:27,646 --> 01:06:30,941
Now, listen, if you won't tell me,

562
01:06:30,983 --> 01:06:35,070
I'm gonna do both your knee caps,

563
01:06:35,154 --> 01:06:37,823
one at a time until you do.

564
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:39,825
Fucking...

565
01:06:39,908 --> 01:06:41,743
So, what's it gonna be?

566
01:06:43,662 --> 01:06:46,123
Because I don't think
you can take much more of this.

567
01:06:46,164 --> 01:06:49,167
All right,
there was this one old fella...

568
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:51,587
Fucking...

569
01:06:53,255 --> 01:06:55,424
But he come at us, man.

570
01:06:55,507 --> 01:06:59,511
He was waving this
fucking shank around and shit.

571
01:06:59,594 --> 01:07:00,971
Fucking...

572
01:07:01,013 --> 01:07:03,682
Fuck, he told us
he was gonna stab us.

573
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:05,976
We told him to fuck off, like,

574
01:07:06,018 --> 01:07:08,979
gave him a chance,
but he wouldn't go.

575
01:07:09,021 --> 01:07:10,063
Then what?

576
01:07:11,189 --> 01:07:14,735
Fucking, just gave him
a couple of slaps, that's all, man.

577
01:07:16,862 --> 01:07:19,448
He had this fucking big shank, man.
He was mad.

578
01:07:19,531 --> 01:07:21,491
What makes you think
I should believe you?

579
01:07:21,533 --> 01:07:22,868
Fuck it, I couldn't give a shit.

580
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:25,370
- Well you should...
- Oh, fucking hell.

581
01:07:25,454 --> 01:07:28,165
...if you ever want to walk again.

582
01:07:28,206 --> 01:07:30,208
Fuck off!

583
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:31,918
Fuck off.

584
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,295
Fuck.

585
01:07:33,378 --> 01:07:36,548
Oh, fuck.

586
01:07:36,631 --> 01:07:38,091
Oh, fucking wait.

587
01:07:38,133 --> 01:07:39,759
- What the fuck?
- Goodbye, Marky.

588
01:07:39,801 --> 01:07:43,722
No, I got the whole fucking thing
on my phone.

589
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:47,892
- You what?
- Oh fuck. I'm sorry, man.

590
01:07:47,976 --> 01:07:51,855
- We was just retaliating, bruv.
- Where's the phone?

591
01:07:51,896 --> 01:07:53,231
In my pocket.

592
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,364
Go on, make it work.

593
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:26,598
<i>Calm down bruv</i>

594
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:37,150
<i>Right kill him man</i>

595
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:39,902
<i>Kill that pensioner blood</i>

596
01:09:10,141 --> 01:09:13,019
Fuck, I'm sorry.

597
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:17,315
We just meant to shit him up.

598
01:09:20,234 --> 01:09:22,403
It wasn't me that stabbed him.

599
01:09:24,322 --> 01:09:25,740
Who did?

600
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:32,163
So ain't no one warned you about me, no?

601
01:09:32,246 --> 01:09:36,375
- No.
- You think you're a big girl?

602
01:09:36,417 --> 01:09:37,835
Yeah?

603
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,056
Come on, tease me.

604
01:09:51,098 --> 01:09:53,184
Feel my gun.

605
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:21,962
Carl.

606
01:10:22,046 --> 01:10:23,339
What?

607
01:10:27,635 --> 01:10:29,511
Get the fuck out of here.

608
01:10:47,404 --> 01:10:52,576
Get out. He's got a gun.

609
01:10:54,745 --> 01:10:56,079
Who's got a fuckin' gun?

610
01:11:13,972 --> 01:11:15,599
Who's got a fuckin' gun?

611
01:11:15,682 --> 01:11:17,976
Boys, please.

612
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,603
Don't fucking shoot, man.

613
01:11:23,357 --> 01:11:25,817
Wait, please.

614
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:27,277
Fuck.

615
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:43,960
Fuck this.

616
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:47,923
Fucking hell, Carl!
Wait! Fucking hell!

617
01:11:48,632 --> 01:11:50,425
Fucking wait!

618
01:12:18,495 --> 01:12:20,705
Fuck!

619
01:13:26,854 --> 01:13:28,648
Mr Brown, can you hear me?

620
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,281
Do you remember me?
I'm Sergeant Terry Hicock.

621
01:13:37,323 --> 01:13:41,077
I'm sorry, sir, I've got to ask you
a couple of questions, is that OK?

622
01:13:42,912 --> 01:13:45,373
Did you see anyone on the canal tow path?

623
01:13:48,584 --> 01:13:50,878
No. Are you sure?

624
01:13:53,172 --> 01:13:54,548
Er, excuse me?

625
01:13:55,591 --> 01:13:58,552
If you want to interview Mr Brown
then you'll have to come back.

626
01:13:58,636 --> 01:14:00,763
He's not well enough
to answer your questions.

627
01:14:00,805 --> 01:14:02,306
No, of course.

628
01:14:03,849 --> 01:14:06,811
- What exactly is wrong with Mr Brown?
- Emphysema.

629
01:14:06,852 --> 01:14:09,355
For more information
you'll have to speak with the doctor.

630
01:14:10,856 --> 01:14:11,982
Oh, wait.

631
01:14:15,528 --> 01:14:16,529
Here, sorry.

632
01:14:17,988 --> 01:14:19,406
Thank you.

633
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:23,536
So much for our witness.

634
01:14:26,205 --> 01:14:27,957
Where was he found?

635
01:14:38,467 --> 01:14:41,136
Listen, ma'am, we're gonna be late
for this briefing.

636
01:14:43,389 --> 01:14:46,350
Is this exactly
where Mr Brown was found?

637
01:14:46,392 --> 01:14:50,604
Yes, ma'am. Uniform said he had trouble
breathing and couldn't answer questions.

638
01:14:50,646 --> 01:14:52,940
- Did they search him?
- Search him for what?

639
01:14:59,905 --> 01:15:02,157
What do you think he was doing here?

640
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:04,284
Taking a piss. Walking his dog.

641
01:15:10,123 --> 01:15:12,334
I smelt cordite on his coat.

642
01:15:15,837 --> 01:15:19,591
Right, look, I'm sorry, ma'am, but, er...
the Super's briefing started 15 minutes ago

643
01:15:19,675 --> 01:15:21,510
and we're supposed to be there.

644
01:15:42,614 --> 01:15:44,825
Apologies, sir.

645
01:15:44,866 --> 01:15:47,411
I have 13 warrants to execute on the estate.

646
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:49,412
I hope your witness was worth it.

647
01:15:49,454 --> 01:15:52,165
Er, the witness proved, erm, unreliable, sir.

648
01:15:52,207 --> 01:15:54,292
Claims not to have seen anything.

649
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:55,377
Pity.

650
01:15:58,463 --> 01:16:01,883
Sir, I don't think Harry Brown is a witness.

651
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:03,760
I think he's our chief suspect.

652
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:05,136
I'm sorry, I was under the impression

653
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:08,056
uniform found an elderly gentleman
on the tow path.

654
01:16:08,139 --> 01:16:10,517
Yes, that's right,
that's correct, sir.

655
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,852
Mr Brown
is a close friend of Leonard Attwell,

656
01:16:12,894 --> 01:16:16,273
the senior citizen found
stabbed in the pedestrian subway.

657
01:16:16,314 --> 01:16:19,901
It's the same pedestrian subway
where last night's shooting took place

658
01:16:19,985 --> 01:16:24,114
and both victims were questioned
in connection with Mr Attwell's death.

659
01:16:24,155 --> 01:16:25,490
It's too much of a coincidence

660
01:16:25,573 --> 01:16:28,159
that Mister Brown just happened
to be found so close by.

661
01:16:28,243 --> 01:16:29,327
So, what you're telling me is

662
01:16:29,369 --> 01:16:32,706
this escalating violence
is down to a vigilante pensioner?

663
01:16:32,747 --> 01:16:34,165
Yes.

664
01:16:34,249 --> 01:16:36,000
Do you have any evidence to support that?

665
01:16:36,084 --> 01:16:37,919
Not at the moment,
but I'd like to get a warrant

666
01:16:38,002 --> 01:16:41,756
so I can have Mr Brown's clothes
tested for gunfire residue.

667
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,841
Where is Mr Brown?

668
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:46,302
He's in the hospital, sir.
He's having trouble breathing.

669
01:16:46,344 --> 01:16:48,012
Emphysema.

670
01:16:51,599 --> 01:16:54,435
Also, Dean Saunders was found
on that canal stabbed to death.

671
01:16:54,519 --> 01:16:56,980
He too was questioned by myself
and Hicock and then released.

672
01:16:57,021 --> 01:17:00,191
Did you know that Troy Martindale
was shot in his car last night?

673
01:17:00,275 --> 01:17:02,819
Martindale was a major heroin importer.

674
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,822
Two of Martindale's associates
who operate out of Curzon street

675
01:17:05,863 --> 01:17:07,782
were also shot dead a week ago.

676
01:17:07,865 --> 01:17:09,158
Neither of whom you've questioned

677
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,577
in connection with the killing
of this old man in the subway.

678
01:17:11,619 --> 01:17:14,455
Of course, you'd have known all this
if you'd been at the briefing.

679
01:17:14,539 --> 01:17:17,041
He was with the Royal Marines,
stationed in Northern Ireland.

680
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:19,919
I had the MOD
send me his old service record.

681
01:17:19,961 --> 01:17:22,046
Terry, give us a minute, please?

682
01:17:27,635 --> 01:17:30,263
I've had a request from Division.

683
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,098
They're looking for an experienced officer

684
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,976
to head up a major inquiry
into identity theft.

685
01:17:35,059 --> 01:17:38,771
Your background
makes you the perfect candidate.

686
01:17:38,813 --> 01:17:40,940
I've recommended you
and they've accepted.

687
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,694
Take the weekend for yourself, Alice.

688
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:48,948
Good luck.

689
01:19:21,331 --> 01:19:23,208
Fuck off.

690
01:19:27,004 --> 01:19:28,547
Give me your other arm!

691
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:31,174
Oi, fuck off!

692
01:19:31,258 --> 01:19:32,342
Move out.

693
01:19:37,347 --> 01:19:38,765
I'll get you. Come here!

694
01:19:41,101 --> 01:19:46,023
Get on the fucking floor!
Show me your hands!

695
01:19:46,106 --> 01:19:48,692
Fucking, pricks! Fuck off!

696
01:19:48,775 --> 01:19:50,485
Get off me!

697
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:13,568
Visors down!

698
01:21:51,647 --> 01:21:53,733
Mr Brown?

699
01:21:56,485 --> 01:21:58,863
Mr Brown, please.

700
01:21:58,905 --> 01:21:59,947
Mr Brown!

701
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:11,709
Petrol bomb!

702
01:22:11,751 --> 01:22:14,962
Get down, incoming!
Move back!

703
01:23:10,309 --> 01:23:12,394
I'm really sorry.

704
01:23:15,981 --> 01:23:18,025
Do you really think
Mr Emphysema's got it in him

705
01:23:18,108 --> 01:23:20,194
to top a load of hoodies?

706
01:23:23,655 --> 01:23:27,117
I've just spoken to the hospital.

707
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:29,036
He's discharged himself.

708
01:23:31,413 --> 01:23:33,665
Well, we're off the case now,
thanks to you.

709
01:23:39,087 --> 01:23:41,215
I think he's going to the estate.

710
01:23:44,718 --> 01:23:47,930
I think he's going to kill Noel Winters.

711
01:23:48,013 --> 01:23:50,265
Who gives a fuck if he is?
Noel Winters is a cunt.

712
01:23:50,349 --> 01:23:53,644
His dad was a cunt.
One day he's gonna have loads of cunty kids.

713
01:23:53,685 --> 01:23:56,355
As far as I'm concerned,
Harry Brown's doing us a favour.

714
01:24:08,867 --> 01:24:09,993
Come on then.

715
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:47,864
You fucking bastards.

716
01:24:56,122 --> 01:24:57,624
Oh, fucking hell.

717
01:25:02,253 --> 01:25:03,630
Shit!

718
01:25:44,796 --> 01:25:48,925
Sid. It's me. It's Harry.
Open the door, mate.

719
01:25:55,014 --> 01:25:57,517
Move that table,
I want to put him in the corner.

720
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:02,230
That's it.
Get an ambulance.

721
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:07,109
Don't move, son.
He'll be all right.

722
01:26:08,152 --> 01:26:10,655
- Get an ambulance!
- Yeah, I'll, er...

723
01:26:23,834 --> 01:26:25,503
You all right, love?

724
01:26:47,191 --> 01:26:50,277
It's not Northern Ireland, Harry.

725
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:52,780
No, it's not.

726
01:26:54,698 --> 01:26:57,785
Those people
were fighting for something.

727
01:26:58,953 --> 01:27:00,579
For a cause.

728
01:27:01,789 --> 01:27:07,962
To them out there,
this is just entertainment.

729
01:27:10,965 --> 01:27:14,218
But where does it end... hm?

730
01:27:18,889 --> 01:27:23,477
You shoot Noel for what he did to Leonard
and then Sid shoots you?

731
01:27:24,978 --> 01:27:26,814
Sid?

732
01:27:27,856 --> 01:27:29,400
What's Sid got to do with it?

733
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:38,075
Sid Rourke's Noel Winters' uncle.

734
01:28:22,202 --> 01:28:24,955
Not looking too good there,
me old son.

735
01:28:25,038 --> 01:28:27,457
Where's Noel,

736
01:28:27,541 --> 01:28:29,167
Uncle Sid?

737
01:28:51,481 --> 01:28:53,108
Get out here, Noel.

738
01:28:59,239 --> 01:29:00,699
Put that down!

739
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:03,743
Fuck that. This senile old cunt
killed Marky and Carl.

740
01:29:03,785 --> 01:29:05,286
I told you to put it down.

741
01:29:12,502 --> 01:29:13,503
Come on, Harry.

742
01:29:13,586 --> 01:29:17,173
You're not going to shoot a kid
when there's two coppers upstairs, are ye?

743
01:29:17,257 --> 01:29:20,385
- He killed Leonard.
- He swore to me that he didn't.

744
01:29:20,426 --> 01:29:21,970
Now what am I supposed to do?

745
01:29:22,011 --> 01:29:25,140
- He's my sister's boy. He's blood.
- Blood?

746
01:29:27,183 --> 01:29:30,353
Do you want to see Leonard's blood?

747
01:29:30,395 --> 01:29:33,565
These fucking animals

748
01:29:33,606 --> 01:29:37,026
filmed the whole thing
on their fucking phones.

749
01:29:49,706 --> 01:29:52,542
All right.

750
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:55,753
I defended him when I shouldn't have,
but I can't let you shoot him, Harry.

751
01:29:55,837 --> 01:29:57,463
I can't have that.

752
01:30:08,391 --> 01:30:10,726
Are you all right, Harry?

753
01:30:16,566 --> 01:30:17,859
Are you OK, me old mate?

754
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:00,860
Officers need assistance.

755
01:31:00,943 --> 01:31:04,655
Armed response, come in.
Over.

756
01:31:04,697 --> 01:31:06,198
What are you drinking there, love?

757
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:08,617
Eh?

758
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:10,077
You fucking slag.

759
01:31:10,119 --> 01:31:12,872
Fucking dirty bitch, look at me.

760
01:31:12,955 --> 01:31:14,415
Look up.
Fucking sket.

761
01:31:14,456 --> 01:31:17,835
I told you I'd fuck you, didn't I?
You fucking cunt.

762
01:31:26,385 --> 01:31:27,386
You see this?

763
01:31:27,469 --> 01:31:29,179
This is the sort of thing
I'm talking about.

764
01:31:29,221 --> 01:31:31,307
It's not a fucking game.

765
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:34,727
Now in future,
you do as you are fucking told!

766
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:36,103
Yeah?

767
01:31:46,488 --> 01:31:48,740
OK. We do them in here.

768
01:31:48,824 --> 01:31:49,867
Dump them on the street.

769
01:31:49,908 --> 01:31:52,828
That way it'll look like
they got caught in the shit storm.

770
01:31:55,497 --> 01:31:57,916
He's half done already.

771
01:32:31,783 --> 01:32:35,412
See that?
It's nice and easy.

772
01:32:39,708 --> 01:32:41,668
Turnover, you fucking slag.

773
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:43,545
Come on.

774
01:32:46,882 --> 01:32:48,175
Look at me.

775
01:32:50,135 --> 01:32:52,262
Go on, fucking look at me.

776
01:32:53,555 --> 01:32:55,891
I'll be the last fucking thing
you see when you die.

777
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:02,939
Go on, struggle.
Struggle. Go on.

778
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,530
Go on.

779
01:33:44,606 --> 01:33:47,066
Go on. Do me a favour.

780
01:33:47,108 --> 01:33:49,444
Pull the trigger.

781
01:33:52,113 --> 01:33:53,990
<i>Do you have a clear target?</i>

782
01:33:58,536 --> 01:34:00,079
Do it.

783
01:34:00,121 --> 01:34:02,081
Please.

784
01:34:35,573 --> 01:34:37,700
Following the findings
of the enquiry

785
01:34:37,742 --> 01:34:40,202
concerning the aftermath
of Operation Blue Jay.

786
01:34:41,245 --> 01:34:44,040
The ruling of the committee
commend not only myself,

787
01:34:44,081 --> 01:34:46,417
but other members of the squad.

788
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,086
In particular,
Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock,

789
01:34:50,171 --> 01:34:53,382
who having tragically lost his life
in the line of duty

790
01:34:53,424 --> 01:34:57,345
has been singled out for
the Queen's Gallantry Medal for Bravery,

791
01:34:57,428 --> 01:35:01,515
along with fellow officer
Detective Inspector Alice Frampton.

792
01:35:01,599 --> 01:35:03,893
Can you confirm
or deny the rumours

793
01:35:03,934 --> 01:35:08,189
that a number of deaths on the estate
are attributed to a vigilante?

794
01:35:08,272 --> 01:35:11,942
Both the findings of the committee
and the police investigation

795
01:35:12,026 --> 01:35:14,278
have found no evidence
to support such a theory.

796
01:35:14,361 --> 01:35:19,200
And, can I just say
on a personal note, Martin,

797
01:35:19,283 --> 01:35:20,951
that type of wild speculation

798
01:35:21,035 --> 01:35:23,412
undermines the work of the police force

799
01:35:23,454 --> 01:35:26,999
and ultimately does a disservice
to members of the public who support it.

800
01:35:30,044 --> 01:35:32,129
Now, as I made clear many months ago

801
01:35:32,212 --> 01:35:35,841
we operate and apply a zero-tolerance policy

802
01:35:35,883 --> 01:35:37,843
with reference to criminal activity

803
01:35:37,885 --> 01:35:41,263
involving firearms
and the distribution of drugs.

804
01:35:41,305 --> 01:35:42,765
<i>Most important</i>

805
01:35:42,806 --> 01:35:45,100
<i>the findings
suggest that crime on the estate</i>

806
01:35:45,142 --> 01:35:48,062
<i>has declined by almost 30 per cent</i>

807
01:35:48,145 --> 01:35:50,439
<i>With continued help from members
of the community</i>

808
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:52,941
<i>we hope to eradicate the criminal element</i>

809
01:35:52,983 --> 01:35:58,072
<i>who have long since blighted
the lives of the silent majority</i>
