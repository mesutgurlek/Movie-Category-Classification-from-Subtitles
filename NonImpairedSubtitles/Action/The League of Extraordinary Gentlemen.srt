00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,900
He's in that passage.

2
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,800
He's over there.

3
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Lay back, he'll come right into us.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
What in God's name is that?

5
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Halt!

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Get outta here!

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,300
Halt!

8
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,300
In the name of the law...

9
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,900
How in the hell do you stop this thing?

10
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,900
I said halt!

11
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,800
Stop!

12
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,300
In here.

13
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Careful mate.

14
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,900
There's a man inside.

15
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Round them up.

16
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Leave one alive to tell the tale.

17
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Kill the rest.

18
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,000
Such treasures.

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Treasures...yes.

20
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Some worth more than others.

Those are your servants, sir.

What do you want?

28
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000

There. That gentleman in the back.

39
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Do I have the pleasure of addressing Allan Quartermain?

40
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Ahhh...Yes you do sir. Indeed, you do.

41
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,200
You're not what I expected.

42
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,400
Well, I presume you're another traveller,

43
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,900
who got it in his head to sample the Dark Continent,

44
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,900
and while you're at it, track down old Allan Quartermain
and have him tell his ventures.

45
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,500
Well...

46
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,700
Well, have a seat, sir.

47
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,700
If you'll fill my glass, Bruce. A double.

48
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,300
I know how to regale you with how
I found King Solomon's mines. I could relate...

49
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,800
It is not your past that interests me.

50
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,500
Ahhhh?

51
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,700
My name is Sanderson Reed.

52
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,200
I'm a representative of Her Majesty's British Government.

53
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,000
The Empire needs you.

54
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But the question is...do I need the Empire?

55
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,000
Perhaps I should toddle off, Allan?

56
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,800
Yes, of course, Nigel. You toddle off.

57
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,300
I'll be toddling.

58
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Nigel is useful for keeping the story seekers at bay.

59
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm Quartermain.

60
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The Empire is in peril.

61
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,400
You're probably too young to know,
but the empire is always in some kind of peril.

62
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,500
We need you to lead a team of unique men
like yourself to combat this threat.

63
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,700
Regale me.

64
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,300
There is a great unrest.

65
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,000
Countries set at each other's throats baying for blood.

66
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,100
It's a powder keg.

67
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,100
The trouble of which I speak could set a match to the whole thing...War.

68
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
With whom, exactly?

69
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Everyone. A world war!

70
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,200
That notion makes you sweat?

71
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,300
Heavens, man! Doesn't it, you!

72
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,300
This is Africa, dear boy. Sweating is what we do.

73
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,900
Where is your sense of patriotism?

74
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,900
God save the queen!

75
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,900
God save the queen!
(God save her! God bless her!)

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,300
That's about as patriotic as we get around here.

77
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,400
But you're Allan Quartermain.

78
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Stories of your exploits have thrilled English boys for decades.

79
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,500
That I know.

80
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,500
And Nigel has done a great job of reminding me.

81
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,600
But, with each past exploit I've lost friends.

82
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,100
White men and black, and much more.

83
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,200
And I am not the man I once was.

84
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,600
(-It sure was a long walk.)
(-Exactly.)

85
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
Are you Mr. Quartermain?

86
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Yes, indeed, sir.

87
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Wrong Quartermain!

88
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Get down!

89
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,600
They're indestructible!

90
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
No, just armor plated.

91
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,900
Automatic blazes...who in God's name has automatic rifles!?

92
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,900
That's unsporting. Probably Belgian.

93
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,200
Wicked waste.

94
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Look out!

95
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Good old Britannia.

96
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,100
Wasn't there another one of these buggers?

97
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,700
Mr. Quartermain.

98
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Bruce. Matilda.

99
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Their friend might have some information.

100
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,100
But, he's so far away.

101
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,300
There. I thought he was.

102
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,300
God, I hate getting older.

103
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Did you mean to just wound him?

104
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Obviously.

105
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Stop him. I need information.

106
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,700
Lucky poison.

107
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,700
You may have no love for the Empire, but I know you love Africa.

108
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,100
A war in Europe will spread to its colonies.

109
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,700
It appears the war has arrived.

110
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,700
Very well, Reed.

111
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,800
I'm in.

112
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,200
Excellent.

113
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Pack for an English summer.

114
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,000
You made good time getting here.

115
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Not as good as Phileas Fogg around the world in 80 days.

116
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,600
Where are we going?

117
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Australia?

118
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,900
And here we are, sir.

119
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't like theatrics.

120
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
After Africa's felt, London weather
isn't helping your mood as I see.

121
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Identify yourself.

122
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,300
I'm known by many names, Mr. Quartermain.

123
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,600
My underlings call me "Sir".

124
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,800
My superiors call me "M".

125
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
"M"?

126
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,900
Just "M".

127
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,200
I must say the delight is mine...

128
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Meeting so notable a recruit to this newest
generation of the league of extraordinary gentlemen.

129
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,500
League of what?

130
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
There have been other times when a danger upon the world
has required the services of singular individuals.

131
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, very curious.

132
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,400
This museum is full of the curious.

133
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Allan Quartermain.
Captain Nimo.

134
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,300
I know of Mr. Quartermain.

135
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,800
And I know of you, Captain.

136
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,600
Rumor has it that you are a pirate.

137
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,900
I'd prefer a less provocative title.

138
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,900
I'm sure you would.

139
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,800
Gentlemen. Please.

140
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,100
Nations are striking at nations.

141
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Every attack marked by the use of highly advanced weaponry.

142
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,800
We've discovered all these attacks are through the work of one man,

143
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,000
who calls himself the "Phantom".

144
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,600
Very operatic.

145
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,500
And what's in it for him?

146
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,100
Profit.

147
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,300
Those machines are his creations,

148
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,400
the work of scientists he holds prisoned.

149
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,300
These attacks have every nation
clamoring for the very weapons that it'd sell them.

150
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,600
Then, it's a race for arms.

151
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,000
And millions will perish.

152
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,700
There's one last chance to avert war.

153
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,500
The leaders of Europe are to meet secretly in Venice.

154
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,500
And you believe that this phantom will attack that conference?

155
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,100
If he can fight it.

156
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,400
We need a team to get to Venice and stop him.

157
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,800
This team will consist of 6 members.

158
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,700
You have 4 days.

159
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,000
Four days to get to Venice?

160
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,300
It's impossible.

161
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,400
Let me worry about that.

162
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,800
Well, well, extraordinary gentlemen indeed.

163
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,200
One of them is late.

164
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,100
Parker, chemist.

165
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Oh, chemist? Do we get to blow something up, then?

166
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,700
My eye sight must be worse than I thought.

167
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,700
No, your eye sight's fine.

168
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,500
No games, M.

169
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Some time ago a talented, although misguided, man of science

170
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
discovered the means to become invisible.

171
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Yes, I recall the tale, but didn't he die?

172
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,000
Well yes, he did, but his process didn't.

173
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You see, I stole it, and here I stand for all to see.

174
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
Is this some parlor game?

175
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The ladies. Easy now Allan.

176
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,400
I'm feeling a bit of a draft in my nether regions.

177
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,200
And I must say, it is quite refreshing.

178
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,700
Allow me to introduce myself.

179
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Rodney Skinner, Gentleman thief.

180
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Now, invisibility would be a boom to my work.

181
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,800
For you can imagine, it was my own doing.

182
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Once you're invisible, it bloody hard to turn back.

183
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,800
He finally caught it.

184
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
And they'll provide an antidote.

185
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,900
That is, if I'm a good boy.

186
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,400
And are you a good boy?

187
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Well, I guess you'll find out, won't you?

188
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
Am I late?

189
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
A woman's prerogative, Mrs. Harker.

190
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Please tell me this is Harker's wife...with a sick note.

191
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Sick would be a mild understatement.

192
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,600
My husband's been dead for years.

193
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Gentelmen, Mrs. Willamina Harker.

194
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,600
Mina's prime acquaintance with a reluctant(ly) member may prove useful.

195
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
I'm waiting to be impressed.

196
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,600
The fate of the world is at stake.

197
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,900
There are still 2 more members to recruit.

198
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
The clock has turned, gentlemen.

199
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,800
Kicking out already?

200
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,800
A moment ago was sharing and giggles.

201
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,400
What in God's name is that?

202
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,300
I call it an automobile.

203
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,700
Yes, but what is it?

204
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,900
The future Gentlemen.

205
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,400
The future?

206
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,900
This is my first mate.

207
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Call me Ishmael. Please.

208
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So, how did they get you?

209
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,700
It's none of your business.

210
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,700
You're a little tense, Mr. Q.

211
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,700
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure danger in the way I do.

212
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,000
And I imagine you with quite a library Mr. Quartermain.

213
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,400
All those books you must've read me by looking at the covers.

214
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,400
I've had women along on past exploits,

215
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
and found them to be at best a distraction.

216
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,600
Do I distract you?

217
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,600
My dear girl, I've buried 2 wives and many lovers,

218
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,100
and I'm in no mood for more either.

219
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,300
-You can send them my way ?
-Skinner, shut up.

220
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,600
[East London Docks]

221
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,000
Should I wait, Captain?

222
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No, bring my lady to me.

223
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,800
This is a charming spot.

224
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Jack, the Ripper lived here!

225
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,700
Good evening

226
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Mr. Dorian Gray?

227
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,300
I am indeed.

228
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,800
We came by way of M.

229
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Um, M for mystery.

230
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,000
Well, I told him what I'm telling you.

231
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,500
I'm not interested.

232
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Dorian.

233
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Mina?

234
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Charming decor.

235
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,000
Ah, you're missing a picture Mr. Gray.

236
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,500
And you don't miss a thing, do you, Mr. Quartermain?

237
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Oh, sometimes.

238
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,100
Scotch anyone?

239
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,600
Please...help yourself.

240
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Don't let it ruin your makeup.

241
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,900
I'm impressed Mr. Gray.
You take Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.

242
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes, well, I've seen too much in my life to shock easily.

243
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Although I must say I was surprised to see you again.

244
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,200
When our last parting was such sweet sorrow?

245
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,100
Ah, so you're nothing more than an enticement.

246
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Nevertheless, your presence intrigues me.

247
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,400
They say you're indestructible Quartermain.

248
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Well, a witch doctor did bless me once.

249
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,300
I had saved his village.

250
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,300
He said Africa would never allow me to die.

251
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
But you're not in Africa now.

252
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,800
No.

253
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,800
I confess some curiosity of what the files say about Mr. Gray.

254
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,400
We, all of us, have a useful trade in this endeavor.

255
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,700
A hunter.

256
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,900
A scientist.

257
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,800
Even Skinner has stealth.

258
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,900
Cheers.

259
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,700
What of you?

260
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,200
I have experience.

261
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Gray and I have met before.

262
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,300
Many years ago at Eaton College.

263
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,300
A lecture no doubt. You're the nation's hero.

264
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,100
Dorian the eagerly listening boy.

265
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Quite the reverse.

266
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,100
It was Gray visiting Eaton. And I was the boy.

267
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,100
What is it?

268
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,600
Gray?

269
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,800
They're not mine.

270
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,800
They're mine.

271
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,900
First meetings usually warrant introductions.

272
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,600
Of course.

273
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,500
I am the phantom.

274
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
You are the League of so called extraordinary gentlemen.

275
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,700
Introductions made.

276
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Oh, and I'm scarred, Mr. Quartermain, not blind.

277
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Drop the gun.

278
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,700
Your mission is to stop me.

279
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,400
That of course I cannot permit.

280
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,400
So I give to all a special one time invitation.

281
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,300
Join me.

282
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,900
Do you think we'll help start a war that will consume the planet?

283
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,800
While you profit from your arms race?

284
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,800
I cannot deny that fortunes that are made in war.

285
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Imagine the riches a world war will yield.

286
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,500
He's not wrong.

287
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Speak for yourself.

288
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:47,700
Draw your pistol.

289
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,700
I walk a different path.

290
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Run, James.

291
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Night night.

292
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Dorian.

293
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,400
What are you?

294
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm complicated.

295
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,300
Damn.

296
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,300
I thought I was special.

297
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,400
You're invulnerable to harm.

298
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,100
I don't like to boast.

299
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,500
What happened to Willamina?

300
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Oh, she probably hip deep in some sort of trouble.

301
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,400
Don't be such an alarmist Mr. Q.

302
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,400
And my hips are none of your business.

303
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,700
Shoot. Go on.

304
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,000
I guessed as much that they would do anything to protect you.

305
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Ithink that's your biggest mistake,

306
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,200
thinking that I need them to protect me.

307
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,900
Extraordinary.

308
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,100
Boy, they told me European women had funny ways.

309
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,100
You missed a spot.

310
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,200
Excuse me.

311
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,300
-And you are?
-Special Agent Sawyer.

312
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,200
The American Secret Service.

313
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,400
Then America is aware of the situation?

314
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Well, if war starts in Europe
how long is it going to take to cross the Atlantic?

315
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,700
I followed you.

316
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,600
I knocked out a straggler and I took his place.

317
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,800
Very noble.

318
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,900
But this is a private party and you're not invited.

319
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,600
Actually, Dorian has declined.

320
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,000
So we are one shy of a full deck.

321
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
On the contrary, the battle was just the spur I needed.

322
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,600
That and the thrill of a friendship renewed.

323
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,900
Hm.

324
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,900
So you're not needed.

325
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,800
Winchester.
That's right.

326
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,000
It's modified. American style.

327
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,400
American style shooting too.

328
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,800
Well, whatever it takes.

329
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,800
If you like it, I brought two.

330
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,900
You're in.

331
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,000
So, what's the next port of call?

332
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,100
Paris.

333
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,800
Just one last member to recruit.

334
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,500
Capture is more of the word.

335
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,700
And it will be quite a hunt.

336
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,600
You make him sound like some kind of animal.

337
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Of, speaking thus Mrs. Harker, your conduct a moment ago.

338
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Indeed. We were all a quiver of curiosity.

339
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Well...

340
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,700
My husband was Jonathan Harker.

341
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Together with a professor named Van Housin we fought a dangerous evil.

342
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,100
It had a name...Dracula.

343
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,900
He was a Transylvanian.

344
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,300
Hmmmm...European?

345
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,300
One of those radicals newspapers left to report on?

346
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,600
I don't know, Mr. Skinner.

347
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Is vampiric sucking blood a radical behavior?

348
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Ahhh...our transportation is forthcoming.

349
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
A boat?

350
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,200
It travels on water if that's what you mean.

351
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,100
And beneath it!

352
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Behold. Nautilus, the sword of the ocean.

353
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,500
Next stop, Paris.

354
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't see what we need a big monkey for.

355
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Well, this big monkey has terrorized the louvres for months.

356
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Imagine the mayhem he'll give the enemy, huh.

357
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,400
Missed.

358
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,400
I'm not trying to hit him.

359
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Turn left, Mr. Hyde.

360
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Make him turn left, boy.

361
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,900
If you can't do it with one bullet then don't do it at all.

362
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,100
He's doubled back.

363
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Precisely. Come on.

364
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,700
Look out.

365
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,600
That was naughty.

366
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,800
Thanks.

367
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,300
Eye's open boy.

368
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Can't protect you all the time.

369
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,100
He's afraid.

370
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,100
I can't smell anything.

371
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Perfect. Welcome aboard Mr. Hyde.

372
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,100
This hunt is too dangerous for a woman.

373
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Even for such as you. Leave it to me.

374
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Oh God.

375
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,300
Hello, Dorian.

376
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,300
The great white hunter's bagged his prize.

377
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,600
Or the prize bagged him.

378
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,000
I've got him.

379
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Stay back. If you value your life.

380
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,100
Ow! You scratched me.

381
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,100
Better me than him.

382
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Well, this is nice.

383
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,500
Mr. Hyde, you've done terrible things in England.

384
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,500
So terrible that you fled the country.

385
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,700
And I'm ashamed to say that her majesty's government
is willing to offer you amnesty in return for your services.

386
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,700
You want to go home.

387
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,700
Home. Home is where the heart is, that's what they say.

388
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,700
And I have been missing London so.

389
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,700
Its sorrow is as sweet to me as a rare wine.

390
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,900
I'm yours.

391
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,100
Don't be afraid.

392
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,500
Who says I'm afraid?

393
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,500
You. You stink of fear.

394
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,200
Quite the parlor trick.

395
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,200
You wait till you see my next one.

396
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Dr. Jackyll at your service.

397
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,300
So, the league is set.

398
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,800
So is the date for the conference.

399
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,900
We have three days.

400
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,900
Three days? Can this canoe do that?

401
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,600
You underestimate the nautilus.

402
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,200
You underestimate her greatly.

403
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,900
She's out of your league.

404
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,400
Mina.

405
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Don't flatter yourself, Dorian.

406
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Fortune rewards the bold.

407
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,100
If you require any help during the voyage Mrs. Harder, just let me know.

408
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,500
I'm curious how you think you could assist me, Agent Sawyer.

409
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Heavy lifting.

410
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,900
Will that matter, I'm a useful kind of guy.

411
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You're sweet,

412
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,800
And you're young.

413
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Neither traits that I hold in high regard.

414
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,500
The solar panels are fully charged.

415
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,500
We'll be diving in a moment.

416
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,400
Mr. Quartermain,

417
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,200
Mr. Jackyll,

418
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,300
Mr. Skinner.

419
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,800
Captain.

420
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Nimo.

421
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,000
The plans phantom stole from the bank of England.

422
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
These are copies.

423
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Da Vinci's blueprints of Venice.

424
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Its foundations and waterways.

425
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So he'll attack the conference by sea.

426
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,500
Easy Allan.

427
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Skinner. I want you dressed at all times,

428
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,700
or it's my foot up your ass.

429
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,600
Dinner is served Mr. Quartermain.

430
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,500
I can offer a jacket if you require.

431
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,300
Oh, thank you, no.

432
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,300
But thank you for your contribution so far.

433
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
I may have been overly rude earlier when I called you a pirate.

434
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,100
And I may been overly charitable when I said I wasn't.

435
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,800
But I try to live in the now, where the ghosts of old wrongs do not abide.

436
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,900
What about you?

437
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,800
Oh, I don't believe in ghosts, although I've seen my share.

438
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Your past haunts you.

439
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Vanity, pride, mistakes...

440
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,100
cost me someone dear.

441
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,900
So now you throw yourself in harm's way.

442
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Old tigers sensing the end are the most fierce.

443
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,200
And they go down fighting.

444
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,100
An hour left Captain. That's all I'm saying.

445
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,700
Powder?

446
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,400
You think sabotage?

447
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,400
We ain't that far off course.

448
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,800
Pull out.

449
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,300
Did you want something?

450
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,300
No. I was just wondering why you signed up for all this.

451
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,000
Nimo told me you hate the British Empire.

452
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,600
They called and I answered.

453
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,500
But that ain't all of it, is it?

454
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Pull out.

455
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,300
Sorry I asked.

456
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
A few years ago the British approached me with a mission for the queen and country.

457
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,100
That sounds like the morning ride to work for you, I'd imagine.

458
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,900
I signed on without hesitation.

459
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,200
I even took my son along.

460
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,200
I led, my son followed.

461
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,100
He died in my arms.

462
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,500
After that I washed my hands of England, the empire,
the legend of Allan bloody Quartermain.

463
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Now, would you like to learn how to shoot?

464
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,600
I can already.

465
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,100
I saw. Very American.

466
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,100
Firing off bullets and hoping they hit the target.

467
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Sawyer, I'm talking about hitting the ace.

468
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,100
At 900 yards.

469
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Try.

470
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,600
Easy. Easy.

471
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Pull out.

472
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,700
Aim.

473
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,800
That's easy.

474
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,900
Allow for wind, target movement.

475
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,100
Yeah, that's easy too.

476
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,600
This is the part that's not.

477
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,600
You have to feel the shot.

478
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,400
Take your time with it.

479
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,000
You have all the time you need.

480
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
All the time in the world.

481
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,300
Take...your...Too soon.

482
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,300
But that was bloody close,

483
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,900
and at 500 yards too.

484
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,800
Again.

485
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Pull out.

486
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,600
Did you teach your son to shot like this?

487
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Quatermane?

488
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That's Kallie, the goddess of death.

489
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,100
If he worships death, can we trust him?

490
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,700
He's not the one I'm worried about.

491
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,000
Mina.

492
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm identifying a powder that Nimo found.

493
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,000
Magnesium phosphorous.

494
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Photographers use it to create a flash.

495
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,400
A camera perhaps.

496
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,400
It appears as though someone wishes to capture the vessel's secrets.

497
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,500
I was surprised you ultimately joined the league.

498
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,800
I mean to undo the flaws of my character.

499
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,900
I want to face my demons.

500
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,900
And what do you know of demons?

501
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Do you recall a space on the wall of my house?

502
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,100
A picture was missing.

503
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,100
Although the picture is my portrait,

504
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,800
I doubt you would recognize the face upon it.

505
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Every year that passes, my portrait ages instead of me.

506
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,900
When did you last see it?

507
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,600
I dare not look upon it myself.

508
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,600
The magic of the painting would be undone.

509
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,500
Nightcap?

510
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,500
I'm not much of a drinker.

511
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,100
Just a small one then.

512
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,800
How clumsy of me.

513
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,800
We don't want blood everywhere. Do we?

514
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,400
No...not the blood.

515
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,000
Yes, Henry,

516
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,900
look but don't touch.

517
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,800
Huh huh...that's your way.

518
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,200
Just shut up!

519
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,600
I won't trip again.

520
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,600
Tripped?

521
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,800
You've known what it was about each time you drank the formula.

522
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,200
Liar. I'm a good man. A good man.

523
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,600
Who's lying now?

524
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,400
You want it even more than you want her.

525
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,100
No!

526
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,700
You can't shut me up forever.

527
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:43,800
Drink the elixir!

528
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,800
No!

529
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,300
She barely even looks at you.

530
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,100
Be quiet.

531
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,100
She looked at me.

532
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,800
Contain your evil, doctor.

533
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,300
I'll not have the brute free upon my ship.

534
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,600
Must I take drastic steps?

535
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,100
I am in control.

536
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,200
I very much doubt it.

537
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,000
Your talk is well and good, sir,

538
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
but your past is far from laudable.

539
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,900
Let me out.

540
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,500
If I didn't know better I'd swear I already had.

541
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,800
One of the vials is missing.

542
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,200
Oh God.

543
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,700
So it's clear,

544
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,700
with Da Vinci's blueprints and enough explosives

545
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,600
he could set a bomb that would blow Venice's foundations to rubble.

546
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,400
He's going to sink the whole city.

547
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,400
Yes, and spark off a world war.

548
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm afraid that is not the sum of the problems.

549
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,400
Skinner...he's taken a vile of my formula.

550
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,900
Are you sure?

551
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,200
Who else?

552
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,200
You've seen the way the sneaky bloke operates.

553
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,400
[Venice]

554
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,100
It's the carnival.

555
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,100
My God. We must locate that bomb.

556
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,500
We can go no further, Captain.

557
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,500
All ahead...stop.

558
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,100
Deploy the divers beneath the city.

559
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,500
The explosives must be found.

560
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Aye aye sir.

561
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,900
This bomb, it could be anywhere.

562
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,100
What about Skinner?

563
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,100
I'd be alert for his treachery.

564
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,200
Bloody carnival.

565
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,100
God, I feared the worst.

566
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:17,100
Sorry, you still have...

567
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,500
The buildings are falling like dominoes.

568
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,100
We're too late.

569
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,700
There must be more than one bomb.

570
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,800
Nimo.

571
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,100
The bombs are at the city's center.

572
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,000
We must take out one key building.

573
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,600
Yes. Get ahead of the raps and take out one key building.

574
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,000
We can interrupt the chain of destruction.

575
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,100
With a beacon we can place the exact coordinates.

576
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,300
I can launch a rocket and take out the domino effect.

577
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,800
That's ridiculous.

578
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
We'd never get there in time.

579
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,000
That leaves no room for error.

580
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,100
But I tell you it could work.

581
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,900
What are you talking about. Gray's right.

582
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,900
I'm an mortal sir, not a gazelle. How can we outrun this!

583
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,600
Care for a spin?

584
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,700
Come on Jackyll, get in.

585
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,900
I need coordinates.

586
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,100
Can you track this thing?

587
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,600
Of course.

588
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,300
Good, then the car will be your target.

589
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,600
Launch when you see the flare.

590
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,600
Right.

591
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,700
Jackyll, come on, we'll need Hyde.

592
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,700
No. Hyde will never use me again.

593
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Then what good are you?

594
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,700
Straight ahead, then turn left.

595
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,100
No, no. Take a right after the canal port.

596
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:52,100
We have to turn left to get ahead of the dominoes.

597
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,000
Snipers.

598
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,100
Duck.

599
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,100
Damn, Skinner, he must've told them we were coming.

600
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Dorian.

601
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,600
Can't get a clear shot.

602
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,600
Take the wheel.

603
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,000
Sit down, you buffoon.

604
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,600
I don't know how to drive this bloody thing.

605
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,700
Sit down.

606
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,700
Ok, got it.

607
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,700
Save your bullets, these men are mine.

608
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,600
Did you see that?

609
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,100
Did you see what she just did?

610
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,900
It's a gauntlet!

611
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,900
The vampire lady has us covered.

612
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,700
The collapse has reached the carnival captain.

613
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,100
Time's running out.

614
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,400
Tune the prism to the car's frequency.

615
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,000
The rockets must be ready to launch.

616
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Aye aye captain.

617
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,400
Come on, Sawyer, come on.

618
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,600
Captain, we must pull out.

619
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,600
No, we stay and do our job.

620
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,300
Remember the flare.

621
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,500
I'm off.

622
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,200
What?

623
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,200
Don't forget, you're the target.
