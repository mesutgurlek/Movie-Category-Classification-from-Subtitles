00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,150
present

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,270
Languedoc, 1342

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,430
Since the time immemorial,

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,430
the knights who called themselves
the "Warriors of Light"

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,910
have been chasing witches
and sorcerers

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,870
who torture humans.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,190
But one day,

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,150
their path was barred
by the Warriors of Darkness.

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,270
And no one wanted to make way.

13
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,310
And the battle started,

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,270
bloody and merciless.

15
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,310
As the battle reached heaven,

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,270
Great Gesser saw they were
equal,

17
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,430
and if the battle is not stopped,

18
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,390
everyone perishes.

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,070
So he stopped the battle.

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,590
So the Forces of Light

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,510
and the Forces of Darkness

22
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,830
signed the Armistice.

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,430
And it was said that from that
time on neither good nor evil

24
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,190
can be made without
mutual consent.

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,830
And it was said there
shall be the Day Watch

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,990
to watch over
the Forces of Light.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,510
And it was said there
shall be the Night Watch

28
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,110
to watch over the Forces
of Darkness.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,590
Yet in a thousand years,

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,310
the Great Other will come

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,990
and take the side of Evil,

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,950
and the world will be plunged
into the Darkness.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,110
Hi, I've come to answer the ad.

34
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,590
- Have you brought the photo?
- Yes.

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,550
Hold a sec.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,950
Give it to me.

37
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,270
Come in.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,830
Moscow, 1992

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,790
The room's not done,
step in the kitchen.

40
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,110
You sit down, sonny.

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,510
Don't worry.

42
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,470
Don't pay any mind that I call you
sons. You're all sons to me.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,990
- The story is...
- I know your story, Anton.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,310
Anton and Irina, 6.6.90

45
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,190
You loved her and took
care of her,

46
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,110
and 2 days ago she packed
everything up

47
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,070
and abandoned you for
another man.

48
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,110
See, I know everything.

49
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,310
I have it from my granny
and my mom.

50
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,510
This is a family trait.

51
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,110
- We'll do everything now.
- I don't get it.

52
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,430
What's to get here?

53
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,390
She'll have a child.

54
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,590
Not yours.

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,830
Don't be afraid, I'll get her
back in no time.

56
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,710
But the child will drag her to
the rival father.

57
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,670
To poison the innocent fetus

58
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,110
is a great sin.

59
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,070
So, to get the wife back
one should poison the child?

60
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,190
Don't be scared. I'll clap
my hands and it'll die.

61
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,110
And the wife will throw it
away, dead.

62
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,310
- You'll take that sin upon you.
- Well, I don't...

63
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,710
Will you take it?

64
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,510
- The sin?
- Yes.

65
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,470
- I will.
- It's a deal then.

66
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,550
Yes.

67
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,910
It won't hurt. We'll do...

68
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,870
...everything to you.

69
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,390
Don't worry.

70
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,550
People have to be helped.

71
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,910
Don't be afraid, everything's
sterile with me.

72
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,310
- Drink it.
- Are you kidding?

73
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,190
- It's a...
- Are the elements important?

74
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,510
Or the effect?

75
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,470
- The effect.
- Then drink it.

76
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,470
Is anything wrong?

77
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,110
We have to part.

78
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,070
Good boy.

79
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,310
So, we'll start the part 2.

80
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,270
We'll deal with the cub.

81
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,870
Red water, alien woe,

82
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,190
rotten seed

83
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,190
and evil weed.

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,430
Gone thing that used to be.

85
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,390
Come hither, anguish.

86
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,550
There's no running away
from these words...

87
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,710
Don't jerk, you witch!

88
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,910
Get her hands.

89
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,870
Don't let her
clap her hands!

90
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,260
Help!

91
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,470
Go away.

Using the live bait, coppers!

94
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,470
- We'll process you.
- I'm not guilty.

95
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,430
This will be decided by the
court martial.

96
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,590
Darya Leonidovna,
you stand accused

97
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,510
of breaching the contract,

98

"conspiracy to assassinate".

100
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,270
- Your job and position?
- I work from home.

101
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,590
- Are you licensed?
- Yes.

102
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,190
Who licensed you? Cooperators,
ruined the country.

103
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,150
Who are you?

104
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,590
Does he see us?

105
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,550
Yes, he does.
He is the Other.

106
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,670

To have good trolling

118
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,390
you need the right spot
and time for fishing.

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,950
A minnow can get entangled
in underwater snags...

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,870
Yes. The sun'll be setting
soon.

123
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,070
It'll be a cold night.
Put on warm clothes.

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,070
Omens and signs are at fault
that guide him.

134
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,310
Any word is perceived
as an order.

- Where to?

137
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,510
The main thing is
not to miss him.

138

I've run out of this shit.

Why are you so early?

00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,790
I'll be right back.

155
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,870
Hi there, neighbor.

156
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,110
Hi, dad.

157
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,070
I told you not to bring anyone.

158
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,150
It's still warm.

159
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,590
Is it pig's?

160
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,550
Human stomach is exactly
like pig's.

161
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,510
You know, they even make

We like you very much.

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,390
- Who?
- Our family. Me and Kostya.

167
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,470
Why did you bring him?

168
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,190
He became like us.

169
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,910
No, Kostya, he's the Light One.

170
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,870
The Light Ones drink blood
only under one circumstance.

171
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,390
When they hunt our likes.

172
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,310
Ilyukha!

173
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,710
- What?
- He still doesn't call.

174
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,670
- Dial him again.
- He won't answer.

175
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,390
- Why doesn't he?
- I'll call again.

176
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,430
Where is this villain
hiding himself?

177
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,390
He's underground, prob'ly.

178
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,950
Come to me.

179
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,950
Where are you?

180
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,150
Do you feel that rotten, bro?

181
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,950
I'll chew your ear off.

182
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,470
Come hither.

183
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,670
Why do you push me?

184
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,590
With your specs on.

185
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,830
You should go to work,
bloodsuckers!

186
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,790
SVIBLOVO

187
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,950
I'm sorry.

188
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,470
Sr. Lt. Somov. Your
documents please.

189
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,710
Anton Gorodetsky.

190
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,990
Take your glasses off.

191
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,990
- Are you drunk or what?
- Drunk on blood.

192
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,590
Drunk all right...

193
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,430
Drunk

194
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,590
Drunk and being rowdy,
Anton.

195
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,550
Freeze! Get him.

196
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,150
You drink piss for sure.

197
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,150
Go home.

198
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,510
I've got you, Anton.
Sviblovo, Studyonaya St.

199
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,430
What's the number, Anton?

200
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,710
- What's wrong?
- I lost him.

201
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,710
Look at the number.
Don't switch the phone off.

202
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,430
C'mon, let's go.

203
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,390
Got to lose some weight.
Let's go.

204
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,670
Go on, drink him.

205
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,510
I can't.

206
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,470
Wait, come here.

207
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,670
Take a bite.

208
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,390
Boy, where are you?

209
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,870
The Night Watch.
All step out of the gloom.

210
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,390
Semyon, the red! Stop!

211
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,190
Boy, you run.

212
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,150
Using the living bait,
you dirty fuzz?

213
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,150
No, we just use some bread.

214
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,470
Andrey!

215
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,870
Shut yer kisser up.

216
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,190
Have you seen the number?

217
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,430
12.

218
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,390
Gotcha. Ilyukha, ask him
for directions.

219
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,990
Andrey, don't. Let him go.

220
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,950
Andrey, no!

221
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,150
Zawulon, Semyon!

222
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,470
Andrey, I'm begging you,
let's beat it!

223
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,470
Wait!

224
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,430
I see you, scum.

225
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,390
Come out!

226
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,390
Emergency service.
City Light Company

227
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,190
I told you, 12, but you
said, 11.

228
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,670
Lena, take him. The day watch
has come.

229
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,990
You are charged with unlawful
use of firearms.

230
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,310
What does he say?

231
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,190
I didn't hear
because of the machine.

232
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,990
We've an emergency
here, sorry.

233
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,310
You could move your car,

234
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,910
or we could damage it.

235
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,870
Good bye.

236
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,510
The CLC here.

237
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,190
We're late, Boris Ivanovich.

238
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,310
He killed one.
The vampiress escaped...

239
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,310
What's wrong with him?

240
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,710
No end of numbers 12
at that street.

241
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,670
- 12, bldg 1, bldg 2...
- What's wrong with him?

242
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,310
What's wrong with him?

243
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,310
Take him right here.

244
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,270
City Light Company

245
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,470
To my table!

246
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,790
Quick!

247
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,150
All of you, out! Quick!

248
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,150
Every Night Watchman
should be able

249
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,190
to fight.

250
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,990
The cook, the whore,

251
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,830
the sawbones.

252
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,190
The programmer.

253
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,150
You'd been sitting in the
office for 3.5 years

254
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,710
and learned to treat
the Night watch duty

255
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,670
as a normal human job.

256
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,590
Don't blame yourself.
You didn't kill him,

257
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,550
you just gave him
the eternal rest.

258
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,910
Don't sleep, talk.

259
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,190
It's Zawulon.

260
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,990
There's a woman.

261
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,950
- Is she young? Pretty?
- It's not the...

262
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,830
What?

263
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,590
The funnel.

264
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,910
5 days.

265
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,510
The funnel.

266
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,470
I wanted to strike
the funnel down.

267
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,470
I...

268
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,910
Don't.

269
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,870
Look here, Anton.

270
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,430
Let's go there.

271
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,390
Go there. Here.

272
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,390
What are you pushing?

273
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,190
All right.

274
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,150
Come back, Anton,
come back.

275
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,110
Come back.

276
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,070
- Did you see her?
- Yes.

277
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,550
She's beautiful.

278
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,150
Just a moment.

279
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,510
- Analytics Dept.
- Beat to quarters.

280
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,710
Anton found the funnel
of damnation.

281
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,590
I should know for sure

282
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,600
what's gonna happen in Moscow
in the next 24 hours.

283
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,870
City Light Company.

284
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,710
INCIDENTS

285
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,670
The flight Moscow-Antalia
crashed over Moscow.

286
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,670
Pilot-in-command and
the crew of IL84

287
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,470
the flight 99753
Moscow-Antalia...

288
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,910
The flight time
4 hours 20 minutes.

289
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,830
I left my swimsuit
in the hotel.

290
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,510
I took it.

291
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,430
- You were in the room?
- So what?

292
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,110
- Did you look in the mirror?
- Why?

293
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,070
Jesus, don't start that again.

294
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,150
- Let's skip the flight.
- Then skip it.

295
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,670
Here she is. The virgin.

296
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,390
There lived a virgin in Byzantum,
and someone wished her evil

297
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,910
and cursed her.

298
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,870
Wherever she trod, bad luck
lurked over her head.

299
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,070
She took a candle, and the
candle died down.

300
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,390
She petted a puppy, and
the puppy died.

301
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,950
A bird that ate from her hand
fell to the ground.

302
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,470
In the houses she visited
children died.

303
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,710
The darkness and ravage
ruled the city.

304
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,830
The ravage and darkness.

305
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,590
So warriors stepped
from the dark

306
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,430
who called themselves the
Warriors of Darkness.

307
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,190
And from among the people
those stepped out

308
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,510
who called themselves
the Warriors of Light.

309
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,470
And the great Battle
between Dark and Light began.

310
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,150
But no one could win,
for they were equal.

311
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,590
It will be so until
a man emerges

312
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,190
who is fated to become
the Great one.

313
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,510
If he takes the side of Light,
the Light wins.

314
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,470
But those who know the truth
say he'd choose the Darkness.

315
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,910
For it's easier to kill
the Light in oneself

316
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,870
than to scatter
the Darkness.

317
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,390
The prophecy comes true.

318
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,670
Pass me on to Alice.

319
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,950
It's Zawulon.

320
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,830
I can't talk at the moment.

321
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,910
- You know what happened?
- No.

322
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,870
Your hairdresser. They bashed
his head against the basin.

323
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,190
Bring me the one
who did this.

324
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,150
I'm coming.

325
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,710
We'll train his girlfriend.

326
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,110
The one with the scorched face.

327
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,590
CLC issued the license on her
to the hairdresser,

328
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,910
I mean, allowed
to gobble her up.

329
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,430
It turned out they knew
each other.

330
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,390
She offered him her throat.

331
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,190
I warned her, I did.

332
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,150
You can't tell enough, they're
young and unafraid.

333
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,830
They caught them on live bait.

334
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,790
Now she's starved.

335
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,990
- Give me.
- Are you salivating?

336
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,830
Give me.

337
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,510
- Andrey taught you to call.
- Well, he did. Give me.

338
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,150
The kid answered your call.

339
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,430
Lure him out.

340
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,190
And when he's in your hands,
demand

341
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,590
to see the one who killed
your Andrey.

342
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,830
My Andrey.
Give me, please.

343
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,790
Give it to me!

344
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,830
Do you want a revenge?

345
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,790
- Don't torture her.
- Please?

346
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,670
- She'll sure find him now.
- How?

347
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,950
She'll find him.
Like a dog.

348
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,350
Come to me.

349
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,430
Where are you going?

350
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,830
I have to find him.

351
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,790
Find whom?

352
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,390
The boy.

353
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,790
Where are you going?
You're barely alive.

354
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,390
We shouldn't've charged you
with field work.

355
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,150
To drink blood and catch
vampires is not for you.

356
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,990
It's not the point.

357
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,110
What is?

358
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,070
We license them ourselves.

359
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,830
So?

360
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,790
And then we use our live
bait to catch them.

361
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,790
Who said it? Whose words
are those?

362
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,110
Those are my words.

363
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,190
It's me who says it.

364
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,430
You don't know anything.

365
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,390
Sitting here,
you don't know anything.

366
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,190
It was a child.

367
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,710
A child.

368
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,670
He's like a bitten
sandwich to her now.

369
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,310
Torn from her mouth
in the last moment.

370
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,830
If I don't find him,

371
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,590
she'll do it.

372
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,550
Wait.

373
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,150
I'll give you a partner.

374
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,590
You've killed
a Dark one, Anton.

375
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,550
Zawulon won't forgive you for
that. You need protection.

376
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,270
What's this?

377
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,390
It's Olga.

378
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,470
She'll help you.

379
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,150
Why do I need it?

380
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,870
It's your choice.

381
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,710
From our last program
we learnt

382
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,510
how to use live bait.

383
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,510
Today let's talk about owls.

384
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,470
Owls are a special case
of nocturnal predators.

385
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,430
Only an owl can look
at an object

386
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,910
with both eyes at a time

387
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,190
due to their evolved
adaptation.

388
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,710
Owls mostly are
nocturnal species.

389
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,590
Owls can see the heat their
victim's body emanates.

390
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,430
Owl's eye can perceive
invisible infra-red rays.

391
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,390
Managed to foist it off.

392
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,550
The predator who has
a peculiarity...

393
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,790
I didn't want to kill!

394
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,390
Owls feed on animal life,
small animals and birds.

395
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,910
Check out where she lives
and works.

396
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,510
All her contacts
in the last 3 days.

397
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,510
Who could send this damned
curse? And when?

398
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,590
This is a matter of minutes
now, mind it.

399
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,430
I met a curse that strong
118 years ago.

400
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,430
I see. How much time
do we have?

401
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,270
No time.
Is it her?

402
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,670
Yes, Svetlana Nazarova, aged 29,
she works in the clinic No 17.

403
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,910
Has never come in view of
the Night Watch.

404
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,870
Lives with her mother in 37,
Vatutinki, bldg A.

405
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,710
It's close to Vnukovo airport.

406
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,590
Incidents:

407
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,550
Mom is hospitalized, kidney
problem, a grafting is necessary.

408
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,470
A friend's kid is sick,
she visited them.

409
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,830
Here's another victim,

410
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,790
their neighbor Auntie
Valya, aged 78.

411
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,510
She's a tough woman, yet
called the ambulance.

412
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,310
That witch gave her
a bad look.

413
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,270
- How do you do.
- Hello, Sveta.

414
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,950
- What kind of a dog is that?
- Maxim brought from work,

415
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,430
and I don't know
what to do with it.

416
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,550
Let her live.

417
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,070
Let her live.

418
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,150
- Take care, Auntie Valya.
- Thank you, Sveta.

419
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,070
Olga.

420
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,470
Wanna eat?

421
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,550
A feathered wonder.

422
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,470
Say something.
Be human.

423
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,950
Turn away.

424
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,780
Don't look.

425
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,150
Don't turn

426
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,110
- You...

427
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,070
- Turn away.

428
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,670
Are you scared?

429
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,470
The shower is - there.

430
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,870
- Why did they do it to you?
- It's a punishment.

431
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,990
How do they spin it?

432
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,190
Up left is hot, right is cold.

433
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,910
No... But yes.

434
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,910
I've never heard of
punishments like this.

435
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,910
You've never heard of
crimes like this.

436
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,590
D'you have anything to
change into?

437
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,550
In a moment.

438
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,910
Do you have any woman's
clothes by any chance?

439
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,870
What?

440
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,390
I'm sorry, it's just in case.

441
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,150
Here, I have it from my mom.

442
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:52,140
Thanks.

443
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,590
Anything wrong?

444
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,550
No.

445
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,670
Step inside.

446
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,190
You know, Anton,

447
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,910
there are too few
of us left.

448
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,110
And when someone goes
away for good,

449
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,310
all of us feel it immediately.

450
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,910
That's how the world
spins, neighbor.

451
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,990
There's an agreement.

452
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,910
- You understand what I say.
- What, Anton?

453
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,430
Yours and ours have struck
a deal that

454
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,390
everything may be done
but in turns.

455
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,220
I still don't get one thing.
