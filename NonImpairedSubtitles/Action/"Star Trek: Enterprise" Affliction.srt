Captain's Starlog, November 27, 2154.

27
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:27,443
We've returned home for the official launch
of our sister ship Columbia.

28
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:32,336
On a personal note, I'll also be saying good-bye
to one-hell-of-a chief engineer.

29
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,207
[door chimes]
Yeah?

30
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:52,005
She's a thing of beauty.

31
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:57,264
Columbia's virtually identical to Enterprise.
A good engineer can see the differences.

32
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:03,755
You coming to the mess hall later?
My "going away" party?

33
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:09,357
I don't understand the logic behind this transfer.
You're not being promoted...

34
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,438
You think I'm doing this to advance my career?

35
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:14,392
You wouldn't leave Captain Archer
without sufficient reason.

36
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,362
Well, for one thing,
this is a new challenge.

37
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:18,943
It took me a year to fine-tune Enterprise.

38
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:22,121
I figure I can do the same
for Captain Hernandez in half the time.

39
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:26,578
She needs a Chief Engineer
who's been out there... has the experience.

40
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,605
Are you leaving because of me?
Starfleet's approved the transfer.

41
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:34,212
You didn't answer my question.

42
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:37,478
This may come as a shock,

43
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:40,963
but not everything in my life
revolves around you.

44
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,111
I'm glad we got here early.

45
00:03:59,182 --> 00:04:01,065
There never used to be a wait to get in.

46
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:04,791
You didn't think Madame Chang was going
to be your little secret forever, did you?

47
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,875
There are a lot of Starfleet people here.
That's probably my fault.

48
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,896
I told a few friends about the place.
A few?

49
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm a COM officer. If there's one thing
that I know how to do, it's disseminate information.

50
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,355
You didn't tell me how your meeting
went today at the IME.

51
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:24,321
They asked if I was interested
in becoming Director of Xenobiology.

52
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,841
That's great!
Are you going to accept?

53
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,052
I'm considering it.
The truth is, I've grown rather fond of my shipmates.

54
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,974
I'm not certain I'm ready to leave them just yet.
What would you suggest?

55
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:36,235
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I've got a vested interest in keeping you around.

56
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:38,975
You, Denobulan, come with us.

57
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:42,076
What do you want?
Maybe you didn't hear me.

58
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,116
Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.

59
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:15,031
Hoshi...
I'm all right, sir.

60
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,877
Who did this? That's what I'm trying to determine.
Commander Collins, Starfleet Security.

61
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:23,011
Jonathan Archer. This is Lieutenant Reed.
There were three men. They were...

62
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:25,510
They were in the shadows.
I didn't get a good look at them.

63
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,315
You told me before that one of them
said something to the others.

64
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:30,618
Right before I passed out.

65
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:34,368
I'm pretty sure it wasn't English.
Do you remember what he said?

66
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:40,861
I'm sorry, sir. The only DNA we've recovered
belongs to Ensign Sato and to your Doctor.

67
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,130
We did find some residual
ionization traces here.

68
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,509
A transporter signature?

69
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:52,055
Very few people have access to that kind of technology.
Still, it's a likely explanation.

70
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:57,707
Dr. Phlox was involved in an altercation
the last time he was in San Francisco.

71
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:01,382
You think this is related?
Assaults against aliens are still pretty rare.

72
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:04,923
If the man who attacked him was holding a grudge...
He was a loudmouth in a bar.

73
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:08,885
I doubt he could find his head with both hands,
never mind organize a kidnapping.

74
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:11,785
We're pursuing all avenues.
Excuse me, Captain.

75
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,045
Lieutenant.

76
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:17,585
Check with Starfleet Operations.

77
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:21,962
See if their satellites picked up
any transporter activity this evening.

78
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:40,863
The dilithium matrix has got to be aligned within .3 microns.
The specs say .5.

79
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:45,348
Who do you think wrote those specs?
A warp field specialist?

80
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,356
Exactly.

81
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,775
Some guy who's probably never
been outside the solar system.

82
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:55,358
I've spent the last three and a half years crawling inside
one of these engines. I know what I'm talking about.

83
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:56,368
Aye, sir.

84
00:06:57,355 --> 00:06:58,605
Biggs, Pierce.

85
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:00,815
I want you to recalibrate the field stabilizers.

86
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:04,520
Rivers and Strong, you'll start
with the injector assembly.

87
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,692
This bucket of bolts was supposed
to leave dry dock six months ago.

88
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:14,065
I guarantee you Columbia's gonna warp out of orbit
before the end of the week.

89
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:15,957
Let's get to work.

90
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:25,818
It's customary to report to the captain after a transfer.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

91
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:29,349
I wanted to see what the situation was like
before we spoke.

92
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:32,804
Commander Charles Tucker,
reporting for duty.

93
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:34,855
Welcome aboard.

94
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,112
Trip is it?
That's right.

95
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,779
So what do you think...
can she be salvaged?

96
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:45,057
I think there's a good chance.

97
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:48,052
Any news on Dr. Phlox?

98
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,860
Not so far. If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

99
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,617
You certainly know how to motivate the troops.

100
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:58,851
We'll be pulling triple shifts
if we want to meet this new launch date.

101
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:01,215
You still need to eat.

102
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,739
Captain's mess, tomorrow,

103
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:04,954
1800 hours.

104
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:08,803
We can trade stories about your former CO.
I'll be there.

105
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:13,403
And Commander...

106
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:16,935
drop by the quartermaster's
at the end of your shift.

107
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:17,838
Ma'am?

108
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:19,832
You might want to...

109
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:22,744
update your uniform.

110
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:26,897
Aye, Captain.

111
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,580
[door chimes]
Come in.

112
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:42,685
We've heard nothing from the kidnappers...
not even a ransom demand.

113
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:45,437
I've spoken
with the Denobulan ambassador.

114
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:48,062
He's notified the doctor's wives.

115
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:51,657
Hoshi thought she overheard one of the kidnappers
say something in another language...

116
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,660
but she was semiconscious at the time.

117
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:59,359
Maybe you could help her remember.

118
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:01,516
A mind-meld?

119
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:05,032
I've never initiated a meld before.

120
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,627
I don't have the proper training.
I know it's dangerous...

121
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:11,436
but I can walk you through it.
You?

122
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,979
I had Surak's katra in my head
for four days.

123
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:17,362
I picked up a few tricks.

124
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:24,715
Computer, access satellite logs 1-3-7.

125
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:29,279
Time parameters 1900 and 1945 today.

126
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:32,878
What?

127
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:41,156
Starfleet Operations,
this is Lieutenant Malcolm Reed aboard Enterprise.

128
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:44,922
Please acknowledge.

129
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:48,555
Burning the midnight oil, Lieutenant?

130
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:50,509
Sir...

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,450
I thought I was calling Starfleet Ops.

132
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,752
Let me guess.

133
00:09:55,821 --> 00:10:00,671
You want to know why the grid covering San Francisco
was down for maintenance tonight.

134
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,367
Something like that.

135
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,329
Meet me at this address...

136
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:06,453
in one hour.

137
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,333
My mind to your mind.

138
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,225
Our minds are merging.

139
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,142
Our minds are one.

140
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:39,129
Nothing's happening.

141
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:43,031
T'Pol, try to relax your emotional suppression
just a little.

142
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,686
I feel what you feel.

143
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,070
I know what you know.

144
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:56,538
[gasps]

145
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:58,503
Can you hear me?

146
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:00,409
Yes... perfectly.

147
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:04,684
You and the doctor have
just left the restaurant.

148
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,898
I'm glad we got here early.

149
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:11,791
There never used to be a wait to get in.
Good.

150
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:15,848
They asked if I was interested
in becoming Director of Xenobiology.

151
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:18,139
Where were you attacked?
There.

152
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,722
Truth is, I've grown rather fond of my shipmates...

153
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,928
Do you see them?
...not certain I'm ready to leave them just yet.

154
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,878
What would you suggest?
Yes.

155
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,156
You, Denobulan, come with us.

156
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,428
What do you want?
Maybe you didn't hear me.

157
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,407
[grunting]

158
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:43,128
Focus on the moment.

159
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:44,971
Put aside any pain.

160
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:50,262
Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.

161
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:52,312
Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.

162
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,913
Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.

163
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,270
"Bring him with us."
It's Rigelian.

164
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:09,340
A Rigelian freighter left orbit two hours
after Phlox's abduction.

165
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,691
According to their flight plan,
they were headed for Proxima Colony.

166
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:16,339
This trajectory won't take them
anywhere near Proxima Colony.

167
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:20,848
Ensign...
Sir.

168
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:25,616
Put Admiral Gardner through to my ready room.
Shore leaves are canceled.

169
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,809
Get everyone back aboard.

170
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:48,744
Am I to understand you are responsible for taking that
satellite grid off-line?

171
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:50,104
Not me personally.

172
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,180
But you're involved.

173
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,156
Phlox is my friend.

174
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,619
Do you know where he is?

175
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,695
We have an assignment for you.

176
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:07,866
I wasn't aware that
I was still a part of your section.

177
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:12,169
There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant,

178
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:15,437
and it may be the only way
to save your friend's life.

179
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:45,371
Welcome to Qu'Vat Colony, Doctor.

180
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:48,156
You will work with Dr. Antaak.

181
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,672
I will do nothing of the kind.

182
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:55,002
Then you will die.

183
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,538
I'm certain there are easier ways
for you to recruit a new lab assistant.

184
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,615
You misunderstand me, Doctor.

185
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:04,036
Antaak will be assisting you.

186
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:08,194
It's good to see you again, Doctor.

187
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,583
I beg your pardon?

188
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,576
I wouldn't expect you to remember
but we met briefly five years ago,

189
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,776
at the IME conference on Tiburon.

190
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,319
I don't recall meeting a Klingon
at that conference.

191
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:22,786
I was disguised as a member
of the Mazarite delegation.

192
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,849
My people weren't invited.

193
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,804
I will let you two get "reacquainted."

194
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:30,502
I suggest you work quickly, Doctor.

195
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:35,184
I expect a progress report
by sunrise.

196
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:44,918
You must forgive the general's conduct.

197
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:48,345
The warrior caste has little use
for social protocols.

198
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,809
What do you want with me?

199
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,831
The Empire is facing its gravest threat
since the Hur'q invasion.

200
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:02,033
A virus is spreading from planet to planet.
Millions are already infected.

201
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,575
If this continues, the Klingon
species will cease to exist.

202
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,350
Why didn't you simply ask for our help?

203
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,644
Starfleet and Denobula would've provided you
with all of the specialists you'd need.

204
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,118
You don't understand the Klingon way, Doctor.

205
00:15:15,118 --> 00:15:19,080
To ask for assistance would make us look weak
in the eyes of our enemies.

206
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,180
It could even incite rebellion.

207
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,895
But why me?

208
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,972
I was impressed by your lecture
at the conference.

209
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:29,511
Your paper on viral propagation
was very insightful.

210
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:36,051
What field of study are you in precisely?
Metagenic research.

211
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:39,864
I've already isolated the virus.

212
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:43,947
I assume you'll want to start
by mapping the nucleotides?

213
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,008
It wasn't my idea to abduct you.

214
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:50,745
Nevertheless, you are here.

215
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:53,755
Millions of lives are at risk.

216
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:13,136
The freighter's warp trail has terminated.
They may have dropped to impulse.

217
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:17,912
How long to intercept?

218
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,519
At our current speed...
8.2 hours.

219
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,225
Archer to Engineering.

220
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,429
Commander Kelby...
respond.

221
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,650
Kelby here, sir.

222
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:45,627
We could use a little more speed.
The injectors are running at 105%.

223
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:50,723
Commander Tucker's pushed them higher than that before.
I'll see what I can do, Captain.

224
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:12,382
I don't know who's in charge of your mess hall,
but he could give the chef on Enterprise a run for his money.

225
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:14,962
I stole him from the Republic.

226
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,091
Captain Jennings said I could have anything
I wanted when I left... so I took his cook.

227
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:21,712
[chuckling]

228
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:28,381
I've gotten two transfer requests
from crewmen in your department.

229
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:29,647
Who?

230
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:32,998
It's probably better
if I didn't mention names.

231
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:36,508
I denied them.
You're already short-handed.

232
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:40,285
Quite an impression you've made, Commander.

233
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:44,472
You've been aboard less than two days
and already some of your team want to jump ship.

234
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:49,126
I've knocked a few heads together...
but we're getting the job done.

235
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,122
We'll be ready for warp trials by Thursday.

236
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:56,442
I was surprised you accepted this transfer.

237
00:17:56,794 --> 00:17:59,183
I saw an interview with you
after the Xindi mission.

238
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:04,010
You said you couldn't see yourself serving on any other starship.
Well, you've got a good memory, Captain.

239
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:05,912
It comes in handy.

240
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:14,407
I was getting a little too comfortable on Enterprise.
Got a lot of friends over there but...

241
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,529
sometimes it's easier to work with people
who are just colleagues.

242
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:47,448
Why are you here?

243
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:50,171
I was about to ask you the same thing.

244
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,878
Is this a daydream?

245
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,423
I'm meditating.

246
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:58,287
This is where I go in my mind.

247
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,103
Wow.

248
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:03,291
I would've thought
you'd pick a more interesting place.

249
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:06,096
Like the beach or...

250
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,827
one of those fire plains
you showed me.

251
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:13,782
Please leave.

252
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,190
Exactly where am I supposed to go?

253
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:18,316
Away.

254
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,060
This is my daydream. You go away.
Excuse me, Commander?

255
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:27,828
Is everything all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
The diagnostic you asked for. Thanks.

256
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,983
Bridge to T'Pol.

257
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,441
We're approaching the coordinates.

258
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,201
On my way.

259
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:55,511
No bio-signs.

260
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:58,594
I'm reading several bodies aboard.

261
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:07,253
Is one of them Denobulan?

262
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,373
They're all Rigelian.

263
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:16,554
Can you tell who did this?

264
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:22,282
No, sir.

265
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:27,287
I'll have to bring aboard
some of the debris and analyze it.

266
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:31,452
Scan for their data recorder.
It might tell us something.

267
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,844
Unless I'm mistaken,
this virus is a mutated form of the Levodian flu.

268
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:43,744
It's immune to whatever
antiviral we've tried.

269
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:47,076
We should contact the IME.

270
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:51,243
They may have seen this mutation before and I'm certain
they'll be willing to share their database with us.

271
00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:55,093
I know of a few indirect channels.

272
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:59,018
No one would have to know.
There's no reason to contact them.

273
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:04,472
We've acquired their entire database.

274
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,008
You stole it.

275
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:12,502
Medical research isn't a priority
for the High Council.

276
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:15,533
I'm forced to obtain information
however I can.

277
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,666
That doesn't sound very honorable.

278
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,611
Given the choice between honor and saving lives,
I choose the latter.

279
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:25,437
Perhaps you should ask your superiors to steal
a genome sequencer, hmm?

280
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:28,776
We're not going to be able to map the virus
without the proper technology.

281
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:41,775
This man's been infected.
Very observant. We are being exposed!

282
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:46,812
This patient is at stage one.
The virus doesn't become contagious until stage three.

283
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:51,273
When I asked you to bring me a subject
for dissection, I assumed he'd already be dead.

284
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:53,323
He won't be alive much longer.

285
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:57,722
What do you think you're doing?
Euthanizing him. Out of the question.

286
00:21:58,696 --> 00:22:00,790
I thought you were committed to saving lives.

287
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,449
It is more honorable to give one's life
to medical research than to die for no purpose!

288
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,760
That choice is not ours to make.

289
00:22:09,368 --> 00:22:10,318
Proceed.

290
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,987
Computer, establish an encrypted com-link.

291
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:25,715
Starfleet frequency seven-nine-baker.

292
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,572
Lieutenant.

293
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:34,121
You told me the Klingons were going to rendezvous
with that freighter -- not destroy it.

294
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:37,300
I regret what happened,
but they had to cover their tracks.

295
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,613
How many were on board that ship?
That's not your concern.

296
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:43,487
Have you analyzed
the weapon signatures yet?

297
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:44,506
Yes.

298
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,604
You haven't told Archer?

299
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:52,111
But I'm not certain how much
longer I can keep this from him.

300
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,537
Orion raiders have been known
to operate in this area.

301
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:58,065
You want me to lie again?

302
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:02,021
I could explain
the situation to the Captain.

303
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,823
You have a peculiar sense of humor, Lieutenant.
I've worked closely with the man.

304
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:09,745
You can trust him.
Archer is a Starfleet captain.

305
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:13,244
His duty would be to report everything
you tell him to Admiral Gardner.

306
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:14,721
They would launch an investigation.

307
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,410
I'm being compromised, sir...

308
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,850
and I don't like it.

309
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:25,033
Then I suggest you adjust
your comfort level, Lieutenant.

310
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:28,316
You made a commitment to us
long before you joined the Enterprise.

311
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:34,145
Tactical alert. All hands to battle stations.
What was that? I believe we're under attack.

312
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:48,004
Hull plating's holding.

313
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,470
Still no response.

314
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:52,521
Target their weapons.

315
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:10,087
We've been boarded.
D-deck, starboard side.

316
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:11,871
Access tube Seven.

317
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:14,427
Seal it off.
Get the MACOs down there.

318
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:23,323
Dah petagh.

319
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,947
ay'vamDaq nuHmey tIOeg!

320
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,020
Disable that ship.
I don't want them getting away.

321
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,243
jol Quv yIchegh!

322
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,885
They've activated their transporter.

323
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,908
They're going to warp.
Pursuit course.

324
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:23,938
[console beeping]

325
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,438
The helm's not responding.

326
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,153
Wake him up.

327
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,335
[grunts]

328
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,979
Why did you attack us?

329
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:49,628
SoHvaD pagh vIjatlh, human.

330
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:53,484
"I have nothing to say to you, human."

331
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:57,967
That sounds like... Klingon.
There must be some kind of mistake.

332
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:00,349
What is it?

333
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:03,251
According to his bio-signature,
he is Klingon.

334
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:18,387
He must have been surgically
altered to look human.

335
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,220
Any theories?

336
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:27,471
I need to run further tests. Their boarding party
disabled our antimatter flow regulators.

337
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,570
Warp drive should be repaired
in six hours.

338
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,958
Give our new chief engineer a hand.

339
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:40,797
Tell him to dig a little deeper.
See if these "Klingons" damaged any other systems.

340
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:43,815
The Rigelian freighter--

341
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:47,873
did you get anything out of the black box?
It's been erased.

342
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:52,452
It might've been a safeguard,
in case it fell into the wrong hands.

343
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,087
Work with Hoshi.

344
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,672
See if you can reconstruct any data.

345
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:15,210
There is something familiar about these base-pair sequences.
Familiar?

346
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:16,226
Mm.

347
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,339
Boshar!

348
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:25,989
Feeding time is over.

349
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:26,985
Go back!

350
00:27:28,703 --> 00:27:31,853
Do you think it's wise
to keep wild animals in here?

351
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:36,122
There are dozens of creatures in your Sick Bay.
I don't let them roam free.

352
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,913
I could never keep Boshar locked up.

353
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:42,279
He was my first patient.
He tore his side open when I was a child.

354
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:45,101
I stitched the wound myself.

355
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:50,336
I have seen these sequences before.

356
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:53,572
Six months ago, to be precise.
This is Augment DNA.

357
00:27:55,736 --> 00:28:01,110
How did modified human genes find their way into this virus?
Is it really such a surprise, Doctor?

358
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,060
It took only two human Augments to commandeer
a Bird of Prey and murder its entire crew.

359
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:11,289
The Empire could not allow an inferior species
to gain an advantage on us.

360
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:16,121
Imagine every Starfleet vessel manned
with genetically engineered humans.

361
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:19,753
Earth banned genetic engineering
decades ago!

362
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:23,199
The Augments who attacked you
were relics of another era!

363
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,358
The Vulcans told that
to the High Council.

364
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:29,116
They weren't very persuasive.
We were simply responding to a threat.

365
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:30,951
You were trying to create Klingon Augments.

366
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,888
But Soong's experiments were all killed.
Where did you get the genetic material?

367
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:39,588
Several embryos were found
in the wreckage of the Bird of Prey.

368
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:44,887
We used them to resequence
a number of test subjects.

369
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:48,212
There were some
unanticipated side effects.

370
00:28:48,738 --> 00:28:51,338
Their cranial ridges started to dissolve.

371
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,397
Augment DNA was more aggressive
than you realized, hmm?

372
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:58,516
For a time, it appeared we were quite successful.

373
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:01,882
Our Augments might have looked human,
but they were Klingon--

374
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,858
stronger, more intelligent.

375
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:05,969
Then...

376
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:09,705
their neural pathways started to degrade.
They died in agony.

377
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:14,118
One of the test subjects was
suffering from the Levodian flu.

378
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:16,682
The Augment genes modified the virus.

379
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:18,653
It became airborne.

380
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:21,321
You should have told me this earlier!

381
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:26,910
If you hope to ever leave this place,
I suggest you stop asking questions and resume work.

382
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:36,465
What do you think?

383
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:39,800
We may be able to reconstruct the directory
with a recursive algorithm.

384
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:43,907
Is it unusual to have weird
dreams after a mind meld?

385
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:48,319
Subconscious thoughts
are often exchanged.

386
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,279
They sometimes surface during sleep.

387
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,630
I had a bizarre dream last night.

388
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:56,552
Commander Tucker was in it.

389
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:00,239
We were in a strange place.
It was all white.

390
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,330
There was almost a, uh...

391
00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:06,816
romantic quality to it.

392
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:11,433
I don't ever remember dreaming about
Commander Tucker before. [console beeping]

393
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,510
Most unusual.

394
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:18,015
The recorder was erased...
deliberately.

395
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:24,058
Malcolm said there might've been a safeguard.
The memory core was wiped by that microdyne coupler.

396
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:28,776
You're sure?
It left a unique magnetic signature.

397
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,549
We found it in storage locker C-14.

398
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:36,245
The last person to access that locker
was Lieutenant Reed.

399
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:43,096
I'm not quite sure
what you're getting at, sir.

400
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:48,547
Only someone with security clearance
of alpha-four or higher had access to the black box.

401
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:51,327
That's just T'Pol, you and me.

402
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,953
I agree.
It is a bit of a mystery.

403
00:30:57,703 --> 00:31:02,310
You're sure that freighter
was destroyed by Orion weapons?

404
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:04,619
There's no doubt.

405
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,697
I asked T'Pol to double-check
your analysis.

406
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:20,805
The freighter was fired on
by Klingon disruptors.

407
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,350
With all due respect, sir,
there must have been a mistake.

408
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,946
I've seen the sensor logs.

409
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:32,063
Someone could have tampered with them.

410
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:38,873
I want to know
what the hell is going on.

411
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:43,868
Answer me, Lieutenant.

412
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,910
Respectfully, sir...

413
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:51,371
I refuse to answer
any more questions.

414
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,713
Malcolm, I never would've believed that you,

415
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:02,746
of all people...

416
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:11,401
Corporal.

417
00:32:13,363 --> 00:32:17,913
Lieutenant Reed's been relieved of duty.
Escort him to the brig and confine him.

418
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:51,002
We've set course for Klingon territory.

419
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,899
We haven't picked up
any warp signatures yet.

420
00:32:54,214 --> 00:32:58,874
I may have to take this ship into their space.
I don't have to tell you how dangerous that is.

421
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:01,424
If you know where they've taken Phlox...

422
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,105
I have no idea
where the doctor is, Captain.

423
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:09,843
On that, you have my word.
Your word isn't worth a lot at the moment.

424
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:24,465
The Malcolm Reed I know would give his life
before committing treason.

425
00:33:24,946 --> 00:33:27,146
I'm not working for the Klingons.

426
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:29,799
Who, then?

427
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:42,277
You've betrayed everything
that uniform stands for.

428
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:43,754
Captain...

429
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:48,813
There are some...

430
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:51,358
obligations...

431
00:33:52,746 --> 00:33:55,046
that go beyond my loyalty to you...

432
00:33:56,364 --> 00:33:57,614
and this crew.

433
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:08,679
What the hell does that mean?

434
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,679
I can't say any more.

435
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:16,133
You haven't said much of anything.

436
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:23,246
You've told me a lot about your father...

437
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:27,454
his years in the Royal Navy,
their tradition of honor and service.

438
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:33,618
How do you think he'll react
when he learns you're facing court-martial?

439
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:35,688
I wouldn't know, sir.

440
00:34:56,477 --> 00:35:00,727
We are running out of time.
I can't sequence these nucleotides any faster.

441
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:03,872
Perhaps you should've abducted Dr. Soong.

442
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:06,507
He could've mapped this genome
more efficiently than I can.

443
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:08,660
We tried.
Soong was under heavy guard.

444
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,496
If you don't accelerate your efforts,
there will be no one left to cure.

445
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:15,356
The High Council has dispatched the fleet.

446
00:35:15,442 --> 00:35:17,742
They have annihilated N'Vak Colony.

447
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:23,234
N'Vak was one of the first planets affected by the plague.
They're massacring the victims?

448
00:35:23,343 --> 00:35:27,143
The Council will do whatever's required
to contain this outbreak.

449
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:32,385
General, we're making progress,
but I'll need a few weeks to develop an antiviral agent.

450
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:36,085
It will have to be tested...
Millions will be infected by then.

451
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,286
The Council will not wait!

452
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:41,595
How long until the fleet reaches us?
Five days.

453
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,876
I can't cure this in five days!

454
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:48,014
They wouldn't destroy us if they knew
we had created Klingon Augments.

455
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:51,994
The experiment failed!
It succeeded for a brief period.

456
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:57,432
If Phlox and I can find a way to stabilize
the human DNA prior to the onset of stage three,

457
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:00,061
our Augments would survive.

458
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:03,677
If we're successful,
you could use them as leverage,

459
00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:07,344
force the High Council
to give us more time to find a cure.

460
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:11,562
You don't seriously expect me
to help you create Klingon Augments?!

461
00:36:11,562 --> 00:36:14,043
You could save the inhabitants
of this planet.

462
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:18,436
I won't assist you.

463
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,350
Kill me if you must.

464
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,734
I refuse to cooperate.

465
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:29,887
Take him.

466
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:45,652
Hail the dock master.

467
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,657
[com beep]
This is Captain Hernandez.

468
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:56,369
Request permission to depart.
You're cleared for departure.

469
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:59,045
Smooth sailing, Columbia.
Thank you.

470
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:02,821
Bridge to Engineering.

471
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:05,997
Are we ready, Mr. Tucker?
Just a few more seconds.

472
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:07,608
I hope.

473
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:10,214
Ensign?
Dilithium matrix is stable.

474
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,080
Driver coils are configured
for warp speed.

475
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:14,626
Nice work.

476
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:17,048
Engineering to bridge!

477
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:20,634
We're ready whenever you are, Captain.
Time to weigh anchor.

478
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:27,177
Lieutenant, aft thrusters
at one-half until we clear spacedock...

479
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,976
then take us to warp.

480
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,407
[coughing]

481
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,880
So, what are you in for?

482
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:15,626
Is your captain hoping you'll obtain information from me?
I shouldn't think so.

483
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:17,658
Then why are you here?

484
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:20,399
That's a long story.

485
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:21,971
Entertain me.

486
00:38:25,474 --> 00:38:26,724
I lied to him.

487
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:30,532
You're fortunate to be alive.

488
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:34,433
A Klingon who betrays his captain
would be immediately executed.

489
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,620
[coughs]

490
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:47,365
Why did you and your men board Enterprise?

491
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,820
You know, you may find this hard to believe, but...
you and I actually want the same thing.

492
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,690
And what is that?

493
00:38:58,052 --> 00:38:58,952
A cure.

494
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,866
There's no reason for you
or any more of your people to die.

495
00:39:09,378 --> 00:39:12,993
There's a malfunction in the intermix chamber.
Plasma pressure's rising.

496
00:39:12,993 --> 00:39:15,548
The antimatter flow regulators
are locked open.

497
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:18,183
Did the Klingons damage them?
Uncertain.

498
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:22,005
Pressure's approaching critical.

499
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,866
Can we drop to impulse?

500
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:28,073
The reactor would breach.
But we can reduce pressure by increasing speed.

501
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:30,638
Go to maximum warp.

502
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,686
Get down to Engineering.

503
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,466
See what you can do.

504
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:48,937
You sabotaged us.

505
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:51,757
How do we repair the damage?

506
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:59,124
If our reactor breaches, you're going to die with us.
I'm a soldier of the Empire--

507
00:39:59,328 --> 00:40:00,878
I'm prepared to die.

508
00:40:01,886 --> 00:40:02,836
Captain!

509
00:40:03,293 --> 00:40:05,393
You need your tactical officer!

510
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:08,344
Please, sir!

511
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,589
I can be useful!

512
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:34,292
Commander, did you see that?
Please be more specific.

513
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:35,887
On the monitor.

514
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:47,441
T'Pol to Captain Archer.
Go ahead.

515
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:50,617
The warp matrix has been compromised...

516
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:52,653
by a Klingon subroutine.

517
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:57,090
Can you remove it? I'm not certain.
It's infiltrated our command protocols.

518
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:01,716
Do what you can.

519
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:09,525
Bridge to Captain Archer.
Pressure's increasing again.

520
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,151
Take us to warp 5.2.

521
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:17,038
Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.
We're out of options, Travis.

522
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:19,902
5.2.
Acknowledged.
