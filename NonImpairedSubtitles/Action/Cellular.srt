Ripped by: dj-oRi

2
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:16,549
But we don't have a fishtank.

3
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:18,083
- We could get one.
- Oh, mister.

4
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:25,234
Mom, will you still be a science teacher
when I get into high school?

5
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,964
Hmm...
you never know.

6
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,972
Why?

7
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,032
'Cause I think it'd be kind of weird to
have your mom as a teacher.

8
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:35,977
Ah!

9
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,913
I don't. I don't think so.
I think...

10
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:40,939
it might be
kind of neat.

11
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,282
Why?

12
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,585
Because then I'd get to hug and kiss you
anytime I wanted to.

13
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,558
Mom, that is gross.

14
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:52,652
Get out of here.

15
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,823
You have soccer, 1:45.
I'll pick you up.

16
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,026
Okay, Mom.

17
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,970
Mom!

18
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,184
Morning, Rosario.

19
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,193
- Buenos dias, Miss Jessica.
- Como esta?

20
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,888
Ay, bien, bien.

21
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,829
Miss Jessica, you had a phone call when
you were in the shower.

22
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:03,355
I think they left you
a message.

23
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,993
Okay.

24
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,297
Don't move!

25
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,168
Don't touch that alarm!

26
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:16,309
Search the house.
Put her in the van.

27
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:35,454
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

28
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,648
I'm videotaping hot chicks
walking in their bikinis.

29
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,884
Man, this is the greatest
cell phone ever made.

30
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,189
It is, I'm not kidding.

31
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,059
Hey, I draw you.
I draw you, $5.

32
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:25,090
- No, no, no, no tengo dinero, gracias.
- Let me get the phone.

33
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,534
Hold on a second. I'm e-mailing this
video to my computer.

34
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,595
It's gonna be
my new screen-saver.

35
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,007
- Here you go.
- It's Chloe.

36
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,669
No, dude, don't do this.
Don't do this.

37
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,678
- I'm just gonna say hi.
- You're not gonna say hi.

38
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:39,203
- No hi? I can't say hi?
- No hi. Come on, man.

39
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:42,046
Hold it together. This girl... she dumped
you, all right?

40
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:44,553
Have some self-respect.
Have some dignity.

41
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:45,952
- You're right.
- Be strong.

42
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,548
- You're right, thank you.
- Yeah, all right.

43
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,821
Oh, what's
going on, ladies?

44
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,921
What... what are you...
bro?

45
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:57,330
Like I'm talking to myself.

46
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,357
Chloe!

47
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,599
- Hey!
- Ryan.

48
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,970
- Hello, Chad.
- Chloe.

49
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,996
- Sam.
- Hey.

50
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,168
Friend with nipples.

51
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,905
Hey, so I called you
the other night.

52
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,345
I know, Tara told me.

53
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,109
Why didn't you
call me back?

54
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,208
Let's chat over here.

55
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:18,311
- Okay.
- Good luck, man.

56
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:25,957
Okay, Ryan, I really want you
to hear this, okay?

57
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,520
We're not
getting back together.

58
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,555
What, you mean
like today?

59
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,227
'Cause that's fine.
I have time.

60
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,702
This is just some
big joke to you, isn't it?

61
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,263
No, it's not,
it's not.

62
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:39,899
Yes, yes,
you know, see...

63
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:43,343
this is exactly why I broke up with you
in the first place.

64
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,815
You are irresponsible,
self-centered,

65
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,647
completely childish.

66
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:51,414
And, look,
I need to move on.

67
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:53,479
All right, okay, wait, wait, wait.
I know I used to be that way.

68
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:58,153
I used to be all those
things, but not anymore.

69
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:00,162
I'm serious, Chloe,
ever since you dumped me,

70
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,562
I've been thinking
about my life...

71
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:04,657
and I've changed.

72
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,793
- Sure you have.
- I have.

73
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:09,771
I came down here
to volunteer.

74
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:12,103
For what?

75
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:15,076
For what... for the...
the "Heal The Day."

76
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,510
Watch your back.

77
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,275
"Heal the bay?"

78
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:20,111
Yes, that's what I said.

79
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:23,277
That's bullshit.

80
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,811
Give me something... give me something
to do. I'll prove it to you.

81
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,381
Okay then,

82
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:33,122
Here. These flyers need to be handed
out before the concert tonight.

83
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,495
- Okay.
- Chloe, he can get the t-shirts.

84
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:39,126
Right... there're four bo xes
of T-shirts

85
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:41,329
that need to be picked up
from the Office Depot.

86
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,838
Okay, that's not
a problem.

87
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:47,502
- Okay.
- Okay.

88
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:50,205
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

89
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,412
Shit!

90
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,251
I'm just a big fan of, you know...
elastic. I think it's awesome.

91
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,846
Ah, dude,
that sucks.

92
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,881
No, that sucks more.
I'm not doing this.

93
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,951
- Please, Chad. It'll take 10 minutes.
- No! Dude, no.

94
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:09,658
You get to hang out with her friend with
the nipples. I think she liked you.

95
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,133
You're a god,
thank you.

96
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:15,001
It's awesome.
See you later, man.

97
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:21,739
Ah, so it's chilly
out here, huh?

98
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,745
No, not really.

99
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,440
I beg to differ.

100
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,308
Hello? Hello?

101
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,209
If you'd like to make a call...
- Shit!

102
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,895
"My baby loves me"

103
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,420
"And I'm running away"

104
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:19,400
"Running away"

105
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,096
"I've been
thinking lately"

106
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,935
"About the things
I've done so wrong..."

107
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,167
Hello, gorgeous.

108
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,976
See, this is exactly why I broke up
with you in the first place.

109
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,982
You are irresponsible,

110
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,076
completely childish...

111
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:40,813
Hello.

112
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:43,086
Hello, hello!

113
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,888
Hello, thank God!

114
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,155
Who is this? Chloe?

115
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:49,995
My name is Jessica Martin.
I need your help.

116
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:53,763
I've been kidnapped. l... I need you
to go to the police.

117
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,134
Kidnapped, huh?

118
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,901
This is for real.
l... I don't know where I am.

119
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,205
l... I'm locked up
in an attic somewhere.

120
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,575
l... I think they're going
to kill me.

121
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:05,580
Nice kidnappers
to give you a phone.

122
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:08,981
They... they didn't give me
a phone, no.

123
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:11,213
Th... there was a...

124
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,381
Right, I think if you were in trouble,
you would've called the cops and not me.

125
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,220
Now, I got another
call, okay?

126
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,920
Please, just listen.

127
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:22,397
The phone I'm on
is shattered.

128
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,265
I've been clicking wires
together forever

129
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:28,827
trying to reach
someone, anyone.

130
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,839
Please,
just don't hang up.

131
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:32,841
I may not get anyone else.

132
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,502
Right, later.

133
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,909
- Hello?
- I have no idea what just happened.

134
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,211
One minute I'm talking
to nipples, next thing you know,

135
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:42,217
I'm wearing a whale costume
handing out flyers.

136
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,047
That sucks.
Sounds like she got you.

137
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:49,148
I mean, I'm not saying
it doesn't have its benefits.

138
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:52,388
Hey, you guys know that a blue whale's
got an 11-foot penis?

139
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,123
- Heal the bay.
- Really?

140
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,630
I gotta to go.
I'll see you later.

141
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,723
All right,
later, bud.

142
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,459
Can you hear me?

143
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:04,405
You're still there, huh?
You know, this has been really fun.

144
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,670
But now you're wasting
my minutes. I'm gonna go.

145
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,201
They're going to kill me.

146
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:13,613
You're my only hope.

147
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,085
Nice with the fake tears,
lady.

148
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:20,646
- What's your name?
- What?

149
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,657
Please, tell me your name.

150
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,659
Ryan.

151
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:27,594
Ryan...

152
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,531
I don't know who you are.
I don't know you at all.

153
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:33,729
But I can't believe
that you would be so selfish

154
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:36,169
that you wouldn't take
10 minutes out of your day

155
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:39,197
to hand your phone
to a police officer.

156
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:42,005
Just 10 minutes.

157
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:46,140
Okay, 10 minutes.

158
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,952
Hold on.
Hold on a second.

159
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:53,750
Shut up, okay?
Now listen to me.

160
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:56,257
I'm a cop and have been
for 27 years.

161
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:59,955
So let's just cut the bullshit, pal,
because I've heard it all.

162
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,862
Now, I ordered the "Rain Shower"
with awapuhi.

163
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,834
Don't tell me jojoba is awapuhi.
I wasn't born yesterday.

164
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,396
So I'm gonna return the two cases and
you will refund my money.

165
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:13,135
Or maybe... maybe I should
just drive down there

166
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,405
and we can discuss this
in person.

167
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:18,311
No, no, no, I've got loofahs
up my ass.

168
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,043
What I want is a refund.

169
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,483
Thank you.

170
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,249
Thank you,
I appreciate that.

171
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:29,223
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

172
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:31,089
Hey, Mooney, I thought
the captain told you

173
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,492
you're not supposed
to have this shit sent here anymore.

174
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,021
I ordered this a long time ago, before
he ever told me that.

175
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:41,059
Sea sponges from
the coast of France.

176
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,367
Sea sponges?
Your husband like that sort of stuff?

177
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,702
Hey, lay off him,
all right?

178
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,970
At least he's got a plan.
What does your future hold

179
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:48,670
besides bowling nights
and a beer belly?

180
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:51,077
- Hey, this is Kevlar, pal.
- Yeah, have another doughnut.

181
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:52,705
Asshole.

182
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:57,718
- Thanks, Jack.
- Yeah, forget about it.

183
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,350
You sure about this
beauty parlor thing?

184
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:08,386
Day spa. It's a day spa.

185
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,455
And no, I'm not sure
about shit.

186
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,660
You know, you could
always come work for me.

187
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,669
I could use you
on the task force, really, could.

188
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:17,171
Thanks, Jack.
I appreciate that.

189
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:19,003
But I made a deal
with Mare.

190
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,942
And it's not just that.
I'm bored.

191
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,810
27 years... it's enough.

192
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,974
Okay.

193
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,815
- What?
- No, nothing.

194
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,912
What? Come on,
say it.

195
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:36,791
You're pussy-whipped, Bob.

196
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,555
I mean, she's got you wrapped around
her little finger like a toy.

197
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,790
No, l... look,

198
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,355
If this thing takes off,
we can make a shitload of money.

199
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,391
And then we'll see
who's laughing.

200
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,067
All right, I hope so.

201
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:53,074
Here is our top story
this hour.

202
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:55,372
Breaking news
coming out of Culver City:

203
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:59,313
The bodies of two men have been
discovered outside a local warehouse

204
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:03,944
shot execution-style in what appears
to be yet another gangland slam.

205
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,149
These murders are the latest episode
in what has been dubbed

206
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:11,558
a gang war over Los Angeles'
illegal street-drug trade.

207
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:22,362
All right, I'm at the police station.
I'm running inside.

208
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:25,931
- I'll give them the phone.
- Thank you so much.

209
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,207
Excuse me, Officer.

210
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:35,375
Hold on a second,
you've got the wrong form.

211
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:38,875
What? Crap, I thought
I'd grabbed an 18-9.

212
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:41,913
Hey, listen, I got some lady on the
phone who says she's been kidnapped.

213
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,424
Will you talk to her?

214
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:50,264
- Thank you.
- Sergeant Mooney.

215
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,790
Y-yes, yes, Officer,

216
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,099
m-my name is Jessica,

217
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:57,105
Jessica Martin.

218
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,540
I've been kidnapped. l...
I have a home in Brentwood.

219
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,544
This morning, five men

220
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,069
broke into my home
and killed my housekeeper.

221
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:07,605
You got something to say
to me, puto bitch?

222
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:11,009
Oh brother.

223
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,351
Hey, hey! Break it up.

224
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,823
Take this upstairs
to robbery-homicide, fourth floor.

225
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,155
Wait, wait,
where am I going?

226
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,626
The fourth floor,
upstairs, now, go!

227
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,829
Give us a hand.
Hey, Rudy, come on.

228
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,838
Excuse me, are you
a detective?

229
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,999
Detective?
I'm a freaking victim here.

230
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,134
Detective? Those jerks
dragged me down here.

231
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,973
And they're supposed
to read me my rights.

232
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:38,445
And they... hey, where are you going,
you little punk?

233
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,742
Ryan!

234
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:42,114
Oh my God!

235
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:44,619
What? What is it?
What's going on?

236
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,532
What?

237
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:11,774
What? What?

238
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,282
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

239
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:16,648
No, oh, God! No!

240
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:20,849
Oh, God!

241
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:23,483
Where did he put it?

242
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,755
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Holy shit!

243
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,354
- What are you talking...?
- Where is your husband?

244
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:30,627
Where is he?

245
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,327
l...

246
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,994
Oh, God...

247
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:36,869
Tell me what
I need to know.

248
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:40,932
Don't, please! Don't.

249
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:53,644
You have
a little boy, right?

250
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,782
He goes to the Wyman School

251
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,815
- in Westwood?
- No, no.

252
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:01,726
No! What do you want
with him?

253
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:04,426
No! What do you
want with him?

254
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:09,426
You've got the wrong family!
You've got the wrong family!

255
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,939
Please, God! No!

256
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:13,601
Oh my God!

257
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:18,607
...and the victims have been
escorted to Culver City...

258
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,512
We need to end
this thing now.

259
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,347
Deason, Dimitri,
go get the kid.

260
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:29,415
Ryan, Ryan?

261
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,119
I know, I'm going
to get help.

262
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,721
What's going on there?

263
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:37,254
It's just static. I'm running upstairs
to find a detective.

264
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,028
Hang on a second.
I might lose you, okay?

265
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,967
No, you can't lose me.

266
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,732
I know. We're almost there.
Don't worry.

267
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:46,764
No, Ryan, stop,
you can't loose me or I'm dead.

268
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,277
What do you want me to do?
I'm standing in the stairwell.

269
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,072
I mean, I can...
I can see the door.

270
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:58,681
Oh, shit!

271
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:02,613
Is anybody there?

272
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:05,422
I need a detective, please,
this is an emergency!

273
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,863
Anybody!

274
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,865
Oh my God!

275
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:29,207
Ryan, what time is it?

276
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,550
It's 1:30.
Is anyone there?

277
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,388
Listen to me. My son's school
gets out at 1:45.

278
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,689
They have my car.
He'll hop in the car. You have to...

279
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:41,218
Look, I'm trying, I can't move.
What do you...

280
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,494
the Wyman School.
Barrington and Sunset.

281
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:48,663
- 1:45, Ryan, hurry!
- Shit!

282
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,806
Where are you?

283
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,810
I just turned off Sunset.

284
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,812
Okay, it's on your right.

285
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:00,610
About, uh... two miles
up the road.

286
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:02,674
What do these guys
want anyway?

287
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:05,949
I don't know.
I'm a science biology teacher.

288
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,683
What about your husband?
Is he rich?

289
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:11,022
No, no, he's a realtor.

290
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,391
None of this
makes any sense.

291
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:21,359
Yo, Grandma, come on!

292
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:22,392
What is it?

293
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:24,997
Where is a cop
when you need one?

294
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,234
What is this?

295
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,117
Hey, hey!

296
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,813
Get off your cell phone.
Concentrate on the road.

297
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:41,322
- Yeah, yeah...
- Idiot! You still there?

298
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,790
- Oh, Ryan, hurry.
- Okay, all right.

299
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:47,853
All right,
I see the school.

300
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:03,170
- Ryan?
- Yeah.

301
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,872
How much time do we have?

302
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:07,074
Uh... we got one minute.

303
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,412
Okay, go up
to the main building.

304
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,250
His classroom will be
on... on the left.

305
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,279
Okay.

306
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,496
- All right, I'm here.
- Okay.

307
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,930
- What's your kid's name?
- Ricky.

308
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,934
- Ricky what?
- Martin.

309
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:28,994
Ricky Martin? You named your child
Ricky Martin?

310
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,766
It was before the singer...

311
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,398
Whatever, whatever.
What does he look like?

312
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,068
He's 11 years old,

313
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,409
blond hair, he's really s...
uh... small for his age,

314
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,779
gree... green eyes,
he's got on a...

315
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,250
a bl... blue shirt
and khaki pants.

316
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:45,685
They're all wearing that.

317
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,655
- Hey, are you Ricky Martin?
- No.

318
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:50,658
- Sir, can I help you?
- Ricky Martin?

319
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:54,651
Go to the office.
Hand them the phone.

320
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,164
I'll tell them
what happened.

321
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,896
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

322
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:04,201
Hey, do you know where I can find
the administrations office?

323
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,900
Yeah, it's up two...

324
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,738
You can't go there
right now, sir, it's closed.

325
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,676
- Oh, shit!
- You can't go in there, sir, sir?

326
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:10,939
Ricky Martin!

327
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,504
- Was that the bell?
- Yes, yes it was.

328
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:14,879
- Ricky Martin!
- Hurry!

329
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,146
Hurry, he'll go
to the parents' pickup spot.

330
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:19,483
- Okay, okay.
- Hey!

331
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:27,222
Oh, God! Ryan?
Ryan, they're gonna get him.

332
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,752
All right, parent pickup,
I see it.

333
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:30,594
- He'll definitely go there?
- Yes.

334
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:32,395
What kind of car you got?

335
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,493
A... a black SUV.

336
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:36,834
Of course you do.

337
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:42,505
Excuse me, sir,
you cannot be up here.

338
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,637
You've got to be down there
with the other parents.

339
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,648
I know, I'm looking for a kid named
Ricky Martin. I think he's in trouble.

340
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:50,981
He'll have a "Lord Of The Rings"
backpack.

341
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:55,916
Ryan, did you hear me?

342
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:01,053
Ricky Martin!

343
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:03,257
Holy shit, you see that?
The kid just got kidnapped.

344
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,788
What?!!

345
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:09,598
- I'm sorry. I gotta borrow your car.
- No, sir! Hey!

346
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,471
Hey! Don, I need
some help here.

347
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:15,806
Hey! Hey! Hey!

348
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,311
Ryan, are you there?

349
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,075
Yeah, Jessica, I'm here.

350
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,281
Don't let them get away.

351
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,020
It's okay, it's okay.
I can still see them up ahead.

352
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,658
It's gonna be okay. I can
see them, all right, Jessica?

353
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,725
You know what? This isn't a bad thing.
I can actually follow them

354
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:42,760
to where they're holding you
and I can call the cops.

355
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:51,068
- Shit!
- What?

356
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:53,104
This bus just cut me off.

357
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,582
Come on!

358
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,320
All right, this isn't working.
Hang on.

359
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,365
Son...

360
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:19,930
Holy...

361
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:26,278
Whoa!

362
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:32,479
Whoa, whoa.

363
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,991
Holy shit!

364
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:52,538
Oh! Oh!

365
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:58,608
- A-are you okay?
- We're okay.

366
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,638
We're alive.
We're breathing.

367
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:02,149
What happened?
Did you loose them?

368
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:04,049
Don't worry,
I'll find them.

369
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:12,190
Shit!

370
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:13,660
What?

371
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,822
Little bit of traffic.
Just give me a second, okay?

372
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,866
Come on, man,
let us through.

373
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:25,435
- Shit! My battery's dying.
- Do you have a charger?

374
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah, at my house, Jessica.

375
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:28,939
Hang on,
I'm checking the car.

376
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:30,569
Now you wanna move?

377
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,172
Shit.

378
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,046
Whoa!

379
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:39,248
- Did you... did you find it?
- Not exactly.

380
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:46,353
Hey, what's the holdup?
Come on.

381
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:03,339
You are gonna owe me
so big for this.

382
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:19,720
Get the rig out!

383
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:31,638
Shit!

384
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:49,556
You still there?
Can you hear me?

385
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:51,752
- I'm here.
- All right.

386
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:54,057
We're getting us
a charger.

387
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:58,523
- Sorry, excuse me, I'm sorry.
- Hey!

388
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:01,194
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
excuse me, I'm sorry.

389
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:02,760
Excuse me, excuse me!

390
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:04,704
- Hey, there's a line.
- I know, I'm sorry.

391
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:06,297
Excuse me,
I need a charger.

392
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:08,605
Sir, you need
to wait your turn, okay.

393
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:10,702
And we're having a special today
on cheetah spots.

394
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:13,270
- If you're feeling fierce.
- Ooh, how fun.

395
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:15,112
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, sir.

396
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,742
- Just a second...
- I'm with a customer.

397
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,720
If you'll just take a number, somebody
will be with you shortly.

398
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:21,483
We also have this one here.

399
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:24,720
Hey, hey, listen, I've got a
life-and-death call on this phone.

400
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,693
My battery is about to die.
You have a charger?

401
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,525
Sure, yeah, why don't you
take a number, okay?

402
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,121
And one of our sales
associates will help you

403
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:31,757
when your turn
comes around, excuse me.

404
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,392
No, no, my battery's
gonna die.

405
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,733
Excuse me, miss, please,
I have an emergency.

406
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,136
Sorry, sweetie, I'm
on break. Take a number.

407
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,403
No, I don't want
to take a number.

408
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:43,570
Come on,
this is ridiculous.

409
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:51,476
Screw this.

410
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,232
Oh, my god!

411
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:12,973
Now who's gonna give me
that goddamn charger?

412
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:19,038
- Dude, here's your charger.
- Thank you.

413
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,807
- Hey, Jack?
- Hey, Bob.

414
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:25,081
I sent a kid up
to see you guys this morning.

415
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,849
He had a phone with him,
some woman on the other end.

416
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:29,049
An abduction, something
like that... you do anything with that?

417
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,785
You know, I've been stuck
down at City Hall all morning

418
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,622
doing press on these
gang killings,

419
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,423
- but, uh, I'll ask around for you.
- Would you?

420
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,123
- Sure. All right.
- Thanks.

421
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:39,725
Hey, Bob, you know,
I was thinking about it.

422
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:42,828
You and Mare,
you'll do great with that beauty parlor.

423
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:46,864
It's a day spa.

424
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,347
Aw, shit.

425
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,988
Jess, are you there?
Pick up. Jessica!

426
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,082
Honey, listen to me,
you have to get out of the house

427
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:40,458
as fast as you can. Something's
happened. There's no time to explain.

428
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:43,396
Just get Ricky and meet me at our place
in left field, honey. I love you.

429
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:46,093
I'll explain
to you later, now go.

430
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,197
All right, we're good.
We got a charger.

431
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,639
Oh my God!

432
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,392
Do you want to die here?

433
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,457
Oh, shit!

434
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:23,330
No, please.

435
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:26,534
My family hasn't done
anything to you.

436
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,843
Your husband left a message
asking you to meet him in left field.

437
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,745
Where is that?

438
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:38,241
What? l... I don't know.

439
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:41,346
I don't know.

440
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,858
Go to the window.

441
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,167
There's something
I want you to see.

442
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,371
Dimitri, bring him out.

443
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:37,033
You got three seconds
to tell me where left field is,

444
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:39,239
or you're never gonna see
your son again.

445
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,771
Oh, God. Oh, God!

446
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,209
One...

447
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:52,885
...two...

448
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:58,027
He's a baby, you bastard!
He's a baby!

449
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:01,001
- Yeah, come on...
- He's a baby, he's a baby!

450
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:02,434
What's the matter
with you, huh?

451
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,064
He's a baby,
he's a baby!

452
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:10,373
Yeah, you wanna play?
You wanna play?

453
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:13,005
You wanna play
with me? Huh?

454
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,697
Your time is up.

455
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:33,496
Oh, God!
No, no, no, no, no.

456
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,900
- Your son is dead.
- No, no, he's not.

457
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:38,098
No, no, no, no, no!

458
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:42,735
It's a bar.
It's a bar in LA.

459
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,378
- What?
- It's a bar

460
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,407
at LAX.

461
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,347
We got him.

462
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,790
Put the kid in the garage.

463
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:02,661
When I didn't show up
for work this morning

464
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:04,961
someone called the police,
I'm sure.

465
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:07,331
You better hope they didn't.

466
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,715
You know...

467
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:26,277
all I care about is the safety of my
son, that's all I care about. I will...

468
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,288
- Shut up!
...cooperate with you. I will...

469
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:30,517
- Shut up.
- l... I just...

470
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:32,651
no, I just want
to tell you, l...

471
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:35,254
Hey, hey, hey! can you
turn that down?

472
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:36,729
Can you turn that down,
please?

473
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,829
- I just want you to know...
- Shut up.

474
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,462
Shut up!

475
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:05,688
Ethan, what the hell
are we doing, man?

476
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:07,388
This is turning into
a bunch of bullshit.

477
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:10,363
- Man, you gotta chill out.
- LAX, let's go!

478
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:16,001
Jessica?

479
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:22,440
Jessica, come on,
say something.

480
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,707
I'm... I'm here.

481
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:27,442
Ah. You knew where he was,
Jessica.

482
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,347
If you know stuff,
you got to tell these guys.

483
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:32,511
Don't you get it, Ryan?

484
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:35,317
After they find Craig,

485
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:37,324
we're all going to die.

486
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:39,826
You don't know that.
Don't think that way.

487
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:42,853
We've all seen their faces.
They can't let us live.

488
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:46,697
I feel so helpless.

489
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,999
It's my family.

490
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:30,005
- Miss Martin?
- Yes?

491
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:34,481
- Jessica Kate Martin?
- Yes, can I help you, Mister...?

492
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:38,542
I'm sorry.
Officer Mooney.

493
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,180
Ms. Martin, did you call
the police today?

494
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,190
No.

495
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,125
We had a report
of a possible kidnapping.

496
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,220
You haven't been
kidnapped today, have you?

497
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:50,628
No.

498
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:53,361
I'm sorry
to have disturbed you then.

499
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,801
Oh, no problem,
thank you, Officer.

500
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,477
- Yeah?
- It's Bayback.

501
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,920
- What is it?
- We had a visitor, a cop.

502
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:17,015
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's taken care of.

503
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:18,685
Good.

504
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,019
Oh, God.
If they find Craig...

505
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:25,828
Hey, listen to me.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

506
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:28,392
I'm gonna beat them
to the airport.

507
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,166
Do you hear me?

508
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:35,699
Yes, I hear you.

509
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:38,337
- Okay.
- Thank you.

510
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:43,183
Thank you
for doing all this.

511
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:46,553
So what does that guy
look like,

512
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:48,487
that guy you were
talking to?

513
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:51,320
Um, uh...

514
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,523
black jeans,
a brown leather jacket,

515
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:58,589
close-cropped hair,
that's about it.

516
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,624
What else, what else?
What was he driving?

517
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:03,330
Just shut up.

518
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:05,339
Wait, what?
Jessica, I can't hear you.

519
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:07,364
- I'm sitting in it right now.
- Yeah?

520
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,273
- Hello?
- It's a brand new Porsche Carrera.

521
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,868
- The partners gave it to me.
- Great.

522
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:14,541
Mm-hm, sugar.
Brand new, arctic blue convertible.

523
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:17,380
It goes zero to 60
in 5.2 seconds.

524
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:19,909
Takes the girls' panties down
in 3.5 seconds.

525
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:23,390
- Jessica, you still there?
- Hey, this is a private call.

526
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:25,915
No, I'm here.
But you're breaking up.

527
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,690
Get off my line!
Mom, are you still there?

528
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:30,697
Hey, hey, listen,
this woman needs help.

529
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:32,494
Uh, actually no,
you're gonna need help

530
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:34,330
uh, when you pull my subpoena
out of your asshole

531
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:35,892
for not getting
off my line.

532
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:37,996
Jessica, Jessica,
don't hang up.

533
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,906
Can you hear me?
Whatever happens, don't hang up.

534
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:42,967
- Honey?
- What? Yeah, hey, Jess,

535
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,534
don't... don't hang up.

536
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:47,547
Hey, just be yourself, Jess.
Just get off my line, man.

537
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:49,446
- Jessica.
- Jessica! Jessica!

538
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:51,951
- Jessica, can you hear me?
- Who's Jessica?

539
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,044
Shit!

540
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:57,046
Please,
please, listen to me.

541
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:01,027
I've been kidnapped.
I don't know where I am.

542
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:03,121
They murdered
my housekeeper.

543
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:04,893
Wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

544
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:08,060
Murdered your housekeeper?
That... that's really cute.

545
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:10,127
Um, A) Shut up,

546
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:12,765
B) You can't bullshit
a lawyer, baby girl,

547
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:14,365
Do you get that?

548
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:17,741
Okay? I get paid $600 an hour
to listen to shit like this.

549
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:19,871
So you want me
to bill you?

550
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:22,781
That's fine. Bill me anything you want.
Just help me.

551
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:26,184
I will pay you...

552
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,626
What the hell
is your problem, man?

553
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,661
What the hell is your problem?
You want to tussle?

554
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:47,230
- Give me your phone!
- Oh snaps.

555
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:48,832
Give me your phone!

556
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:50,901
Ryan? Is that you?

557
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:52,173
Yeah, I'm here, Jessica.

558
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:54,113
Hey, Jess,
your buddy's here.

559
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:56,616
Look, give me your phone
or I shoot your car.

560
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,117
Oh, hell no, hell no.

561
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:00,620
Why would you want to do
something awful like that?

562
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,687
Move!

563
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:12,525
I'm really sorry about this.

564
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:14,261
But I need your car.

565
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:15,962
- Oh, come on, dude, I'm not...
- Look,

566
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:18,528
- Okay. Yeah, that's fine.
- I need your car.

567
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,365
Ryan, i-is that you?

568
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,503
It's okay, Jessica,
I'm here.

569
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:27,036
- Oh, I thought I'd lost you.
- Have fun.

570
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,571
I'm sorry.

571
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:39,455
W-What's happening?

572
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,791
It's okay. Our lines got crossed with
some lawyer. It's all right.

573
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:44,525
- I got his phone. I got his car.
- Okay.

574
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,863
- Shit.
- What is it?

575
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:50,200
It's a tunnel!

576
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:53,468
Whoa, whoa! Jesus!

577
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:55,498
- What's happening?
- Get out of the way!

578
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:56,737
Can you back up?

579
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,768
I can't. There's traffic.

580
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,008
You can't loose me.

581
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,308
Do you hear me?

582
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:05,784
I'm backing up.

583
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:22,302
Oh, look who's coming back.
Awesome! Come on, buddy.

584
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,531
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, are you?

585
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:26,631
Suck it!

586
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,771
Oh, I am in deep shit!

587
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,552
- Shit!
- What?

588
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:51,087
- They're already here.
- Ryan, just find Craig.

589
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,259
Don't worry,
don't worry.

590
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,427
I got them.

591
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:06,572
This is the final
boarding call for Orly,

592
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:08,946
flight 180,
with service to Paris...

593
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:17,921
Okay, what does
your husband look like?

594
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,391
Please have your
boarding passes ready

595
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,257
before entering
the security checkpoint...

596
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:23,525
About six feet tall,

597
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:27,728
really good shape, 40s.

598
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:30,293
What else?
What's he wearing?

599
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:33,272
Blue jeans, blue jeans,
he wears blue jeans all the time.

600
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:36,174
A Lakers jacket.
He had that on this morning.

601
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,236
No, it's ridiculous.

602
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,111
Okay, man,
I'll call you later.

603
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:49,114
Have a wonderful trip,
Mr. Clouseau.

604
00:41:49,156 --> 00:41:51,317
Ah, oui-oui.

605
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,031
I'm sorry, excuse me.

606
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:01,557
Or I miss
my flight.

607
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:27,724
This is code red,
code red.

608
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:29,319
Concourse A.
Security checkpoint.

609
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:31,058
Excuse me.
Step this way, please.

610
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:32,998
- Is there a problem?
- Is this your jacket, Sir?

611
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:34,523
- Yeah.
- He's got a gun.

612
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:35,694
Wait, wait!

613
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:37,260
Down, down, down!

614
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,566
Don't move, don't move.

615
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:41,541
- Stay down.
- All right, take it easy.

616
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:44,169
We're police officers.
What's the matter with you?

617
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:47,078
Look in the goddamn tray.
Check my ID.

618
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:49,105
He's a cop.

619
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:52,583
All right, back off.

620
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,645
That's what
I was trying to tell you.

621
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:56,815
Jesus Christ, Jessica,
these guys are cops.

622
00:42:56,857 --> 00:43:00,122
What the hell
is going on here?

623
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,355
This doesn't make
any sense.

624
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:05,422
All right,
I see "left field."

625
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:09,232
Do you see Craig?
Do you see him?

626
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,032
- I got him.
- Oh, thank God!

627
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:18,442
- Don't ask questions, just follow me.
- Get off me.

628
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:21,107
- Trust me. Your wife sent me.
- What?!

629
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,116
Look, they are here and they are
looking for you.

630
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,015
- They already have your family.
- What are you talking about?

631
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:27,145
Just let me explain it
to you, just trust me.

632
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,279
- Here, here he is.
- What?

633
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:30,449
Okay.

634
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,632
- This is it.
- Yeah.

635
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:45,404
Hey, bro, this isn't
my wife, okay?

636
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:48,966
My wife's name is Patty.
My name is Ed. Good luck.

637
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:21,198
You goddamn animals
better not have hurt them.

638
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,232
Animals?

639
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:31,007
We just recovered
the stolen vehicle.

640
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:32,678
It's heading
to Quicksilver Towing.

641
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,517
We're gonna have a look around
for the suspect.

642
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:37,183
Shit!

643
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,675
- Craig! No! No!
- Jess! Jess!

644
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:02,375
No!

645
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:06,182
Here she is. We've got your kid.
Now where is it?

646
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,520
Tell them, tell them they've got the
wrong family. That it's a mistake.

647
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:15,221
Oh, God, Jess, I'm sorry!
This isn't a mistake.

648
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:17,355
Listen to me.
I've made arrangements.

649
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,366
It's in a safety
deposit bo x.

650
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,927
And it's got special instructions that
if anybody gets to it...

651
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,165
No! No!

652
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:26,194
Stop it!

653
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,208
Here is the deal, Craig.

654
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:30,676
Either you give us
what we want,

655
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:33,475
or I blow her brains
all over you right now.

656
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:35,880
Your call. It's an 85¢
bullet to me, Craig.

657
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:41,017
Okay, okay, please, please, God.
Please don't hurt her, please.

658
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:43,716
It's in our bank
in Century City.

659
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:45,349
Please, don't hurt her.

660
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:47,257
- Please! I love you, Jess.
- No! No!

661
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:49,819
You'll have help
in the bank.

662
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:52,923
Please, don't hurt her, please!
Jess, I love you!

663
00:45:52,966 --> 00:45:56,367
- Please, don't hurt her.
- No!

664
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:59,338
Ryan, they've gone
to the Brenner Building

665
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,933
on Olympic
and Century Park.

666
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:05,467
Hey, change of plan.
I gotta get to Century City fast.

667
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:16,981
This definitely has
a smoother feel.

668
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,083
And the fruit acid
is still...

669
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:21,287
burning the shit
out of my face.

670
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:24,388
Okay, well then I think we're definitely
gonna have to go with this pink one.

671
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:27,366
No, Mare, it's
highway robbery.

672
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:29,369
What about the...
the other blue one?

673
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:31,462
No, I didn't like
the way that one dried.

674
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:33,166
I think it's the uh...

675
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,300
I think it's the live algae
in this one.

676
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:37,310
Mare, listen to me.

677
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:39,471
I'm not being
negative, okay?

678
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:41,538
But I think
this is bullshit.

679
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:44,517
Live algae
at $80 a pop?!

680
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,143
And we're rubbing it
on our face?

681
00:46:46,186 --> 00:46:48,245
Do you know how much algae
there is in the world?

682
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:50,256
Honey, this one works.

683
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:53,987
Yes, but maybe it's
the... the collagen.

684
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:56,325
No, sweetie,
they all have collagen.

685
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:58,456
I have to get that
'cause it might be the painter.

686
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:05,703
Authorities are asking
for your help

687
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,139
in identifying this man
believed to be responsible

688
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:10,473
for today's
bizarre string of crimes.

689
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:14,641
It started with a robbery
at gunpoint of a 457 cellular store.

690
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:18,208
We were afraid he was gonna try to rob
the cash registers.

691
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,847
But all he ended up doing
was buying a charger.

692
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:24,653
Buying?! He bought that charger.
He paid for it?

693
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:27,751
Yeah, actually
he overpaid it.

694
00:47:27,794 --> 00:47:29,762
'Cause we have
this sale going on.

695
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:32,731
Well, There you have it,
a bizarre twist in today's crime spree...

696
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,427
a criminal who appears
at least at moments

697
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:36,197
to be honest.
Back to the newsroom.

698
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:38,033
He continued his crime spree

699
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:41,666
by stealing an $80,000
Porsche Carrera at gunpoint.

700
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:45,200
I basically got cut off
by this young man,

701
00:47:45,245 --> 00:47:46,974
very good-looking,
in a security car.

702
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,505
And he was on the phone
talking to his friend, Jessica

703
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,984
who was supposedly
"kidnapped."

704
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:53,850
Whatever the...
like... you know...

705
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:56,185
and then, uh, basically he just
held me up at gunpoint

706
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:58,589
and stole my Porsche.

707
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,102
Directory assistance.

708
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,661
Yeah, I need the number
of a residence, please.

709
00:48:11,705 --> 00:48:14,902
Jessica Martin
in Brentwood.

710
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:19,003
That number is 555-6763.

711
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:21,037
For an additional 40...

712
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:30,122
Hi, you've reached
the Martins.

713
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,752
Leave your number
and we'll call you back.

714
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:05,816
She had an accent...

715
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:15,833
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

716
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:26,202
Thank you.

717
00:49:45,032 --> 00:49:46,624
Whoa, hey!

718
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:55,768
I'm sure once all
the paperwork is done...

719
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:58,607
we should be getting it
in the next four or five days...

720
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,820
Yeah.

721
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:11,983
Ryan, what are you
going to do now?

722
00:50:12,025 --> 00:50:14,391
I haven't had a clue
what I was doing all day.

723
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:24,367
Mr. Martin. Oh, my...
are you all right?

724
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:26,235
Car accident, I'm fine.

725
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,504
I just need to get
back into my deposit bo x.

726
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:33,475
I don't know what's in it.

727
00:50:33,513 --> 00:50:36,243
I just know
if they get it, we're dead.

728
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,945
JT, will you show Mr. Martin
to his deposit bo x?

729
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:41,078
Don't let them
get it, Ryan.

730
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:06,838
Excuse me.

731
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,973
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- What's going on?

732
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,048
- No!
- Get some help.

733
00:51:14,087 --> 00:51:16,419
Run!

734
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,585
Drop your weapon.

735
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:23,494
L.A.P.D., lock the building down.
Dimitri, get him out of here.

736
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,084
No.

737
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:09,928
Shit!

738
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,403
Damn it!

739
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,872
Deason, back of the building,
back of the building now.

740
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:11,894
Ethan, he's gone.

741
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,640
It's heading
to Quicksilver Towing.

742
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,041
We're gonna have
a look around for the suspect.

743
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:31,641
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

744
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,711
Follow that tow truck.

745
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:57,674
Craig Martin here.

746
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,839
Now this building has 5,000 square feet
to use as offi...

747
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,541
What the hell?

748
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:04,948
Jesus.

749
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:11,322
Are these cops?
What are they doing?

750
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,195
Waste this guy.

751
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,723
All right.
Light 'em up, boss.

752
00:55:21,768 --> 00:55:23,668
Who they? ...what the...

753
00:55:23,703 --> 00:55:26,797
Oh, Jesus.

754
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,469
Oh, God! Oh, Je...

755
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,343
Jack, get that asshole.

756
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:37,980
Shit.

757
00:55:46,626 --> 00:55:48,617
I'm a dead man.

758
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:11,275
Ms. Martin?

759
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,986
Ms. Martin!

760
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:23,317
Police.
Anybody here?

761
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,992
Police officer.

762
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:25,417
27 years!

763
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:27,851
27 years
without this shit!

764
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:32,525
Where's Jessica Martin?

765
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:33,924
Who are you?

766
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,689
I am a cop.

767
00:58:46,873 --> 00:58:49,137
Shit.

768
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,212
9-1-1.

769
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:57,114
Yes, Operator,
I'm a police officer.

770
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:01,951
I need paramedics
to 3270 Bonhill Road.

771
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:04,582
3270 Bonhill Road.

772
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,615
One moment, please.

773
00:59:20,773 --> 00:59:23,037
All right, no, no, no,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

774
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:25,067
Would you just
give me back my goddamn car?

775
00:59:25,111 --> 00:59:28,046
Don't take that tone
of voice with me, sir.

776
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:30,641
I already told you.
We do not release vehicles

777
00:59:30,683 --> 00:59:32,014
until all impound fees
are paid.

778
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:33,882
Hey, you know what?
That's really awesome.

779
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,821
But guess what? I did not ask for it
to get impounded, okay?

780
00:59:36,856 --> 00:59:38,824
I got carjacked.
Do you know what that is?

781
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:41,725
A carjacking? Where a jackoff comes up
to you, sticks a gun to your head

782
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:45,128
and says... hey, buddy, get out of... I
was car... I had it stolen from me.

783
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,132
Sir, you want
your car back or not?

784
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,396
Do I want my...

785
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:51,699
I don't know... let me think
about it for a second...

786
00:59:51,738 --> 00:59:54,002
yes, but I'm not
paying for it.

787
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:57,434
Howie, take her
on back.

788
00:59:57,477 --> 00:59:58,910
Howie? Howie... no.
Howie!

789
00:59:58,945 --> 01:00:02,244
Howie, cut it out.
You're not...

790
01:00:02,282 --> 01:00:04,307
just... okay, fine.

791
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,614
That's fine, it's fine.
It's all bad.

792
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:09,520
I'm just gonna... this is what I'm gonna
do... I'm gonna pay you, okay?

793
01:00:09,555 --> 01:00:10,954
Never mind, Howie.

794
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:14,153
Who do I make it out to?
Lady who sucks? Is that it?

795
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,854
I tell you right now,
here you go.

796
01:00:15,895 --> 01:00:18,921
One scratch on the car
and guess who gets an ass whip...?

797
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:21,092
Hey, that's my car!

798
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:23,898
That's my car! Oh, no, this isn't
happening, this isn't happening.

799
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:26,200
That ain't Howie.

800
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:38,109
Thank you. Yes.

801
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:44,918
Well, you missed
all the major pipes.

802
01:00:44,957 --> 01:00:46,720
And you're gonna need
about five stitches.

803
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:50,422
But some of this tissue
looks gangrenous.

804
01:00:52,332 --> 01:00:55,233
That's avocado mud mask.

805
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:57,702
It's for combination skin.

806
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:06,239
Moon? You all right?

807
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:08,372
Yeah.

808
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:12,242
Can you give us
a minute, fellas?

809
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:17,817
Jack, I didn't know
she was a cop. l...

810
01:01:17,857 --> 01:01:20,451
Hey, Moon, take a breath, okay?
It's gonna be okay.

811
01:01:22,295 --> 01:01:25,492
You just gotta tell me exactly
what happened here.

812
01:01:25,531 --> 01:01:28,261
I don't know. I'm still trying
to figure it out.

813
01:01:28,301 --> 01:01:31,236
I went inside. I clearly identified
myself as a cop

814
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,965
and she just
opened fire on me.

815
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:35,997
She didn't say a word.
She just started shooting.

816
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:38,340
I checked her ID.
Dana Bayback...

817
01:01:38,378 --> 01:01:41,939
Bayback...? No.
I never heard of her.

818
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:44,882
She was pretending
to be Jessica Martin.

819
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,612
Hold on a second.
Who's Jessica Martin?

820
01:01:46,652 --> 01:01:48,950
The woman who owns
the house.

821
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:52,219
And I think the real Jessica Martin
is in trouble, Jack.

822
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:59,494
Did... did Bayback... did she say anything
to you at all, anything?

823
01:01:59,532 --> 01:02:01,659
Nothing.

824
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:04,602
She never had a chance.

825
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:09,174
It's gonna be okay.

826
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:21,874
Hello?

827
01:02:27,191 --> 01:02:29,751
Hello? Are you there?

828
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:33,058
You little bitch.

829
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,512
I wanna know who
you were just talking to.

830
01:02:57,755 --> 01:03:00,019
No! Ow!

831
01:03:02,426 --> 01:03:06,226
First I'm gonna kill you,
then I'm gonna kill your little kid.

832
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:11,193
Oh, you wanna play?

833
01:03:16,874 --> 01:03:18,842
What did you do to me?

834
01:03:18,876 --> 01:03:22,937
10th grade biology.
Brachial artery

835
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:29,175
pumps 30 liters
of blood a minute.

836
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:31,915
But there's only five
in the human body.

837
01:03:31,955 --> 01:03:35,015
I'm sorry. God!

838
01:03:42,032 --> 01:03:43,021
Bitch!

839
01:04:20,804 --> 01:04:23,534
- Mom!
- Ricky.

840
01:04:25,943 --> 01:04:29,435
Ricky? Baby, are you okay?

841
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,947
I can't get out of here.

842
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:34,139
Yeah? Ethan!

843
01:05:34,178 --> 01:05:37,545
- You better take this.
- What is it?

844
01:05:37,581 --> 01:05:39,378
I got what you're
looking for.

845
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:41,681
- Oh?
- Yeah.

846
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:44,017
Okay, and what I do
for it?

847
01:05:44,055 --> 01:05:45,522
What?!

848
01:05:45,556 --> 01:05:48,389
What I do for what I looking for?
You tell me now.

849
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:49,916
Wait, who's this?
What number did I call?

850
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:51,861
You call me
on the payphone.

851
01:05:51,896 --> 01:05:53,591
You waste my time.
I have pictures to draw.

852
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:55,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude.
Chill out.

853
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:58,095
No, you don't tell me what to chill.
My mother tells me to chill.

854
01:05:58,135 --> 01:06:00,535
I sit here, I draw people
telling me to chill out all the time.

855
01:06:00,571 --> 01:06:02,903
You don't tell me what to chill.
I chill you.

856
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,908
Chad!

857
01:06:04,942 --> 01:06:07,137
I thought you said
you had this under control.

858
01:06:07,178 --> 01:06:09,840
- It is.
- Oh, really?

859
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,370
Why don't you ask
Bayback about that?

860
01:06:11,415 --> 01:06:14,043
I heard about the cop.
She handled it already.

861
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:17,077
Oh, yeah? She handled that before
or after he killed her?

862
01:06:17,121 --> 01:06:19,214
What?

863
01:06:19,256 --> 01:06:22,521
Bayback is dead.

864
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,393
A cop was investigating
Jessica Martin's disappearance.

865
01:06:25,429 --> 01:06:27,260
Something about some kid
who tipped him off.

866
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:30,096
- He knows too much.
- Mooney doesn't know shit.

867
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:32,534
And let's just leave
the thinking to me, okay?

868
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:41,503
Go back to the bank,
get the video of the kid.

869
01:06:41,545 --> 01:06:44,605
Check every frame till you find one we
can use to ID that son of a bitch.

870
01:06:44,648 --> 01:06:46,673
You got it.
Dimitri!

871
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:58,617
Ricky!
Listen to me.

872
01:06:58,662 --> 01:07:01,597
Get away from the window.

873
01:07:01,632 --> 01:07:03,896
Do you see the cabinet
in the corner?

874
01:07:03,934 --> 01:07:06,027
Go over there
and get behind it.

875
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,265
No! Don't leave me!
Don't leave me.

876
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:10,432
No, I'm not
gonna leave you.

877
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:13,204
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

878
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:15,212
I'm gonna take you home.

879
01:07:15,246 --> 01:07:18,079
Okay, Mommy.

880
01:07:56,253 --> 01:07:58,153
Get outside now!

881
01:07:58,189 --> 01:08:00,657
Come on, baby,
get in the back seat.

882
01:08:00,691 --> 01:08:03,683
Get down, hurry!

883
01:08:14,138 --> 01:08:16,197
Get down.

884
01:08:24,315 --> 01:08:26,783
Get out of the car now.

885
01:08:26,817 --> 01:08:28,512
Mom.

886
01:08:28,552 --> 01:08:30,349
- Get out of the car.
- No!

887
01:08:30,387 --> 01:08:33,117
No, don't!

888
01:08:33,157 --> 01:08:36,422
- Get out of the car.
- No, don't! Don't!

889
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,293
You wanna save
that boy here?

890
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:40,524
Get out of the car,
you bitch!

891
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:42,429
Don't, no!

892
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:46,266
Get out, bitch!

893
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:52,942
- Who did you tell?
- Nobody.

894
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:54,740
Lying bitch!

895
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:56,837
Who is that kid at the bank?

896
01:08:56,881 --> 01:08:59,281
I don't know...

897
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:02,376
You are dead.
Your family is finished.

898
01:09:07,892 --> 01:09:09,860
Bad timing, Tanner.

899
01:09:09,894 --> 01:09:12,362
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

900
01:09:17,768 --> 01:09:19,565
How did you get
this number?

901
01:09:19,603 --> 01:09:21,696
Well, modern technology
is amazing, you know.

902
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:23,969
My phone remembers
the last 50 incoming calls.

903
01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:25,270
What do you want?

904
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:27,436
I want the woman
and her family.

905
01:09:27,478 --> 01:09:29,969
Okay, now let me tell you
what I want.

906
01:09:30,014 --> 01:09:32,073
I want you to tell me
where you are right now.

907
01:09:32,116 --> 01:09:35,085
Or bad things are gonna happen
to this little family.

908
01:09:37,454 --> 01:09:40,252
Sorry,
it doesn't work that way.

909
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:44,751
Oh, really?
Go cut the kid's throat.

910
01:09:44,795 --> 01:09:47,730
Fine. You lost.
Nice talking to you.

911
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:57,900
Ring.

912
01:10:00,945 --> 01:10:03,846
Come on, ring.

913
01:10:03,881 --> 01:10:05,508
Ring!

914
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,020
Get the point?

915
01:10:12,056 --> 01:10:14,320
You're playing
with fire, kid.

916
01:10:14,358 --> 01:10:17,225
Yeah, know what? You're lucky I'm still
talking to your sorry ass, all right?

917
01:10:17,261 --> 01:10:20,924
From here on out, you do as I say,
exactly as I say.

918
01:10:20,965 --> 01:10:24,867
Or I slap this bitch on "Nightline"
and call it a day, okay?

919
01:10:27,671 --> 01:10:29,696
So how do you want
to do this?

920
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,435
Santa Monica Pier.

921
01:10:31,475 --> 01:10:33,102
No. Too busy.

922
01:10:33,143 --> 01:10:35,236
Yeah, that's kind
of the idea, dickhead.

923
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:39,911
How will I recognize you?

924
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:41,941
You let me
worry about that.

925
01:10:41,986 --> 01:10:43,715
Give me a number
I can reach you.

926
01:10:43,754 --> 01:10:47,986
555-0167.

927
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:51,152
I can hardly wait.

928
01:10:51,195 --> 01:10:53,220
Me too.

929
01:10:55,282 --> 01:10:56,306
Yeah?

930
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,716
- Where's your cop friend?
- He's right behind me.

931
01:10:58,752 --> 01:11:01,186
We're making a trade with the kid
at the Santa Monica Pier.

932
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:03,951
- Your boy can ID him.
- All right, I'm on it.

933
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:08,617
So how's he looking?

934
01:11:08,662 --> 01:11:10,630
He needs to go
to the hospital.

935
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:12,393
- Why? What's up?
- No, it's nothing.

936
01:11:12,433 --> 01:11:13,991
Come on, what's up?

937
01:11:14,034 --> 01:11:16,628
We caught a break with that kid that
robbed the cell phone store.

938
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,160
That's the kid
who was in the station.

939
01:11:18,205 --> 01:11:20,469
Yeah well, we know he is at
the Santa Monica Pier,

940
01:11:20,507 --> 01:11:23,135
but no one can ID him.
No one knows what he looks like.

941
01:11:23,177 --> 01:11:26,078
I do. I saw him this morning.
I can point him out to you.

942
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:29,082
Absolutely not. You need to get stitches
or it's gonna open up again.

943
01:11:29,116 --> 01:11:31,710
Here, you take care of him.
I can wait 20 minutes.

944
01:11:31,752 --> 01:11:33,049
You're sure
you're up for this?

945
01:11:33,086 --> 01:11:35,486
Come on, let's solve
this goddamn thing.

946
01:11:35,522 --> 01:11:37,922
All right.

947
01:12:10,724 --> 01:12:12,715
Ethan, I'm here.

948
01:12:19,433 --> 01:12:22,527
- Dimitri,
- I'm in position.

949
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:28,007
You here?

950
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,509
Yeah.

951
01:12:30,544 --> 01:12:33,308
Showtime, he's on.

952
01:12:33,347 --> 01:12:35,315
So now what?

953
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:37,647
First you show me
the Martins are okay.

954
01:12:37,684 --> 01:12:41,484
There's a black van in the parking lot
at the northwest corner,

955
01:12:41,522 --> 01:12:43,820
next to the Spy Sunglass
truck.

956
01:12:44,825 --> 01:12:46,793
Okay, I can see it.

957
01:12:46,827 --> 01:12:50,558
He's within
visual of the van.

958
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:53,589
Now look at
the passenger side window.

959
01:12:55,469 --> 01:12:57,096
Deason, show the woman.

960
01:13:01,408 --> 01:13:03,968
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

961
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:05,774
We found him yet?

962
01:13:05,812 --> 01:13:07,803
No, I don't see him.

963
01:13:07,848 --> 01:13:10,180
He's the one on the cell phone,
you idiot.

964
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:15,279
Everybody's
on a cell phone.

965
01:13:15,322 --> 01:13:17,722
Six feet tall,

966
01:13:17,758 --> 01:13:19,726
Caucasian,

967
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,729
light brown hair,
sandy hair, about 20.

968
01:13:22,763 --> 01:13:25,163
I wish I could remember
what he was wearing.

969
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,128
Your turn, now you show me
something.

970
01:13:29,169 --> 01:13:33,902
- No, first you let them go.
- I don't think so.

971
01:13:33,941 --> 01:13:36,409
Not until after
you give me the camera.

972
01:13:36,443 --> 01:13:39,003
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that.

973
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:41,207
You know, it does me no good
to hand over the videotape,

974
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:42,943
then you guys
turn around and take us out.

975
01:13:42,983 --> 01:13:45,178
I swore I wouldn't do that.

976
01:13:45,218 --> 01:13:48,381
Like you swore
to protect and serve?

977
01:13:50,357 --> 01:13:52,382
- Look, it's your choice.
- Excuse me.

978
01:13:52,426 --> 01:13:55,918
Either the Martins or the videotape.
Either way, I'm walking in five minutes.

979
01:13:55,963 --> 01:13:58,329
I'm warning you.
Shit!

980
01:13:58,365 --> 01:14:00,925
I cannot believe you.
Where have you been?

981
01:14:00,968 --> 01:14:05,234
- Chloe!
- Here. There he is.

982
01:14:05,272 --> 01:14:08,435
I got him. He's across from the arcade
talking to some girl.

983
01:14:08,475 --> 01:14:11,410
Damn it, Ryan, you know
how long I waited for those t-shirts?

984
01:14:11,445 --> 01:14:12,935
That was so important to me.

985
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,039
Look, I can explain it to you.
I just can't do it right now.

986
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:17,448
It's not safe. There are
people after me right now.

987
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:20,180
God, I tried to call you
and your phone is off.

988
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,983
Hey, kid, I've been
looking for you.

989
01:14:22,022 --> 01:14:24,149
It's me, Mooney
from the police station.

990
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:25,988
- Shit!
- No, wait, wait, wait,

991
01:14:26,026 --> 01:14:28,290
wait a second, it's... ouch!

992
01:14:28,328 --> 01:14:30,353
Hey, there you are, kid.

993
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:31,989
You run, everyone dies.

994
01:14:32,032 --> 01:14:34,398
Would you relax?

995
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:36,459
He's a cop.
He's with me.

996
01:14:36,503 --> 01:14:39,097
Jessica Martin?
You were right.

997
01:14:39,139 --> 01:14:40,936
I got the kid.

998
01:14:40,974 --> 01:14:43,033
Copy.

999
01:14:43,076 --> 01:14:45,135
We're all good
here, right?

1000
01:14:47,514 --> 01:14:50,779
- Hey, Mooney, you don't look so hot.
- Nah, I'm all right.

1001
01:14:50,817 --> 01:14:53,377
No, I wanna get you over to the hospital
and get that checked out.

1002
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:56,184
- This is detective Dimitri, C.I.D.
- Hey.

1003
01:14:56,223 --> 01:14:58,191
Get him over to the hospital.
Get him looked at.

1004
01:15:01,762 --> 01:15:05,289
Just relax, will you?
You're in good hands.

1005
01:15:05,332 --> 01:15:08,199
Yeah.

1006
01:15:08,235 --> 01:15:11,170
Will someone please explain to me
what's going on?

1007
01:15:12,906 --> 01:15:14,897
Who is she?

1008
01:15:16,843 --> 01:15:19,437
She's nobody.
I've never seen her before.

1009
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:24,983
Let's go have a little chat about
Jessica Martin, huh?

1010
01:15:46,173 --> 01:15:48,641
God, that felt good.

1011
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:56,616
This... this is nothing.

1012
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:59,141
Except my wife is gonna kill me
when she sees it.

1013
01:15:59,186 --> 01:16:01,620
That is it.

1014
01:16:01,655 --> 01:16:02,952
All right, we've got it.

1015
01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:06,720
We're all done here.
Take care of the Martins.

1016
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,127
Tanner... we can take care of him
back at the safe house,

1017
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:11,960
not here.

1018
01:16:44,898 --> 01:16:48,390
Dude! What are you doin'?
I was like...

1019
01:16:48,435 --> 01:16:49,663
take a walk.

1020
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:56,739
Shit!

1021
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:01,409
Yeah-ah!

1022
01:17:15,896 --> 01:17:19,093
Now get up! Up!

1023
01:17:23,703 --> 01:17:25,762
Put them on.
Put them on.

1024
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:41,217
You were gonna shoot me?

1025
01:17:48,962 --> 01:17:53,831
It's all right.
I'm a policeman.

1026
01:17:53,867 --> 01:17:56,267
That's a very bad man.

1027
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:09,242
The kid's in a boathouse
under the pier.

1028
01:18:09,282 --> 01:18:11,716
Copy that?

1029
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:13,719
Ethan, you copy that?

1030
01:18:13,753 --> 01:18:15,880
Copy.

1031
01:18:32,138 --> 01:18:34,265
Last chance, kid.

1032
01:18:34,307 --> 01:18:37,470
You come out now,
I'll make it easy on you.

1033
01:18:40,113 --> 01:18:42,104
Okay then.

1034
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:46,911
You wanna do it this way?

1035
01:18:51,191 --> 01:18:53,523
Cocky little piece
of shit!

1036
01:19:20,553 --> 01:19:23,647
Time's up.
Bye-bye.

1037
01:19:40,006 --> 01:19:43,464
Oh, shit.

1038
01:19:49,816 --> 01:19:53,479
Do you have any idea how much trouble
you've caused me today?

1039
01:20:02,429 --> 01:20:04,954
Who are you?

1040
01:20:04,998 --> 01:20:07,262
How did you get involved?

1041
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,858
I just answered my phone.

1042
01:20:12,605 --> 01:20:13,594
Shit.

1043
01:20:16,776 --> 01:20:18,744
You're pathetic.

1044
01:20:18,778 --> 01:20:20,905
The bitch has
more fight than you.

1045
01:20:23,149 --> 01:20:24,582
Come on.

1046
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:36,852
Okay, that's enough.

1047
01:20:42,202 --> 01:20:45,000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!
Please. Please!

1048
01:20:45,038 --> 01:20:47,006
Let him up.

1049
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,668
Help me.
They're dirty cops.

1050
01:20:49,709 --> 01:20:52,735
He attacked my partner.
He tried to kill me.

1051
01:20:52,779 --> 01:20:54,474
I said let him up.

1052
01:20:54,514 --> 01:20:57,347
You're gonna believe
this lying piece of shit over a cop?

1053
01:20:57,384 --> 01:20:59,011
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

1054
01:20:59,052 --> 01:21:01,020
What's important is that
you believe

1055
01:21:01,054 --> 01:21:04,581
I would put a bullet in your skull
if you don't let him up.

1056
01:21:04,624 --> 01:21:07,559
They kidnapped Jessica Martin
and her family.

1057
01:21:07,594 --> 01:21:10,085
- Hands in the air.
- What?!

1058
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:11,825
Do it, now!

1059
01:21:14,901 --> 01:21:17,529
Turn around.

1060
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,399
Drop the gun.

1061
01:21:29,783 --> 01:21:32,616
We've got to get out of here.
Stay with me.

1062
01:22:00,613 --> 01:22:04,947
Ah, God, aah.
My leg.

1063
01:22:04,984 --> 01:22:07,145
Stay there.

1064
01:22:07,187 --> 01:22:09,212
Okay.

1065
01:23:09,682 --> 01:23:11,206
No.

1066
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:18,682
- Mom, no!
- Ricky, look at me. Look at me, son.

1067
01:23:18,725 --> 01:23:21,523
Look at me.

1068
01:25:19,812 --> 01:25:24,010
All right, Mom, hurry.

1069
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:26,484
Mom!

1070
01:25:43,469 --> 01:25:45,869
Ryan.

1071
01:25:49,709 --> 01:25:51,438
Jessica.

1072
01:25:55,581 --> 01:25:58,072
It's okay, it's over.

1073
01:26:09,562 --> 01:26:11,154
Through, please...

1074
01:26:11,197 --> 01:26:14,291
- Absolutely ridiculous.
- Save it.

1075
01:26:14,334 --> 01:26:17,929
Oh, Bob, thank god.
Will you back me up here?

1076
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,733
I'm getting set up,
man, l...

1077
01:26:19,772 --> 01:26:22,172
Hey, sorry to interrupt. Have you guys
seen these new phones?

1078
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,870
They're amazing.
They've got technology

1079
01:26:24,911 --> 01:26:27,573
and features like...

1080
01:26:27,613 --> 01:26:29,376
video recording.

1081
01:26:29,415 --> 01:26:31,576
Moon, don't listen
to this punk.

1082
01:26:32,652 --> 01:26:34,279
They destroyed
the original recording

1083
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,015
but not till after I copied it
into my phone.

1084
01:26:36,055 --> 01:26:38,285
It's footage of this officer
and his men

1085
01:26:38,324 --> 01:26:40,519
robbing and murdering
two drug dealers in an alley.

1086
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,891
This is total bullshit.

1087
01:26:41,928 --> 01:26:44,658
Jack, did I ever tell you
how much I hate dirty cops?

1088
01:26:44,697 --> 01:26:47,530
I think those chemicals
from your beauty parlor

1089
01:26:47,567 --> 01:26:49,296
are getting
your brain, Moon.

1090
01:26:49,335 --> 01:26:52,600
It's a day spa,
you fuck.

1091
01:26:55,241 --> 01:26:56,503
Get him out of here.

1092
01:27:13,226 --> 01:27:15,251
Are you all right?

1093
01:27:15,294 --> 01:27:18,058
Yeah, it's...
fine.

1094
01:27:18,097 --> 01:27:22,534
l... I don't know if there's
anything I could ever do...

1095
01:27:22,568 --> 01:27:24,968
thank you.

1096
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:29,105
I do.

1097
