00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:14,561
You done
drinking that?

780
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:18,931
Who is Sugar?

781
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:19,999
This time,
I want the truth.

782
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:22,534
All right. Fine.

783
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:24,737
The truth is, he's a two-bit,
drug-dealing loser

784
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:26,539
who used to be
Mike's neighbor.

785
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:29,442
You've got quite the sense of humor,
don't you, Mr. Axe?

786
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,178
I do hope a life in prison
doesn't beat it out of you.

787
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,047
Got that bastard.

788
00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:35,348
Exact location?

789
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:37,217
He's hiding in the second
structure from the back.

790
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,553
Ground level,
the entrance by the alleyway.

791
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,521
Reading should be accurate
within 2 meters.

792
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,089
Tell Fuller
to get his team ready.

793
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:45,091
We need to take Westen
before his backup gets here.

794
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:49,429
Good luck.

795
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:51,098
Let's go!

796
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,332
All right,
target is located

797
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,700
in the second structure
from the back.

798
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,702
He's at the ground-level
alley entrance.

799
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,739
We know he's armed.
Prepare for full breach.

800
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:00,875
And I want running updates
on the fly.

801
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:02,409
Okay, looks like
Mike pulled it off.

802
00:34:02,477 --> 00:34:04,444
But she's still got one guy
for backup.

803
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,212
This won't be
as easy as we thought.

804
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:10,250
Fuller:
Target's location surrounded.

805

Preparing to breach.

<i>Thwarting a breach attempt</i>

807
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:16,391
<i>typically involves</i>
<i>meeting force with force,</i>

<i>Without a blasting cap, C4 is</i>
<i>really just flammable clay.</i>

811
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,173
<i>Luckily, C4 doesn't</i>
<i>have to explode to be useful.</i>

812

<i>When your goal is to scare</i>

Go!
Go, go, go, go!

00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:51,962
Riley:
Where's Westen?

820
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,164
Clearing the structure now.
Stand by.

821
00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:55,499
Do not
let him get away.

822
00:35:11,514 --> 00:35:13,616
Target has retreated
to second level.

823
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:17,820
Bradley,
do you have a shot?

824
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,455
Bradley: Negative.
Target is in the room.

825
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:21,090
Awaiting clean shot.

826
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:23,059
Damn it, Fuller!
What's taking so long?

827
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:24,194
Get your team in there.

828
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:29,699
Take him down now.

829
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:31,134
Whatever it takes,

Do not hesitate

Jesse: Fuller,
do not take the shot.

832
00:35:57,227 --> 00:35:59,629
I repeat,
do not take the shot.

833
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:04,968
Agent Riley, confirm
your order to stand down.

834
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:06,236
Please confirm stand-down.

You can have the honor
of calling the rest of your dogs off.

837
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:14,577
Confirmed.

838
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:16,746
All units, stand down.

839
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:25,822
Nicely done -- commanding,
but not trying too hard.

840
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,358
I hope you realize this is the
biggest mistake you've ever made.

841
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:29,960
Because it just became
my mission in life

842
00:36:30,027 --> 00:36:32,428
to put you behind bars --
all of you.

843
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:34,497
Lady, you sure know
how to make a guy feel special.

844

<i>A spy gets used to</i>
<i>having enemies.</i>

<i>It's just part of the job.</i>

<i>But you never expect</i>
<i>to be hated at home.</i>

<i>Allies become enemies,</i>

So, this is what becomes
of the great Michael Westen.

854
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,624
Murderer, kidnapper,
traitor.

855
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,625
There's more to this, Riley,
than you know.

856
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:40,560
Card killed my brother,
he tried to kill --

857
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:42,062
To kill you, too?
[ Chuckles ]

858
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,764
Yeah, Mr. Axe told me
your sad story.

859
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,033
Unfortunately,
the evidence in the hotel room

860
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,868
tells a completely different
story.

861
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,837
And then there's the fact
that you ran.

862
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:52,905
I didn't know who was
coming through that door --

863
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:54,373
somebody who wanted
to know the truth

864
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,008
or somebody
working with Card.

865
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:57,143
What <i>is</i> the truth,
Mr. Westen?

866

[ Sighs ]

867
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:04,117
Card was running unauthorized
Ops around the globe,

868
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:06,053
and he wasn't
going to stop.

869
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:07,922
He used Anson.
He used Gray.

870
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:09,523
He was trying to use <i>me.</i>

871
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:12,493
Now, I didn't betray my country.
I was trying to <i>protect</i> it.

872
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,669
Whoa.

00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:25,806
Now that I know
your side of the story,

00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:27,174
I want you to know...

875
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:31,679
...I don't care.

876
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:35,617
You killed Tom Card --
one of our own.

877
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:37,853
And your friends
helped you escape.

878
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:41,056
You are now enemies
of the United States of America,

879
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:43,692
and it's my job
to make sure you face justice.

880
00:38:47,397 --> 00:38:49,966

some helpless old woman.

903
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:18,151
I served them lemonade
and pretended I was...

hard of hearing.

905
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:20,620
Anyway, eventually
they started talking

906
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:21,621
like I wasn't even there.

907
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:25,893

Thanks, mom,
but they'll be coming back.

909
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:31,666
You still need
to leave.

910
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:33,033
Yeah,
I thought of that.

911
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:35,870
And then I came up
with a better idea.

912
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:37,638
I'm staying
right at home.

913
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:39,106

Michael.

915
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,445
If all you guys
are going into hiding,

916
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:47,481
you're gonna need a lifeline
to the outside world.

917
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:50,384
You wanted to leave. I think
that's the best thing to do.

918
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:51,585
And now
you want to stay.

919
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:53,220
I was angry.

920
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,588
I still am.

921
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:57,824
There's a part of me

that will <i>never</i> get over

If I don't forgive you,
I'll lose <i>you,</i> too.

924
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,769
I'm staying.

00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,542
This is a fight

Well,
you have two choices.

You can give up now...
