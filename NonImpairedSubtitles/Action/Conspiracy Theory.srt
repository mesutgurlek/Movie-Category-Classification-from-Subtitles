JERRY: July eighth, 1979. . .

2
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:21,729
. . .all the fathers of Nobel Prize
winners were rounded up. . .

3
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:24,442
. . .by United Nations military units. . .

4
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,610
. . .and actually forced at gunpoint. . .

5
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,606
. . .to give semen samples
in little plastic jars. . .

6
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:34,045
. . .which are now stored at Rockefeller
Center underneath the ice skating rink.

7
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,528
I wouldn't want to be there
for the thaw.

8
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,961
I mean, it's disgusting!

9
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,005
You know what they put in the water?

10
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:43,363
Fluoride!
Yeah, fluoride.

11
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:46,686
On the pretext
that it strengthens your teeth!

12
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,886
That's ridiculous!
You know what this stuff does to you?

13
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:52,323
It actually weakens your will. . .

14
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,009
. . .takes away the capacity for free
and creative thought. . .

15
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,925
. . .and makes you a slave to the state.

{y:n}Conspiracy Theory

17
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:05,131
Ever wonder about these right-wing
militia groups and survivalist types?

18
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:09,003
They say they're defending
the country from U.N. troops.

19
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:13,525
They're yelling so loud,
my theory is that this is a conspiracy:

20
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,485
They are the U.N. troops.
They're in place!

21
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:17,684
The infrastructure's ready.
It's a fait accompli.

22
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:19,964
They'll just take over,
we'll all be toast.

That's what I said, Oswald.

24
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:26,168
He said, "I'm just a patsy,"
which means he didn't do it, right?

25
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,364
Armand Hammer goes to the doctor.

26
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:30,445
The doctor says, "Armand. . .

27
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:34,646
. . .you've only got 3 minutes to live".
And he says, "That's terrible news."
28
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:37,731
"Isn't there anything you can
do for me, Doc? 3 minutes"?

29
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:40,607
And the doctor says,
"Well, I can boil you an egg".

30
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,372
I guess not.

31
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:47,689

"Got Milk"?

Son of a bitch!

JERRY:
"Eat beef"?

37
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:05,171
That's like saying, "Smoke cigarettes"
or "Drive cars." It's really generic.

38
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,963
This guy looks at me and says, "You
think you're living in a free country"?

39
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,528
"You think it's a democracy?
Of course not".

40

Web sites, newsletters,
self-published manifestoes. . ..

They think we're kooks.

42
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,884
George Bush knew what he was saying
when he said, "New World Order".

43
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:21,885
You remember those three little words?

44
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:26,132
He was a 33rd degree Mason,
and as ex-director of the CIA. . .

45

send conspiratologists everywhere. . .

their own credibility.

Sister, I'm sure your heart's
in the right place, but. . .

49

. . .somebody's got to lift
the festering scab that is the Vatican.

50
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:47,648
A chip for identification so they can
track down an animal anywhere he's at.

51
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:51,403
You'll insert it under the dog's skin
and it's an identification thing.

52
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,571
I mean,
it's only a small logical step. . .

53
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:56,969
. . .till they start putting it
in us and our children.

54
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,803
Then before we know it,
they'll come with the pretext. . ..

55
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:06,048
Is that one of the new $100s with
the changed picture of Ben Franklin?

56
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,561
Look at him.

57
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:10,765
He looks like the love child
of Fred Mertz and Rosie O'Donnell.

58
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,368
That's him.
Get rid of it, lady.

59

See the metal strip in it?
That's a tracking device.

If you got any more of those at home,
get rid of them.

61

They'll follow you. They know where
every one of those $100s is going.

They're everywhere.

Oh, there was nobody in here!

Someone's got a roof garden.
Ripe for the picking.

155
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:07,124
That's it.
Health food.

156
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:10,805
That's disgusting! What is that?
You really don't need it.

157
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,966
I didn't leave this open.

158
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:17,529
Somebody's been up here.
Oh, I'm not the only one with a key.

159
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,169
Right where I left you.

160
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:28,006
Return to sender.

161
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:30,242
Disgusting!

162
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,209
GUARD 1:
Jerry. . .keys.

163
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:44,842
JERRY: How come this is safe for me,
but not the keys.

164
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,049
Smart girl.

165
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,644
GUARD 2: How's that, Jer?
JERRY: Justice.

166
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,366
She wears a blindfold.

167
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:07,730
GUARD 3: You have an appointment?
JERRY: Naturally.

168
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:10,686
GUARD 2: Can you show us a slip?
JERRY: I'm not wearing one.

169
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:15,411
WILSON: Good morning, Claudia.
- Good morning.

170
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:18,924
This is what you wanted.
Your coffee's on your desk.

171
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,411
WILSON:
People, give me this room.

172
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,529
Not you, Miss Sutton.
You stay.

173
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:31,246
This is a request
from you for 18 wiretaps. . .

174
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:35,606
. . .on the Ezekiel Walters case,
a case we are no longer investigating.

175
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:38,051
I'm doing it in my spare time.

176
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,291
This is the Justice Department,
not Alice Sutton, P.I.

177
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,686
Walters got life on the bank bombing.
Until we get new evidence. . .

178
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:47,446
. . .this case is closed.

179
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:51,650
Do you know what it's like
to think you know what happened. . .

180
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,332
. . .but to never be sure?

181
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:57,369
I've been here 20 years, Alice.
I know what it's like.

182
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,366
Until you've investigated your own
father's murder, you have no idea.

183
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,132
JERRY:
Alice Sutton knows me.

184
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:08,051
GUARD 2:
You're making it hard on yourself.

185
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,210
CLAUDIA:
{y:i}Ms. Sutton's psychotic's here again.

186
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:12,529
WILSON:
I want him out of here right now.

187
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:15,407
(SCREAMING) I have a right!
I am an American citizen!

188
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,888
I demand to see Alice Sutton!

189
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,327
This guy's a restraining order
waiting to happen.

190
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:24,762
Can I see Alice Sutton?

191
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,009
GUARD 2: No, he can't.
He needs an appointment.

192
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,329
I have a right to be here.
She'll tell you that.

193
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:30,762
Get him out.

194
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,290
I haven't done anything wrong!

195
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,052
ALICE:
Officers, I'll take him from here.

196
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,449
I'm Alice Sutton.
Sorry.

197
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:47,083
Hi, Alice.

198
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:49,651
You need to make appointments.

199
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:53,972
Can I make one now? ln a few minutes?
I can wait if you're busy.

200
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:57,092
Come around.

201
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:01,051
ALICE:
I don't see the connection.

202
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:05,770
Come on! Six major earthquakes
in 3 1/2 years and the space shuttle. . .

203
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:08,851
. . .in orbit for every one.
Don't you think it's strange?

204
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:11,089
ALICE: Testing some
top secret seismic weapon?

205
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:14,490
Not testing. Using.
Nukes are passé. We're talking. . .

206
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:16,412
. . .the weapon of the future.

207
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:18,490
What's it got to do
with the President?

208
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:22,243
JERRY: The President's in Europe
at the moment. Tomorrow he'll be. . .

209
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:26,167
. . .in Turkey,
right here along this fault line.

210
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:28,888
And they sent up
a space shuttle yesterday.

211
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:30,162
Motive?

212
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:33,607
How about $50 billion?
How's that for a motive?

213
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:36,970
Here, let me get that.

214
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:41,485
The President's cutting funding to NASA,
the milk cow of the aerospace industry.

215
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:46,164
ALICE: You're saying that NASA's going
to kill the President with an earthquake?

216
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:49,127
- Do you still ride?
- Not for years.

217
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,847
Why do you keep the picture of you?
Kind of wish you hadn't quit?

218
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:54,081
The earthquake.

219
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,091
Not exactly the kind of thing. . .

220
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:59,524
. . .a Secret Service agent can
just throw himself on top of, is it?

221
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:01,692
Mr. Wilson needs you.

222
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:02,883
Thank you.

223
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,285
She always burst in like that?

224
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:10,805
Yes, that's her job. I have to go.
My boss is looking to yell at me.

225
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,687
You want me to talk to him,
smooth things out for you?

226
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:16,885
No, I want you to go home
or wherever it is that you go.

227
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:20,085
And make appointments.
You can't just keep bursting in.

228
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,249
It's just what they'd be expecting.

229
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:23,530
Jerry.

230
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:29,123
I have a serious job here.
I have a boss I must answer to.

231
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:31,772
Do you understand that?

232
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:35,645
I'm sorry.
You're right.

233
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,161
ALICE:
Use your common sense.

234
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:39,444
Deal.
So are you going to warn him?

235
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:40,643
Who?

236
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:42,163
The President.

237
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,051
I won't promise you anything.

238
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,644
You think I'm crazy.
She thinks I'm crazy.

239
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,163
No, Jerry, I think you're different.

240
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:55,525
You know, to be normal
in the real world. . .

241
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:58,168
. . .and to drink Coca-Cola and eat. . .

242
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,171
. . .Kentucky Fried Chicken. . .

243
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:03,365
. . .you got to be in a conspiracy
against yourself.

244
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:06,447
Want to go out sometime?

245
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,170
So, what's your horse's name?

246
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:20,562
Johnny Dancer.

247
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:25,006
You've been here a dozen times,
you never asked that before.

248
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,887
I was waiting till
I got to know you better.

249
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:36,808
I'd say eight, actually. . .

250
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:38,647
. . .times.

251
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:42,170
Times I've been here.
Eight.

252
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:58,242
JERRY:
Hey, pal!

253
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:01,804
Don't these water mains
usually go in the wintertime?

254
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,408
All I know is it's beaucoup overtime.

255
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:18,882
Feds.

256
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,492
No, not Feds.

257
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:23,050
These guys got a purpose.

258
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,051
It's government plates.

259
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:27,451
There's something fishy going on.

260
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:29,961
Bet my balls.

261
00:22:30,293 --> 00:22:32,568
Here they come.
Camera!

262
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,451
SURVEYOR:
Sir, he's in the building now.

263
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:43,283
Spooks! I knew it!

264
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:47,442
Yes, sir.

265
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:12,167
JERRY: Surprise counts for something.
You're good.

266
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:14,051
You've been watching me a while?

267
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,563
I'm told I have eyes
in the back of my head. . .

268
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:19,526
. . .but I didn't even
see you guys coming.

269
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,925
You must be spooks?
Spooks?

270
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,532
CIA spooks, right?

271
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:26,122
Say something.

272
00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:31,408
I was right.

273
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:33,922
Right about what?

274
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:37,691
No, I wasn't right.
I was wrong.

275
00:24:39,493 --> 00:24:43,008
You guys are from NASA! That's right!
You're from NASA! Come on!

276
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:44,248
No, not the eyes!

277
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:05,763
What?

278
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,125
JONAS: We've been looking
for you a long time.

279
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:13,807
Do I know you?

280
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:16,332
Very well.

281
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:22,128
Have you ever. . .

282
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:25,325
. . .been in a place
from which hope is gone?

283
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:28,163
Where all that's left. . .

284
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:30,012
. . .is patience?

285
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:36,332
Now, Jerry. . .

286
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:39,289
. . .to whom have you been talking?

287
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:43,970
I talk to lots of people.
I drive a cab, you know?

288
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:47,450
JERRY: I meet people all day.
JONAS: Who else knows what we know?

289
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:50,802
What?

290
00:25:51,573 --> 00:25:53,052
What we know, Jerry.

291
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,210
JERRY:
What?

292
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:56,643
Tell me what?!

293
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,969
What do we know?

294
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:03,690
If I know what we know, I could tell you
what we know and if someone else knows!

295
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:06,569
You got to be more specific.

296
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:19,128
What is that?

297
00:26:21,173 --> 00:26:22,970
Gravy for the brain.

298
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:26,089
JERRY:
Not gravy!

299
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:28,287
Please!

300
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,603
Not gravy.
No, not gravy!

301
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:35,769
Don't do this to me, please!

302
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,252
(JERRY SCREAMS)

303
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:42,892
JONAS:
Now, Jerry. . .

304
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:45,212
. . .to whom have you been talking?

305
00:26:45,493 --> 00:26:47,211
JERRY:
No, I've had gravy!

306
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:52,049
I know you.

307
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:55,521
You know now, Jerry.
Now you know.

308
00:26:55,813 --> 00:26:58,452
- I don't know! Help me!
- Who else knows, Jerry?

309
00:26:58,733 --> 00:26:59,768
Who else knows?

310
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,805
- Who knows?
- Help me!

311
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:04,482
What do you know?
Who have you been talking to?

312
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:06,331
Help!
Help!

313
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:15,206
I know I must share
some of the blame for this.

314
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,969
I wish it didn't have to be this way.

315
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:25,051
To whom have you been talking?

316
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:30,924
Who else knows?

317
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:40,882
JERRY:
I believe.

318
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:42,242
I believe!

319
00:27:45,093 --> 00:27:46,651
- Who else knows?
- I don't know.

320
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:50,492
Jerry, names!

321
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:52,570
I don't want to dance!

322
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:54,969
To whom have you been talking?

323

(JONAS SCREAMS)

324
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:10,129
Now he knows!

325
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,172
Now he nose!

326
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:25,165
He's flying!

327
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,405
JERRY:
You wouldn't do this if you knew!

328
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:48,762
Alice!

329
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,249
I want to see Alice Sutton!
There she is.

330
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,444
There she is.
Alice!

331
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:56,287
Alice, this is it!
They tried to. . . .

332
00:30:57,613 --> 00:31:00,252
I don't know what they tried,
but I know. . . .

333
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:03,286
I don't know what I know,
but I know that it's big.

334
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:04,767
Will you let me talk?

335
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,127
Cut it out, will you?
Get back!

336
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:13,808
Get back.
Please, just give me that gun.

337
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:15,731
And roll it over here.

338
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,046
Will you get back?

339
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,523
JERRY:
I need to talk to you.

340
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:24,485
You want to talk to me?
Here I am.

Get back!

343
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:33,567
I have to tell you something.

344
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:36,523
ALICE:
Why don't you just take it easy?

345
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,885
Take it real easy with that, okay?
Just take it easy.

346
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,810
You have blood on your shirt.

347
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,564
I bit his nose off!

348
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:50,406
You bit somebody's nose off?

349
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:55,723
Don't get in this thing where
you make me repeat myself. I hate that.

350
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:56,843
Okay.
I'm sorry.

351
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:59,886
Get back,
you dumb complicit sons of bitches!

352
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:02,733
You're looking for a man
with no nose, not me!

353
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:05,445
JERRY: I need to tell you there was a. . .
ALICE: Look at me.

354
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:07,451
. . .like a fish tank.
No goldfish!

355
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:10,293
- And I was in the belly of a whale.
ALICE: Just calm down.

356
00:32:10,573 --> 00:32:12,291
Wheelchair!
I was crippled and. . . .

357
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:15,087
Look at me. I want you
to put the gun down, please.

358
00:32:15,373 --> 00:32:18,331
There was a goldfish.
There wasn't any gravy and I. . . .

359
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:19,765
Jerry.

360
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:21,492
I don't know what to. . . .

361
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,967
Put the gun down.

362
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,043
I'm sorry.

363
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:29,522
It's okay.

364
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:31,442
I'm sorry.

365
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,530
Okay?
Perfect.

ALICE: Take it easy!
Take it easy!

367
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:41,206
My God, you're bleeding!
Call an ambulance!

368
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,328
JERRY: A piece of a wheelchair
poked through me.

369
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:46,732
Back away!
Back away!

370
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,652
Put it away!

371
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,368
JERRY: Oh, Christ!
ALICE: Tell me what happened.

372
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:52,962
I can't.

373
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:57,852
I can't remember.

374
00:32:58,213 --> 00:33:01,205
I can't remember them.
I can't remember me.

375
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:03,292
I can remember you.

376
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:05,282
I remember you.

377
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,290
It's on the tip of my tongue.

378
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:14,651
I'll remember in the morning.

379
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,651
I'm just tired.

380
00:33:18,693 --> 00:33:21,366
I just need some sleep.

381
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:30,602
Open.

382
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:36,726
Open, please.

383
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,686
DOCTOR:
She's for you.

384
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,530
No, nurse.
Don't!

385
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:46,811
What is it? What is it?
I told them. . . .

386
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:48,890
Something to help you sleep.

387
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:51,687
I don't want to sleep,
I want to check out.

388
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:55,443
Why am I handcuffed to this bed?
I'm not a criminal. Please, help!

389
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,566
Alice, you get me out of here.
They gave me some stuff.

390
00:33:58,853 --> 00:33:59,763
You're under arrest.

391
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:02,692
What's the charge?

392
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:05,009
Jerry, you were there.
Figure it out.

393
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:09,764
Try to remember who stabbed you with
the wheelchair or where it happened.

394
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,447
I wish I could explain it
so it all made sense.

395
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:15,842
It's all right.
Just relax.

396
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:17,367
Alice.

397
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:22,292
You got to switch the charts.
Switch my charts with that guy's charts.

398
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:27,564
Don't make me repeat myself. Switch
my chart or I'll be dead by morning.

399
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:30,687
Relax. Go to sleep.
I will see you tomorrow.

400
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:33,203
JERRY: You want to bet?
ALICE: You're just being paranoid.

401
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:35,006
Only because they want me dead.

402
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,761
Please, Alice.
Please, save my life.

403
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:40,402
Switch them.

404
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:43,811
Switch the charts.

405
00:35:18,373 --> 00:35:19,931
ALICE: Could you open this,
please, ma'am?

406
00:35:22,013 --> 00:35:22,923
What happened?

407
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:26,410
COP: Guy came in with a stab wound
and died of a heart attack.

408
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:31,963
You Miss Sutton?

409
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:34,329
They want me to bring you downstairs.

410
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:35,843
Who does?

411
00:35:36,213 --> 00:35:40,092
The FBI, the CIA. You name
the initials, they're down there.

412
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:41,965
Any special reason?

413
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:44,528
They said to bring you
and the body to the basement.

414
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:47,168
And the body's on its way,
so come with me.

415
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:51,045
I just need one minute, please.

416
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:02,848
Thank you.

417
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:05,729
For what?

418
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:08,924
For switching the charts.

419
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:11,489
I didn't switch the charts.

420
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:16,491
It's okay. The guy traded bullets
with an old man in a liquor store.

421
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:18,001
He had it coming.

422
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:21,530
You expect me to believe
that someone came in here last night. . .

423
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,043
. . .and gave him something
to stop his heart?

424
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:27,009
You switched the charts,
you tell me.

425
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:35,483
I've got to go downstairs.
The CIA wants to see your body.

426
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,452
I won't be here when you get back.
I'll keep in touch.

427
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,049
You're handcuffed to the bed.

428
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:47,609
I'll have to chew through my arm.
It's better than hospital food.

429
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:51,163
Thank you.

430
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,846
You saved my life.
Thank you.

431
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:02,012
Heart attacks happen.

432
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,851
I didn't switch the charts.

433
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:09,727
JERRY:
Yeah, you did.

434
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:13,090
You switched them.
You switched the charts.

435
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:18,685
Let's see here.
This is a grueling experience.

436
00:37:24,653 --> 00:37:25,847
COP:
Put that out!

437
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:29,250
There's a government man now.
This is Miss Sutton.

438
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:31,609
LOWRY:
Miss Sutton, Agent Lowry, FBI.

439
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,886
We're waiting for jurisdictional
problems to be cleared.

440
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:37,129
LOWRY: Fletcher's something else.
ALICE: Tell me about it!

441
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:40,485
Police want him for assault.
Secret Service for counterfeiting.

442
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:42,968
We want him for a string
of bank robberies.

443
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:45,369
No one knows
what the CIA wants him for.

444
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:48,808
This CIA shrink. . .

445
00:37:49,093 --> 00:37:51,891
. . .is here to I.D. Fletcher.
They knew each other somehow.

446
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:53,242
Take off the sheet.

447
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,523
JONAS: This isn't him.
WILSON: The chart says "Jerry Fletcher".

448
00:37:57,773 --> 00:37:58,967
Alice.

449
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:05,129
- He's. . . .
- He's what?

450
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:11,091
DOCTOR:
He's having a heart attack!

451
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:13,411
Where's that goddamn cop?

452
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:16,291
Get a crash cart in here, stat!

453
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,323
- A dog bit it.
ALICE: Excuse me?

454
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:28,249
You were going to ask about my nose.
Poor animal is to be destroyed today.

455
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:31,206
- And you feel bad for it?
- It's my dog.

456
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:34,685
JERRY: Oh, no!
I'm sorry.

457
00:38:36,373 --> 00:38:37,328
JERRY:
Nurse!

458
00:38:38,613 --> 00:38:40,126
JONAS:
There he goes!

459
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:44,285
- Open the goddamn gate!
NURSE: No, and you watch your language!

460
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:47,531
FBI, lady!
Open the damn door!

461
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:00,489
Hi, Alice.

462
00:39:01,613 --> 00:39:02,728
You never saw me.

(WOMAN SCREAMS)

464
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:06,803
Shut up!

465
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:08,003
There he goes!

466
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:11,446
LOWRY:
Lady, open the damn door!

467
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,883
JONAS: Open the gate!
Will you open it?!

468
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:20,851
JONAS: You!
Get hospital security.

469
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:23,203
- Block all exits.
- Yes sir. Let's go!

470
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:25,888
Is this guy a psychiatrist
or a field agent?

471
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,852
You want to put your foot down
and get out of there?

472
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:49,727
Come on, buddy.

473
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:53,091
If you only knew
what really happened to Serpico. . .

474
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:55,290
. . .you'd be helping me out right now.

475
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:56,483
Get out of there!

476
00:39:58,613 --> 00:39:59,682
Come on, now!

477
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:01,850
Give me a break.
I'm wounded.

478
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,327
Hands behind your back!

479
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,131
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

480
00:40:36,773 --> 00:40:38,445
He said a dog bit his nose.

481
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:43,687
You got to help me out of this,
Alice, please.

482
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:45,452
I can't make any promises.

483
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:47,132
I'm in a tight spot here.

484
00:40:50,373 --> 00:40:51,806
You look really pretty today.

485
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,410
Your eyes look kind of different.

486
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:56,888
Please, Alice, make an exception.

487
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:03,049
JERRY: Please.
Alice, are you there?

488
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,688
Come back.
Please, don't leave me here.

489
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,122
Thank you.

490
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:13,408
ALICE:
There we go.

491
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:39,042
Have you seen him?

492
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:42,769
- No. Did you see him?
LOWRY: No way to shut this place quick.

493
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:47,131
You have a half-naked man chained
to a bed rail. Just block the exits.

494
00:41:48,293 --> 00:41:49,169
ALICE:
Good idea.

495
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:52,169
Will you keep me company, please?

496
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,932
JERRY: David?
- Carl.

497
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:15,683
I'm sorry, Carl. Dr. Fine.
I want your advice about something.

498
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:19,363
I had a middle-aged guy,
operate on his gallstones--

499
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:23,612
CARL: Do I know you?
JERRY: Of course. Dr. Fine, proctology.

500
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:28,162
So Jerry thinks that NASA is plotting
to kill the President?

501
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:29,852
You already asked me that.

502
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,567
And you have no idea
where Jerry lives?

503
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:36,243
You've asked me that 3 times.
Why keep making me repeat myself?

504
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,330
All right, here's a fresh one.

505
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:41,042
Why you?

506
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:45,611
Your colleague, Mr. Wilson, tells me
Jerry won't talk to anyone but you.

507
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:47,611
That seems. . .

508
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:50,807
. . .oddly possessive behavior to me.

509
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,530
I'm sorry, what was the question?

510
00:42:53,893 --> 00:42:56,407
Why do you insist on
having me repeat myself?

511
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:00,722
Why. . .

512
00:43:01,013 --> 00:43:02,002
. . .you?

513
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:07,292
I think he has a crush on me.

514
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:09,241
How charming.

515
00:43:09,813 --> 00:43:11,007
He has great taste.

516
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:12,928
Now, why him?

517
00:43:13,253 --> 00:43:16,131
Why do you tolerate
his visits to your office?

518
00:43:18,373 --> 00:43:22,685
About 6 months ago, I was leaving work
and 2 guys tried to mug me.

519
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:26,450
Jerry came out of nowhere
and rescued me. That's how I met him.

520
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:33,046
He probably is crazy, but
there's something about Jerry that. . . .

521
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:38,322
I don't know.

522
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,688
I don't have the heart
to tell him to get lost.

523
00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:44,043
I didn't know the CIA
had psychiatrists.

524
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:47,085
We're very specialized.

525
00:43:48,813 --> 00:43:49,563
May I?

526
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:55,807
{y:n}"Veritas".

527
00:43:56,693 --> 00:43:57,762
Truth.

528
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:01,250
What is it they say about truth?

529
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,964
The truth will set you free.

530
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,806
LOWRY:
"Catcher in the Rye".

531
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:41,007
Chapman had that book
when he shot John Lennon.

532
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:43,372
I was just thinking that.

533
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:46,567
Remember the guy that shot Reagan?
John Hinckley?

534
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:49,321
They found a copy of that book
in his apartment.

535
00:44:52,453 --> 00:44:54,409
Weird coincidence.

536
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:57,291
Thanks for your input, officer.

537
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:01,363
Gum. . .

538
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:03,121
. . .keys. . .

539
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:04,882
. . .and a book.

540
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:08,643
Car.

541
00:45:09,493 --> 00:45:10,812
Maybe apartment.

542
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:14,043
This one's odd.

543
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,883
What do you think?
It's got paint on it.

544
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,407
Safety deposit box key.

545
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,083
I'll take that.

546
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:25,042
And that.

547
00:45:30,253 --> 00:45:31,322
You're welcome.

548
00:45:32,133 --> 00:45:33,361
Spooks!

549
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:38,011
What do you say we. . .

550
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:41,366
. . .I don't know,
compare notes on this guy?

551
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:49,883
"Geronimo"?

552
00:45:56,813 --> 00:45:58,292
ALICE:
No, don't!

553
00:45:58,573 --> 00:45:59,483
COP:
Let me have the ticket.

554
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,090
No, I'm here, I'm here!

555
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,210
- There's a "no parking" sign there.
- I see it.

556
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:09,843
- Two cops to give a ticket now?
- These days it takes 2 cops.

557
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:23,446
JERRY: I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

558
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:26,253
Tickets have been coming all day.
Didn't know what to do.

559
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,923
- How'd you know this was my car?
- I didn't. It was a lucky guess.

560
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:32,807
I feel kind of naked.
Could we get out of here?

561
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:36,802
ALICE: Don't tell me you're naked.
- It's a figure of speech. Can we go?

562
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,732
JERRY: Please.
Hurry.

563
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:40,970
People are looking everywhere.

564
00:46:50,293 --> 00:46:52,329
What took you so long?
I was here all day.

565
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:56,083
It takes time to search a hospital.
A lot of people are after you.

566
00:46:56,373 --> 00:47:00,924
They'll put me in the same place as
Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone.

567
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:04,565
Oswald killed the President.
Is that what you're planning?

568
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:06,969
No. Did you call him
about the earthquake?

569
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:08,242
ALICE:
I'll do that.

570
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:12,651
- Can you sit up so I can see you?
- No. I don't want them to see me.

571
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:13,604
Them who?

572
00:47:13,893 --> 00:47:17,522
Them back there. Change lanes.
Watch the rearview mirror.

573
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:19,531
It's a fun experiment.

574
00:47:34,533 --> 00:47:37,047
Did you see it?
Wraparound headlights?

575
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:40,292
Crown Victoria?
FBI. It's a legitimate tail.

576
00:47:41,493 --> 00:47:42,608
As opposed to?

577
00:47:43,413 --> 00:47:45,244
As opposed to serious people.

578
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:50,011
Can you drive this thing,
or do you just like looking good in it?

579
00:47:50,373 --> 00:47:53,365
I suppose you think I should speed up
and try to lose them.

580
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,284
It's what a man would do.
I'm not a man.

581
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:58,003
I noticed.

582
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,487
What are you doing?

583
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:14,883
Agent Lowry.

584
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:17,281
It wasn't my idea.

585
00:48:17,573 --> 00:48:18,722
Jonas?

586
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,292
It's his show for now.

587
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:25,246
You want to get dinner?

588
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:28,730
Interagency cooperation and all?

589
00:48:31,013 --> 00:48:33,208
When I'm ready to compare notes,
I'll tell you.

590
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,562
It's your call.

591
00:48:35,653 --> 00:48:36,608
Good night.

592
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:45,845
See? Wasn't that easier than squealing
tires and knocking over trash cans?

593
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:47,327
Nothing's easy.

594
00:48:47,813 --> 00:48:49,371
You know that guy they arrested in--

595
00:48:49,653 --> 00:48:51,325
How long have we known each other?

596
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:54,967
Six months and 11 days.

597
00:48:56,613 --> 00:48:58,410
Six months and 11 days.

598
00:48:59,253 --> 00:49:00,971
I'll give you one more hour.

599
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:02,482
Where to?

600
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:14,328
Why did we have to go down
to go back up?

601
00:49:17,093 --> 00:49:20,642
JERRY: 'Cause I don't like to
come and go in the same way twice.

602
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:23,925
I just live in there.
I have to get. . . .

603
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:36,888
- Here, you should have this.
- What is it?

604
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:39,926
JERRY: It's my union pin.
I figured, the way you drove. . .

605
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:42,808
. . .you should be in the union.

606
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:46,963
I'd be proud to have you
drive me around in a cab.

607
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:50,402
Come in, please.

608
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:53,129
Give me those.
I'll put them up.

609
00:49:53,973 --> 00:49:56,407
Let me shut the door.
Sorry there's not more room in here.

610
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,172
My keys!

611
00:49:58,853 --> 00:50:00,252
I'll just get the light.

612
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,732
The Jerry Garcia file.

613
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:09,049
I didn't. . . .
Yes, I did!

614
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:12,405
You know why The Grateful Dead
are always on tour?

615
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:17,450
Because they're all British agents,
intelligence agents. They're spies.

616
00:50:19,013 --> 00:50:22,403
Jerry Garcia himself has
a double-0 rating, just like James Bond.

617
00:50:23,013 --> 00:50:24,651
Jerry Garcia's dead.

618
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:27,570
That's what they want you to think.

619
00:50:28,773 --> 00:50:31,765
Is this supposed to protect you
from aliens or something?

620
00:50:32,053 --> 00:50:33,532
No, it's just a beer bottle.

621
00:50:34,293 --> 00:50:35,362
Follow me.

622
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:37,531
Come into my humble abode.

623
00:50:38,293 --> 00:50:39,203
JERRY:
Here we go.

624
00:50:43,013 --> 00:50:43,923
Welcome.

625
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:48,572
Want something to drink?

626
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:50,802
Coffee. . .

627
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:52,402
. . .if that's okay.

628
00:50:52,693 --> 00:50:54,490
No, coffee's our friend.

629
00:50:54,933 --> 00:50:57,049
Coffee's our friend.
It's fine.

630
00:51:11,173 --> 00:51:14,961
I keep the beans in the fridge.
Keeps them fresher, makes better coffee.

631
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:18,928
Papa Leoni told me that.

632
00:51:19,573 --> 00:51:21,291
He's dead now.
Nice old guy.

633
00:51:34,853 --> 00:51:36,252
"I love the delicate shadow. . .

634
00:51:39,653 --> 00:51:41,371
. . .of she wanting me to be".

635
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:45,603
I can't seem to remember
this combination. Want some juice?

636
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:47,449
Sure.

637
00:52:10,053 --> 00:52:11,691
If my universe had a hub. . . .

638
00:52:11,973 --> 00:52:12,723
This would be it?

639
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:15,883
Here.

640
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:18,721
ALICE:
"In the Irons"?

641
00:52:19,013 --> 00:52:22,528
JERRY: Yeah, I've been reading up
on it lately. Equitation.

642
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:24,127
Are these yours?

643
00:52:25,653 --> 00:52:26,768
Yes.

644
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:32,168
But I think this is
what's been causing the problem.

645
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:36,731
This is the third issue this year.
I give you "Conspiracy Theory".

646
00:52:37,653 --> 00:52:39,052
This is my newsletter.

647
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:41,131
I think it's got them scared.

648
00:52:41,613 --> 00:52:44,923
I must have hit a nerve
with one of those articles in there.

649
00:52:45,213 --> 00:52:47,090
They're pissed off about something.

650
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,728
"The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret"?

651
00:52:52,693 --> 00:52:55,526
ALICE: "The Oliver Stone-George Bush
Connection"? Oliver Stone?

652
00:52:56,933 --> 00:52:59,288
Sure.
I mean, he's their spokesman.

653
00:53:01,573 --> 00:53:04,485
You think if anyone
had the information that he's got. . .

654
00:53:04,773 --> 00:53:08,083
. . .and had a podium to shout
it from, they'd actually let him do it?

655
00:53:08,373 --> 00:53:11,365
No, it's quite clear that
he's a disinformation junkie for him.

656
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:16,325
That he's still alive says it all.
He should be dead.

657
00:53:17,813 --> 00:53:19,326
Can you prove any of this?

658
00:53:21,173 --> 00:53:25,132
No. Absolutely not.
A good conspiracy is unprovable.

659
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:31,848
If you can prove it,
they screwed up somewhere.

660
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:33,691
And if that's the case. . . .

661
00:53:34,053 --> 00:53:34,883
ALICE:
They?

662
00:53:35,173 --> 00:53:36,083
They!
Yes.

663
00:53:38,053 --> 00:53:39,122
They who?

664
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:43,686
"They who"?
I don't know.

665
00:53:43,973 --> 00:53:46,646
That's why they call them "they".
And "them".

666
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,412
Where does Jonas fit in?

667
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:54,891
He's one of "they". He's one of them.
He's them. For sure.

668
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:57,130
ALICE:
They. Them.

669
00:53:59,093 --> 00:54:00,731
They must have a secret handshake.

670
00:54:17,493 --> 00:54:18,403
That's it?

671
00:54:19,893 --> 00:54:22,771
No. How would I know?
I'm not one of them.

672
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:24,452
I'm just horsing around.

673
00:54:27,493 --> 00:54:28,926
How many subscribers?

674
00:54:29,653 --> 00:54:31,291
Let's see.

675
00:54:35,013 --> 00:54:35,923
Five.

676
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:41,130
But I think it's probably got
something to do with the economy.

677
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,529
You think one of them
is not who they seem?

678
00:54:46,773 --> 00:54:48,570
You think it might be one of they?

679
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:51,528
That could be.
Of course!

680
00:54:52,173 --> 00:54:53,162
You have a list?

681
00:54:55,093 --> 00:54:56,731
A subscriber's list?

682
00:54:57,173 --> 00:54:58,891
Yes, right over here.

683
00:55:01,253 --> 00:55:04,006
JERRY: I thought you meant
some other kind of. . . .

684
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:12,810
ALICE:
Big Holden Caulfield fan?

685
00:55:19,973 --> 00:55:20,962
Not really.

686
00:55:21,253 --> 00:55:22,845
You just like the story?

687
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:28,090
Not especially, no.

688
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:31,447
You've got a dozen copies
of this book.

689
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:33,442
I know.

690
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:35,522
I know.

691
00:55:39,373 --> 00:55:40,886
There's more of them in here.

692
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:44,972
Under the bed too.

693
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:49,366
I don't know why,
but whenever I see one. . .

694
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:51,132
. . .I have to buy it.

695
00:55:53,653 --> 00:55:55,132
And if I don't see one. . .

696
00:55:55,413 --> 00:55:57,290
. . .then I have to find one. . .

697
00:55:57,573 --> 00:55:58,722
. . .to buy. . .

698
00:55:59,093 --> 00:56:00,651
. . .so I can feel normal.

699
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,046
I don't know why.

700
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:10,651
Did you ever read it?

701
00:56:13,893 --> 00:56:16,088
Yeah, you read this in school.

702
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,807
No one ever gave it to me
to read at school.

703
00:56:19,093 --> 00:56:21,209
That's what they start
when you're young.

704
00:56:21,493 --> 00:56:25,611
When you're little, at school,
they Baden-Powell all the boys and. . .

705
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:27,963
. . .they Betty Crocker all the girls.

706
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:30,091
Then they air condition you.

707
00:56:30,373 --> 00:56:33,524
And they put you in an Easy Bake Oven
and you can't breathe anymore.

708
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:37,691
You must think I'm crazy.

709
00:56:39,653 --> 00:56:41,086
Yeah, right!

710
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:46,009
4, 23. . .

711
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:47,283
. . . 12.

712
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:54,882
That's the combination of the coffee.
Do you still want some?

713
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:02,730
You idiot!

714
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:10,721
We're made.
Gas them.

715
00:57:14,453 --> 00:57:15,852
JERRY: Go!
Tear gas!

716
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,282
Don't breathe!

717
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:23,289
{y:i}AGENT 1: Delta team, are you secure?
AGENT 2: Delta team, secure.

718
00:57:28,693 --> 00:57:29,682
AGENT 1:
Take it down!

719
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:38,642
Clear!

720
00:57:40,613 --> 00:57:41,682
JERRY:
On top of the bed!

721
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:48,330
Move it!
Come on!

722
00:58:04,373 --> 00:58:06,568
ALICE: Are you coming?
JERRY: I'm right behind you.

723
00:58:13,893 --> 00:58:15,212
JERRY:
Close your eyes.

724
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:16,483
ALICE:
What are you doing?!

725
00:58:16,853 --> 00:58:17,922
Torching my hub!

726
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:39,202
ALICE:
What is that?

727
00:58:39,573 --> 00:58:41,609
That was here when I moved in.

728
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,367
ALICE: What are you doing?
JERRY: Always be prepared.

729
00:59:02,453 --> 00:59:04,648
AGENT 1:
Get out now! Go!

730
00:59:12,773 --> 00:59:14,923
JERRY:
The fire's two flights up on the left.

731
00:59:15,213 --> 00:59:16,328
JONAS:
Excuse me.

732
00:59:17,733 --> 00:59:19,007
Clear a path.

733
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,611
- Is that who I think it was?
JERRY: Yes.

734
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:23,849
ALICE:
Has this ever happened before?

735
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:26,124
No, but I've been practicing.
Let's go.

736
00:59:26,413 --> 00:59:27,812
Jerry.
Who are you?

737
00:59:29,413 --> 00:59:31,005
I'm a guy putting out a fire.

738
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:32,810
Let's go.

739
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:38,206
FIREMAN: See this aluminum-looking stuff?
It's firewall.

740
00:59:39,373 --> 00:59:42,683
It's amazing. The guy designed it
so it could be an incinerator. . .

741
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:45,848
. . .leaving the rest
of the building untouched.

742
00:59:46,573 --> 00:59:47,926
Dr. Jonas.

743
00:59:49,893 --> 00:59:51,565
Something else you should see.

744
00:59:51,853 --> 00:59:53,206
I want to hear more.

745
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:55,411
Let's go.
Wrap it up.

746
00:59:59,173 --> 01:00:00,288
You mind?

747
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:24,249
In one hour. . .

748
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:28,287
. . .tell me how she eats, she sleeps,
her kindergarten teacher's name.

749
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:33,967
- Home, safe and sound.
- It only looks safe.

750
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,488
- You can't stay here.
- They're not after me!

751
01:00:36,773 --> 01:00:38,570
Don't turn the lights on.

752
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:41,527
I can stay here with you,
I can sleep on your couch.

753
01:00:41,813 --> 01:00:44,008
- Don't turn the lights on.
- You're going, okay?

754
01:00:44,293 --> 01:00:46,011
- I don't want to go.
- You're going!

755
01:00:46,293 --> 01:00:47,521
I want to ask you something.

756
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:50,486
Ask me to stay.
I could sleep in the bathtub.

757
01:00:50,893 --> 01:00:52,724
- You can't be here alone.
- Shut up.

758
01:00:53,013 --> 01:00:54,685
Get down!

759
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:56,881
What are you doing now?

760
01:00:57,173 --> 01:01:00,324
You don't want to be seen here.
Always make sure these are shut.

761
01:01:00,613 --> 01:01:03,844
Please, just be still, be quiet.
Listen to me, okay?

762
01:01:04,133 --> 01:01:06,044
I think we can make some progress. . .

763
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:10,161
. . .if you just answer
one question to my satisfaction.

764
01:01:10,453 --> 01:01:11,329
I'll try.

765
01:01:13,293 --> 01:01:16,285
It's about the painting
on the wall in your apartment.

766
01:01:17,893 --> 01:01:21,852
I didn't mean for you to see that.
It's like looking in someone's diary. . .

767
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:24,931
. . .and taking it all out of context.

768
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:26,803
That's fair.

769
01:01:27,093 --> 01:01:28,287
It's just that. . .

770
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:34,649
. . .it was so big and you obviously put
a lot of time into it and you seem to. . .

771
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:36,162
. . .know me so well.

772
01:01:36,453 --> 01:01:38,011
How is that possible?

773
01:01:38,853 --> 01:01:40,525
So, what's the question?

774
01:01:41,453 --> 01:01:43,125
How is that possible?

775
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:47,604
This is you and your dad.
He was. . .

776
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:50,805
. . .murdered, right? He was that judge.
It was in the paper.

777
01:01:51,093 --> 01:01:52,765
Did they ever find out. . .

778
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:54,731
. . .how, who did it?

779
01:01:55,013 --> 01:01:57,402
You don't mind me asking you?

780
01:01:59,693 --> 01:02:01,684
You're changing the subject.

781
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,651
He's why you punish yourself?

782
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:08,082
Please, don't start.

783
01:02:08,373 --> 01:02:11,206
You get on the treadmill,
turn your back to that picture. . .

784
01:02:11,493 --> 01:02:12,972
. . .like you're running away.

785
01:02:13,253 --> 01:02:15,687
Sometimes you sing
with the music. . .

786
01:02:15,973 --> 01:02:18,089
. . .but most of the time,
you punish yourself.

787
01:02:18,373 --> 01:02:21,524
I don't know where you get
the energy after a full day's work.

788
01:02:21,813 --> 01:02:25,044
- You run like a maniac. Why?
- What are you talking about? Music?

789
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,893
What are you talking about?
Are you watching me?

790
01:02:28,173 --> 01:02:29,526
What do you do?
Sit in your car?

791
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,769
Do you wait in an alleyway?
Every day?

792
01:02:32,053 --> 01:02:34,965
- It's not like--
- What is it? Tell me what it is!

793
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:38,723
- You don't ride your horse--
- Don't change the subject! Get out!

794
01:02:39,013 --> 01:02:41,766
I will give you $100
to get out of my house.

795
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:44,613
I don't need any money.
I got plenty for a rainy day.

796
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:46,812
Guess what?

797
01:02:47,853 --> 01:02:50,651
- It's pouring out.
- All right, you're tired.

798
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:53,370
Just don't be mad at me, okay?

799
01:02:57,773 --> 01:03:00,924
Use your dead bolts, Alice.
Okay? Just lock up.

800
01:03:22,413 --> 01:03:24,244
I'm going to empty my bladder.

801
01:03:55,533 --> 01:03:57,842
- How's your bladder?
- I got to go. How's yours?

802
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:00,124
No, don't do that.

803
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,891
A lot of folks are looking for you.

804
01:04:05,773 --> 01:04:08,412
I guess that makes you
the smart one.

805
01:04:09,893 --> 01:04:11,611
Put your hands on the wheel.

806
01:04:13,133 --> 01:04:14,805
Both your hands on the wheel.

807
01:04:15,093 --> 01:04:15,843
Thank you.

808
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:16,883
You're welcome.

809
01:04:17,173 --> 01:04:18,208
Don't mention it.

810
01:04:18,853 --> 01:04:20,127
Where's my partner?

811
01:04:20,453 --> 01:04:21,249
Who?

812
01:04:22,213 --> 01:04:23,362
He's okay.

813
01:04:24,013 --> 01:04:27,005
But you got a gun to your head
asking how your partner is.

814
01:04:27,693 --> 01:04:29,092
You might be okay.

815
01:04:30,093 --> 01:04:32,323
He'll have a headache
a couple of days.

816
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:34,771
Are your intentions honorable?

817
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:37,406
I'm not sure what you mean.

818
01:04:39,653 --> 01:04:41,883
With Alice. I mean. . . .

819
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:44,284
Think of me as her guardian angel.

820
01:04:45,413 --> 01:04:49,247
That's ironic because we're here
to protect her from you.

821
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:55,811
No, you're here because you thought
I'd show up, so that's why you're here.

822
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,288
Seemed like a possibility.

823
01:05:00,293 --> 01:05:02,523
What about your intentions?
Are they. . .

824
01:05:02,893 --> 01:05:03,962
. . .honorable?

825
01:05:04,973 --> 01:05:05,883
Yeah.

826
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:07,931
I'm not a violent man.

827
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,602
By nature. . .

828
01:05:09,893 --> 01:05:12,965
. . .I'm not a violent man,
Mr. Lowry.

829
01:05:13,253 --> 01:05:15,448
But if you hurt Alice in any way. . .

830
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:18,167
. . .or anything like that, I'll kill you.

831
01:05:20,453 --> 01:05:22,364
Does that seem honorable enough?

832
01:05:22,893 --> 01:05:24,611
Well, maybe.

833
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:37,205
Are you pretending?

834
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:40,131
Yes, yes--

835
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:43,762
Sorry.

836
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:45,884
It's got to be here.

837
01:06:00,813 --> 01:06:01,882
Thank God!

838
01:06:06,893 --> 01:06:08,292
May I help you, sir?

839
01:06:10,573 --> 01:06:12,723
- I need to scan it.
- Put it through.

840
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:13,843
No, this side.

841
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:15,168
I'll do it.

842
01:06:25,253 --> 01:06:27,483
Bingo! "Catcher in the Rye".

843
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:31,323
Location is 33 East 17th Street,
Barnes and Noble.

844
01:06:32,813 --> 01:06:34,007
Where's. . .?

845
01:06:34,853 --> 01:06:37,048
- I'm putting it in a bag.
- I don't want one.

846
01:06:52,293 --> 01:06:54,090
I got the exact change for you.

847
01:06:54,373 --> 01:06:55,931
Make life easy for you.

848
01:07:04,013 --> 01:07:05,082
Your receipt.

849
01:07:05,773 --> 01:07:06,888
Thank you.

850
01:07:07,813 --> 01:07:09,292
"Catcher in the Rye".

851
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:11,291
It's a classic.

852
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:12,767
Have you read it?

853
01:07:14,053 --> 01:07:15,611
- Never read it.
- Never?

854
01:07:15,893 --> 01:07:18,691
No, I haven't.
I never read it.

855
01:07:27,813 --> 01:07:29,371
We're going silent, guys.

856
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:35,886
Confirm silent.

857
01:07:43,173 --> 01:07:44,731
Could I have a pretzel?

858
01:09:08,373 --> 01:09:09,283
I got him.

859
01:09:17,893 --> 01:09:18,803
There he is.

860
01:09:23,373 --> 01:09:24,283
Just one.

861
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:28,442
Hurry up.

862
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,044
Bomb!
There's a bomb under my seat!

863
01:10:37,573 --> 01:10:40,804
Be calm! Remain calm
and move out in an orderly fashion!

864
01:11:05,813 --> 01:11:06,962
There he is!

865
01:11:23,893 --> 01:11:25,121
I'm not sorry.

866
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:26,887
Leave me alone, will you?

867
01:12:35,413 --> 01:12:37,404
I'm turning into a Jerry.

868
01:13:27,773 --> 01:13:29,206
I've got a cease and desist. . .

869
01:13:29,493 --> 01:13:31,131
. . .on Jerry Fletcher matters.

870
01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:34,644
We're not to discuss him with the press,
NYPD, or anyone else.

871
01:13:35,413 --> 01:13:37,847
Building security
is arresting him on sight. . .

872
01:13:38,133 --> 01:13:41,284
. . .and we're to report any attempt
he makes to contact you.

873
01:13:41,973 --> 01:13:44,646
I don't like it.
Something's not right here.

874
01:13:45,013 --> 01:13:48,085
Dr. Jonas thought you might be
inclined not to cooperate.

875
01:13:48,493 --> 01:13:49,403
Why is that?

876
01:13:51,573 --> 01:13:54,007
We don't know who Dr. Jonas is.

877
01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:55,965
Nor who we're cooperating with.

878
01:13:56,653 --> 01:13:58,928
I've had many credentials
flashed in my face.

879
01:13:59,213 --> 01:14:01,773
And after yesterday,
I know not to ask questions.

880
01:14:02,573 --> 01:14:04,245
We're out.
We're shut off.

881
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:05,727
We're terminated.

882
01:14:07,733 --> 01:14:08,961
Understood?

883
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:13,881
Understood.

884
01:14:29,613 --> 01:14:31,490
They can't see
the trees for the forest.

885
01:14:42,613 --> 01:14:45,491
{y:i}Hi, may I speak
{y:i}with Mr. Ketcham, please?

886
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,252
{y:i}This is Mrs. Ketcham.

887
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:50,491
Hello, Mrs. Ketcham.
Your husband receives our newsletter.

888
01:14:50,773 --> 01:14:53,526
Would he like to renew
his subscription?

889
01:14:53,813 --> 01:14:57,772
{y:i}My husband is dead. He was killed
{y:i}last night in a car accident.

890
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,051
These just came for you.

891
01:15:15,213 --> 01:15:17,090
- Want a vase?
- Yes, please.

892
01:15:19,893 --> 01:15:23,363
"Go out the building to the right.
Take the first bus".

893
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:34,646
Tell Jill I'm expecting
a call from Milwaukee.

894
01:15:34,933 --> 01:15:37,083
- Transfer my calls to my mobile.
- Will do.

895
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:46,523
Got her.

896
01:15:48,853 --> 01:15:50,730
Subject is on the move.

897
01:16:13,933 --> 01:16:15,127
She's on the bus. Go!

898
01:16:15,413 --> 01:16:17,369
Subject on bus 1 648.

899
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:18,881
Will follow.

900
01:16:31,693 --> 01:16:32,728
What the hell?

901
01:16:33,013 --> 01:16:34,162
Keep going!

902
01:17:00,813 --> 01:17:03,247
- Like a Roadrunner cartoon. See that?
- No, what?

903
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:06,411
You didn't see it?
Nobody ever sees what I see.

904
01:17:07,093 --> 01:17:09,448
Where did you get
your five subscribers?

905
01:17:10,453 --> 01:17:13,604
Bulletin board, through library
computers so it couldn't be traced.

906
01:17:14,253 --> 01:17:15,925
They're dead.
4 out of 5 of them.

907
01:17:16,213 --> 01:17:17,965
I checked.
All in the last 24 hours.

908
01:17:18,253 --> 01:17:20,084
1 accident,
2 heart attacks, a stroke.

909
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:22,284
This one I can't reach.
Henry Finch.

910
01:17:22,573 --> 01:17:23,722
They're dead.

911
01:17:24,013 --> 01:17:25,287
I did that.

912
01:17:26,453 --> 01:17:29,047
Heart attacks and strokes, it's CIA.
Henry Finch!

913
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:30,527
Oh, my God!

914
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:33,532
I should've realized.

915
01:17:33,813 --> 01:17:35,610
They monitor absolutely everything.

916
01:17:35,893 --> 01:17:37,531
Elaborate on "they". They?

917
01:17:37,813 --> 01:17:38,802
They?

918
01:17:39,093 --> 01:17:41,368
There's lots of groups, actually.
Lots of initials.

919
01:17:41,653 --> 01:17:44,963
CIA. FBI. IMF, you name it.

920
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,767
They are part of the same
two opposing factions.

921
01:17:48,053 --> 01:17:49,247
Which are?

922
01:17:52,093 --> 01:17:54,288
Some of them are very wealthy families.

923
01:17:54,573 --> 01:17:57,371
Their goal is to maintain stability.
That's what they say.

924
01:17:57,653 --> 01:18:00,451
The other is Eisenhower's
industrial-military complex.

925
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:02,928
And they want instability,
so they say.

926
01:18:03,213 --> 01:18:05,886
So you're saying group one
is warring with group two?

927
01:18:06,173 --> 01:18:08,733
At some levels. But at others,
it's the same group.

928
01:18:09,013 --> 01:18:11,402
Scary! It's hand and glove.
Cold wars, hot wars.

929
01:18:11,693 --> 01:18:13,490
They sit and watch the whole show.

930
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:14,683
Take a breath.

931
01:18:17,133 --> 01:18:21,411
The latest casualty in the whole fiasco
is one of America's richest men:

932
01:18:21,813 --> 01:18:23,371
Ernest Harriman.

933
01:18:24,853 --> 01:18:25,842
He was murdered.

934
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:27,452
- Murdered?
- Here in Manhattan.

935
01:18:27,733 --> 01:18:29,849
I read in the paper. . .

936
01:18:30,133 --> 01:18:33,489
. . .he drowned in a swimming pool.
It was an accident, in Newport.

937
01:18:33,773 --> 01:18:37,402
Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't
even kill Sunny Von Bulow there.

938
01:18:37,653 --> 01:18:39,245
He drowned,
but not in Newport.

939
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:40,602
Where, then?

940
01:18:43,813 --> 01:18:45,929
Here, at the 7th Street
subway station.

941
01:18:46,213 --> 01:18:49,762
A billionaire on the subway?
Why didn't they drown him in his limo?

942
01:18:50,053 --> 01:18:52,726
Don't you read the papers?
Don't you watch TV?

943
01:18:53,253 --> 01:18:55,130
Last week,
this place was under water.

944
01:18:55,413 --> 01:18:57,210
- A water main broke.
- I know.

945
01:18:57,493 --> 01:19:00,485
You know what's above this area?
The Harriman Building.

946
01:19:00,773 --> 01:19:04,163
The whole substructure was flooded.
He didn't drown in a pool.

947
01:19:04,453 --> 01:19:07,365
Call the coroner
in Rhode Island or wherever it was. . .

948
01:19:07,653 --> 01:19:09,609
. . .and ask if he had chlorine
in his lungs.

949
01:19:09,893 --> 01:19:11,531
- Okay, I will.
- You will?

950
01:19:11,973 --> 01:19:13,167
If you want, I would.

951
01:19:13,453 --> 01:19:15,409
I don't know what to say.
I love you.

952
01:19:16,693 --> 01:19:17,603
What?

953
01:19:20,293 --> 01:19:22,409
It's like I resolved to. . .

954
01:19:22,773 --> 01:19:24,684
. . .call you up 1 ,000 times a day. . .

955
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:27,292
. . .ask you if you'll marry me. . .

956
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:29,690
. . .in some old-fashioned way.

957
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:33,210
Everything you do is magic.

958
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:37,725
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.

959
01:19:39,253 --> 01:19:41,323
Yeah, I know that.

960
01:19:44,453 --> 01:19:48,162
I'm nervous. I reached out and
grabbed the first thing I could think--

961
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:52,162
I know they're song lyrics,
but I know how I feel. . . .

962
01:19:52,933 --> 01:19:56,084
I think you're confused.
It's been a long day.

963
01:19:56,613 --> 01:19:59,491
You wanted to know. . .
that picture on the wall.

964
01:20:00,693 --> 01:20:01,842
We shouldn't talk about it.

965
01:20:02,133 --> 01:20:03,691
Yes, we should.
It's Geronimo.

966
01:20:03,973 --> 01:20:06,487
That's love.
And love gives you insight.

967
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:09,446
Love lets you see things
that you wouldn't normally. . . .

968
01:20:10,053 --> 01:20:13,728
I just know that I've loved you
since the first time I saw you.

969
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:17,002
You don't love me.

970
01:20:17,293 --> 01:20:18,362
Sure I do.

971
01:20:19,253 --> 01:20:20,003
I don't?

972
01:20:26,573 --> 01:20:28,529
I thought that. . . .
Well, I thought. . . .

973
01:20:28,813 --> 01:20:30,690
I just thought that maybe. . . .

974
01:20:47,893 --> 01:20:50,566
I'm sorry.
Jerry, I'm sorry.

975
01:21:09,253 --> 01:21:12,006
{y:i}We have a call
{y:i}from the Milwaukee post office.

976
01:21:12,453 --> 01:21:15,763
{y:i}The mail for Henry Finch
{y:i}is being forwarded here to Manhattan.

977
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:17,283
Where?

978
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:20,485
{y:i}Foley Square.
{y:i}The Criminal Courts Building.

979
01:21:47,973 --> 01:21:49,770
I'd like to see Mr. Finch, please.

980
01:21:50,053 --> 01:21:52,487
- Who?
- Henry Finch.

981
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:54,571
Is he expecting you?

982
01:21:55,053 --> 01:21:58,841
I'm Sutton with the Justice Department.
I want to see Mr. Finch immediately.

983
01:22:19,493 --> 01:22:20,972
He'll be right with you.

984
01:22:33,413 --> 01:22:35,290
What the hell is going on here?

985
01:22:35,573 --> 01:22:37,848
I'm very impressed, Alice.

986
01:22:39,253 --> 01:22:41,323
How's Jerry this morning?

987
01:22:41,613 --> 01:22:42,966
A more important question is:

988
01:22:43,253 --> 01:22:44,572
Who are you?

989
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:47,848
Those are bigger questions
than you think.

990
01:22:49,973 --> 01:22:51,201
Please sit down.

991
01:23:01,413 --> 01:23:03,529
For reasons that will soon be. . .

992
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:07,330
. . .regrettably clear,
I'm going to tell you a secret.

993
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:11,366
Then you can judge
what and who I am.

994
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:13,168
Years ago. . .

995
01:23:13,493 --> 01:23:16,565
. . .I worked for
the Central Intelligence Agency. . .

996
01:23:16,853 --> 01:23:20,289
. . .on the MK ULTRA program.
You familiar with it?

997
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:22,965
It was mind control.

998
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:25,244
"Manchurian Candidate" kind of stuff.

999
01:23:26,373 --> 01:23:28,603
That's a vulgar generalization.

1000
01:23:29,613 --> 01:23:31,922
But yes, you take an ordinary man. . .

1001
01:23:32,213 --> 01:23:34,124
. . .and turn him into an assassin.

1002
01:23:34,413 --> 01:23:35,732
That was our goal.

1003
01:23:37,453 --> 01:23:40,809
MK ULTRA was terminated in 1973.

1004
01:23:41,533 --> 01:23:42,648
But. . .

1005
01:23:43,493 --> 01:23:44,812
. . .not the. . .

1006
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:46,486
. . .the research.

1007
01:23:46,973 --> 01:23:48,531
That, I continued.

1008
01:23:50,973 --> 01:23:52,406
Shall I go on?

1009
01:23:54,693 --> 01:23:56,968
"The truth will set you free".

1010
01:24:00,933 --> 01:24:04,005
It involved hallucinogenic research. . .

1011
01:24:05,093 --> 01:24:08,722
. . .electroshock to induce
vegetative states. . .

1012
01:24:09,573 --> 01:24:11,803
. . .terminal experiments
in sensory deprivation.

1013
01:24:12,173 --> 01:24:13,322
Terminal?

1014
01:24:13,933 --> 01:24:15,651
As in, "resulting in death".

1015
01:24:23,173 --> 01:24:25,209
I'm now trying to pay my penance.

1016
01:24:26,773 --> 01:24:30,049
These things that you're talking about,
you did them to Jerry?

1017
01:24:31,853 --> 01:24:36,290
MK ULTRA was science,
sanctioned by the government.

1018
01:24:38,413 --> 01:24:39,448
It all ended. . .

1019
01:24:39,733 --> 01:24:42,042
. . .the moment John Hinckley
shot Ronald Reagan.

1020
01:24:47,413 --> 01:24:49,404
No, that wasn't us.

1021
01:24:50,733 --> 01:24:52,724
But the technology had been stolen.

1022
01:24:53,933 --> 01:24:56,163
Pandora's box opened.

1023
01:24:57,653 --> 01:25:01,282
My subjects were taken from me,
used in the private sector.

1024
01:25:01,813 --> 01:25:03,326
Jerry was one of them.

1025
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:06,410
One of your subjects.

1026
01:25:07,253 --> 01:25:10,165
It is imperative that I discover
who stole the technology.

1027
01:25:11,733 --> 01:25:15,009
Alice, I will do what is necessary. . .

1028
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:18,890
. . .to stimulate Jerry
into telling me what he knows.

1029
01:25:20,813 --> 01:25:22,883
Jerry is very dangerous.

1030
01:25:27,693 --> 01:25:29,445
Jerry has killed.

1031
01:25:39,493 --> 01:25:41,165
To find who programmed Jerry. . .

1032
01:25:41,453 --> 01:25:45,128
. . .I have to find Jerry,
but I can't do that without you.

1033
01:26:02,413 --> 01:26:03,846
Do you recognize this?

1034
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:12,132
Where did you get that?

1035
01:26:12,493 --> 01:26:14,085
You do recognize it, then?

1036
01:26:15,413 --> 01:26:16,812
Of course I do.

1037
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:20,333
It belonged to my father.
Where did you get it?

1038
01:26:22,613 --> 01:26:25,286
What do you know
about your father's death?

1039
01:26:28,013 --> 01:26:31,369
He denied a man in prison
appeal for a new trial.

1040
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,411
Ezekiel Walters.

1041
01:26:33,773 --> 01:26:37,129
Walters had nothing to do
with your father's murder.

1042
01:26:38,933 --> 01:26:43,370
They found him holding his wallet.
The only thing missing was this photo.

1043
01:26:43,693 --> 01:26:45,251
Where did you find it?

1044
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:54,329
Jerry's safe deposit box.

1045
01:26:54,613 --> 01:26:57,127
When do you think Jerry
first took notice of you?

1046
01:26:57,493 --> 01:26:59,961
What is it the two
of you have in common?

1047
01:27:02,253 --> 01:27:04,403
I was mugged and he saved me.

1048
01:27:04,693 --> 01:27:08,288
He may have saved you,
but that was no coincidence.

1049
01:27:08,653 --> 01:27:11,372
Come on, you're a lawyer.
You think like one.

1050
01:27:12,653 --> 01:27:15,213
Your father was assassinated.

1051
01:27:19,013 --> 01:27:23,006
And the sick son of a bitch
has been obsessed with you ever since.

1052
01:27:34,613 --> 01:27:36,922
I am so sorry, Alice.

1053
01:27:37,653 --> 01:27:39,371
I truly am.

1054
01:28:10,013 --> 01:28:11,241
Miss Sutton?

1055
01:28:12,093 --> 01:28:13,651
Hold on one second.

1056
01:28:15,933 --> 01:28:17,651
Alice, you order pizza?

1057
01:28:19,213 --> 01:28:20,282
Hold it.

1058
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:35,766
"Go to the northeast corner. . ."

1059
01:28:36,053 --> 01:28:37,884
". . .of Greenwich and Battery Place."

1060
01:28:38,213 --> 01:28:41,250
"Bring the pizza.
I have something important to tell you".

1061
01:28:45,773 --> 01:28:49,163
Call Bill in Security
and tell him Fletcher's in the area.

1062
01:28:50,413 --> 01:28:53,325
"I have something
important to tell you".

1063
01:28:56,093 --> 01:28:58,812
I have tried everything
I know to get Jerry to talk.

1064
01:28:59,493 --> 01:29:00,687
Would you try?

1065
01:29:00,973 --> 01:29:03,282
I promise you,
you'll be perfectly safe.

1066
01:29:03,693 --> 01:29:04,921
No way.

1067
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:07,570
You don't have to do this.

1068
01:29:12,653 --> 01:29:13,483
I will.

1069
01:29:13,773 --> 01:29:15,001
Good girl!

1070
01:29:15,613 --> 01:29:17,968
I want a bug in this box,
audio and track.

1071
01:29:26,813 --> 01:29:28,041
That still hot?

1072
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:30,767
Hop in. Doesn't pay
to stand around too long.

1073
01:29:57,613 --> 01:29:59,569
This is 42-K.
We're on him.

1074
01:30:04,573 --> 01:30:05,847
Thanks.

1075
01:30:06,133 --> 01:30:07,327
I'm starving.

1076
01:30:10,493 --> 01:30:11,687
This is good.

1077
01:30:12,013 --> 01:30:13,162
Have some.

1078
01:30:17,653 --> 01:30:20,042
- Do you have him on that?
- We still got him.

1079
01:30:20,453 --> 01:30:21,442
{y:i}You okay?

1080
01:30:22,733 --> 01:30:26,408
No, you're not. I shouldn't have said
all that stuff I said before.

1081
01:30:27,893 --> 01:30:31,363
I won't do that anymore.
I'm sorry. I can't help how I feel.

1082
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:33,809
What did you want to talk to me about?

1083
01:30:35,933 --> 01:30:39,846
I can feel what I. . .I mean,
I can think. . .no, I can feel. . .

1084
01:30:40,133 --> 01:30:43,250
. . .what I want to say,
but I can't get it out.

1085
01:30:44,813 --> 01:30:47,646
I've heard enough.
Stop the car. I want her out of there.

1086
01:30:48,093 --> 01:30:48,923
Keep driving.

1087
01:30:49,293 --> 01:30:50,612
It's kind of like. . .

1088
01:30:50,893 --> 01:30:55,011
. . .if you sing along to the music
you know the words with the music.

1089
01:30:55,293 --> 01:30:56,965
But with no music,
you're helpless.

1090
01:30:58,013 --> 01:31:00,049
{y:i}I don't understand.
{y:i}Is something wrong?

1091
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:02,688
{y:i}No. Don't worry about it.

1092
01:31:03,253 --> 01:31:05,483
I want to take you
where the music's playing.

1093
01:31:05,773 --> 01:31:07,604
The music is playing in Queens?

1094
01:31:08,573 --> 01:31:09,722
No, not today.

1095
01:31:10,893 --> 01:31:12,531
- Did she say Queens?
- Yes.

1096
01:31:12,813 --> 01:31:14,849
{y:i}This is air unit one.
{y:i}We've lost visual.

1097
01:31:15,133 --> 01:31:18,284
{y:i}He's on the lower level.
{y:i}We'll pick him up on the other side.

1098
01:31:29,613 --> 01:31:31,410
- Where is he?
- Straight ahead.

1099
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,132
About 300 yards.

1100
01:31:37,573 --> 01:31:39,006
- What?
- Nothing.

1101
01:31:39,533 --> 01:31:40,761
You see something?

1102
01:31:42,813 --> 01:31:43,802
Hang on.

1103
01:31:44,653 --> 01:31:46,689
What are you doing?

1104
01:31:48,013 --> 01:31:48,843
Let's go.

1105
01:31:49,133 --> 01:31:50,009
The pizza!

1106
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,686
Leave the pizza.

1107
01:31:52,973 --> 01:31:54,645
I'll get you another pizza.

1108
01:31:55,853 --> 01:31:57,206
- What's this?
- He stopped.

1109
01:31:59,373 --> 01:32:01,489
I have to go back and get the pizza.

1110
01:32:02,413 --> 01:32:04,210
It'll all make sense in a minute.

1111
01:32:04,493 --> 01:32:05,972
Stop, stop, stop!

1112
01:32:06,653 --> 01:32:08,052
This is ours. Hop in.

1113
01:32:08,573 --> 01:32:10,848
All mobile units watch him.
What do you see?

1114
01:32:11,133 --> 01:32:12,851
Just slide across.

1115
01:32:36,973 --> 01:32:38,929
Air unit one, what do you see?

1116
01:32:39,213 --> 01:32:43,001
{y:i}We see no traffic.
{y:i}We'll go down and take a look.

1117
01:33:00,733 --> 01:33:04,282
{y:i}They have exited the vehicle.
{y:i}The pizza box is still in the car.

1118
01:33:13,453 --> 01:33:15,330
Where are we going?

1119
01:33:16,013 --> 01:33:17,082
Connecticut.

1120
01:33:17,693 --> 01:33:21,891
{y:i}We shut the bridge down.
{y:i}All off-ramps. Both levels. Got it?

1121
01:33:22,413 --> 01:33:24,608
{y:i}Roger that.
{y:i}I'll take the west end.

1122
01:33:34,013 --> 01:33:35,492
Where are we going?

1123
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:38,282
You hear it?

1124
01:33:40,253 --> 01:33:41,572
The music,
I almost hear it.

1125
01:33:44,093 --> 01:33:45,321
I almost hear it.

1126
01:33:45,933 --> 01:33:46,922
We will.

1127
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:49,243
We will.

1128
01:34:13,133 --> 01:34:14,930
Mr. Wilson's office.

1129
01:34:15,293 --> 01:34:16,248
Hello?

1130
01:34:22,053 --> 01:34:22,929
David Berkowitz.

1131
01:34:23,933 --> 01:34:26,367
Ted Bundy. Richard Speck.

1132
01:34:29,293 --> 01:34:30,362
What about them?

1133
01:34:31,373 --> 01:34:32,852
Serial killers.

1134
01:34:34,013 --> 01:34:36,686
They only have two names.
You ever notice that?

1135
01:34:37,373 --> 01:34:39,250
But lone gunman assassins. . .

1136
01:34:39,533 --> 01:34:42,923
. . .they always have three names.
John Wilkes Booth.

1137
01:34:43,213 --> 01:34:45,169
Lee Harvey Oswald.
Mark David Chapman.

1138
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:47,808
John Hinckley shot Reagan.
He only has two.

1139
01:34:51,533 --> 01:34:54,684
Yeah, but he only shot Reagan.
Reagan didn't die.

1140
01:34:54,973 --> 01:34:57,089
If Reagan had died,
I'm pretty sure. . .

1141
01:34:57,373 --> 01:35:00,922
. . .we probably would all know
what John Hinckley's middle name was.

1142
01:35:11,533 --> 01:35:13,251
Mr. Wilson's office.

1143
01:35:17,213 --> 01:35:19,807
It's her. The line's open.
Get a trace on it.

1144
01:35:20,253 --> 01:35:22,528
- Hot one! Line three trace.
- A cell trace.

1145
01:35:38,093 --> 01:35:39,162
This is my father's place.

1146
01:35:42,253 --> 01:35:44,130
This is where the music's playing.

1147
01:36:01,933 --> 01:36:03,412
I just thought of another one.

1148
01:36:03,933 --> 01:36:06,527
James Earl Ray.
The guy that got Luther King.

1149
01:36:07,653 --> 01:36:10,645
Then there's Sirhan Sirhan.
I haven't figured that out.

1150
01:36:10,933 --> 01:36:13,572
Maybe it's Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan.

1151
01:36:13,853 --> 01:36:16,321
Here we got the stables
and the house is over there.

1152
01:36:16,613 --> 01:36:18,808
I guess I should just follow my nose.

1153
01:36:24,773 --> 01:36:26,331
What's your middle name, Jerry?

1154
01:36:26,613 --> 01:36:27,932
What do you mean?

1155
01:36:28,573 --> 01:36:31,041
- Did you kill my father?
- No.

1156
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:36,003
Maybe.

1157
01:36:36,893 --> 01:36:37,643
Maybe?

1158
01:36:37,933 --> 01:36:38,683
I don't know.

1159
01:36:38,973 --> 01:36:39,803
You don't know?

1160
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:45,643
You were at the horse show
that day.

1161
01:36:46,973 --> 01:36:50,522
You never rode again after that.
I think maybe you blame yourself.

1162
01:36:51,853 --> 01:36:53,730
God, it's on the tip of my brain.

1163
01:36:58,093 --> 01:36:59,321
He died right here.

1164
01:37:02,173 --> 01:37:04,403
He. . .died right here.

1165
01:37:04,653 --> 01:37:07,486
Did he see you coming, Jerry?
Did he beg for his life?

1166
01:37:07,773 --> 01:37:10,685
You put a gun to his head
and you shot him!

1167
01:37:10,973 --> 01:37:14,852
He died in the dirt, like an animal!
You killed my father!

1168
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:19,172
Answer me! I have to know!
Tell me, please.

1169
01:37:19,453 --> 01:37:20,966
Please tell me!

1170
01:37:28,733 --> 01:37:31,645
I went to the court
to kill your father.

1171
01:37:32,733 --> 01:37:33,722
I'm sorry.

1172
01:37:34,013 --> 01:37:37,050
I was programmed to do that.
The Ezekiel Walters hearing.

1173
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:39,324
I had a gun. . .

1174
01:37:39,613 --> 01:37:43,652
. . .and I couldn't shoot him.
I couldn't do it because I saw you.

1175
01:37:44,493 --> 01:37:46,165
That was the first time I saw you.

1176
01:37:46,453 --> 01:37:48,205
That was the first time we met.

1177
01:37:49,933 --> 01:37:52,572
And, I knew that if I was to screw up. . .

1178
01:37:52,853 --> 01:37:55,811
. . .Jonas would send
someone else to do the job.

1179
01:37:56,093 --> 01:37:59,483
So I decided to watch him
and make him safe, make it safe.

1180
01:38:00,093 --> 01:38:01,287
He had to carry a gun.

1181
01:38:01,693 --> 01:38:02,523
I know.

1182
01:38:02,813 --> 01:38:06,601
He stuck it in my face the
first time I tried to introduce myself.

1183
01:38:06,893 --> 01:38:08,121
I had to. . . .

1184
01:38:12,813 --> 01:38:14,212
I didn't kill him.

1185
01:38:20,173 --> 01:38:23,165
I didn't kill him.
We became friends.

1186
01:38:26,053 --> 01:38:27,452
He made good coffee.

1187
01:38:29,293 --> 01:38:31,648
He helped me remember
all of this stuff.

1188
01:38:35,853 --> 01:38:38,287
One of Jonas' guys. . .no!

1189
01:38:48,653 --> 01:38:51,770
When I got here,
he was already dying.

1190
01:38:53,853 --> 01:38:55,571
He was dying when I got here.

1191
01:38:55,853 --> 01:38:59,084
What does Jonas have to do
with Ezekiel Walters?

1192
01:39:04,413 --> 01:39:06,927
Ezekiel Carl Walters. . . .

1193
01:39:11,053 --> 01:39:13,044
Ezekiel Walters is a Jonas fall guy!

1194
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:16,848
He's the three name thing!
Ezekiel Carl Walters!

1195
01:39:19,213 --> 01:39:21,886
He was innocent,
innocent of everything.

1196
01:39:23,933 --> 01:39:27,721
Your father was going to reopen
the case because. . .

1197
01:39:28,493 --> 01:39:30,131
. . .he didn't accept the official story.

1198
01:39:30,413 --> 01:39:31,323
Why?

1199
01:39:34,173 --> 01:39:35,731
Because he believed me.

1200
01:39:36,093 --> 01:39:37,731
He believed me.

1201
01:39:42,653 --> 01:39:46,532
He believed that I couldn't do
what I was meant to do to him. . .

1202
01:39:46,813 --> 01:39:49,088
. . .and he was going to
blow it wide-open. . .

1203
01:39:49,373 --> 01:39:51,807
. . .before Jonas sent someone else.
He was going to. . . .

1204
01:39:58,173 --> 01:39:59,492
When he was dying. . .

1205
01:40:00,413 --> 01:40:02,529
. . .he was still really worried
about you.

1206
01:40:04,573 --> 01:40:07,007
He took your picture out of his wallet.

1207
01:40:07,453 --> 01:40:08,932
He called you his baby.

1208
01:40:10,653 --> 01:40:13,167
I told him I'd keep you safe.

1209
01:40:14,733 --> 01:40:17,406
And I kept your picture,
and I've been watching you ever since.

1210
01:40:20,093 --> 01:40:21,321
I didn't kill him.

1211
01:40:22,733 --> 01:40:24,769
But I was late and. . . .

1212
01:40:26,493 --> 01:40:27,721
I'm sorry.

1213
01:40:29,773 --> 01:40:30,842
I'm sorry.

1214
01:40:40,653 --> 01:40:41,972
I believe you.

1215
01:40:42,733 --> 01:40:44,052
I believe you.

1216
01:40:56,933 --> 01:40:58,207
He made great coffee.

1217
01:41:01,013 --> 01:41:02,287
They traced my phone. Sorry.

1218
01:41:02,573 --> 01:41:03,449
Oh, my God!

1219
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:05,764
I have to ask you one thing.

1220
01:41:06,053 --> 01:41:06,929
You switched the charts?

1221
01:41:07,213 --> 01:41:08,407
Now is not the time.

1222
01:41:08,693 --> 01:41:10,684
Now is all I got!
Did you switch them?

1223
01:41:12,413 --> 01:41:13,084
Yes.

1224
01:41:13,453 --> 01:41:14,772
I knew it.

1225
01:41:21,013 --> 01:41:21,525
Freeze!

1226
01:41:25,253 --> 01:41:27,721
- Freeze!
- Get away from her!

1227
01:41:33,293 --> 01:41:35,170
- Get off me!
- Leave her alone!

1228
01:41:36,653 --> 01:41:38,371
Get off me!

1229
01:41:39,933 --> 01:41:41,571
Let go of me!

1230
01:41:42,493 --> 01:41:43,767
Get off her!

1231
01:41:57,413 --> 01:41:59,085
You embarrassed me, Jerry.

1232
01:41:59,373 --> 01:42:02,524
You made certain people
take notice of me who shouldn't have.

1233
01:42:07,373 --> 01:42:08,852
You all right?

1234
01:42:47,133 --> 01:42:48,612
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.

1235
01:42:49,853 --> 01:42:51,889
It's a moment without hope.

1236
01:42:53,533 --> 01:42:55,410
You've never seen her run.

1237
01:43:44,813 --> 01:43:47,566
This will put my words in your mouth.

1238
01:43:55,293 --> 01:43:59,411
Once this does its job, you'll swear
that you killed her yourself.

1239
01:44:01,293 --> 01:44:02,851
She's dead, you know.

1240
01:44:07,853 --> 01:44:10,606
Well, then you can't hurt me anymore.

1241
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:14,210
I'll be the judge of that.

1242
01:44:23,933 --> 01:44:25,810
Come on in.
I'll get the lights.

1243
01:44:34,573 --> 01:44:36,052
Holy shit!

1244
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:37,528
We need to talk.

1245
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:40,452
When I was in here last night,
there were desks.

1246
01:44:40,733 --> 01:44:44,521
I'm going to call the management
right now. This is not good.

1247
01:44:45,013 --> 01:44:47,891
You guys, I'll meet you downstairs.
Go ahead.

1248
01:44:50,093 --> 01:44:51,082
Come on.

1249
01:44:54,493 --> 01:44:56,848
Who's the Deputy Director of the FBl?

1250
01:44:57,213 --> 01:44:59,329
You think we have time for 20 Questions?

1251
01:44:59,853 --> 01:45:02,208
Hold it right there.
Put your hands in the air.

1252
01:45:08,893 --> 01:45:10,008
What gave me away?

1253
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:13,322
Nothing.
I just wanted to make sure.

1254
01:45:14,053 --> 01:45:15,406
Who are you guys?

1255
01:45:16,973 --> 01:45:19,328
If the intelligence world
was a family. . .

1256
01:45:19,853 --> 01:45:22,162
. . .think of us as the uncle
no one talks about.

1257
01:45:25,613 --> 01:45:26,932
We watch Jerry.

1258
01:45:27,533 --> 01:45:29,410
Jerry's the bait for Jonas.

1259
01:45:30,253 --> 01:45:32,926
Jonas has shown himself.
Why don't you take him?

1260
01:45:33,773 --> 01:45:35,491
Jonas builds assassins.

1261
01:45:35,853 --> 01:45:39,129
We need to know who and where
they are and who Jonas works for.

1262
01:45:41,613 --> 01:45:43,808
Jonas had my father killed, didn't he?

1263
01:45:46,653 --> 01:45:47,688
We think so.

1264
01:45:49,693 --> 01:45:51,649
- Do you know where Jerry is?
- No.

1265
01:45:51,933 --> 01:45:54,049
I wish I did. Honest.

1266
01:45:57,133 --> 01:45:58,532
What are you going to do?

1267
01:45:59,693 --> 01:46:01,092
I'm going to find him. . .

1268
01:46:01,853 --> 01:46:03,650
. . .because he'd find me.

1269
01:46:04,653 --> 01:46:08,123
- Let's work together on this.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1270
01:46:10,093 --> 01:46:13,244
At least take a number
where you can call if you need me.

1271
01:46:13,533 --> 01:46:15,171
Hands in the air.

1272
01:46:26,653 --> 01:46:27,802
I'm sorry.

1273
01:46:40,613 --> 01:46:41,887
Everybody's sorry.

1274
01:48:53,933 --> 01:48:55,161
Geronimo.

1275
01:48:55,773 --> 01:48:56,603
Son of a bitch!

1276
01:49:20,973 --> 01:49:24,249
{y:i}The President had left the area
{y:i}only moments earlier and is now. . .

1277
01:49:24,533 --> 01:49:25,568
{y:i}. . .safe in Germany.

1278
01:49:25,853 --> 01:49:29,368
{y:i}The quake in southern Turkey
{y:i}measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.

1279
01:49:29,653 --> 01:49:32,963
{y:i}Thousands are feared missing or dead.
{y:i}More on this story as it. . ..

1280
01:49:40,973 --> 01:49:41,928
Can I help you?

1281
01:49:42,213 --> 01:49:43,771
I'm with the Justice Department.

1282
01:49:44,053 --> 01:49:46,487
I need to see any male patients
brought in. . .

1283
01:49:46,773 --> 01:49:48,001
. . .in the last 12 hours.

1284
01:49:48,293 --> 01:49:51,649
Justice Department?
You got credentials or something?

1285
01:50:03,053 --> 01:50:03,963
Treasury Department.

1286
01:50:06,613 --> 01:50:09,173
But it'll do.
Come on, let's go.

1287
01:50:12,333 --> 01:50:15,166
{y:i}# You're just too good to be true #

1288
01:50:15,533 --> 01:50:16,852
That's better.

1289
01:50:24,653 --> 01:50:25,881
Yo, Marie!

1290
01:50:26,173 --> 01:50:27,447
Those two guys in today?

1291
01:50:27,933 --> 01:50:30,208
Transferred to
Mount Vernon immediately.

1292
01:50:31,853 --> 01:50:32,922
Sorry.

1293
01:50:50,893 --> 01:50:52,451
Jerry, can you hear me?

1294
01:50:58,173 --> 01:50:59,572
Can you hear me, Jerry?

1295
01:51:07,853 --> 01:51:10,686
{y:i}# You're just too good to be true #

1296
01:51:11,853 --> 01:51:13,650
Jerry, tell me where you are!

1297
01:51:19,293 --> 01:51:21,249
{y:i}# I love you, baby #

1298
01:51:23,373 --> 01:51:25,568
{y:i}And if it's quite all right

1299
01:51:25,933 --> 01:51:27,605
{y:i}# I need you, baby #

1300
01:51:27,893 --> 01:51:30,453
{y:i}# Through all the lonely nights #

1301
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:31,723
Hi, Alice.

1302
01:51:33,293 --> 01:51:34,612
Hi, Jerry.

1303
01:51:34,893 --> 01:51:36,884
Alice, I'm sorry you're dead.

1304
01:51:38,573 --> 01:51:40,768
Jerry, tell me where you are.

1305
01:51:41,333 --> 01:51:42,368
Right here.

1306
01:51:47,533 --> 01:51:48,886
Where's "here", Jerry?

1307
01:51:50,053 --> 01:51:51,406
On the floor.

1308
01:51:54,573 --> 01:51:56,768
Behind a waffle or a. . . .

1309
01:51:59,933 --> 01:52:03,005
The paint is peeling on the ceiling.

1310
01:52:04,493 --> 01:52:06,370
That rhymes.
Peeling on the ceiling.

1311
01:52:09,533 --> 01:52:11,410
Nice views, and I can. . . .

1312
01:52:17,453 --> 01:52:19,887
I can see the smokestacks in the light.

1313
01:52:20,173 --> 01:52:21,731
Good views.

1314
01:52:22,093 --> 01:52:24,368
Where can you see
the smokestacks from?

1315
01:52:26,653 --> 01:52:28,689
That would be the power station.

1316
01:52:28,973 --> 01:52:32,522
You can see it from the north wing,
but that's been closed for two years.

1317
01:52:32,813 --> 01:52:33,802
Take me there, right now.

1318
01:52:34,093 --> 01:52:35,606
I'm coming to get you.

1319
01:52:41,613 --> 01:52:43,012
You can fit through there?

1320
01:52:43,693 --> 01:52:45,012
Around this corner.

1321
01:52:45,453 --> 01:52:46,522
Down the hall.

1322
01:52:47,773 --> 01:52:50,003
Just honk the horn.
I'll come out.

1323
01:52:51,533 --> 01:52:52,522
This is it.

1324
01:52:52,813 --> 01:52:54,690
- You have a key?
- I don't have a key.

1325
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:56,842
Can you break it open?

1326
01:52:57,133 --> 01:52:58,964
$100 doesn't cover this.

1327
01:52:59,373 --> 01:53:01,648
I'll clean the place up.

1328
01:53:02,573 --> 01:53:03,642
No, wait!

1329
01:53:03,933 --> 01:53:05,730
Let's think about this!

1330
01:53:25,133 --> 01:53:27,089
This is as far as I go, lady.

1331
01:53:28,013 --> 01:53:31,323
Call the police and this man.
Tell them where I am.

1332
01:53:32,333 --> 01:53:33,732
I'll call for backup.

1333
01:53:34,253 --> 01:53:35,481
I'll call for backup.

1334
01:53:35,773 --> 01:53:39,607
{y:i}# Call Roto-Rooter, that's the name #

1335
01:54:22,173 --> 01:54:23,652
What'd you think this would do?

1336
01:54:25,573 --> 01:54:27,962
How would I know?
I'm tied up on the floor.

1337
01:54:31,733 --> 01:54:34,486
I don't know,
maybe I wanted some attention.

1338
01:54:35,093 --> 01:54:36,651
I was lonely.

1339
01:54:52,933 --> 01:54:54,525
Are you all right?

1340
01:54:56,693 --> 01:54:59,605
This is, like,
the best dream I ever had.

1341
01:55:04,813 --> 01:55:06,485
Could you untie me?

1342
01:55:06,773 --> 01:55:08,525
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

1343
01:55:26,373 --> 01:55:28,409
- North wing?
- Can I see some I.D.?

1344
01:55:28,693 --> 01:55:30,012
I.D. him, Flip.

1345
01:55:30,293 --> 01:55:32,932
- Through that door, but it's abandoned.
- No matter.

1346
01:55:35,973 --> 01:55:37,292
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

1347
01:55:37,573 --> 01:55:38,403
Can you walk?

1348
01:55:38,693 --> 01:55:39,842
I think so.

1349
01:55:42,213 --> 01:55:43,202
Kiss me.

1350
01:55:44,293 --> 01:55:45,362
For luck.

1351
01:55:46,053 --> 01:55:47,008
Kiss me and. . . .

1352
01:55:48,693 --> 01:55:49,489
You're crazy.

1353
01:55:49,813 --> 01:55:51,849
I'm certifiable, I know. . .

1354
01:55:52,133 --> 01:55:54,966
. . .but kiss me once.
Kiss me, then we'll go.

1355
01:56:19,093 --> 01:56:21,402
Jerry, you continually surprise me.

1356
01:56:42,213 --> 01:56:43,009
Go!

1357
01:56:48,973 --> 01:56:52,204
I always seem to come between you
and the men in your life.

1358
01:57:47,213 --> 01:57:48,646
Somebody help me!

1359
01:57:48,933 --> 01:57:50,002
Help me!

1360
01:57:54,213 --> 01:57:55,532
Freeze!
Drop your weapon!

1361
01:57:55,813 --> 01:57:56,768
Don't shoot!

1362
01:57:58,373 --> 01:58:00,250
Get an ambulance here, now!

1363
01:58:06,213 --> 01:58:07,612
Geronimo.

1364
01:58:09,413 --> 01:58:10,812
Is that this place?

1365
01:58:11,493 --> 01:58:13,051
No, not anymore.

1366
01:58:15,573 --> 01:58:16,892
It's love.

1367
01:58:18,213 --> 01:58:20,169
Love gives you wings.

1368
01:58:22,213 --> 01:58:25,091
And helps you fly
and we can fly away.

1369
01:58:31,013 --> 01:58:32,332
Yes, I do.

1370
01:58:32,613 --> 01:58:33,932
I do so.

1371
01:58:38,533 --> 01:58:39,522
I love you.

1372
01:58:39,813 --> 01:58:40,882
I do.

1373
01:58:47,813 --> 01:58:49,292
I love you too.

1374
01:58:58,693 --> 01:58:59,808
Now you tell me.

1375
01:59:15,253 --> 01:59:17,369
Somebody help me, please!

1376
01:59:17,733 --> 01:59:19,769
Somebody help me!

1377
01:59:25,733 --> 01:59:27,644
I'm right here.
I'm here with you.

1378
01:59:27,973 --> 01:59:29,452
It's going to be okay.

1379
01:59:29,733 --> 01:59:32,531
No, I want to go with him.
I want to stay with him!

1380
01:59:33,413 --> 01:59:34,812
Stop pulling on me.

1381
01:59:37,093 --> 01:59:38,287
Jerry, I'm right here!

1382
01:59:42,053 --> 01:59:43,452
Look at me!

1383
02:01:28,413 --> 02:01:30,324
I miss your face.

1384
02:01:55,413 --> 02:01:56,323
Hi.

1385
02:02:01,093 --> 02:02:02,367
I'm back. . .

1386
02:02:03,013 --> 02:02:04,287
. . .if you'll have me, Johnny.

1387
02:02:06,293 --> 02:02:07,612
Is that a "yes"?

1388
02:02:40,053 --> 02:02:41,372
Geronimo.

1389
02:02:58,413 --> 02:03:01,564
As long as they think you're dead,
she's safe.

1390
02:03:03,533 --> 02:03:05,251
I kept my end of the bargain.

1391
02:03:05,773 --> 02:03:07,092
What about yours?

1392
02:03:07,373 --> 02:03:09,045
I'll tell you all I remember.

1393
02:03:09,333 --> 02:03:13,246
I'll give you all the gravy on Jonas
and his operation and. . . .

1394
02:03:14,893 --> 02:03:18,329
You're going to have to help me.
It's coming back, but slow.

1395
02:03:18,693 --> 02:03:19,762
You got it.

1396
02:03:20,493 --> 02:03:23,007
By the way,
my real name's Hatcher.

1397
02:03:26,813 --> 02:03:27,802
Pleased to meet you.

1398
02:03:29,253 --> 02:03:30,971
- Go easy on me.
- Sorry about that.

1399
02:03:32,013 --> 02:03:34,129
I guess nothing was
what it seemed?

1400
02:03:37,133 --> 02:03:38,202
Guess not.

1401
02:03:39,853 --> 02:03:41,081
Except her.

1402
02:04:01,773 --> 02:04:03,445
Son of a bitch!

1403
02:04:10,613 --> 02:04:12,649
Brought the paper for you.

1404
02:04:13,133 --> 02:04:15,806
- Thanks, Flip. It is Flip, isn't it?
- Yes, it's Flip.

1405
02:04:16,973 --> 02:04:19,009
Don't even think about it.

1406
02:04:20,173 --> 02:04:21,686
At least not for now.

1407
02:04:38,173 --> 02:04:39,970
{y:i}# I need you, baby #

1408
02:04:40,613 --> 02:04:42,205
{y:i}# To warm the lonely nights #

1409
02:04:56,493 --> 02:04:57,721
We got a future.

1410
02:09:36,253 --> 02:09:37,481
