the one-kiloton detonation thingy

1319

Right now, it’s our insurance policy.

1321

There’s a good chance they’re gonna try
to kill us right out of the gate.

1322
01:27:27,251 --> 01:27:29,420

1334
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:30,270
I started to think
you were never coming home.

1335
01:28:30,979 --> 01:28:32,647
Where, oh, where have you been?

Doing my job.

1337
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:36,233
Your job?

1338
01:28:36,316 --> 01:28:37,567
I’m sorry. Were we not clear

1339
01:28:37,651 --> 01:28:39,819
when we suspended
your recruitment protocols?

1340
01:28:39,945 --> 01:28:42,530
I got that sense when you
called me “bloody obsolete”

1341
01:28:42,613 --> 01:28:44,073
and tried to disassemble me.

1342
01:28:45,573 --> 01:28:48,201
Well, you’ve certainly
caused quite a commotion

1343
01:28:48,284 --> 01:28:51,829

out of the Eiffel Tower.

Every time you turn it on here,

Impossible.

It isn’t just receiving tachyons.

It is taking a possible future and...

And amplifying it, transmitting it,
like a feedback loop.

And because you won’t believe it,

you won’t do what is necessary
to make it a reality.
