<i>Go ahead.</i>

55
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,873
<i>Thanks. Oh. You're</i>
<i>gonna answer my question?</i>

56
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:59,077
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Oh. Good. First of all.</i>
<i>I just wanted to say. Uh...</i>

57
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,019
<i>I don't mind being counted</i>
<i>as an American.</i>

58
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,953
<i>I'm one of the silent majority.</i>

59
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,959
<i>But I wish you had made</i>
<i>some of those questions</i>
<i>multiple choice.</i>

60
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:11,930
<i>The question was. Um.</i>
<i>Are you the head of the family?</i>

61
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:15,957
<i>Well. Quite frankly.</i>
<i>The day I married that woman...</i>

62
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:20,405
<i>that. Unfortunately. I've been</i>
<i>married to for 25 years...</i>
<i>Ohh.</i>

63
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:25,968
<i>Well. It's true.</i>
<i>I lost the position</i>
<i>as head of the family.</i>

64
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,879
<i>You see. What I do...</i>
<i>I stay at home. I hate working.</i>

65
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,712
<i>I hate going out</i>
<i>and seeing people...</i>

66
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:33,218
<i>and getting involved</i>
<i>in the rat race and things.</i>

67
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:36,119
<i>So she works</i>
<i>and I do the housework...</i>

68
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,647
<i>and. Uh. Take care of the babies</i>
<i>and things like that.</i>

69
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,455
<i>And so. I was wondering...</i>
<i>you wanted honest answers.</i>

70
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,927
<i>Now. What I did.</i>
<i>I pencilled in all of the marks...</i>

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,662
<i>You wanted marks in these circles</i>
<i>I see in front of me.</i>

72
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,569
<i>I pencilled it in first. But I said.</i>
<i>"No. That's being dishonest.</i>

73
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,504
"I'm really not
the head of the family...

74
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,701
<i>and yet I'm the man</i>
<i>of the family. "</i>

75
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,006
<i>Although there are people</i>
<i>who would question that.</i>

76
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,707
<i>But nevertheless.</i>
<i>I was wondering...</i>

77
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,511
how should I answer
that question?

78
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:07,451
Well, if you
don't consider yourself
head of the household...

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,750
<i>and you think your wife</i>
<i>occupies that position...</i>

80
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:12,291
<i>I would suggest you put</i>
<i>your wife's name there.</i>

81
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,726
<i>But that's so embarrassing.</i>
<i>What will you people</i>
<i>think when I send it?</i>

82
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:18,593
<i>Nobody is even</i>
<i>going to know.</i>
Are you sure?

83
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,599
I'm positive. No one
will know about that.

84
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,601
We won't know you from
Adam's house cat.

85
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,899
<i>But there are people</i>
<i>in my neighborhood...</i>

86
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,462
<i>They will never see that form.</i>
<i>Are you sure?</i>

87
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,703
<i>No one in your neighborhood</i>
<i>will ever find out.</i>

88
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:33,541
<i>I don't want people</i>
<i>to know about that.</i>

89
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,877
<i>I've lived like this</i>
<i>for 15 years...</i>

90
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,315
<i>and I admit.</i>
<i>I wear a house dress.</i>

91
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:41,912
<i>It's so much easier to pick up</i>
<i>stuff in a house dress...</i>

92
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:43,717
<i>And. You know. Slippers.</i>

93
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,987
<i>And. Quite frankly. I've</i>
<i>adopted most of the ways...</i>
Talk about pollution.

94
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,588
<i>Of the average housewife.</i>
<i>And I' d hate for anybody</i>
<i>to know that.</i>

95
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,690
<i>Anyway. It's very embarrassing.</i>
<i>So would you...</i>

96
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:58,067
<i>All information that</i>
<i>you include on that form</i>
<i>is confidential.</i>

97
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:00,231
<i>It's unreasonable</i>
<i>to expect...</i>

98
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:18,113
<i>- 800.000 others.</i>

99
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:21,888
<i>So it would be all right?</i>
<i>I wanna be honest with you.</i>

100
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,896
<i>I'm really not</i>
<i>the head of the family.</i>
<i>She doesn't know I'm calling.</i>

101
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:28,127
<i>That woman just drives me</i>
<i>up the wall.</i>

102
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,863
<i>I like doing this</i>
<i>just to get even with her.</i>

103
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,637
<i>You know how women are</i>
<i>before you marry them.</i>
<i>They're so nice.</i>

104
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:41,078
<i>And suddenly they become</i>
<i>so aggressive.</i>

105
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:43,308
<i>I mean. She became</i>
<i>so aggressive afterward.</i>

106
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:46,614
<i>Just took over everything.</i>
<i>I mean...</i>
<i>Oh. No.</i>

107
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:50,122
<i>I'm afraid of her. You see.</i>
<i>I've been wanting to divorce her.</i>

108
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,125
<i>The first six months of marriage.</i>
<i>I knew I made a mistake.</i>

109
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:55,718
But no, I got ahold of this first,
before she did...

110
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:57,820
and I thought,
"Well, I'll answer it."

111
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:00,661
But I wanted to be honest,
and I'm a man of conscience...

112
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:03,760
<i>so I wanted to make sure.</i>
<i>If I put down I'm</i>
<i>the head of the family...</i>

113
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,862
<i>nobody would know</i>
<i>the difference. Right?</i>
<i>No.</i>

114
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,399
<i>I'll put it down...</i>

115
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:12,809
<i>I really like you.</i>
<i>Are you married?</i>
Hey!

116
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,040
<i>No.</i>
<i>Oh. When you get married...</i>

117
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,606
<i>don't be like</i>
<i>that whippo I married.</i>

118
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,549
<i>Would you?</i>

119
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,383
<i>- I'll try my best not to be.</i>
- All right.

120
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,821
Thank you so much.
It's nice talking to you.
You're welcome.

121
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,518
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

122
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,993
<i>This is Mr. Whittington.</i>

123
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,505
<i>You were talking to</i>
<i>a Mr... uh... uh...</i>

124
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:43,633
<i>Oh. Valenti. The man</i>

00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,080
<i>Yes. Well. I've. Uh...</i>

127
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,810
<i>I've been trying to get</i>
<i>in touch with Mr. Mack.</i>

128
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:54,115
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>Because. Um...</i>
<i>well. I've tried to...</i>

129
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,825
Huh.

130
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:10,029
<i>Well. I play music on</i>
<i>something unusual myself.</i>

<i>original amateur talent.</i>

132
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,570
<i>Mr. Valenti is unusual</i>
<i>for the fact...</i>

133
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:20,773
<i>that he not only blows</i>
<i>"Oh Johnny"on the bicycle pump...</i>

<i>but also does nail file</i>
<i>on a high. Flat table...</i>

135
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:28,247

<i>something unusual?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

138
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,888
<i>Well. Uh. What do you do.</i>
<i>May I ask?</i>
<i>I... I play meat.</i>

139
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,863
<i>You what?</i>
<i>I play meat.</i>

140
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:41,093
<i>You play meat?</i>

141
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:45,831
<i>Yes. Uh... meat.</i>
<i>You know. Beef and pork?</i>
That's sick, man.

142
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:48,373
<i>M-e-a-t. Meat?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

143
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,274
<i>It may sound a little strange.</i>

144
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:54,279
<i>Yeah. I don't mean</i>
<i>to hurt your feelings.</i>

145
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:58,909
<i>But I've never heard of anybody</i>
<i>who plays meat.</i>
<i>Well... uh...</i>

146
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:02,682
<i>a lot of people</i>
<i>think it's strange.</i>
<i>Yes. I can understand that.</i>

147
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:06,853
<i>No offense. Are you</i>
<i>serious about this?</i>
<i>Yes. Yes. I've...</i>

148
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,791
<i>worked here as</i>
<i>an assistant butcher...</i>

149
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:12,662
<i>and I've found in a cold</i>
<i>storage locker there...</i>

150
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:57,036
Yes, sir. Whatever
you want, I got it.

151
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,544
What do you want?
Fill it with Ethyl.

152
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,978
If Ethel don't mind.

153
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:39,914
Want me to check
under the hood for you?
Uh, please. Yes.

154
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,124
Looks like you could use
a new radiator hose.

155
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:58,565
Where have I
heard that before?
I'll get one later.

156
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:02,404
- You're the boss.
- Not in my house, I'm not.

157
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:15,887
Attendant?
Yes, sir?

158
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:19,721
You got change
for the telephone?
Yes, sir.

159
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,995
I'll get you the rest later?

160
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:30,263
Be with you in a minute.

161
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:47,415
Operator, I'd like to call
659-0716, collect.

162
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:55,492
Uh, Dave Mann.
The number here is 238-2098.

163
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:58,697
Thank you.

164
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,868
Excuse me.

165
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:09,668
Honey? Uh, it's me.

166
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:14,577
What's the matter?
Did you have an accident?
No, nothing like that.

167
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:18,674
Well, what happened?
Well, nothing
happened. I just, uh...

168
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:23,154
uh, well, l...
I just wanted to,
uh, to apologize.

169
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:27,955
You don't have to
apologize, Dave.
I know. I wanted to.

170
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:30,291
When I left the house
this morning,
you were asleep...

171
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:33,491
so I just wanted
to call you up and
tell you that, uh...

172
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:36,763
I, uh... I'm sorry
about last night.

173
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:39,100
I don't really
want to talk about it.

174
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,572
Well...

175
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,007
don't you think
maybe we ought to?

176
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:46,375
No, because if we
talk about it...

177
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:49,472
we'll fight, and you wouldn't
want that, would you?

178
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:51,744
Of course not.

179
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:54,150
What is that
supposed to mean?

180
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,018
- Oh, never mind.
- Uh, just a minute.

181
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,320
I know what it's
supposed to mean.

182
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:03,920
It means you think
I should go out and call
Steve Henderson up...

183
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:07,989
and challenge him to
a fistfight or something.
No, of course not.

184
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:11,594
But you could have at least
said something to the man.

185
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:13,605
I mean, after all, he...

186
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,268
Practically tried to rape me
in front of the whole party.

187
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,040
- Oh, come on, honey.
- Just forget it.

188
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:24,515
- You gonna be home by 6:30?
- If Forbes lets me go in time.

189
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:27,576
- Is it that important
that you see him?
- Huh.

190
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:29,883
He's leaving for Hawaii
in the morning.

191
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,857
The way he's been griping
to the front office,
if I don't reach him today...

192
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:37,487
- I could lose the account.
- You said there'd be no problem
getting home on time.

193
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:40,157
There probably won't be.

194
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:43,999
It's your mother.
God knows she's not
coming to see me.

195
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,870
Honey, I said there
probably won't be
a problem.

196
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,841
Well, just be on time, okay?

197
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,438
All right.
Okay, I'll be there.

198
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,199
Here's your card, sir.

199
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,570
Be with you
in a second.

200
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,909
- Save them stamps?
- No, thanks.

201
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:27,207
Good enough.
Come back, now.

202
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,214
Will do.

203
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:56,162
I gave you the road.
Why don't you take it?

204
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:01,503
Why don't you go?

205
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, boy, you're beautiful.

206
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,484
I don't believe it.

207
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,997
I don't believe it.

208
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:13,403
I'm in no mood to play games.
Let's go.

209
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:45,301
Well, it's about time, Charlie!

210
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,115
My God.

211
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,591
Jesus.

212
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:14,235
Come on, you miserable fathead.
Get that fat-ass truck out of my way.

213
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:25,750
Well, I'm never going to
make that appointment now.

214
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,797
You miserable...

215
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:08,321
Okay. Okay.
You want to play games?

216
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,713
<i>You all right. Mister?</i>

217
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:39,012
Uhh!

218
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:43,043
Yeah. Yeah, except...

219
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:46,056
Oh, my neck.
You got a whiplash,
probably.

220
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:49,252
Yeah. It's all right.

221
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:53,924
He's all right.

222
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,035
What happened?

223
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:04,005
That truck driver
tried to kill me.
Kill you? Go on!

224
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,544
He chased me
down the mountain at...

225
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:09,172
at nearly 90 miles an hour,
and I don't...

226
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:13,082
don't know what else
you'd call it.
Tried to kill you.

227
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:17,281
It sure looks like you got
whiplash, all right.
Oh, it's... it's, uh...

228
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,847
You got the whiplash,
all right.
Oh, that's okay.

229
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:21,859
Thank... It's okay.

230
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,487
Anything I can do for you?
No, nothing. Thank you.

231
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:26,622
That's okay.
Okay.

232
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:35,367
Just a little whiplash is all.

233
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:29,960
<i>What happened</i>
<i>out there. Mister?</i>

234
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:33,759
Can I use your
men's room, please?
Yeah. Through the door...

235
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:36,767
on the right,
down the hall...

226
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:39,269
turn left, second door.

237
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,697
<i>Well. You never know.</i>
<i>You just never know.</i>

238
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:42,859
<i>You just go along figuring</i>
<i>some things don't change. Ever.</i>

239
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:46,700
<i>Like being able to drive</i>
<i>on a public highway...</i>

240
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,866
<i>without somebody trying</i>
<i>to murder you.</i>

241
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:53,877
<i>And then one stupid thing</i>
<i>happens.</i>

242
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:57,540
<i>Twenty. Twenty-five minutes</i>
<i>out of your whole life...</i>

243
00:28:57,616 --> 00:29:01,950
<i>and all the ropes that kept you</i>
<i>hangin' in there get cut loose.</i>

244
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,083
<i>And it's like. There you are.</i>
<i>Right back in thejungle again.</i>

245
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:12,660
<i>All right. Boy.</i>
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>
<i>But it's over now.</i>

246
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,800
<i>It's all over.</i>

247
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:40,256
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

248
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:45,092
What happened out there?
Oh, just a slight
complication.

249
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:48,599
Oh? Looked like a big
complication to me.

250
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:17,078
- Well, you ready to order now?

251
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:19,309
Ahem. Yes. Heh heh.

252
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:21,614
Yes, thank you. Um...

253
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,250
Oh, I think I'll...

254
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:32,125
Ahh.

255
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:34,256
Just give me, um... um...

256
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:37,495
Why don't you just give me
a Swiss cheese sandwich...

257
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:40,936
- on rye. R-Y-E.
- Swiss cheese on rye.

258
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:43,941
- All right.
- And could I have another
glass of water, please?

259
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:47,172
- Oh, sure.
Another glass of water.
- Oh, uh, miss?

260
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:49,975
- Do you have an aspirin?
- Aw, your head aches.

261
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:52,141
Sure, I'll get you some aspirin.

262
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:09,696
<i>All I did was pass this</i>
<i>stupid rig a couple of times...</i>

263
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:12,862
<i>and he goes flyin'</i>
<i>off the deep end.</i>

264
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:15,701
<i>He has to be crazy.</i>

265
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:20,404
<i>Okay. So he's crazy.</i>
<i>What can I do about it?</i>

266
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:23,914
<i>Find him a psychiatrist?</i>

267
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:26,041
<i>Oh. Boy.</i>

268
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:14,663
<i>Now wait a minute.</i>

269
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:19,295
<i>Now wait just a minute.</i>
<i>All right. Now. Think.</i>

270
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:24,607
<i>Okay. He's in here.</i>

271
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:29,443
<i>Well. That doesn't mean</i>
<i>he intends to continue his... attack.</i>

272
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:32,381
<i>It is lunchtime...</i>

273
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:38,082
<i>and Chuck's Cafe may be</i>
<i>the only place to eat for miles around.</i>

274
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:40,784
<i>Yeah. He probably</i>
<i>eats here all the time.</i>

275
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,692
<i>He was just...</i>
<i>just moving too fast before...</i>

276
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:47,698
<i>and he had to... slow down.</i>
<i>Turn around. That's all.</i>

277
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:54,137
<i>That's all.</i>

278
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:01,744
<i>Why didn't I leave right away</i>
<i>when I saw his truck outside?</i>

279
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,839
<i>Then I' d know what</i>
<i>he intends to do.</i>

280
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:10,613
<i>What if he followed me out.</i>
<i>Started after me again?</i>

281
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,622
<i>I' d be right back</i>
<i>where I started.</i>

282
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,250
<i>Even if I got a lead.</i>
<i>He' d overtake me soon enough.</i>

283
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:18,557
<i>He's got some... some...</i>
<i>some souped-up diesel.</i>

284
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,360
<i>My-My car's just not</i>
<i>that powerful. I just...</i>

285
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:24,630
<i>can't drive 80 and 90</i>
<i>miles an hour.</i>

286
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:28,695
<i>As soon as I stopped concentrating.</i>
<i>I' d go back to 60 or 70</i>
<i>like I always do.</i>

287
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,604
<i>It's a habit.</i>
<i>I can't help it.</i>

288
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:34,372
<i>I ca... Take it easy.</i>

289
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,072
<i>Just... take it easy.</i>

290
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,084
<i>Maybe l...</i>

291
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,317
<i>Maybe I should try</i>
<i>some kind of contact.</i>

292
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:49,155
<i>I' d better do something.</i>

293
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,892
<i>Look. Mister. I... I'm sorry</i>
<i>if I irritated you.</i>

294
00:35:55,967 --> 00:36:00,301
<i>Why don't I buy you a beer</i>
<i>and get this straightened out?</i>

295
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:02,236
<i>No.</i>

296
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:08,272
<i>Look. Mister. I'm sorry</i>
<i>if I irritated you. But...</i>

297
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:10,280
<i>let me. Uh...</i>

298
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:26,928
There you are.
Anything else?
No, thank you.

299
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:29,489
Uh...

300
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,558
I'd like some ketchup.

301
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,885
<i>What if I called</i>
<i>the local police?</i>

302
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:59,657
<i>But then I' d have to</i>
<i>stay here. Iose more time.</i>

303
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:02,700
<i>What if he stayed too?</i>
<i>Actually talked</i>
<i>to the police himself?</i>

304
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,496
<i>Naturally.</i>
<i>He' d deny everything.</i>

305
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:08,562
<i>I've got to prove it.</i>
<i>None of these people</i>
<i>would back me up.</i>

306
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,575
<i>The cops' d probably...</i>

307
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:30,787
<i>Okay... so now what?</i>

308
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:30,541
Look, uh...

309
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:34,117
heh heh...

310
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,885
- I want you to cut it out.
- What?

311
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:43,593
Just-Just cut it out, okay?

312
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:51,630
- Cut what out?
- Now, come on. I mean...

313
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:55,730
please, l - l...
Let's not play games.

314
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:59,868
- What the hell are you
talking about?
- I can call the police.

315
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,874
- The police?
- You think that I won't?
You're wrong, mister.

316
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:09,715
If you think you can
take that truck of yours...

317
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:15,089
and use it as a murder weapon,
killing people on the highway,
well, you're wrong.

318
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,152
<i>You've got another thing comin'.</i>
Man, you need help.

319
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:22,889
Don't you tell me
I need help.

320
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:28,465
Hey! Hey, hey, come on!

321
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,404
Who the hell
do you think you are...

322
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:33,672
- knockin' my sandwich
outta my hand?
- You wanna fight, get outside.

323
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:37,579
<i>- I don't wanna fight.</i>
<i>I wanna knock his head off.</i>
- You already hit him twice.

324
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:40,617
<i>What more do you want?</i>
<i>Huh? Come on now.</i>

325
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:43,620
<i>He's sick. Can't you see?</i>
<i>He ain't gonna fight no one.</i>

326
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:47,454
That creep goes around,
knocks my sandwich outta my hand.

327
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,459
I'll buy you
another sandwich.

328
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:51,461
Come on, forget it.
No, forget it.

329
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:53,929
- Forget it.
- I don't wanna stay
around here anyway.

330
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:57,092
Let me buy you
a beer then, huh?

331
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:59,102
I'll buy you a beer.

332
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:05,800
Get out of here, huh?

333
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:17,698
Yeah?
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I could use help.

334
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:22,398
What kind of help?
I could use a push.
Damn thing overheated.

335
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:24,566
Now I can't get her
started again.

336
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:26,906
Why didn't you flag down
that truck?
What truck?

337
00:44:26,978 --> 00:44:30,573
The one that just
went by here.
I didn't notice.

338
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:33,412
I must have been inside
tryin' to get that
piece of junk shakin'.

339
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:36,078
Would you get off
the car?
How about it?

340
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:40,419
Looks like I'd go
right underneath the bumper.
No.

341
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:44,018
Hey, get off the car.
You're gonna get hurt there.

342
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:47,428
Naw, you're all right.
Rodney, get down
from there.

343
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:50,365
<i>You too. Shawn.</i>
<i>Come on. Everybody!</i>
<i>Back on the bus!</i>

344
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:53,028
Wait a minute!
Wait, l...

345
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:57,336
Well, we'll see.

346
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:17,356
Come on. Come on.

347
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:45,214
Push! Push! Push!

348
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:49,248
Push! Push! Push! Push!

349
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:54,764
<i>Push! Push!</i>
<i>Push! Push!</i>

350
00:45:54,832 --> 00:45:59,895
<i>Push! Push!</i>
<i>Push! Push!</i>

351
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,906
<i>Push! Push!</i>

352
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:10,513
<i>Push! Push! Push!</i>

353
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:23,216
He can't do it!

354
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:26,593
You can't do it!
You can't do it!

355
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:30,259
You can't do it!
You can't do it!
