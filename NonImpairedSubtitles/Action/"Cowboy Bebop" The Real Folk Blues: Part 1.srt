All: <i>What!</i>

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,470
What a foolish thing this is
that you have done.

You look so pitiful, Vicious,
and you are.

47
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,830
We have already informed you
of our final decision.

48
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,430
You cannot succeed us
as a leader of this clan.

49
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,570
The syndicate doesn't need
corpses that can't fight.

50
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,670
Who've lost their taste for blood.

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,070

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,720
Kill me.

55
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,330
Just do it now.

56
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,890
You cannot choose how you will die,
nor when.

57
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,870
You must learn humility.
When your pride is broken...

58
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,900
...then we will send you
to the underworld.

59
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,130
Don't forget...

60

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,570
You and I,
were doing fine.

64
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,700
Then they come along,
and messed up everything.

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Seems like every bounty's a problem.

66
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,840
"Pamper'! "Baby me"!
Nothing but problems

67
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,310
I understand now why you have this
attitude about women and kids.

68
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,910
Definitely,
too much vermouth.

69
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,480
Who are these guys?

70
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,480
Damn!

71
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,650
Lin!?

72
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,400
I'm Lin's brother.

73
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,090
Shin...

74
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,360
That's right,
you both were inside...

75
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,670
Once you cross this line, you'll never be
able to go back to the syndicate.

76
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,180
What happened,
Shin?

77
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,110
Vicious is going to be executed.

78
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,780
<i>He tried to pull off the coup, but it
backfired. They've got him in the chamber.</i>

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,450
Now, you're a target too.

80
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,950
So's Julia...

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,220
Julia?

82
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,190
They're in Tharsis city.

83
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,700
I'll cover your escape.

84
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,490
<i>Please go now,
while you can!</i>

85
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,890
- I owe you one, Shin!
- Good luck!

86
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,520
Jet: <i>I don't know what's going on
with the Red Dragons...</i>

87
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,460
...but it's really not
your problem now, right?

88
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,720
Vicious, Julia...

89
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,100
To me, those names
sound ominous.

90
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,430
Like a magic spell that unlocks a door.
A door that should stay closed.

91
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,880
What are you gonna...
Uuugh!

92
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,210
Keep it still,
please.

93
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,820
You're not in the syndicate anymore,
Spike.

94
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,290
Yeah,
I know.

95
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,290
And you, doctor...

96
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,860
Forget everything you've heard.
In fact, forget we were here.

97
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,460
What are you yowling` about?

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm just treating stray cats
that wandered into the office.

99
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,640
Pesky cats that I can't
even get rid of.

100
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,530
When this is over,
I'm leaving the syndicate.

101
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
They'll kill you.
You know how they work.

102
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,840
Let them say I'm dead.

103
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,270
I'll be waiting at the graveyard.
By the graves. Not in one.

104
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,050
I...
can't come with you.

105
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,150
Yes, you can.

106
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,990
We'll leave here...
get out of this.

107
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,160
<i>And go where,
do what?</i>

108
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,260
Spike: <i>Live...
be free.</i>

109
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,890
It will be like watching a dream...

110
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,350
Vicious: <i>So,
you were going to betray me?</i>

111
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,720
Did you really thing
you could just leave...?

112
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,560
Vicious.

113
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,360
Keep dream, Julia.
It's never going to happen.

114
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,630
Julia: <i>Are you going to kill him?</i>

115
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,570
I won't...

116
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,530
<i>...you're going to do it for me.</i>

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,210
Either you kill him...

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,510
or else, you both die.

119
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,710
Those are your only options.

120
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,450
Behind her: <i>So there's no place for me after all.</i>

121
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,650
I won't go, and that's that.
I don't care who picks me up.

122
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,320
I don't want to live a life
where I'm always in someone's way.

123
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,130
From Behind: <i>Mother!
I've been looking for you!</i>

124
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,630
A-Alfredo...

125
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,070
I told you to wait at
the curry restaurant!

126
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,470
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,970
That's okay.
I'm just glad you're here.

128
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,180
Mother: <i>Can you really take care of me now?
It sounds too good to be true.</i>

129
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,650
Yes, Mom. Don't worry,
I'll take care of everything.

130
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,120
Have you found a new job, yet?

131
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,490
No,
but I will.

132
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,820
What about your co-host?
That blond girl?

133
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,330
I think she's marrying her agent.

134
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,300
Something about that guy...

135
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,680
Where are you?

136
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,850
What do you want?

137
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,290
<i>I'm heading out to the city of Tharsis.</i>

138
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,650
<i>"I want you to met me there.:"</i>

139
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,020
Why should I?

140
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,460
<i>"It's hard for Jet to
get around by himself... </i>

141
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,020
<i>...with his leg all shot up."</i>

142
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,430
<i>"So quit wasting time,
and get your ass back to the ship."</i>

143
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,430
What makes you think
I'm coming back!

144
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,590
You take too much for granted.

145
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,970
I have my own place to go back to!

146
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,670
What an attitude?
All high-and-mighty.

147
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,240
Jet is not alone. He can take care of him.
Ed and Ein are there too.

148
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,610
You saved me.

149
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,940
And you saved me back.

150
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,810
You're a good shot.

151
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,750
It's a plus when you're
chasing bounty heads.

152
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,660
You're a bounty hunter...?

153
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,950
Well...

154
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,790
...I'm taking a vacation
for personal reasons.

155
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,760
Looks like you're going through
a rough time yourself.

156
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,790
Faye: <i>It might be good to work
with another woman.</i>

157
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,230
<i>How about it?
You wanna partner up?</i>

158
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,240
Julia: <i>I have...
something to take of.</i>

159
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,470
Right.

160
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,230
Too bad.

161
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,910
Do you know places where
bounty hunters hangout?

162
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,110
Faye:<i> If you want to put a bounty on
someone. I can take care of it.</i>

163
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,510
Julia: <i>I'm looking for a bounty hunter.</i>

164
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,520
Julia: <i>I'll drive you back.</i>

165
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,630
I haven't even asked your name.

166
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,000
Faye...

167
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,860
Faye...!?

168
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,670
Faye Valentine.

169
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,830
It's a very common name.

170
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,170
And how about you?

171
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,640
Julia.

172
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,910
Faye: <i>Julia...!?</i>

173
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,610
Julia: <i>It's also a very common name.</i>

174
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,620
I'm glad I met you, Faye.

175
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,420
Same here.

176
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,520
Um,
have I met you somewhere before?

177
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,800
If you see Spike again...

178
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,370
Tell him that I will be
waiting for him there.

179
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,630
That's all. He'll know what it mean.

180
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,250
Tell him that I'll keep waiting.

181
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,510
But,
why...?

182
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,420
See you later,
Faye Valentine.

183
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,620
Hey?
Wait a minute!

184
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,620
How do you know
I know Spike!?

185
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,150
Are you still in pain?

186
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,620
Jet: <i>Have you heard this story?</i>
- Huh?

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,030
Jet: <i>A man injures his leg
during a hunt.</i>

188
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,170
<i>He's in the middle
of the savanna...</i>

189
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,940
<i>...no means to treat the wound.
The leg rots, and death approaches.</i>

190
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,610
<i>Last minute he's picked up
by an airplane.</i>

191
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,010
<i>He looks down, and sees a land
of pure white below him.</i>

192
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,450
<i>Glistening in the light,
is the summit of a snow-covered mountain.</i>

193
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,060
<i>The mountain
is Kilimanjaro.</i>

194
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,280
As he gazes down...<i></i>

195
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,560
<i>...he feels the life flowing out of him...</i>

196
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,830
<i>He thinks,
that's where I was headed.</i>

197
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,960
Spike: <i>And?</i>

198
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,020
Jet: <i>I hate stories like that.</i>

199
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,730
<i>Men only think about the past...</i>

200
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,640
<i>...right before their death.
As if they were...</i>

201
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,570
<i>...searching frantically for
proof that they were alive.</i>

202
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,110
Turn back.

203
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,380
When you and I first met,
you told me something...

204
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,750
...you said that you had died once.
That you had seen death.

205
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,190
Why can't you just let it go?

206
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,990
Forget the past.

207
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,390
There was a woman.

208
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,400
The first time I found someone
who was truly alive.

209
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,660
Lest,
that is what I thought.

210
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,600
She was the part of me that I had lost
somewhere along the way.

211
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,480
The part that I was missing.
That I have been longing for.

212
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,510
- She's back.
- Hm? Who...?

213
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,020
Jet: <i>Ahhh...</i>

214
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,930
This is not a repair shop,
alright Faye?

215
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,860
Don't just come back here
when you've thrashed your ship.

216
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,400
Where is he?

217
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,560
Where is who?

218
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,190
The guy with the fuzzy hair.

219
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,800
Fuzzy hair, huh? Can't you just say
you're looking for Spike?

220
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,970
Where is he?

221
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,880
Jet: <i>Doing something in the workshop.</i>

222
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,750
Wait a minute, Faye.
What are you up too?

223
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,440
You didn't come just to see Spike,
that's for sure.

224
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,920
I was asked to relay a message...

225
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,090
...from Julia.

226
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,960
Huh?
Hold on!!

227
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,430
(Phone buzzing)

228
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,890
<i>Jet,
you there?</i>

229
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,060
What? I don't have any new information.
We're not really in a position...

230
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,730
Cop: <i>I'm glad you're alright.</i>

231
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,860
<i>I was worried. It's getting
pretty intense, you know...</i>

232
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,300
The Red Dragons?

233
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>Yeah...</i>

234
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,770
<i>There was a coup attempt two days ago...</i>

235
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,180
<i>...new guard vs. old.
The old guard won...</i>

236
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,580
<i>...and now they're hunting down anyone...</i>

237
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,180
<i>...who could be connected to the coup.</i>

238
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,050
<i>They'll annihilate every single target
down to the last man.</i>

239
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,950
<i>And your partner is on their list.</i>

240
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,750
Jet: <i>Yeah,
I know. </i>

241
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,480
<i>But why are they go after a guy who
left the syndicate years ago?</i>

242
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,360
<i>Who ever been a part of the group that
staged that coup, they take them out.</i>

243
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,690
<i>That's how they do it.</i>

244
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,790
Jet: <i>What kind of logic is that?</i>

245
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,690
Cop: <i>Just run, Jet.</i>

246
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,600
<i>The police can't stop these guys.</i>

247
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,970
<i>Leave Mars,
and do it fast.</i>

248
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,870
It's too late for that,
but thanks.

249
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,930
You got something?

250
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,900
You look like you
have some information.

251
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,260
It's gonna cost you.

252
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,600
Well, I don't have any money.

253
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,580
You picked a bad time
to come back, Faye.

254
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,550
You're sure you didn't
call them here?

255
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,090
Yeah right,
or maybe they followed you here?

256
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,660
Well, it was bound to
happen sooner or later. Huh?

257
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,090
Wait!

258
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,560
Faye: <i>Hold on!</i>

259
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,200
Spike: <i>I don't have any money.</i>

260
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,300
Faye: <i>She said she'll be waiting there.</i>

261
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,650
She said you'd know what she meant.

262
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,720
Well, I don't.
Sorry.

263
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,980
Her name is Julia.

264
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,890
Someone's trying to kill her,
Spike.

265
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,660
<i>They're after her...</i>

266
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,660
Hey Jet,
I'm ready to take off!

267
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,460
Dragon Leader: <i>One who disturbs the
general affairs of our clan....</i>

268
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,700
<i>...must be executed according to
the general will of our clan.</i>

269
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,050
I'm taking off too!

270
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,050
You can't...

271
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,890
...one of your main thrusters
is totally shot!

272
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,590
Faye: <i>Same difference if
we go down with the ship!</i>

273
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,520
You may leave final words...

274
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,090
...or you may bequeath final possessions.

275
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,960
Nothing.

276
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,120
And you shall shed tears of scarlet.

277
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,080
Jet: <i>Spike,
can you still fly?</i>

278
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,980
Don't worry about us. 
Just go!

279
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,110
Find what you have lost, 
and get it back.

280
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,580
<i>GO!</i>

281
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,500
The leadership of the Red Dragons
has now changed hands.

282
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,670
From this time forward, 
my power is the only power.

283
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:41,830
English subtitle by Dana Robertson
You're welcome.

285
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,230
Aishiteta to nageku niwa...
Too much time has passed by...

286
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:58,570
...amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
...to lament that we were deeply in love.

287
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,270
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo...
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart...

288
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:11,010
...iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
...cannot heal all the tears in it.

Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

Spike: <i>There have been many things,
but the next episode is the last.</i>

296
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,040
Jet: <i>It sure was long...</i>

297
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,050
Faye: <i>The past is the past...</i>
Spike:  <i>No use doing this...</i>

298
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,550
- <i>...and the future is the future.</i>
- <i>So how was it, Jet?</i>

299
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,450
<i>- A man is a man, and a woman is a woman.</i>
Jet: <i>Because of you, I ended up raising Ein.</i>

300
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,960
- <i>I am who I am, and you are who you are.</i>
Jet: <i>Found out I liked dogs after all...</i>

301
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,080
- <i>I wonder where he wandered off too...</i>
Spike: <i>Hey, Jet. </i>

302
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,150
Faye: <i>It doesn't even matter...</i>
Spike: <i>You're not even listening to me.</i>

303
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,430
Jet: <i>Oh... What's that?</i>
Spike: <i>Never mind.</i>

304
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,430
Spike: <i>Anyway... Next episode:
The Real Folk Blues (Part 2).</i>

305
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,130
We'll see you again, 
somewhere.

306
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,640
Faye: <i>It's over?</i>
