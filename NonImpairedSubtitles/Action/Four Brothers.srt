1
00:00:57,838 --> 00:00:59,465
Okay, Darnell,

2
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:02,642
so the candy just happened
to jump into your pocket, huh?

3
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:04,868
I don't think so.
Samir's gonna call the police now.

4
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:07,308
- But l...
- Samir, the police.

5
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,874
- Hello, police?
- Please don't call the police. Please.

6
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:14,377
I'll hold.

7
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:18,189
That's what happens when you
shoplift, there's consequences.

8
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:21,190
But it's just some damn candy.
I don't wanna go to jail.

9
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:24,262
Well, you can probably get away
with stealing sometimes, Darnell,

10
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,796
but, you know, sooner or later
you're gonna get caught.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,491
Is that the way you wanna
lead your life, huh?

12
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:31,830
- No.
- I happen to believe

13
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,404
that you're worth more.

14
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,769
But you gotta believe it, Darnell.

15
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:40,408
- I hear you, Miss Evelyn.
- Are you bullshitting me?

16
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:44,550
- No, ma'am.
- Well, you better not be, you hear me?

17
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:46,343
Yes, ma'am.

18
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:48,748
Okay. Now you tell Samir.

19
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:52,683
I won't steal anymore, sir.

20
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:57,687
It's all right.

21
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,131
Boy, did you get lucky.

22
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,233
Now I want you to go straight home,
you hear me?

23
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,460
- Yes.
- You shouldn't be out

24
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,831
at this time of the night anyway.
Go on, get.

25
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,870
Thank you, Miss Evelyn.

26
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:15,806
You handled that just beautifully.

27
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:20,510
You know, he's a good kid.
He just needs an older brother.

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,746
So let's take a look
at these Thanksgiving birds.

29
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:28,093
Oh, nice. Nice and plump.

30
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,794
Yo, Osama! Osama!
Get behind the register! Now!

31
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,728
- Did you hear what he said?
- Move! Move!

32
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:37,096
- Please! Take it. Please.
- Shut up, man. Come on.

33
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,737
- I want no trouble.
- Shut the fuck up.

34
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:39,963
- Take it all.
- Shut up!

35
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:41,936
- I just came to the country.
- Don't you move.

36
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:44,736
- Do not move!
- I want no trouble, sir. Take it all.

37
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:47,505
This is America, homeboy. Black
people don't get what they want

38
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:49,443
- in this country. Why should you?
- Please!

39
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:05,422
Move, move, move, move!

40
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,190
Come on. Let's go!

41
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:33,068
Been a long time since anybody seen
that face around here.

42
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,077
Must've gotten off for good behavior.

43
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,319
Not likely.

44
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:46,757
That's Bobby Mercer.

45
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,951
Heavyweight champion fuck-up
of the family.

46
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:51,995
And that's a well-defended title.

47
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:55,361
Would've made his daddy proud
if he had ever had one.

48
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:58,196
I used to know him a little.
Played hockey with the boy.

49
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,399
Got thrown out of 60-odd games

50
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,939
before the league
had finally had enough of him.

51
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:05,641
They called him
the Michigan Mauler.

52
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:10,441
- Who's the kid?
- Oh, that's Jack. He's the youngest.

53
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,949
First-class fuck-up,
third-class rock star.

54
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:17,385
- He doesn't look like trouble.
- He's a Mercer.

55
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,581
Don't let him fool you.

56
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,659
Hey.

57
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,453
You all right?

58
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,657
You sure?

59
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,231
You know I love you, man.

60
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,668
Come on, let's go see Jerry.

61
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:35,466
- What do we got over here?
- Another model citizen, I'm sure.

62
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,643
My mom, she used
to talk about y'all all the time,

63
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,971
about how y'all used
to cut up at work.

64
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,910
- No, actually Jeremiah's all right.
- She told me everything.

65
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,812
You know, he was a rising star
in the union for a while.

66
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,810
Man found a cause.

67
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,147
- How you doing, baby?
- Cool.

68
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:50,788
Nice house, man. Not bad at all.

69
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,050
What's up, kiddo?
Come on, man. Give me a hug, man.

70
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,694
We got one MIA.
I thought you said there were four.

71
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,454
Angel?

72
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:00,766
Pretty boy.

73
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,696
Ex-hustler.

74
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,529
Soldier.

75
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,198
Guess he's a no-show today.

76
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,341
Do you remember
when I built that tree house

77
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,237
- and you burned the shit down?
- Come on, man.

78
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:14,208
- Boy, I wanted to kick your ass, man.
- Don't worry, your house is brick.

79
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:16,848
- I ain't gonna burn it down.
- Well, now, yeah.

80
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,608
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No smoking in my house,

81
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:21,651
so you're gonna have
to put that out. Sorry.

82
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,578
I don't get it.

83
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,122
If this woman's such
a goddamn saint,

84
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,090
how did she end up raising
four total fuck-ups?

85
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:32,458
Ms. Evelyn cycled hundreds
of kids out of the foster-care system

86
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,565
and into permanent homes.

87
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:38,761
And in 30 years,
she only came across four lost causes.

88
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:40,405
Four delinquents so far gone,

89
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,734
she couldn't find anyone
to take them in.

90
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,603
So she did.

91
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,244
Trust me, Fowler,

92
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:50,542
these kids are congressmen compared
to what they would've been.

93
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:55,249
- Hey there. You must be Daniela.
- Look how big you guys are.

94
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:57,514
And you must be Amelia.

95
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:00,056
Nice dress, Amelia.

96
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,127
- I'm Amelia.
- I know.

97
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,127
You guys probably don't remember us,
but I'm your Uncle Bobby

98
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:07,356
and this is Cracker Jack.

99
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,659
Don't teach them that, man.

100
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:12,802
- You're not my uncle. You're white.
- Grandma Evey's white.

101
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,837
Yeah, see,
we're a different kind of uncle.

102
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,702
Your grandma,
she adopted me and Uncle Jack,

103
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,343
like she did your daddy.

104
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,604
You're a policeman!

105
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:23,647
That's right, and you're all under
arrest, so don't nobody move.

106
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:26,551
Hey, where y'all going?

107
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,948
What about me, Green?
You gonna arrest me too?

108
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:32,488
All depends, Bobby.
You keeping straight?

109
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,216
Straight-ish.

110
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:37,521
- How you doing, man?
- Good to see you.

111
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,857
- Jack.
- Green.

112
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:43,126
Sorry about your mom, brother.
Give me some love.

113
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,061
Jerry.

114
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,405
I thought you said
he wasn't coming.

115
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:52,339
No, I said I didn't know
if he was coming or not.

116
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:55,912
I ain't seen him in
Lord knows how many years.

117
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:58,675
You know it's hard
to track that Bobby down.

118
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,184
Don't give me that look, Camille.

119
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:06,051
I am way through with that life.

120
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,693
Thanks for coming, Green.
Mom would've been happy you made it.

121
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:12,558
Shit, your mom would've been happy
you made it back for her funeral.

122
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,199
I didn't come back for no funeral.

123
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,238
Thanks for the offer,
but we got it under control.

124
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,034
Yeah. You know, I could tell by
the looks of things when I drove in.

125
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:26,007
The place looks completely different.
Detroit's finest cleaned it up, huh?

126
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:29,181
Yeah, be easy, Bobby.
We got these punks.

127
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,145
Kid playing basketball
across the street

128
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,911
witnessed two gangbangers running in
there, shooting up the place...

129
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,384
Come on, Green. I used to make
a good living around here

130
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,752
because cops like you guys
couldn't find tits in a strip joint.

131
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:40,948
Why don't you come inside,

132
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,457
have some coffee
and some doughnuts

133
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:46,428
and then take your boy and get
the fuck out of here, okay? Come on.

134
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,238
Charming guy.

135
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:10,254
Nice to be home.

136
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,287
So, shit, Bobby,
what've you been up to?

137
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:15,256
I'm a freaking college professor, Jack.
What do you think I've been doing?

138
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,759
- I doubt that.
- Same old Bobby.

139
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:21,161
What about you? You still sucking
a little cock left and right, or what?

140
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,891
Fucker.

141
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:26,734
Y'all ain't right leaving me
out here in the cold like this.

142
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,306
- Yo, little brother! You asshole!
- You ought to be ashamed!

143
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:30,840
- I missed my plane.
- Get over here.

144
00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:33,239
You missed our mother's
funeral too, jarhead.

145
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:35,038
- What's up?
- What's up with you?

146
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:38,483
- What's up, boy?
- It's all good, man.

147
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,984
- You shaved off the Afro, huh?
- Jack!

148
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:45,155
- Haven't seen you in forever.
- Yeah, I know.

149
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:49,522
- Did you get your teeth whitened?
- Man, shut up, Jackie-poo.

150
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,578
I'm gonna get me something to eat.

151
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,645
- All y'all hungry?
- No, I'm gonna get some sleep.

152
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:17,016
Jack, you take your old room, all right?
Angel, take yours.

153
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,350
I'm gonna sleep in Mom's room.

154
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:05,257
You been crying in here,
you little fairy?

155
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:11,596
Leave it alone, man.

156
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:15,004
Still making a lot of racket
on that freaking thing?

157
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,872
Yeah, still making a lot of racket.

158
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,576
- Too weird in Mom's room?
- Oh, man.

159
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:27,912
Way too weird.

160
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,588
It's crazy.

161
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,256
I mean,
everything's exactly the same.

162
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:33,982
She didn't change nothing
in this house.

163
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,566
- Look at y'all.
- What?

164
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,395
Nothing. I'm just happy
to see you, man.

165
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,003
Happy to see my brothers,
that's all.

166
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm happy to see you too, Jerry.

167
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,269
I guess I'll stop by the grocery store
and grab a turkey or something.

168
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:54,503
Have a Thanksgiving dinner.

169
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,012
Let's at least act like
we're a real family.

170
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,315
Mom would like that.

171
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:05,190
Where you think you going?

172
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:10,488
It's a little heavy in there. I'm gonna
just go outside and get me a little air.

173
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:15,456
You're full of shit, man. You can smell
that ass from down the street, huh?

174
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:16,657
What are you talking about?

175
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,632
What do you mean, what?
Come on, what, man.

176
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:21,136
You know exactly what we're talking
about with La Vida Loca.

177
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,433
Ain't nobody going
to get no La Vida Loca nothing.

178
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,338
- She got a boyfriend.
- She got a boyfriend.

179
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,513
She's got hard dick in her right now.

180
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:30,341
She's screaming somebody else's
name, and the last thing she's doing

181
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,848
is thinking about your black ass.
Leave it alone, man.

182
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:35,520
I can't even believe y'all coming at me
with this crazy junk, man.

183
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,484
- She's nothing but trouble.
- I'm standing here

184
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,782
telling y'all both right now,

185
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:41,619
I'm not going to see that girl,
and I'm not!

186
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:46,488
- How serious are you with this dude?
- We're serious!

187
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,157
Oh, shit!

188
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,161
Come on, in here.

189
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:58,135
Loco Ono is not staying
in this house!

190
00:14:58,344 --> 00:14:59,606
- Bullshit, Bobby!
- I don't care!

191
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,973
La Vida Loca ain't staying
in this house one more night.

192
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:03,739
- So get her stuff...
- So it's your house?

193
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,418
- This ain't no homeless shelter.
- You not running shit, Bobby!

194
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:07,950
- You not!
- Hey, Bobby.

195
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,786
Baby, why don't you go back upstairs.
I've got this covered.

196
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,584
- What's wrong with you?
- Go back upstairs!

197
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:16,284
Why do you let him talk
to me like that?

198
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:17,928
- Go upstairs!
- Was I speaking Spanish?

199
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,893
- Was I speaking Spanish?
- What's your problem?

200
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:22,260
Can you stop talking
to my girl like that, man?

201
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:23,992
That's what
I'm talking about, Bobby.

202
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:26,763
She wasn't your girl as of yesterday,
man. She had another man.

203
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:28,167
So I'm confused.

204
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:30,205
What are you talking about, man?

205
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:31,808
- She is my girl!
- He's right!

206
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:35,174
Let's just play some fucking
Turkey Cup, man. How about that?

207
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,750
Don't start, man.

208
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:47,153
- Why do you always do that?
- Shut up.

209
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,123
- To be aggravating.
- "To be aggravating."

210
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:53,392
Chill out, man.
I'm watching the game. Come on.

211
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:56,595
- Why don't y'all hold that down?
- Yeah.

212
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,292
Hold that down, man.

213
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:02,974
- You a woman.
- Get him, Jerry.

214
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:06,239
- Try it one more time.
- What you gonna do?

215
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:10,404
- You'll see.
- Big-ass teeth. Bite me?

216
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,841
You do got some
big-ass teeth, Jerry.

217
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:16,946
Yeah.

218
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:19,921
All right.

219
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,124
- Yeah, get him, Jerry!
- What's up?

220
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,092
- What the hell you doing?
- Come on, boy.

221
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:28,790
The Gorgeous Black Ladies
of Wrestling, Nitro and Midnight.

222
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:31,731
Nitro got Midnight in a headlock.

223
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:33,427
Get him! Get him, Jerry!

224
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,699
Midnight trying to get up,
but Nitro's on him!

225
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:39,537
- Get him, Nitro!
- Okay. All right, all right. All right.

226
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:42,305
I'm still your big brother.

227
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,852
Come on, man, let's eat.
Bring out that bird.

228
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,157
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior,
thank you for this day.

229
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,055
Thank you for this food
we're about to receive

230
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,321
and thank you
for bringing us together. Amen.

231
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:00,726
- Amen.
- Amen.

232
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:10,304
Pass me the salad, man.

233
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,967
Zip up your mouth, Jeremiah.

234
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,903
You grow up in a barn?

235
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:51,409
Close your mouth, Angel.

236
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,486
You think you a cow
or something?

237
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,952
More tattoos, Angel?

238
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:06,297
You don't have to hide them.
Look at mine.

239
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:13,270
But take your elbow off the table.

240
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,341
Jackie?

241
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:36,624
I know bad things happened to you
before you came to me.

242
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:38,628
Hey, look at me.

243
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,894
But you're safe now.

244
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:05,220
To hell with this, man.

245
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,293
Let's go get a pickup game.

246
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:11,463
I wanna see some quick sticks
and some tight passing.

247
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:12,891
It's too cold, man.

248
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:15,589
I ain't come all the way back out here
to go play no hockey.

249
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:19,100
Come on, ladies, let's show
these guys some fucking skills!

250
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,771
Yeah! Come on. Bring it.

251
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,137
All right. Here it comes.

252
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,739
Pass me the puck, Bobby!

253
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,975
Come on, man. Go.

254
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,484
- Y'all watch this.
- You got him.

255
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:39,852
Yeah! Black present.

256
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,351
- There you go, yes!
- Nigga, please.

257
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:44,963
Sorry about that.

258
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:51,336
- Let me to talk to the girls.
- What are you doing? Give me that!

259
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:53,903
- Get your head out of your ass, Jerry!
- That's my phone, man!

260
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:56,301
- Come on!
- Hit him hard.

261
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:59,637
- That was weak.
- Get it, get it, get it.

262
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:02,939
- Shut up, man.
- There you go!

263
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:05,810
- Shit, I gotta make a man out of you.
- Damn it, Bobby.

264
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:08,418
- Why you make them madder?
- Yeah.

265
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:13,348
Gentlemen, I am truly sorry
about your mother.

266
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,618
Although I only met Evelyn
the one time...

267
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,388
...she made quite an impression.

268
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:23,364
I know it's difficult to deal
with mundane financial matters

269
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,470
while your heart still grieves
for a loved one.

270
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,697
How much do we get?

271
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:30,871
Come on, man.

272
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:32,703
- Excuse me.
- Jack, what the...?

273
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,504
Stupid-ass Jack,
what's wrong with you?

274
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,340
What was that?

275
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:41,509
This is the contents of your mother's
safety-deposit box.

276
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,518
I'll leave you to look through it.

277
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,325
Birth certificate.

278
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:58,459
The adoption papers.

279
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:01,504
Henry Ford Hospital.
So I am from Detroit.

280
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:05,267
- Lansing, Michigan.
- My mom was 16?

281
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,809
I got any papers in there?

282
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,577
No.

283
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,181
- I don't?
- No.

284
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:14,848
- You got any papers in there?
- No.

285
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:18,621
1969.

286
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:22,157
- Mom went to Woodstock.
- You didn't know Mom was a hippie?

287
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,022
Oh, here we go.

288
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:34,166
- I ain't got no papers in there, man?
- There's some paper right there.

289
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,108
What about me?

290
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,642
- That'll look good on you.
- Whatever, man.

291
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:43,647
- You're fucking with me.
- Quit crying.

292
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,282
Come on,
I got something to show y'all.

293
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,782
- This is it.
- So this is your dream, Jerry?

294
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:50,080
- Oh, yeah.
- There's a lot of space in here.

295
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,086
What are you gonna do,
build some automobiles?

296
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,384
- No, luxury lofts.
- Rims, man.

297
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:56,424
Urban sophistication
is what I'm talking about.

298
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,291
- So now you're doing real estate?
- This whole first floor here

299
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:02,558
is gonna be lavish offices
and storefronts.

300
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:04,395
I'm gonna put
stained-glass windows here...

301
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:06,628
The building is condemned.
You got insurance?

302
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,272
- Why?
- So we can burn this bitch down.

303
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:11,409
No, we ain't burning shit down. You
always wanna destroy something.

304
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,170
- Look. Look at your little brother.
- Jack!

305
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,409
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this the master suite?

306
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:18,742
Am I making the property value
go down?

307
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:20,885
This shithole gives the term
"Motor City Breakdown"

308
00:22:21,086 --> 00:22:22,713
a whole new meaning, Jerry.

309
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,684
How the hell
you gonna pay for all this?

310
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,520
Government redevelopment loan.
Easy to qualify. Low interest rates.

311
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:33,630
Y'all stick around,
I might give y'all ass a job.

312
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:39,300
They look like nipples.

313
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:43,398
Let's go get a real drink.

314
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:47,209
Your attention, please.
I wanna make a toast.

315
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,744
To Evelyn Mercer.

316
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:52,815
The greatest mother
four degenerate bastards ever had.

317
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,751
Johnny, pour me
and my brothers another round.

318
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:02,825
- And a warm milk for my sister here.
- Man, I will drink you under the table.

319
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,292
We're not talking about sperm,
Jack, this is whiskey.

320
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:07,624
Jack drinks Jack
Jack drinks Jack

321
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,733
- That's your brother.
- Jack drinks Jack

322
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:11,766
Jack licks ass crack and ball sack.

323
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,530
Jack doesn't lick ass crack
and ball sack!

324
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,073
Jack likes boobs. Jack gots fans.

325
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:20,901
Jack's got lots of fans.

326
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,172
- Oh, man.
- Will you shut up, man?

327
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:25,179
- I don't wanna go.
- Why are you in such a rush?

328
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:27,352
You can't hang with your big brother
and have a drink?

329
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:30,750
- I'm here. I mean, what?
- I'm glad y'all here. I love y'all.

330
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:34,221
Hey, that's real goddamn bad stuff
about your mom, fellas.

331
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:38,328
- Yeah.
- Freaking gangs. Worms.

332
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,988
- Someone ought to step on them.
- Which gang, Johnny G?

333
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,999
Oh, shit. Here we go. I knew it.

334
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:46,364
I think I heard something.

335
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:49,840
The neighborhood's
really upset about this.

336
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,408
Same old Bobby.

337
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:53,703
Mama always said,

338
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:57,473
"As bright as Bobby is,
he just does not like to think."

339
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:58,980
Ain't no good gonna come from this.

340
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:01,414
- Let the police do their damn job.
- Stop with the police.

341
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,053
Half the cops
in this town are crooked.

342
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:06,019
You think the other half give two shits
about another liquor-store holdup?

343
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:08,386
I'm telling you, man,
Green's on our side on this one.

344
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:10,357
- Come on, man.
- Green?

345
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:13,053
She's the only woman
that ever gave a damn, man.

346
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:16,063
The least we can do
is go bang on a few doors

347
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:18,236
and see what happens.

348
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:19,734
We owe her that much.

349
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:21,664
Why are you acting
like such a bitch, Jerry?

350
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:24,468
Okay. So, what, y'all just gonna
shoot up the whole town

351
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:25,643
because y'all mad?

352
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,368
- Why not?
- Come on, man!

353
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,547
The people who did this,
they probably from the same

354
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:31,909
shitty-ass streets we from.

355
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:34,449
Mom would've been the first
to forgive them. Y'all know that.

356
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:38,318
- We can't all be saints, Jerry.
- Yeah, we can't all be saints, Jerry.

357
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:42,824
All right. All right. Cool.

358
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:47,026
- Bye, Jerry.
- Don't call me when y'all get shot up.

359
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:48,927
This is Detroit,
in case y'all forgot.

360
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,625
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Johnny.

361
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,099
Come tell us what's going on, man.

362
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:57,833
You wanna know what I heard?

363
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,369
- You got a burner?
- I flew in.

364
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,641
Man, be careful with my baby.

365
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:07,946
- You like that?
- Got ammo?

366
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:11,850
Yeah. It's loaded, little brother.
Careful. Here, you carry the gas can.

367
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:15,049
- We're gonna do that gas thing?
- Yeah, we're gonna do the gas thing.

368
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,751
The only thing that scares people
more than getting burned to death

369
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:19,590
is people getting eaten alive.
Let's go.

370
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,198
What do l...? What do I get?

371
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:26,428
You coming with us? Here you go,
sweetheart. Poke them with that.

372
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:27,969
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

373
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:35,075
Let's go. Five-0!
I wanna see some hands!

374
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,611
Five-0, man! Five-0!

375
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:39,147
It's the fucking police!

376
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:40,944
Bitch, get off me.

377
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:42,916
Get out! I don't wanna see
any of you back!

378
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:44,486
- What are you doing here?
- Hands!

379
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,055
You got any drugs
or alcohol on you?

380
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:47,850
We're gonna make
y'all take urine samples!

381
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,290
Get out of here!
Get your little asses home now!

382
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:57,631
The popos is here! Y'all better run,
man, these white cops are crazy!

383
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,701
They killed Cornbread.
He didn't do nothing.

384
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:01,532
Everybody put
your fucking hands up!

385
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,901
Detroit Police! I wanna see
your fucking hands in the air!

386
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,236
- We got the building surrounded!
- Every last one of you!

387
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:07,639
Sit your motherfucking ass down!

388
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:09,473
- Fuck you.
- Sit the fuck down.

389
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:10,875
- Don't fucking move!
- Sit down!

390
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,142
You. Over here.
Yeah, yeah, you.

391
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:14,477
You the man, right?

392
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:17,655
Sit down and shut the fuck up!
Give me the gas.

393
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,084
Yo, what the hell y'all want?

394
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,122
Y'all ain't no cops.
What the hell you doing here?

395
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:24,090
You're gonna wish I was the police
when I'm done with your ass.

396
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:25,490
No, no, no, no, no.

397
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,597
This is not the talking part, okay?

398
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,824
This is the listening part,
so shut your mouth.

399
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:32,100
- Why are you standing up?
- You know who I am?

400
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:33,532
- It's warm here.
- No?

401
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:36,606
- Get your ass over there on the couch.
- You don't know why we're here?

402
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,207
- Yo, what the fuck!
- Shut up.

403
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,244
I know you're not gonna tell me
what I wanna know,

404
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:45,712
so I'm gonna light
your little bitch ass on fire.

405
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:49,019
Then I'm gonna
watch you run around here

406
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:52,190
like a chicken with his head cut off,
lighting all your little friends on fire.

407
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:53,449
Is that what you want?

408
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:56,127
Which one of your boys shot up
the liquor store on 104th Street?

409
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:58,929
The police got witnesses, bra.

410
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:01,827
- Don't even hit us with no bullshit.
- Okay, tough guy. Hey!

411
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,296
Now is the talking part.

412
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,630
You better start saying what
the fuck I wanna hear. Speak.

413
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:09,432
Man, that shit was counterfeit
as a motherfucker, man.

414
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:12,735
Ain't nobody playing no basketball
when that shit went down, okay?

415
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:14,503
Why you think cops
ain't arrest nobody?

416
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:17,140
What the hell is he doing?

417
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,840
How do you know nobody was playing
basketball if you weren't there?

418
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:23,078
Because, bitch, police said those
people wasn't killed till 11:00.

419
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:25,847
- So what?
- So they turn the court lights out at 10!

420
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,789
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Now, where we going, man?

421
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,158
The fuck y'all taking me?

422
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:37,130
You little bastards need
to stay in school.

423
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,536
That's what you get
for calling my brother a bitch.

424
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:42,332
I hope you all have
a very nice evening.

425
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:50,914
It's 10:02, and these
fucking lights are still on.

426
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:53,050
I know you know
who did this, homeboy.

427
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,412
This is bullshit. Let's pop
this motherfucker right now.

428
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,247
- Speak up on it, man.
- Bobby, take it easy.

429
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,185
- Shut up, Jack. Come on.
- Look, what...?

430
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:01,757
Yo, man, they gonna shut off!
They gonna shut off, man!

431
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,894
Only lights that are going off
are yours. Let's go.

432
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,620
Look, look, look. Look.

433
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:11,735
You're fucking lucky.

434
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:14,229
Told you.

435
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:17,875
Man, y'all fools been played.
Get off of me, man!

436
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,203
Y'all don't even know
who you messing with, man.

437
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,505
Questioning me about the lights
being off and all that.

438
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:25,808
Why don't you shut the fuck up, man?
You talk too much.

439
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:30,219
Jack, it was a questionable kill.

440
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:31,719
What makes you think that?

441
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,857
Boy, it's sad,
you growing up without a father.

442
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:35,549
Nobody taught you anything,
did they?

443
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:38,821
I should've stayed around longer and
held your little hand, huh, sweetheart?

444
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:39,998
Whatever, man.

445
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:43,690
Look, sometimes pros will cover up
their shots with another crime.

446
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:45,369
Like a burglary or something.

447
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,562
Then pay a witness to throw
the cops on to the wrong suspect.

448
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,605
You understand?

449
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,436
Why would anybody wanna kill

450
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:56,205
the sweetest woman
in the goddamn world?

451
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:00,111
I don't know, Jackie. I don't know.

452
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:11,020
All right, I'm here.

453
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,630
- What?
- Last night we found out

454
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:15,356
it wasn't random.

455
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,502
The witness was paid, and the whole
gang story was some bullshit.

456
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:19,795
Are you serious, man?

457
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:22,439
- Come on now.
- Yeah.

458
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:26,074
Can I help you, gentlemen?

459
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,509
Yeah, if we could just have
a moment of your time, sir.

460
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:32,205
Evelyn Mercer was our mother.

461
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,878
She was a good lady.

462
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:39,016
I liked her very much.

463
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,820
Let's come inside.

464
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:58,868
This doesn't add up.

465
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:06,607
He's already got the money.

466
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,947
Supposedly, a witness told police
this was a gang shooting.

467
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:42,313
You know anything about that?

468
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,989
The police talked
for a long time with one man.

469
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,623
One man more than the others.

470
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,427
Would you remember what
he looks like if you see him?

471
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:52,324
He comes in for Gatorade
after the games.

472
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:55,159
Big guy. Always wears sweats,
never a jacket.

473
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,562
Even with snow or rain.

474
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,532
He has a dog and a...

475
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:02,298
- You know a:
- A fro?

476
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:05,271
Like an Afro? Like Ben Wallace,
the basketball player?

477
00:31:05,477 --> 00:31:07,911
Pistons. Yes, yes, Ben Wallace.

478
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,140
Okay.

479
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:14,042
- Is he on the courts a lot?
- On the courts or at the gym.

480
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:19,653
That wasn't no gang shooting,
that was an execution.

481
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:22,554
They set Mom up.
They set her up.

482
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,788
Come on.

483
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,173
- You guys ready?
- What's the plan, Bobby?

484
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:47,783
- We're winging it, Jerry.
- We always wing it.

485
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,783
We're gonna get killed.

486
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:52,422
What you mean "we," white boy?

487
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:54,319
You ready?

488
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,695
Here we go.

489
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:00,091
Excuse me.

490
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,233
I'll handle it. I don't know what
the hell you think you're doing,

491
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:07,200
but you better get
the hell out of here, friend.

492
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,066
I'd love to, friend, but I can't.

493
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:13,309
Yeah! I got the rock now!
I got this motherfucker now!

494
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:16,036
- What? What? I got the rock!
- What, bitch?

495
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:24,311
No need to grab me.
This will only take a second.

496
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:26,183
Now shut up and listen!

497
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,018
- Get off!
- Get off the floor!

498
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:30,160
My name is Bobby Mercer.

499
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:32,057
And some of you probably
knew my mother.

500
00:32:32,264 --> 00:32:33,788
And some of you probably know
she was shot

501
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,466
about a week ago across the street.

502
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:38,798
Sixty-two years old,
murdered in cold blood!

503
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,905
- Think about it, Bobby, think. Think!
- I'm looking for the witness.

504
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,870
I got this.

505
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:47,875
Ballplayer. Big guy.
Supposedly never wears a coat.

506
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,973
- Dog lover. Ring any bells?
- Damn.

507
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:54,780
You tell me where I can find the guy
and you can finish your game.

508
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,621
All we wanna do is talk to the guy.

509
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:01,087
You can end this real quickly.

510
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:05,562
Hey! Hey, kid!
No running in the halls!

511
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:08,157
Get off me, man!

512
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,891
- Why you running?
- Get off me, man.

513
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:13,070
- Man, I don't know nothing.
- Why don't you shut up?

514
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:15,933
You got something
to tell me, youngster?

515
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:19,406
- Back the fuck up!
- I'm looking for who killed my mother.

516
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:23,610
You tell me where I can find this guy
and you can finish your game.

517
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:25,744
Cracker Jack.

518
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,181
I appreciate your help very much.
You've all been upstanding citizens.

519
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:32,881
Enjoy the rest of your game.

520
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,286
You crazy as hell.

521
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,354
- What do we got here?
- Bobby, meet Keenon.

522
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:42,058
Keenon, this is Bobby.

523
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,830
Something tells me he was
on his way to deliver a warning.

524
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:48,005
What's his name, Keenon?

525
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,438
Damian. He's my brother.

526
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,109
He's your brother?
No shit. These are my brothers.

527
00:33:57,582 --> 00:34:00,551
- No, dog. He's my real brother.
- Yeah, these are my real brothers.

528
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:03,778
This is Angel, I'm Bobby.
This is Jack and Jeremiah.

529
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:06,047
So, what about you and Damian?
You guys still close?

530
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:08,452
- Does he live at home with you?
- Yeah.

531
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,218
But I ain't telling you shit else.

532
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:13,989
- Okay.
- I wouldn't sell out my brothers either.

533
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:17,691
Just calm down, okay?

534
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:20,000
Look, we just wanna talk to him.

535
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:23,606
We wanna ask him a few questions.
Is he gonna cooperate?

536
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,741
- We got something.
- Address?

537
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:28,640
He lives in the Gardens,
right over there.

538
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:32,840
Enjoy the rest of the game, okay?
Don't worry about it.

539
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:36,916
These are nice grades.
Better stay in school.

540
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:40,217
What is that? Aluminum?

541
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:42,954
Shit doesn't even spin.

542
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:45,220
Come on, man.

543
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:47,627
I just don't get it.
Why would somebody hire

544
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:50,892
a goddamn killer to shoot Mom?

545
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:52,262
Here's an idea:

546
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:55,570
We'll wait for the shithead
to get back and we'll ask him.

547
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,138
Well, y'all do what y'all gotta do.

548
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:00,208
I got gymnastics.
Come on, let me out.

549
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:04,408
You got your leotard on, Jerry?

550
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:07,278
Go to hell. Y'all know what I'm talking
about. I got a schedule to keep.

551
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,350
Girls got gymnastics,
I gotta take them.

552
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,079
Come on, let me out, man.

553
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,054
You wanna take Cracker Jack
with you? He's very flexible.

554
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,251
- Bobby, you're the one who took ballet.
- All right, Jerry.

555
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:19,191
All right, man.

556
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:25,262
I don't mind
If it rains or freezes

557
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:30,203
Long as I got
My plastic Jesus

558
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:32,569
- Riding on the dashboard
- I don't know how you did it

559
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:34,768
for so many years.
Must have driven you crazy, Angel.

560
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:38,039
You're on a ship for what, six months
at a time with nothing but dudes?

561
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:43,448
It wasn't a ship. And the Marines
went coed. They got girls now.

562
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:46,055
Yeah, I bet you them girls
look like dudes too, though.

563
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:48,817
Not after six months they don't.

564
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:55,495
Comes in colors
Pink and pleasant

565
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,225
Glows in the dark...

566
00:35:58,436 --> 00:35:59,835
Oh, that's him. It's him!

567
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,945
Yo, Damian! You Damian?

568
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:22,583
Why are you pulling out guns
and shit, dog?

569
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:26,594
- Yo!
- Oh, fuck! Who are these guys, man?

570
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:30,696
Jack, stay here.
Tell me where it stops.

571
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:36,372
Come on!

572
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:38,371
Four.

573
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:40,778
Five.

574
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:44,307
Six.

575
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:46,676
Come on, come on. Shit!

576
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:52,718
Six. It stopped.

577
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:55,557
Come on, Angel, we got this clown!
Come on!

578
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,496
Six! He stopped at six!

579
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:07,798
Yo!

580
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:10,673
Yo, Damian, I just wanna
ask you a few questions!

581
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,502
I got something for your ass!

582
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:15,303
Bite his ass, Chucky!

583
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:16,814
Oh, shit!

584
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:21,078
Yo, don't shoot my dog, man!

585
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:23,151
- They got him! That's right!
- Shit!

586
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:24,787
- Bite his ass!
- Angel! Angel!

587
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,921
Get this fucking dog
off my leg! Shit!

588
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,795
There's a dog trying to eat me, man!
Help me, man.

589
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:41,062
- Hold on!
- Bite his ass!

590
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:45,766
- It's biting my legs off!
- Get up off my brother!

591
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,079
Get up off my brother, little boy!
What you doing?

592
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,844
Where you at, playboy?

593
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:55,485
My eyes.
Give me something for my eyes!

594
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:58,383
We just wanna talk!
Put that in your eyes.

595
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,852
Talk, huh?

596
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,287
- The window. The window.
- All right.

597
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:06,989
- Shit!
- Y'all didn't know

598
00:38:07,198 --> 00:38:09,291
- who you was messing with!
- He'll try to come up like...

599
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,694
Get him.

600
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,901
Give me my gun! Give me my gun!

601
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:15,697
- I ain't playing with this dude!
- Drop it!

602
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:17,033
I just wanted to talk!

603
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:22,336
You're going down now!

604
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,979
- Think he dead?
- No, he ain't dead.

605
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:30,450
He's just fucked up.
Let's go talk to him now.

606
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,053
Man, you must be freezing.

607
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:37,752
You won't be needing
this no more, playboy.

608
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,664
You know why we're here, Damian?

609
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:48,930
Come on, man,
call me an ambulance.

610
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,108
An ambulance?
What, for my dog bites?

611
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:54,710
I'm gonna be okay.
You give me a name, I'll call 911.

612
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:56,971
I wanna know who shot up
that liquor store now.

613
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:59,809
- Man, I didn't shoot no one.
- Say what?

614
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:02,452
Speak up. Can't hear you, playboy.

615
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:04,747
It's hard to hear you out here
with all this wind.

616
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:08,187
If we leave, ain't nobody else gonna
hear you out here either.

617
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,020
They say it's gonna be a cold night.

618
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:12,492
You ain't gonna make it far
with that leg.

619
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:14,164
Look, man,

620
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:17,232
these two fools
said they'd pay me a few dubs

621
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:19,767
if I said I saw some gangsters
shoot up the place, all right?

622
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:22,872
- But I didn't hurt no one!
- Well, turn into a fucking Fudgesicle.

623
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:25,941
Hey, come on, man!
I can't say nothing!

624
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,608
Fair enough.
You're gonna die right here.

625
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:32,606
Yo, man, come on! Yo, man!

626
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:34,717
- I'm calling his bluff.
- Hey, come on!

627
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:36,578
- Call an ambulance!
- Think he gonna break?

628
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:38,415
You see that sparerib
hanging out of his leg?

629
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,113
It's just a matter of time.

630
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:42,121
- You sure?
- You wanna put money on it?

631
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:43,793
- Are you sure?
- Someone help me!

632
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:46,122
- Turn around, dick lips!
- What the fuck you looking at?

633
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,457
- I'll tell you where you can find him!
- Come on!

634
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,156
Just call me an ambulance.

635
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:53,569
- Give me a name.
- Where can we find him?

636
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,902
Yeah.

637
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,609
How are you guys tonight?

638
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:15,754
Goatee. Goatee.
Look for the man with the goatee.

639
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,190
- I can get you one bigger than that.
- How big?

640
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:20,957
- There he is.
- Where?

641
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,564
Right there.
The guy with the goatee.

642
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:25,827
- I see. Put your fucking hand down.
- Check the cats at the door.

643
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:29,432
I see him. I see him.
Come on. Let's get him.

644
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:32,171
- Get down!
- Damn! Go, go, go!

645
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:35,544
- Run, y'all!
- Move! Everybody move!

646
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:36,714
- Go, go.
- Clear the way.

647
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:38,745
- Excuse me.
- Move!

648
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,384
Come on! Come on!

649
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:43,110
Go ahead, you fucking punks!

650
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:45,385
Get it, Jackie-o!

651
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:51,017
You go, girl!
Let's get these motherfuckers.

652
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:01,370
- Where they at?
- Can't see shit!

653
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:05,638
- Punch it, Bobby! Punch it!
- I got no traction!

654
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:08,573
I'm sliding all over the fucking street!

655
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:18,478
Hold on!

656
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:21,655
Shit!

657
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:24,293
Shit! I scraped the whole side
of my fucking car!

658
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:27,658
- Get these guys before you kill us!
- Sit back and put your seat belt on.

659
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:34,904
- Watch the snow, man!
- I don't give a fuck about the snow!

660
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:39,640
Shit! Where the hell's
that shotgun, Jack?

661
00:41:39,844 --> 00:41:41,903
- There's no shells.
- They're in the trunk.

662
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:44,081
- What the hell am l...?
- Sit down and shut up!

663
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:47,149
Angel, stick that cannon
out the window and bust some shots!

664
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:50,013
I'm gonna put one
in the back of their heads!

665
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:53,352
Shoot those sons of bitches, Angel!
Get them!

666
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:55,082
Shoot that motherfucker!

667
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:01,122
- You got him!
- Look out for the snow bank!

668
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:03,323
Look out!

669
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:10,296
Jackie, you got your seat belt on?
Watch this. Hold on.

670
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:16,609
Oh, shit!

671
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:20,041
- Shit!
- Fuck that nigga. Just drive. Drive!

672
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:23,550
Don't let them get away!
Don't let them get away!

673
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:32,753
I got them.

674
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:35,632
- Shit!
- I'm over this shit!

675
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,994
Pop them, Angel! Pop them!
Get them!

676
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,669
Angel, get your ass in here!

677
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:47,234
Shit! We got a fucking blowout!

678
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:49,743
Bobby, let's just stop the car!
Okay, Bobby? Let's stop!

679
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:53,314
Shut up, Jack! I'm gonna ride
this bitch out on the rim! We got them!

680
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:10,723
Ready?

681
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,108
Hold on. Hold on.
I got them now. I got them.

682
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:21,676
- We got them now.
- We got them.

683
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,210
- On your side, man!
- Where they at?

684
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:24,745
On your side. Look out. Look out!

685
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:28,216
Hold on!

686
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:35,248
- Get them! Get them!
- Hold on!

687
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,206
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

688
00:43:55,413 --> 00:43:56,778
That's what
I'm talking about, Bobby.

689
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:07,523
Jack, you wait here.

690
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:14,054
- Get your punk ass out the car.
- Fuck you!

691
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:18,201
- Who sent you?
- I ain't telling you shit!

692
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:22,673
Get his wallet.

693
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:25,907
You fucked with the wrong lady.

694
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:34,416
Let's get the fuck out of here, man.

695
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:42,823
- Let's go! Come on.
- Are they dead?

696
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:45,791
- Yeah, they gone!
- They killed Mom. We got them.

697
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:54,862
- What's happening?
- Lieutenant. It's maximum ugly.

698
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:58,331
We got two obvious executions.

699
00:44:58,743 --> 00:45:00,335
Any IDs on them?

700
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:03,638
No. I'll get their prints
before we put them on ice.

701
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:07,340
What do you say, Green?
Any ideas?

702
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:09,815
That's what we pay you for.

703
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:20,861
You're such a pussy, Bobby.

704
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:23,393
- Give me a break, will you?
- It should be against the law

705
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:26,069
for people to keep dogs where
someone like you can get to them.

706
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,135
Hey, y'all! Police in the house!

707
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:30,136
- Get me something to cover my arm.
- Yeah, yeah.

708
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:31,899
Shit. Hurry up.

709
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,110
Angel. Mind if we come in?

710
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:41,216
You're already in.

711
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:43,080
Cops are always welcome
at the Mercers'.

712
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,278
It makes us feel safe and cozy.

713
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:48,424
Just the way we like it.

714
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:52,186
Ain't you sexy.

715
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:54,290
Thank you.

716
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:57,262
Jackie wanted this little number
for himself, but I fought him for it.

717
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:00,763
What happened to the hand?

718
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:03,664
Did you happen to forget
our little conversation we had

719
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:07,241
at your brother's house about
not interfering with our investigation?

720
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:11,472
Oh, no, no. This is Turkey Cup, man.
Hockey.

721
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:13,616
An old Mercer family tradition.

722
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:16,048
You remember that, don't you, Green?
You played hockey.

723
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:18,949
Guys can be pretty rough
out on that ice.

724
00:46:19,156 --> 00:46:21,249
Where's you car, Bobby?

725
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:23,690
It's not outside.

726
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:27,625
- We left it at Jeremiah's.
- Yeah.

727
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:29,460
Jerry drove us home.

728
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,897
You know, Volvos are one
of the safest cars out there.

729
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:35,835
Volvos are incredible, man,
when it's a blizzard outside.

730
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,905
- So we...
- Fascinating.

731
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:39,872
Hey, Gretzky,
you know what this is?

732
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:43,547
- A hair from your wife's tit?
- Try from your thick skull.

733
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:47,410
Forensics took it off a pair of contract
killers we found dead this morning.

734
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:50,451
Fishing for a confession
with a phony hair, huh?

735
00:46:50,654 --> 00:46:54,488
That's an old one, boys.
Come on, Green.

736
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:59,289
You know when I'll know you got
my hair off a dead body, right?

737
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:02,295
When I hear the jailhouse doors
close behind me, girls.

738
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,229
Okay, then you tell me
what they told you.

739
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:08,136
You think that these thugs
were hired to kill Evelyn, is that it?

740
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:10,369
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Green.

741
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:15,477
Wait, Green, how do you go from
petty thug to contract killer?

742
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:18,509
And if they were
professional shooters, like you say,

743
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:22,182
they'd have never told us who they
was working with anyway.

744
00:47:22,386 --> 00:47:24,820
Even if they got one hell
of an ass-whupping.

745
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:29,015
You think you're pretty cute,
don't you? He does.

746
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:31,386
Everybody's a smart guy
until I bust them in the mouth.

747
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:33,028
- Wait!
- You gonna bust me in my mouth?

748
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,494
- This ain't what I'm here for!
- The fuck you think this is?

749
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,326
Hey, stop!

750
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:42,370
Look, Bobby, if you got something,
you give it to me.

751
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:44,473
And if it's something vital,
we will run with this.

752
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:47,872
But don't try and take on Detroit
by your damn self.

753
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:49,943
You keep knocking
on the devil's door long enough,

754
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:52,445
and sooner or later,
somebody gonna answer you.

755
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:58,179
What's up, guys?

756
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:02,820
Oh, shit. Evan, Vic's here.
Vic's here.

757
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:05,495
- Ladies, get up.
- Get up. Come on, go, go!

758
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:07,027
I'm going.

759
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:16,037
Out-of-town shooters.

760
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:18,300
That's what I said.

761
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:20,703
I remember hearing myself saying,

762
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:23,971
"Out-of-town shooters."

763
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:27,878
You know what?
You don't pay a ho to fuck you.

764
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:30,716
You pay her to leave.

765
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:33,250
What you pay
out-of-town shooters to do?

766
00:48:34,058 --> 00:48:36,720
You pay them to get
the hell back out of town.

767
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:40,385
That's why I asked
for out-of-town shooters.

768
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:42,259
What'd I get?

769
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:44,930
In-town shooters.

770
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:50,930
Someone decided
to hire in-town shooters.

771
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:53,739
You know what else
I got for my money?

772
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:56,071
In-town police.

773
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:59,779
In-town trouble.

774
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:04,254
Who's got to get
in the ring with me on this?

775
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:06,587
You hungry, Evan?

776
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:11,525
You must be hungry, right?

777
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:15,255
- I'm sorry...
- Don't apologize!

778
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,966
Dog's gotta eat, right?

779
00:49:19,503 --> 00:49:22,131
I tell you what, you wanna come
in my restaurant and eat? Go ahead!

780
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:23,397
Eat, dog, eat!

781
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:29,209
Get the fuck out of my seat, man!

782
00:49:37,688 --> 00:49:39,315
Eat!

783
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:46,452
That's a good boy.

784
00:49:47,164 --> 00:49:48,597
- That's a good boy.
- That's bullshit.

785
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,962
Shut your mouth, bitch!
I'll put you down there with him.

786
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:57,097
Matter of fact, get your ass over here
and share a meal with your man!

787
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,265
Now.

788
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,455
Lap that shit up good.

789
00:50:24,234 --> 00:50:27,294
Now find out who killed
the shooters.

790
00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:31,467
- What bastard hired these guys?
- West Marine's by the river, right?

791
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:34,769
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go take a look.

792
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:36,468
All right.

793
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,609
- Baby.
- Now, sweetie,

794
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,983
wasn't there a discussion
about a dinner together?

795
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,715
Because I seem to remember
spending two hours in the kitchen.

796
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:50,757
We got some important shit
to deal with, baby.

797
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:52,929
She's so la vida loca.

798
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,121
- Man, don't do that right now.
- Shut up, Bobby.

799
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:57,527
- Don't you start with that crap!
- Can y'all not go there?

800
00:50:57,735 --> 00:51:00,533
- That's why you don't get a girlfriend.
- Don't go there, please.

801
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:03,229
You know what?
I want a girlfriend like you.

802
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:06,899
- Can we go?
- Angel.

803
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:10,308
You said this time
was gonna be different.

804
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:15,549
You're breaking mi corazn.

805
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:19,714
She's getting
real comfortable here, huh?

806
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:21,117
What are you doing?

807
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:24,158
I thought you was a macho man.
A tough guy.

808
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:30,427
You know, it's a real shame that little
Jackie's the only one down to ride.

809
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:32,727
Let's go, Jackie.

810
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:34,870
Say goodbye
to your big sister, Jackie. Let's go.

811
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:38,530
You gonna leave me too?
I just need 15 minutes, man.

812
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:43,236
She's addicted
to what Angel's dick did.

813
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,278
Sofi?

814
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,878
Baby.

815
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:55,616
Just like when we were 16.

816
00:51:57,628 --> 00:51:59,596
My favorite room in the house.

817
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:02,424
I already set it to spin.

818
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:15,371
- Who are you?
- Hi, I'm with State Farm.

819
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:18,275
I have a question or two about
your mother's insurance policy.

820
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:25,386
It's imperative that I speak
with Jeremiah immediately.

821
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:26,647
The check is being processed,

822
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:28,984
but nonetheless,
some red flags have been raised.

823
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:30,387
What do you mean, red flags?

824
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:33,995
Well, it's an unusually high payout
for a simple life-insurance policy.

825
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:36,996
For the last two years,
the premium was paid via check

826
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:38,725
from your brother's bank account.

827
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:42,838
With your brother's criminal record and
his business near bankruptcy, well,

828
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,167
- it's our responsibility to investigate.
- Bankruptcy?

829
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,105
Wait, so Jeremiah's broke?

830
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:52,113
- Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Certainly.

831
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:54,307
- Angel, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, baby.

832
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:57,146
What the hell is this?

833
00:52:57,354 --> 00:52:59,219
Oh, those are breath mints, baby.
Give me one sec...

834
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:01,391
- You know I'm allergic to latex.
- I should be going.

835
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:03,617
- No, no. Hold on, please.
- Who did you buy them for?

836
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:05,260
Put the cuckoo back
in the clock, baby.

837
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:07,555
I bought them in Vegas before
I knew I was coming here.

838
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:09,356
- Who are they for?
- For no one!

839
00:53:09,566 --> 00:53:11,295
Please, sir, please.

840
00:53:11,502 --> 00:53:12,867
Baby, if we gonna talk about this,

841
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,971
- can we please do it outside?
- Okay, you wanna talk outside?

842
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:17,572
Well then fine, let's talk outside!

843
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:19,708
We're gonna talk right now.
We're gonna talk right...

844
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,310
Get your ass out of here, girl.

845
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:26,907
So how much is my brother getting?

846
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:30,609
- A little more than 400,000.
- Open the door now.

847
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:31,845
That's crazy.

848
00:53:32,155 --> 00:53:34,555
Check everything, Jackie. There's
gotta be some shit around here

849
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:36,817
that ties these guys
to somebody else.

850
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,108
You dicking around in here?
You find anything?

851
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:05,916
A camera.

852
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:07,317
Come on.

853
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:09,657
Thank you.

854
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,426
- Big Chief.
- Hey, thanks.

855
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:15,923
Angel Mercer. How you doing?

856
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:18,693
I ain't worked for Jerry
for a long time.

857
00:54:18,936 --> 00:54:21,530
Not since he started up
those luxury condos.

858
00:54:21,772 --> 00:54:25,071
High-dollar stuff like that brings in
all the gangsters.

859
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,971
Wait. So you're saying Jerry
got mixed in with some gangsters?

860
00:54:28,412 --> 00:54:30,437
What's going on?

861
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:34,606
There's this do-gooder. He's on
city council. His name's Douglas.

862
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:36,445
- Okay.
- He's the guy who shut down

863
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:38,484
Jerry's warehouse project.

864
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:40,948
He'll know who Jerry
got mixed up with.

865
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:47,395
SIG Sauer.45 auto.

866
00:54:47,598 --> 00:54:50,123
That'll blow your back out.

867
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:55,533
Nine millimeter Beretta.

868
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:57,263
Oh, look at this Beretta.

869
00:54:57,474 --> 00:55:00,204
It's triple-action.
Three bullets at once.

870
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:01,570
They say dead men tell no tales,

871
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:03,541
but they sure leave
important shit lying around.

872
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:05,578
Hey, what the hell
are y'all doing now?

873
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,543
Just getting a head start
on next year's taxes, Jerry.

874
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:11,721
Look how y'all doing
Mama's house!

875
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:14,390
Come on. Look at this table, man.
Come on.

876
00:55:14,591 --> 00:55:16,718
- You know what? You're right.
- Hey, Sofi, why don't you

877
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:18,554
do me a favor
and clean up some of this shit?

878
00:55:18,762 --> 00:55:20,559
Make yourself useful.

879
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:24,156
You missed.

880
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:27,663
Hey, Bobby.

881
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,271
- Where'd y'all get this?
- Our friend Stanly, the shooter.

882
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:35,342
Let me see that.

883
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:38,076
- They were tracking Mom.
- That's that guy.

884
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:40,745
That's that lawyer guy.
That shithead said...

885
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:43,111
He said he only met
her once, Bobby.

886
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,652
Where the hell you been?
I been trying to call you all day.

887
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:47,153
Following up new leads.

888
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,655
Yep. Let's go.

889
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:53,796
Jerry, you coming with us? Don't
you wanna find out who hired them?

890
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:55,897
Yeah, don't you wanna
find out who killed Mom?

891
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,897
- Of course I do, man.
- Let's go. Stop bullshitting. Come on.

892
00:55:59,102 --> 00:56:00,467
All right.

893
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,468
Somebody gotta look after
y'all clowns.

894
00:56:03,707 --> 00:56:08,041
- Oh, so now you calling us clowns?
- Well, I call it like I see it.

895
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:10,678
- What?
- You're gonna leave again?

896
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:12,280
- That's your problem.
- Okay, fine.

897
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:14,643
- Go. Go.
- You gonna be here. Whatever.

898
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:18,014
We might have to spend
the night up in this bitch.

899
00:56:19,823 --> 00:56:22,690
An attack dog.
Come here, poochie.

900
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:25,384
You don't wanna bite me, do you?

901
00:56:25,896 --> 00:56:27,488
You gonna bite me, baby?

902
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:30,493
Hey, Bobby, check this out.
I found Bradford's calendar.

903
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:35,695
You don't think "EM" stands
for Evelyn Mercer, do you?

904
00:56:35,906 --> 00:56:40,206
- You're getting good at this, Jackie.
- November 21.

905
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,878
He met up with her
the night she died.

906
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,480
Why would anybody meet up
with their lawyer at 8:00 at night?

907
00:56:45,682 --> 00:56:47,445
Angel!

908
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:50,584
- Nice. Your girlfriend's here.
- She's crazy, man.

909
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:51,981
Well, go shut her up then.

910
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:56,091
Angel! Angel, come out!
I see you in the window!

911
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:58,386
Come out, you idiot!
I know you're in there!

912
00:56:58,595 --> 00:57:00,722
Y'all come out here with me.
This girl is crazy.

913
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:04,924
Angel! People, there's robbers
in the house!

914
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:06,391
Come out, Angel!

915
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:08,594
- I'm gonna call the police now!
- Come on!

916
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:10,295
You better call
immigration on this girl.

917
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:13,305
You've got a real class act here.

918
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:16,875
- She should be at Guantanamo Bay.
- Oh, my God.

919
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,342
Locked up.

920
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,241
Excuse me. What are you doing?

921
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:24,579
- How you doing, buddy?
- Bobby! Bobby! He's a lawyer!

922
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:26,449
- What's going on here?
- He's a liar, Jerry!

923
00:57:26,656 --> 00:57:28,453
- Ain't nobody's business! Stay away!
- Come here!

924
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:30,182
You heard me, old man.

925
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:33,123
You fucking lied to me. You said
you didn't even know my mother.

926
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:36,265
You were the last person
to see her alive.

927
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,464
Look at that, Jerry. It leaves
a nice big red handprint, huh?

928
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:40,962
Just ask him the question.

929
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:45,540
No, I'm gonna do it again and again
until I find out what I wanna know.

930
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:46,868
- Oh, God!
- Tell him!

931
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:49,978
Okay. Okay, I'll explain.

932
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,738
It's just that I...

933
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:54,712
- I felt so guilty.
- Guilty for what?

934
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:57,978
I'm not even sure
I know how to say it.

935
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:00,622
- Say what?
- Your mother and I were...

936
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:03,088
Were seeing each other socially.

937
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:06,194
- Socially?
- I didn't want to sully

938
00:58:06,396 --> 00:58:07,624
your mother's reputation.

939
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:10,197
- She was a fine, fine woman.
- I know. I know.

940
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:11,991
I have some of your mother's
night things,

941
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,567
- if you want. They...
- What?

942
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,238
- No. No, it's not necessary.
- Too much information.

943
00:58:16,439 --> 00:58:18,669
Baby, listen, I need you
to get out of here.

944
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:21,844
I apologize, Mr. Bradford.
We broke your back window.

945
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:23,808
We're just trying to figure
out what happened.

946
00:58:24,014 --> 00:58:26,312
- I understand.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

947
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:28,484
- You have a beautiful home here.
- Thank you.

948
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:35,355
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yo.

949
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:43,989
- Hey, man. I gotta ask you a question.
- What's up?

950
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:47,136
You know me and Sofi
did a lot of making up last night.

951
00:58:47,337 --> 00:58:50,238
- You gave her that ring, huh?
- Yeah.

952
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,638
But it seem like I got
a little rust on the tools down here.

953
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:56,870
Ask the cockologist
in the shower, man.

954
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,105
- How the hell would I know?
- You're the expert.

955
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:05,715
- Rug burn.
- You're gonna live.

956
00:59:05,922 --> 00:59:08,152
Thank God, man.
I thought my luck ran out.

957
00:59:12,662 --> 00:59:14,152
Hey, listen, man.

958
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:16,059
You know, Jerry
ain't been straight up with us

959
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,359
about that redevelopment project.

960
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:22,470
Found out his dream's dead. Jerry
got involved with some bad people.

961
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:25,038
City got on him about fraud
and whatnot.

962
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:27,410
Cut his loans off like a month ago.

963
00:59:27,611 --> 00:59:30,739
- Technically, Jerry's really broke.
- You think this had something to do

964
00:59:30,947 --> 00:59:32,073
with what happened to Mom?

965
00:59:32,282 --> 00:59:34,648
No, I'm saying that it's something
that we should look into.

966
00:59:35,185 --> 00:59:39,178
I need y'all to go down and visit
this city official named Douglas.

967
00:59:39,389 --> 00:59:41,186
He'll know who Jerry
got mixed up with.

968
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:43,158
I'm gonna go check
on some other shit.

969
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,384
What are you talking about?

970
00:59:44,594 --> 00:59:46,562
Why don't you just tell me
what you know, Angel?

971
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:49,596
I know you need to stay your ass
on that porcelain.

972
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:52,290
This is gonna require a little finesse.

973
00:59:52,502 --> 00:59:54,402
And given your prior reputation
as a hothead,

974
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:57,402
- I wrote the fucking book on finesse.
- You gonna be the first to fuck up.

975
00:59:57,607 --> 01:00:00,599
Wait for me to wipe my ass, Angel.
I'm coming with you.

976
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,368
Angel!

977
01:00:03,246 --> 01:00:05,271
Get me some
fucking toilet paper, Jack.

978
01:00:05,715 --> 01:00:06,704
Angel!

979
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:10,616
You know, you didn't come up
on the list of any of Evelyn's friends

980
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,256
- or known associates, Mr. Bradford.
- No?

981
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:17,756
I got your name
off of her phone records.

982
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:20,720
Well...

983
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:24,492
Well, yes. Yes, we did try to keep
our relationship

984
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:27,864
- somewhat discreet.
- There we go. There we go.

985
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:30,539
You know, well,
maybe you can help me then.

986
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:35,734
You see, what I've gathered so far,
it seems that...

987
01:00:35,946 --> 01:00:39,677
...Evelyn had become upset with
her son Jeremiah's business situation.

988
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:42,351
Yes, she was starting
to raise a bit of a stink.

989
01:00:42,552 --> 01:00:47,182
But... But wasn't all that covered
in the police report that she filed?

990
01:00:48,558 --> 01:00:50,526
What police report?

991
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:54,893
Councilman Douglas.

992
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:56,292
Sorry to startle you.

993
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:58,865
My name's Bobby Mercer. I believe
you know my brother, Jeremiah?

994
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:01,902
Apparently, you were the one
who got his business shut down, right?

995
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,936
This is not the proper venue
for an appeal.

996
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,165
Look, we're not really concerned
with that, councilman.

997
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:08,241
I heard my brother got mixed
up with some hoodlums.

998
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:10,538
You know what I'm talking about?

999
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:14,183
I can't help you. Excuse me.

1000
01:01:34,738 --> 01:01:36,535
Gas?

1001
01:01:38,308 --> 01:01:39,639
Councilman!

1002
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:44,344
Now I gotta light your ass on fire!
All I wanted was a name!

1003
01:01:44,848 --> 01:01:48,875
You're gonna make me turn your ass
into the black gingerbread man now!

1004
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:50,245
It's all right.

1005
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,512
I'll have my little brother
here suck your burning dick.

1006
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:55,919
Give me the fucking cigarette.
Roll down the window.

1007
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,054
Victor. Victor Sweet.

1008
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:01,860
What about him?

1009
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:07,893
Is there a problem?

1010
01:02:19,282 --> 01:02:21,842
Goddamn, Jerry.

1011
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,481
There she is.

1012
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:28,720
So she got in there at 6:05.

1013
01:02:29,192 --> 01:02:31,285
Fast-forward that.

1014
01:02:33,096 --> 01:02:34,825
Hey, look. That's Fowler.

1015
01:02:35,532 --> 01:02:39,992
Wait, pause it, pause it. He didn't say
anything to me about talking to her.

1016
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,867
Fast-forward to when she leaves.

1017
01:02:44,474 --> 01:02:46,237
Okay, stop.

1018
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:50,744
So she was here until 7:11.

1019
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:01,015
He spent more than an hour
with her.

1020
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:04,618
- What do you think he found?
- I don't know, but it's something big.

1021
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:06,819
- How can you tell?
- By the sound of his voice.

1022
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,657
I know my brother.

1023
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:13,998
What's going on, Angel?

1024
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:19,000
- Was that councilman helpful?
- Oh, yeah. A real public servant.

1025
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,272
You remember a punk
named Victor Sweet?

1026
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,045
- I remember a Malcolm Sweet.
- Victor was his nephew.

1027
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,481
Used to deliver things for his uncle.
Like firebombs and beatings.

1028
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:34,350
You remember. Malcolm used
to love to humiliate him all the time.

1029
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:36,081
Yeah, I remember that dude.

1030
01:03:36,292 --> 01:03:38,055
Apparently, Victor got sick
of the ass-whuppings

1031
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:39,888
and sunk his uncle into the river.

1032
01:03:40,096 --> 01:03:41,927
He owns
the whole neighborhood now.

1033
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:43,963
No shit?

1034
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:46,768
Hey, Bobby.

1035
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:52,272
Word around town is that Jerry
owed a lot of people some money.

1036
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:54,466
What are you talking about?

1037
01:03:56,379 --> 01:03:59,473
Recognize that dude over
there with the fat head?

1038
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:03,448
Yeah, that's Evander Pearson.
He used to be all right, that guy.

1039
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:05,450
Jerry and him used to hang
during the union days.

1040
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:08,818
He goes by Evan now. And he's
working for a guy named Victor.

1041
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,994
You guys are coming
up with this pretty quick.

1042
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:15,460
Yeah, we should have been cops.

1043
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:20,331
What are we doing here, Angel?

1044
01:04:20,537 --> 01:04:22,437
Holy shit.

1045
01:04:34,317 --> 01:04:36,285
- Evan.
- Jerry.

1046
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:38,477
I hate meeting you here, man,
with your kids and all,

1047
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:39,882
but you know how it goes.

1048
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:42,216
- I understand.
- I got it.

1049
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:47,954
I found out Jerry got a big
insurance check for Mom's death.

1050
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:50,225
Be cool, brother.

1051
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:54,602
Forget Jerry. We're gonna
find him later. Come on.

1052
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:05,139
- Yo, Evander! What's up?
- Muriel! We leaving.

1053
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:07,714
- Game's over. Let's go.
- Put your jacket on. It's time to go.

1054
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:12,180
It's nice to see you, boys,
but we was just leaving.

1055
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:14,879
You ain't going nowhere.
What was you talking to Jerry about?

1056
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:16,490
Nothing. Just saying hello.

1057
01:05:16,693 --> 01:05:19,526
Me and Jerry go way back from
the union days. You know that, Bobby.

1058
01:05:19,996 --> 01:05:21,964
Angel tells me you're
one of Victor Sweet's boys now.

1059
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:24,827
Hear he's running shit like his uncle.
Treating you like a house nigger.

1060
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:27,730
What are you thinking about, Evan?
The dude's a punk.

1061
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:32,033
You been gone a long time, fellas.
Times change.

1062
01:05:32,508 --> 01:05:34,703
- What's in that envelope?
- What envelope?

1063
01:05:34,911 --> 01:05:36,879
You wanna play that fucking game
with me right now?

1064
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:41,707
- Y'all gonna do this here?
- Right here. Right now.

1065
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:45,547
Give me the envelope
and take a walk. Now!

1066
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:51,721
Go ahead, Evander.
Take the kids home.

1067
01:05:51,928 --> 01:05:53,953
We'll see your ass again real soon.

1068
01:05:54,163 --> 01:05:55,960
Let's go.

1069
01:05:56,466 --> 01:05:57,524
Hurry up.

1070
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:01,899
Councilman.

1071
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:04,130
Pull up a chair.

1072
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,242
Vic, this cop came
to see me today,

1073
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:16,077
and he was asking
about that woman.

1074
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:19,514
Don't worry about cops.

1075
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:21,883
- I got cops.
- No, I'm not.

1076
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:24,821
But I'm worried about this guy
Bobby Mercer.

1077
01:06:25,028 --> 01:06:26,723
He came to see me
after the cop did.

1078
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:29,290
You tell him my name?

1079
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:32,024
Of course not, Vic. I mean...

1080
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:35,261
But look, you know, we can't
do business like this anymore.

1081
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:36,998
Nothing's changing.

1082
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:39,800
Evan and I were just talking
about this fella, Bobby Mercer.

1083
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:51,886
- Vic, I did not tell the man anything.
- Did you tell him my name?

1084
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:55,216
- No, I swear...
- Yes, you did! You stinking coward.

1085
01:06:55,425 --> 01:06:57,620
I smelled it on you
the second you walked in here.

1086
01:06:57,827 --> 01:07:00,318
Now go sit at the other table.

1087
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:06,897
- Excuse me?
- Go sit at the kiddie table!

1088
01:07:07,103 --> 01:07:11,369
I ain't finished with you. I ain't finished
my hand, so sit your ass down!

1089
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:16,776
- Are you in trouble?
- He's on a time-out.

1090
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:19,705
Come on, man, what you got?

1091
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:25,953
No. I'm out.

1092
01:07:27,657 --> 01:07:30,421
Nines. Won again.

1093
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:31,650
Oh, Charlie.

1094
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:35,228
I heard you're marrying
that fine piece of ass of yours.

1095
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:38,533
Yeah, that's right, that's right.
This spring, in fact.

1096
01:07:38,735 --> 01:07:40,862
How about I send you
on a little out-of-town work, huh?

1097
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:43,004
Give me a little
one-on-one time alone

1098
01:07:43,206 --> 01:07:46,073
with that cute little Italian thing
of yours, huh?

1099
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:48,076
How would that be?

1100
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:50,507
I'll teach her some nice tricks
for you.

1101
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:52,806
Yeah, maybe you can teach her
how to cook.

1102
01:07:53,015 --> 01:07:55,381
No, man, I'll teach her better things
than that.

1103
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:57,576
She's too much woman
for you, Charlie.

1104
01:07:57,787 --> 01:08:00,517
You're gonna have
to share her around a bit.

1105
01:08:03,726 --> 01:08:07,287
- Nine! My turn!
- You're the one that...

1106
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:08,823
All right, you kids.

1107
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:13,292
- Who wants some ice cream, huh?
- Me!

1108
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:17,963
Why don't you run upstairs. We'll get
you some ice cream. Go on now.

1109
01:08:32,088 --> 01:08:33,749
Evan.

1110
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:35,982
Pistol.

1111
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:39,292
I ain't playing no more.

1112
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:42,396
I'm gonna go in there and bust that
melon and find out what he's thinking.

1113
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:44,130
His family's in there.

1114
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,931
- You're gonna have to calm down.
- I don't give a shit, man.

1115
01:08:47,136 --> 01:08:48,763
Oh, I'm calm.

1116
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:50,836
- I'm calm.
- Let me just call him.

1117
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,507
He thinks I'm an idiot.

1118
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:55,768
He thinks I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

1119
01:08:56,646 --> 01:08:57,806
- Jerry.
- Yeah?

1120
01:08:58,014 --> 01:08:59,777
- It's Angel.
- What's up, man?

1121
01:08:59,982 --> 01:09:03,418
Look, man. We need to meet up first
thing tomorrow at Mom's house.

1122
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:05,109
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Calm down, Bobby.

1123
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:07,346
We still family, right?

1124
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:10,651
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah, man.

1125
01:09:11,294 --> 01:09:12,556
Okay.

1126
01:09:12,762 --> 01:09:15,390
- Is he coming?
- Yeah.

1127
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:16,587
Good.

1128
01:09:45,261 --> 01:09:47,786
- What?
- You know what you did.

1129
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:50,591
No! You don't know
who you fucking with!

1130
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,461
Where's Bobby?

1131
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:56,264
- What are you hiding, Jerry? What?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1132
01:09:56,472 --> 01:09:58,337
If you had something to do
with what happened,

1133
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:00,873
I swear to God, Jerry,
I'm gonna kill you right here and now!

1134
01:10:01,077 --> 01:10:02,977
- No, Bobby, no!
- Angel's gonna ask some questions.

1135
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,613
And, brother, I shit you not,
the time for lying is over.

1136
01:10:05,815 --> 01:10:07,339
We know you're lying
about your business.

1137
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,415
And we know you got mixed up
with some gangsters.

1138
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:11,348
- Hold on...
- Stay down!

1139
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:15,684
Y'all think I had something to do
with Mom getting killed?

1140
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:19,225
You got a check for 400,000 that you
just so happened to forget to mention

1141
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:22,295
- from Mom's life insurance.
- She took out the policy for the girls.

1142
01:10:22,498 --> 01:10:24,591
Man, I ain't have nothing
to do with that. Come on.

1143
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,064
- You made the payments!
- Good timing, Jerry.

1144
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:28,862
Just when it seems like
all is lost for you,

1145
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:31,631
Mom gets shot by some gangsters
and now you hit the fucking lottery!

1146
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:35,072
So y'all...? Y'all tripping
because I made insurance payments?

1147
01:10:35,278 --> 01:10:37,803
What? I paid all her bills!

1148
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:42,177
Where the fuck were y'all?

1149
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,087
How many years did I have
to take care of her my goddamn self?

1150
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:49,986
Y'all were around doing nothing!
Bullshitting!

1151
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:52,727
And you gonna tell me I killed her?
Come on, man!

1152
01:10:52,929 --> 01:10:54,863
So why would you pay off
a killer like Sweet?

1153
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,055
And what the fuck
did he do for you, Jerry?

1154
01:10:57,266 --> 01:10:59,757
What did he do for me?
He killed my fucking life!

1155
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:01,493
I put everything in that project!

1156
01:11:01,704 --> 01:11:03,899
I bet it all trying to make
something of myself!

1157
01:11:04,106 --> 01:11:05,232
Trying to make the shit work!

1158
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,375
Then Vic's goons gonna
come try to take a piece.

1159
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:09,340
You paid him, Jerry.
You got in bed with him.

1160
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:12,105
No, no, I didn't pay them! That's
how they fucking shut me down!

1161
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:13,543
I thought the city cut you off.

1162
01:11:13,749 --> 01:11:15,614
Douglas? Come on, man.
This is Detroit!

1163
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:18,685
Sweet owns Douglas! He ain't nothing
but a gangster in a suit!

1164
01:11:18,888 --> 01:11:20,719
I don't pay him,
and now he shuts my loans off!

1165
01:11:20,923 --> 01:11:23,551
- End of story, end of project.
- So, what about the 20 grand?

1166
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:26,887
I just told you. You wanna cross
the bridge, you gotta pay the toll.

1167
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:29,332
I took the money. I was gonna pay
the bribe until y'all fucked it up.

1168
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:29,821
I took the money. I was gonna pay
the bribe until y'all fucked it up.

1169
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:31,192
Your mother was a whore!

1170
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:34,368
Hey, fuck you, man! I will kick your...

1171
01:11:37,206 --> 01:11:38,468
It's all about Jerry, right?

1172
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:40,437
Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!

1173
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:42,810
Jack. Jack!

1174
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:50,283
Jack!

1175
01:11:59,328 --> 01:12:01,091
Shit.

1176
01:12:05,201 --> 01:12:08,329
Shit! Get down!
Get the fuck down!

1177
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,596
- Come on! Get down!
- Jack! Bobby!

1178
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:17,277
Shit!

1179
01:12:22,218 --> 01:12:23,685
- Bobby!
- Jack.

1180
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,683
- Bobby!
- Jack!

1181
01:12:28,624 --> 01:12:30,285
Sofi, give me the gun!

1182
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,275
- Bobby!
- Jack, hold on!

1183
01:13:06,128 --> 01:13:07,720
Shit!

1184
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:13,231
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1185
01:13:15,905 --> 01:13:17,463
He's behind the bricks!
Jackhammer!

1186
01:13:25,181 --> 01:13:27,081
Jeremiah, where are you going?

1187
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,315
Jack!

1188
01:13:34,557 --> 01:13:36,684
I got kids! A wife.

1189
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:40,027
A family.

1190
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:20,365
Oh, shit.

1191
01:14:21,704 --> 01:14:23,296
Fuck.

1192
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:35,450
Motherfucker!

1193
01:14:44,093 --> 01:14:45,458
You fucking...

1194
01:15:00,109 --> 01:15:01,508
Bobby!

1195
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:04,243
Bobby! Bobby!

1196
01:15:04,446 --> 01:15:05,811
The van! Watch out!

1197
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:14,589
Jack! Jack, look at me!

1198
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,553
Jack, you all right? Hold on.

1199
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:19,023
We need an ambulance!

1200
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:22,595
Somebody help! Call 911!

1201
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:25,464
Jack. Jack.

1202
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:26,965
Jack!

1203
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:28,796
Jack, please.

1204
01:15:29,004 --> 01:15:30,631
- Come on, man.
- I'm calling, I'm calling.

1205
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,570
- Come on, Jack, you gotta breathe!
- We need an ambulance right now!

1206
01:15:33,776 --> 01:15:37,268
Don't you die on me, you little fairy.
Come on, Jack. Please!

1207
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:39,811
You gotta fucking breathe!
Come on!

1208
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,478
Jack!

1209
01:15:46,689 --> 01:15:48,054
Jack.

1210
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:52,216
Jack, come on, Jack, please!

1211
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:54,185
Please...

1212
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,059
Jack.

1213
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:21,449
- Who sent you? Victor Sweet?
- Yeah. Yeah, it was Sweet.

1214
01:16:22,258 --> 01:16:23,919
Thank God.

1215
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:26,151
Thank God?

1216
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:29,120
He killed my mother and my little
brother, you motherfucker!

1217
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:31,561
Thank Victor Sweet.

1218
01:16:33,702 --> 01:16:36,102
Photograph them.

1219
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:41,505
Hey, let me talk to them, okay?

1220
01:16:44,213 --> 01:16:46,113
Look, I'm real sorry, man.

1221
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:48,112
I really am.

1222
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:50,342
But what happened here?

1223
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:52,520
Victor Sweet did this.

1224
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:53,779
How do you figure that?

1225
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,786
Because his friend in the bag
over there told me.

1226
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:58,516
Okay, I'll make sure I get
a statement from him then.

1227
01:16:58,727 --> 01:17:01,195
Why did Sweet do us like this, man?

1228
01:17:01,397 --> 01:17:04,025
And why did it have
to be our moms?

1229
01:17:05,301 --> 01:17:08,134
Because Evelyn was going after him.

1230
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:10,495
She knew her son, man.

1231
01:17:10,706 --> 01:17:13,470
She never thought for a second
that you were corrupt.

1232
01:17:13,676 --> 01:17:15,701
But I never told her
about my business.

1233
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:18,471
Jerry, were you ever able
to keep a secret from her?

1234
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:21,241
She knew all about
your trouble, man.

1235
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:23,350
The moment they shut you down,
she went down there,

1236
01:17:23,552 --> 01:17:27,545
- raising hell with the councilman.
- You gonna bury Sweet, or are we?

1237
01:17:29,758 --> 01:17:32,056
Well, I got me...

1238
01:17:33,395 --> 01:17:35,522
...a dirty uniform I gotta deal with first.
- What?

1239
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:39,258
You see, Evelyn filed a report that
got passed on to Victor Sweet.

1240
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:41,231
- By who?
- Look, I just got something l...

1241
01:17:41,437 --> 01:17:44,565
Don't bullshit me, Green.
Who are you protecting?

1242
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:48,174
- Your boy Fowler?
- Look, Fowler's my problem!

1243
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:52,279
I'll deal with him.
And then we get Sweet.

1244
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,379
Green.

1245
01:17:57,019 --> 01:17:58,919
So how we gonna deal
with all this?

1246
01:18:00,155 --> 01:18:01,349
Self-defense.

1247
01:18:02,191 --> 01:18:04,022
Wasn't it?

1248
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:09,062
Hey.

1249
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,757
What's happening, partner?

1250
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,594
What's cooking, boss?

1251
01:18:15,671 --> 01:18:18,606
Isn't this one
of Victor Sweet's spots?

1252
01:18:19,842 --> 01:18:21,810
Yeah, I heard that.

1253
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:24,546
So what?

1254
01:18:26,281 --> 01:18:29,444
So why ain't you tell me
that you had talked to Evelyn Mercer

1255
01:18:29,651 --> 01:18:31,915
a week before she got killed?

1256
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:35,181
I mean, don't you think that that's
relevant to a murder investigation?

1257
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:37,683
I didn't tell you

1258
01:18:37,893 --> 01:18:40,657
because it wasn't relevant at all.

1259
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,155
- Really?
- Yeah, I talked to the old lady...

1260
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,164
...for all of about five minutes.

1261
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:48,233
She came in with her usual medley.

1262
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:50,701
Kids tagging up her block,
that kind of shit.

1263
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:58,573
You know, I figured
it was something like that.

1264
01:18:58,781 --> 01:19:00,908
But you still should have
said something to me, man.

1265
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:02,879
Sorry.

1266
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:05,580
Did she file a police report?

1267
01:19:05,788 --> 01:19:08,621
No. I sent it over
to the Parks Department.

1268
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:11,190
They clean that shit up.

1269
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:14,587
- Five minutes, huh?
- Yeah.

1270
01:19:14,797 --> 01:19:17,265
Couldn't have been
much more than that.

1271
01:19:20,469 --> 01:19:22,733
You wanna take a shot?
You're gonna need some practice.

1272
01:19:23,672 --> 01:19:25,640
I'd love to.

1273
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:36,447
It's been a long time
since I played a game like this one.

1274
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:39,553
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

1275
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:49,122
Partner, I think your stick is crooked.

1276
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:51,592
I think it's all right.

1277
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:55,293
And the weight is off.

1278
01:19:55,871 --> 01:19:57,600
Worked pretty good for me.

1279
01:19:59,308 --> 01:20:00,969
You sure?

1280
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,402
Yeah.

1281
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:11,277
You is a dirty cop!

1282
01:20:11,487 --> 01:20:12,784
Give me your badge.

1283
01:20:12,988 --> 01:20:15,320
See, I hate dirty cops.

1284
01:20:17,493 --> 01:20:19,256
Green, wait.

1285
01:20:23,332 --> 01:20:25,425
Green, wait!
There is something I forgot.

1286
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:27,431
What? What the fuck
you wanna say to me?

1287
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:33,841
I forgot they installed those
surveillance cameras in the station.

1288
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:36,203
Motherfucker!

1289
01:21:00,536 --> 01:21:03,471
Officer down! Officer down!
Green's been shot!

1290
01:21:03,672 --> 01:21:07,403
I'm in the alleyway behind
John R and Seven Mile!

1291
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:11,238
Suspects are two young black males
heading east on foot!

1292
01:21:11,446 --> 01:21:14,108
Request backup immediately!

1293
01:21:16,885 --> 01:21:19,649
Ready! Aim! Fire!

1294
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:24,957
Ready! Aim! Fire!

1295
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,027
Ready! Aim! Fire!

1296
01:21:35,037 --> 01:21:36,766
Jackie.

1297
01:21:50,586 --> 01:21:52,986
Never should have came home.

1298
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,519
Never should have came.

1299
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:10,570
I miss him too.

1300
01:22:11,406 --> 01:22:12,771
We won't be able to bring him back,

1301
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:14,875
but we're gonna send him
some company.

1302
01:22:15,077 --> 01:22:19,138
You can't go to war with Victor Sweet.
Not straight up.

1303
01:22:19,448 --> 01:22:23,111
He'll just hire more and more
goons until we are all dead.

1304
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:25,813
I don't know.

1305
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:28,546
I don't know what to do anymore.

1306
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:31,890
I already lost one brother.
You guys are all I got.

1307
01:22:36,898 --> 01:22:38,866
- I got an idea.
- What?

1308
01:22:40,002 --> 01:22:42,493
We'll take the rest of the money
from Mom's insurance,

1309
01:22:42,704 --> 01:22:44,865
pay Sweet to call off the dogs.

1310
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:48,099
- He'll deal. He's a businessman.
- It doesn't count as a plan

1311
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:50,574
if it takes you longer to say it
than it does to think it up.

1312
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:52,906
Yeah, Jerry.
Sweet will meet up with you,

1313
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:54,639
take your money.

1314
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,182
Won't be able to find your body
till the river thaws.

1315
01:22:57,719 --> 01:22:59,846
If you can get that far.

1316
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:14,468
Jesus, Jeremiah,
what you doing here?

1317
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:16,365
I'm here to do a little
collective bargaining.

1318
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:18,801
What, with Sweet?
Did you not get the message?

1319
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:23,304
He wants blood.

1320
01:23:23,512 --> 01:23:25,480
- That's not negotiable.
- Look, they told us

1321
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:29,208
we'd never get $30 an hour on the job
either, right? But what we get?

1322
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:31,511
So don't tell me this is not possible.
Come on, man.

1323
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,449
So, what you bringing to the table?

1324
01:23:35,957 --> 01:23:37,652
Four hundred thousand dollars.

1325
01:23:43,165 --> 01:23:44,757
Yo.

1326
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:48,092
- Evan called Sweet. He's going for it.
- So when's the meet?

1327
01:23:48,303 --> 01:23:49,668
- Four o'clock.
- Today?

1328
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:51,133
- Yeah.
- That's in three hours.

1329
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,069
Well, we ain't got no choice!

1330
01:23:53,275 --> 01:23:55,835
Sweet's supposed to roll up on us
any minute now.

1331
01:23:56,044 --> 01:23:58,103
What? What else?

1332
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:02,475
Well, Evan, we cool.
And he let me in on a little something.

1333
01:24:02,684 --> 01:24:04,709
If Fowler's there, he don't
think he's gonna go for it.

1334
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,378
- So there's no plan!
- Yes, there is, Bobby.

1335
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:10,455
We need to take Fowler out
before the meet.

1336
01:24:10,659 --> 01:24:12,718
We can't kill a cop
even if he is dirty.

1337
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,489
He handed Ma to Sweet, okay?
He ain't walking away from this.

1338
01:24:29,077 --> 01:24:31,875
Make sure the hole's cut
when we get there.

1339
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,480
Hey, come here.

1340
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:38,052
- All right. I love you.
- Now, don't get shot.

1341
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:39,584
- Don't shoot anyone either.
- Relax.

1342
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:41,483
Unless you have to.

1343
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:45,016
Come on, now.
You know I love you, don't you?

1344
01:24:48,497 --> 01:24:51,830
Y'all be good now.
And take care of Mommy, all right?

1345
01:24:57,739 --> 01:24:59,639
Be careful.

1346
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:01,939
I will.

1347
01:25:02,811 --> 01:25:04,574
Bobby.

1348
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:11,916
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

1349
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,988
but don't you let him get hurt.
You bring him back to me.

1350
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:17,756
I will, Camille.

1351
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:20,224
It's gonna be okay.

1352
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:32,704
Hey, kid!

1353
01:25:33,074 --> 01:25:35,372
What you doing,
playing out here in the snow?

1354
01:25:35,577 --> 01:25:38,774
I'm just working on my swing
for the spring.

1355
01:25:39,214 --> 01:25:41,614
Hey, man, I need a big favor.

1356
01:25:41,817 --> 01:25:45,844
I'll give you $20
and this whole box of Baby Ruths.

1357
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,986
You see that house over there?

1358
01:26:04,339 --> 01:26:06,364
Not till we hear from Angel.

1359
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:26,054
- What do you want?
- I'm selling candy to raise money

1360
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:29,992
for my baseball team. We wanna
buy new uniforms and equip...

1361
01:26:30,198 --> 01:26:30,632
Thanks. Now get the hell out of here.

1362
01:26:30,632 --> 01:26:32,361
Thanks. Now get the hell out of here.

1363
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:38,562
This is a big problem.
A big problem for you.

1364
01:26:40,542 --> 01:26:42,772
Even a completely calm person
will suffocate

1365
01:26:42,978 --> 01:26:45,208
in four minutes without oxygen.

1366
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:47,779
And you're not exactly calm,
are you?

1367
01:26:47,983 --> 01:26:50,850
- Jerry!
- Fuck!

1368
01:26:51,052 --> 01:26:52,485
We ain't going nowhere
without the call,

1369
01:26:52,687 --> 01:26:54,279
- so just calm down.
- What the fuck you...?

1370
01:26:55,123 --> 01:26:57,921
- Jerry!
- Just keep stalling him.

1371
01:26:58,126 --> 01:27:00,754
Hold... I'm grabbing my scarf, man.
I'll be there in a minute! Hold on.

1372
01:27:00,962 --> 01:27:02,691
- Angel?
- Hey, I got him.

1373
01:27:02,898 --> 01:27:04,866
- Is he out of the way?
- What, you wanna ask him?

1374
01:27:05,066 --> 01:27:07,762
- Let me hear his voice.
- Hold on, let me put him on. Hold on.

1375
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:10,335
Hey, man, say hi to my brother.

1376
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,664
- We got you now, bitch.
- I'm coming.

1377
01:27:12,874 --> 01:27:14,501
Go.

1378
01:27:16,711 --> 01:27:19,202
Jerry, what the hell? You in there?

1379
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:27,914
- That's our money?
- Yeah.

1380
01:27:31,726 --> 01:27:32,852
- Hey, man, hey!
- Relax, relax.

1381
01:27:33,061 --> 01:27:35,996
- Hey, what is this, man? What is this?
- Relax, relax. Just relax.

1382
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:40,031
We just gotta check it out, make
sure you ain't strapped. Relax, relax.

1383
01:27:40,235 --> 01:27:42,032
- He's good.
- Okay.

1384
01:27:42,237 --> 01:27:44,398
Let's take a ride, Jerry.

1385
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,275
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Well, he's onboard, boss.

1386
01:27:55,884 --> 01:27:57,749
Yeah, all right.

1387
01:27:59,287 --> 01:28:00,549
What did he say?

1388
01:28:00,755 --> 01:28:04,816
He say, "Hurry the fuck up."
Then he hung up.

1389
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:11,090
You'll never get the belt. Trust me.

1390
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:18,067
People never think to go for the bag.

1391
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:20,264
It's always the belt first
for some reason.

1392
01:28:20,475 --> 01:28:23,808
The bag has to be clear, though.
Black doesn't work.

1393
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:28,479
Get up.

1394
01:28:29,117 --> 01:28:30,141
Get over there right now.

1395
01:28:30,352 --> 01:28:33,788
- He's gonna end up dead.
- Ma'am, ma'am, slow it down a gear.

1396
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:37,152
And this isn't even his fight.
It's his stupid brother's fault!

1397
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:39,020
I understand. I can help you.

1398
01:28:39,227 --> 01:28:41,787
But you're gonna have to let
me know who it is we're talking about

1399
01:28:41,997 --> 01:28:44,557
- and what's about to happen.
- My boyfriend.

1400
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:48,734
He was talking about killing a cop.

1401
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:24,161
You hear that?
You know what that is?

1402
01:29:24,372 --> 01:29:26,932
That's a damn beautiful sound.

1403
01:29:27,142 --> 01:29:29,110
Those are my boys coming.

1404
01:29:58,073 --> 01:30:00,337
So, what do we do now?

1405
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:03,040
We get out.

1406
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:11,283
Jesus Christ! What is that?
Wha...? What's that?

1407
01:30:11,486 --> 01:30:15,513
It's ice fishing.
Tommy there is part Eskimo.

1408
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:30,629
No.

1409
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:35,433
It's not looking good
for you, homeboy.

1410
01:30:35,844 --> 01:30:37,903
We'll see if they're still your boys
after they find out

1411
01:30:38,113 --> 01:30:41,207
you killed your partner Green,
homeboy.

1412
01:30:41,683 --> 01:30:43,207
That's your angle, huh?

1413
01:30:43,418 --> 01:30:46,683
You gonna walk out there
and tell them I killed Green.

1414
01:30:48,289 --> 01:30:49,881
That's your story?

1415
01:30:50,091 --> 01:30:52,559
- It has the advantage of being true.
- So what?

1416
01:30:53,528 --> 01:30:55,758
I killed my partner.

1417
01:30:56,965 --> 01:30:59,229
I could kill the whole
damn police department

1418
01:30:59,434 --> 01:31:00,867
if you were the only witness.

1419
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:03,528
They'd probably just
promote me to chief.

1420
01:31:03,738 --> 01:31:07,731
You're one of
the Mercer brothers, brother.

1421
01:31:07,942 --> 01:31:11,105
No cop in the world's gonna
believe your word over mine. Sorry.

1422
01:31:11,312 --> 01:31:13,746
You know what?
You're probably right.

1423
01:31:13,948 --> 01:31:16,746
Other than the ones
I got outside right now in the van

1424
01:31:16,951 --> 01:31:19,920
listening to every bit
of our conversation...

1425
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:22,285
...brother.

1426
01:31:23,324 --> 01:31:24,416
You're lying.

1427
01:31:25,827 --> 01:31:27,226
Afraid not.

1428
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:31,931
Take a look.

1429
01:31:32,567 --> 01:31:34,057
I want eyes on the house!

1430
01:31:34,269 --> 01:31:37,102
Okay, lieutenant, I'm bringing
him out now.

1431
01:31:37,305 --> 01:31:39,933
Come on, man. It's all over.

1432
01:31:45,747 --> 01:31:48,079
I'm gonna pop your head
like a champagne cork.

1433
01:31:48,283 --> 01:31:50,774
You hear me?
I'm taking your clown down with me!

1434
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:25,617
Fool showed up.

1435
01:32:26,054 --> 01:32:29,353
And they say there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

1436
01:32:34,095 --> 01:32:35,426
All right.

1437
01:32:35,630 --> 01:32:38,599
Let's sink this dumb-ass
and get out of here.

1438
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,826
I got a candlelit date lined up with
a hot piece of Puerto Rican pussy.

1439
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:55,340
Jeremiah Mercer. Businessman.

1440
01:32:56,651 --> 01:32:58,744
Give me that.

1441
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:13,662
Goddamn it, I like the way
you do business!

1442
01:33:14,836 --> 01:33:16,736
You're a reasonable man.

1443
01:33:16,938 --> 01:33:18,929
You should have let me in
on your project.

1444
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:21,108
We could have been partners.

1445
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:24,767
Could have been a sweet deal
for both of us.

1446
01:33:24,979 --> 01:33:27,106
Now it just a sweet deal for me.

1447
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:29,909
Come on, man.
We gonna do business, or what?

1448
01:33:31,953 --> 01:33:33,614
Right.

1449
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:38,724
Right. Right.

1450
01:33:38,927 --> 01:33:39,951
Down to business.

1451
01:33:40,528 --> 01:33:42,359
What were the...?

1452
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:44,190
What were the terms again?

1453
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,090
You give me 400 grand,

1454
01:33:47,602 --> 01:33:51,436
and I pardon you and your brothers,
is that right? Forgive and forget, right?

1455
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:52,697
That's right.

1456
01:33:53,241 --> 01:33:55,573
My brothers said I was naive.
That you would shoot me

1457
01:33:55,777 --> 01:33:58,143
and just take the money. Yeah.

1458
01:33:59,948 --> 01:34:02,416
- Damn, man, you hurt my feelings.
- Good.

1459
01:34:03,418 --> 01:34:05,909
Because you don't know shit
about hurt feelings.

1460
01:34:08,556 --> 01:34:11,116
I just buried my mama
and my brother.

1461
01:34:11,326 --> 01:34:13,556
And I think that's
payment enough, Vic.

1462
01:34:14,929 --> 01:34:17,329
You been doing a lot
of thinking, boy.

1463
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:20,657
Yeah, my mama raised me
to be a thinking man.

1464
01:34:20,868 --> 01:34:23,132
So me and my brothers, we came up
with a whole new proposal.

1465
01:34:23,871 --> 01:34:27,671
- A whole new proposal. Is that right?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1466
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:31,140
You gonna like it too. Because it is a...
A sweet deal.

1467
01:34:31,879 --> 01:34:35,110
Check it out. Instead of giving you
the 400 grand, we decided

1468
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:38,149
we'd give it to these mistreated
workers you got standing behind you.

1469
01:34:39,821 --> 01:34:40,947
Pistol.

1470
01:34:41,923 --> 01:34:44,687
- Evan, I said pistol!
- No, bitch.

1471
01:34:44,892 --> 01:34:47,861
The one thing you forgot
about me is this:

1472
01:34:48,062 --> 01:34:51,054
I was in the union for a long time.

1473
01:34:51,532 --> 01:34:54,296
I ain't never missed no meetings.

1474
01:34:54,769 --> 01:34:55,963
He ain't lying.

1475
01:34:56,571 --> 01:34:58,801
It's cold out here when you
by yourself, ain't it?

1476
01:35:03,244 --> 01:35:05,303
So, what now?

1477
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:10,317
You gonna kill the hand
that's been feeding you?

1478
01:35:11,519 --> 01:35:14,886
- Over some stupid old lady?
- Watch your motherfucking mouth.

1479
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:17,385
You dumb shits!

1480
01:35:20,995 --> 01:35:25,694
I told Fowler and his pals
all about this meeting!

1481
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:30,164
You kill me, you all go down!
Murder!

1482
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,632
He's already late.

1483
01:35:33,841 --> 01:35:35,706
Shit, he's probably on his way
right now.

1484
01:35:36,778 --> 01:35:38,075
He ain't coming.

1485
01:35:40,415 --> 01:35:43,646
- Come out!
- I swear to God, I'll kill him!

1486
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:47,320
You guys set me up, huh?

1487
01:35:47,755 --> 01:35:51,316
You think you're real smart,
getting this shit on tape, huh?

1488
01:35:51,526 --> 01:35:52,788
- Fowler?
- What the hell?

1489
01:35:52,994 --> 01:35:55,394
- I thought Fowler was the hostage.
- Back off! I'm serious!

1490
01:35:55,596 --> 01:35:58,224
- Fowler, what are you doing, man?
- Drop the goddamn gun!

1491
01:35:58,433 --> 01:36:00,697
- We're here to help you!
- Back off now! I'm serious!

1492
01:36:00,902 --> 01:36:03,370
That's right.
Fowler, put down your weapon!

1493
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:04,595
Not a chance!

1494
01:36:05,706 --> 01:36:07,606
I said, back off! Now!

1495
01:36:09,977 --> 01:36:11,205
Drop your weapon!

1496
01:36:16,584 --> 01:36:18,484
He's down!

1497
01:36:19,053 --> 01:36:21,385
Man down! Man down! EMS!

1498
01:36:22,223 --> 01:36:23,713
- Call it in!
- Get on the horn!

1499
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:30,791
Come on now.
Who's gonna do it, huh?

1500
01:36:32,467 --> 01:36:34,958
Who the man here, huh?

1501
01:36:35,169 --> 01:36:37,899
Which one of you tough guys
gonna do it?

1502
01:36:38,773 --> 01:36:42,709
Who's gonna take on the champ?
You, Charlie?

1503
01:37:02,363 --> 01:37:04,160
Yeah. That's right.

1504
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:06,758
Is this who I think it is?

1505
01:37:08,369 --> 01:37:10,963
Is this what you all been waiting on?

1506
01:37:11,172 --> 01:37:12,833
- You all right, Jerry?
- Yeah, I'm straight.

1507
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,669
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, Bobby Mercer.

1508
01:37:17,411 --> 01:37:18,639
Back in town.

1509
01:37:18,846 --> 01:37:20,575
- You gonna be the one, man?
- Come on, Bobby.

1510
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:22,442
Bring it on, baby. What you got?

1511
01:37:23,184 --> 01:37:24,845
Watch his hands, Bobby.

1512
01:37:25,052 --> 01:37:26,883
You better say a prayer, man.

1513
01:37:28,222 --> 01:37:30,019
- Get him, champ.
- Come on!

1514
01:37:30,558 --> 01:37:31,991
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

1515
01:37:32,193 --> 01:37:34,457
Come on, kick his ass!

1516
01:37:34,662 --> 01:37:36,994
- Come on, that's it! Come on!
- Hit him hard! Bobby, hit him!

1517
01:37:41,903 --> 01:37:45,100
- Get your ass up! Come on!
- Get him!

1518
01:37:45,306 --> 01:37:48,503
- All right, you got him! You got him!
- Put that shit away, man. Come on.

1519
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:50,006
Yeah, come on, man!

1520
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:57,640
Take him out, boy!

1521
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:02,684
Get back. Get back.

1522
01:38:05,459 --> 01:38:07,290
That's it!

1523
01:38:10,565 --> 01:38:13,125
- Good night, man!
- That's it! All right, come on, man.

1524
01:38:13,734 --> 01:38:15,395
It's over now, Bobby.

1525
01:38:16,103 --> 01:38:18,298
- Elbow, baby, elbow!
- Turn it around, man!

1526
01:38:21,042 --> 01:38:23,567
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Get him!
Come on!

1527
01:38:26,647 --> 01:38:28,342
Fucker!

1528
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:31,450
Hey, get up, bitch! Get up!

1529
01:38:33,888 --> 01:38:35,822
- Motherfuck!
- Get your bitch ass back in there!

1530
01:38:36,023 --> 01:38:37,490
Get him back here!

1531
01:38:42,863 --> 01:38:44,091
Yeah!

1532
01:38:44,565 --> 01:38:45,725
That's what's up!

1533
01:38:58,646 --> 01:39:00,136
- Get him in the hole.
- That's right.

1534
01:39:00,348 --> 01:39:02,680
Way to go, Bobby.

1535
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:17,329
So, what we gonna do
about the police?

1536
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:18,555
Police?

1537
01:39:18,766 --> 01:39:20,791
Cops love the Mercers, Jerry.

1538
01:39:21,969 --> 01:39:24,597
- Sit him down.
- Damn! You girls are trying to kill me!

1539
01:39:24,805 --> 01:39:26,534
What are you doing, man? All right!

1540
01:39:27,575 --> 01:39:28,872
You wanna go another round, huh?

1541
01:39:29,076 --> 01:39:31,874
You arrested him,
and he didn't do anything!

1542
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:33,137
Let me ask you again.

1543
01:39:33,347 --> 01:39:35,247
What happened to Victor Sweet,
Mercer?

1544
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:37,576
His name is Jeremiah Mercer,
and I wanna see him now!

1545
01:39:37,785 --> 01:39:39,980
Ellis, you might wanna close your ears.
This is nasty shit.

1546
01:39:40,187 --> 01:39:43,748
That's what you wanna hear? I did it.
I did it, okay?

1547
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:45,585
If you did it,
then I wanna hear you say it!

1548
01:39:45,793 --> 01:39:48,728
From about 5:30 p.m. Till
about 11 or so last night,

1549
01:39:48,929 --> 01:39:52,797
I was banging that pretty little wife
of yours, okay? Here's the...

1550
01:39:55,569 --> 01:39:58,868
I was bumping uglies with your wife.

1551
01:39:59,373 --> 01:40:01,841
Your mama, she wasn't good
the first time.

1552
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:04,778
- That true? What do you got now?
- Your hair, scumbag!

1553
01:40:04,979 --> 01:40:07,277
Taken off Victor Sweet's dead body.

1554
01:40:10,117 --> 01:40:12,585
Don't push him like that!

1555
01:40:13,487 --> 01:40:14,784
Oh, baby! Oh, my God!

1556
01:40:15,389 --> 01:40:17,152
Are you okay?

1557
01:40:17,358 --> 01:40:19,417
- I'm okay, baby.
- They bought it, baby.

1558
01:40:19,627 --> 01:40:21,356
- They bought it.
- Let me see. Come here.

1559
01:40:21,562 --> 01:40:22,654
- It's all right.
- Let me see.

1560
01:40:22,863 --> 01:40:24,660
- It's just a boo-boo.
- It's not just a boo-boo!

1561
01:40:24,865 --> 01:40:26,355
Somebody put their fist in your eye!

1562
01:40:26,567 --> 01:40:28,034
- Let me see it!
- Come on, now.

1563
01:40:28,235 --> 01:40:29,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1564
01:40:29,804 --> 01:40:32,705
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding, baby.
- You know I can take a punch.

1565
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:35,205
I know you can take a punch.

1566
01:40:35,409 --> 01:40:38,776
- You don't talk about peoples mamas!
- Well, he talked about mine.

1567
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:41,641
- Did you get some licks in?
- Of course.

1568
01:40:41,849 --> 01:40:44,841
- Does his eye look like yours?
- Hey, man, where's Bobby?

1569
01:40:45,052 --> 01:40:46,883
Let me catch you on the street
without that badge.

1570
01:40:47,088 --> 01:40:48,612
I'll smack that smirk
off your face, punk!

1571
01:40:48,823 --> 01:40:52,554
I'm gonna smack you, Bobby.
I told you not to let Jerry get hurt.

1572
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,749
He's breathing.

1573
01:40:53,961 --> 01:40:56,122
- You all right, Jerry?
- I'm all right, man.

1574
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:58,628
Let me get my property.

1575
01:41:00,167 --> 01:41:03,068
- Man, you all right?
- I'm good.

1576
01:41:04,672 --> 01:41:06,230
You said something,
didn't you, Jerry?

1577
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,600
I did not say nothing, man.

1578
01:41:07,808 --> 01:41:09,298
- Why you always...?
- I did.

1579
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:12,877
- What you say?
- I told him I was banging his wife.

1580
01:41:14,682 --> 01:41:16,912
- Come on, man!
- I did too.

1581
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:19,143
Me too.

1582
01:41:20,454 --> 01:41:22,979
Okay, pass the ball, guys!
Pass the ball.

1583
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,424
Yeah, yeah. I got you, I got you.

1584
01:41:30,598 --> 01:41:32,589
Guys, right here, right here.

1585
01:41:58,225 --> 01:42:00,716
Got one window in.

1586
01:42:01,695 --> 01:42:05,529
All right. Let's keep it going,
come on.

1587
01:42:09,937 --> 01:42:12,132
Okay, okay. No more work for today.

1588
01:42:12,339 --> 01:42:15,740
That's right. Come in the house.
Wash your hands.

1589
01:42:16,644 --> 01:42:19,112
- Dang! A little to eat.
- Time to eat. I'm starving.

1590
01:42:19,313 --> 01:42:20,439
What did you cook?

1591
01:42:20,648 --> 01:42:22,548
You too, girls, come on.

1592
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,809
Come on, babies.

1593
01:42:38,532 --> 01:42:40,329
Here you go.

1594
01:42:40,534 --> 01:42:42,559
Evelyn isn't coming back, is she?

1595
01:42:43,504 --> 01:42:45,563
No, she's not coming back.

1596
01:42:45,773 --> 01:42:48,105
Because she's dead, huh?

1597
01:42:49,677 --> 01:42:52,840
Yeah. It's because she's dead.

1598
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:56,081
You guys have fun, all right?
No rough stuff.

1599
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:07,855
Always so good to have
you back home, son.

1600
01:43:08,462 --> 01:43:11,090
You gonna stick around
a little while this time?

1601
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:15,532
I'm thinking about it, Ma.
I'm thinking about it.

1602
01:43:17,838 --> 01:43:20,398
Oh, Bobby.

1603
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:04,647
- Mercer!
- Yeah, Bobby!

1604
01:44:06,554 --> 01:44:10,183
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1605
01:44:10,391 --> 01:44:12,018
Yeah!

1606
01:44:15,195 --> 01:44:17,823
Come on, now. Come on.
Did you have to push?

1607
01:44:18,032 --> 01:44:19,829
Hold up! Hold up!

1608
01:44:20,034 --> 01:44:22,969
If we don't work, nobody work!
Get back!

1609
01:44:33,647 --> 01:44:36,946
I'm sorry, Mr. Wong, your credit card
has been reported stolen.

1610
01:44:37,151 --> 01:44:39,847
Stolen? Madam, you know what,
them my uncles right there.

1611
01:44:40,054 --> 01:44:44,753
- Tyrone Wong, help me out real quick.
- Mr. Wong! Mr. Wong! Mr. Wong!

1612
01:45:03,577 --> 01:45:06,740
You keep sayin'
The world is gonna end

1613
01:45:06,914 --> 01:45:10,611
You keep sayin'
The world is gonna end
