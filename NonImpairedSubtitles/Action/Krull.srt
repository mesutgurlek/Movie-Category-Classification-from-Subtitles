1
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,359
<i>This, it was given me to know:</i>

2
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,558
<i>that many worlds have been enslaved</i>
<i>by the Beast and his army, the Slayers.</i>

3
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,309
<i>And this, too, was given me to know:</i>

4
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,272
<i>that the Beast would come to our world,</i>
<i>the world of Krull...</i>

5
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,990
<i>...and his Black Fortress would be seen</i>
<i>in the land...</i>

6
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,793
<i>...that the smoke of burning villages</i>
<i>would darken the sky...</i>

7
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,477
<i>...and the cries of the dying echo</i>
<i>through deserted valleys.</i>

8
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,794
<i>But one thing l cannot know:</i>

9
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,349
<i>whether the prophecy be true...</i>

10
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,390
<i>...that a girl of ancient name</i>
<i>shall become queen...</i>

11
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,398
<i>...that she shall choose a king, and that</i>
<i>together they shall rule our world...</i>

12
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,232
<i>...and that their son shall rule the galaxy.</i>

13
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,749
Father!

14
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,990
Colwyn should have been here by now.

15
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,749
<i>He may be forced to travel</i>
<i>through the forests and the stone country.</i>

16
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,798
<i>All the passes and the roads</i>
<i>are held by the Slayers.</i>

17
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,998
<i>Colwyn may not get through.</i>

18
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,879
<i>That would please you?</i>

19
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,359
<i>l sent men to help.</i>

20
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,316
<i>But l see no reason for an alliance</i>
<i>with our ancient enemies.</i>

21
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,474
<i>Father, the invaders</i>
<i>are destroying our world.</i>

22
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,592
<i>We must have the alliance.</i>

23
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,752
<i>Only if we're united,</i>
<i>do we stand a chance against them.</i>

24
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,634
<i>Then, l'll make a treaty with King Turold.</i>

25
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,839
<i>lt's not necessary for you to marry his son.</i>

26
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,674
<i>lt's the only way to guarantee the alliance.</i>

27
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,791
<i>The marriage is my choice.</i>

28
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,079
lf it were anyone but Turold's son.

29
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,358
Colwyn is a great fighter.

30
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,711
Good fighters make bad husbands.

31
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,835
Perhaps.

32
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,038
Horsemen approaching!

33
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,393
Open the gate!

34
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,916
We sent to you for help. None came.

35
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,998
Twenty men were despatched to you.

36
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,116
We've lost 300 getting here.

37
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,469
l didn't choose this marriage, Turold.

38
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,233
Nor did l, Eirig.

39
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,592
l chose it! Your daughter chose it.
lt'll be done.

40
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,476
And you'll lead this army with mine
against the Slayers?

41
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,148
Whatever army l have,
l'll lead against them...

42
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,038
...until l've won or l'm dead.

43
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,478
l have chosen well.

44
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,749
So have l.

45
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,598
Your journey was hard?

46
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,994
But necessary.

47
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,077
-lt may already be too late.
-lt's not too late.

48
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,229
ls this where the ceremony will be?

49
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,119
Tonight at moonrise.

50
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,350
My father says that good fighters
make bad husbands.

51
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,116
-That depends.
-On what?

52
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,277
On whether you expect a husband
to follow you around...

53
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,311
...jump every time you clap your hands.

54
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,072
Wouldn't you jump for me?

55
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,356
No, of course not. You're a warrior.

56
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,993
From this day, my kingdom is no more.

57
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,516
Nor mine.

58
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,672
A single kingdom under our children.

59
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,149
Agreed.

60
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,433
l give fire to water.

61
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,752
lt will not return, except from the hand
of the woman l choose as my wife.

62
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,951
l take fire from water.

63
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,032
l give it only to the man
whom l choose as my husband.

64
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,636
Take the fire from my hand.

65
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,312
Call the roll, guards!

66
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,833
-Slayers!
-Arm yourselves!

67
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,878
-We'll fight together.
-No. ls there a safe way out?

68
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,349
-An underground passage.
-Come on!

69
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,479
My place is with you.

70
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,831
-Do you love me?
-Of course l love you.

71
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,909
Then go.

72
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,716
Colwyn, hurry back to me.

73
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,949
Everyone in the centre of the room,
get back!

74
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,469
Take it!

75
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,835
Here!

76
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,509
Colwyn!

77
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,669
Lyssa!

78
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,069
Colwyn!

79
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,195
Colwyn!

80
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,390
Father!

81
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,516
Lyssa!

82
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,749
She's alive.

83
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,115
Where?

84
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,469
Stay still!

85
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,035
Where?

86
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,316
For now, beyond your reach.

87
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,349
Who are you?

88
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,115
l am Ynyr.

89
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,309
The old one.

90
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,391
Well, not as old as all that.

91
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,156
You've come down
from the Granite Mountains.

92
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,117
Yes. l am needed now.

93
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,149
Father!

94
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,591
There's no time now for grief.

95
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,039
You haven't lost a father
and a bride on the same day.

96
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,720
Nor have l become king on that day.

97
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,278
l have no kingdom.

98
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,514
Your kingdom may be greater
than you know.

99
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,359
l give it to you, old man,
and welcome to it.

100
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,838
l came to find a king...

101
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,350
...and l find a boy instead.

102
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,150
Lyssa?

103
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,074
They will hold her in the Black Fortress.

104
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,638
Can you lead me to it?

105
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,479
You must have help.

106
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,432
l'll find men on the way.

107
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,036
ln the Fortress,
you will face more than the Slayers.

108
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,672
You will face the Beast,
who is their leader.

109
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,359
He can be killed.

110
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,275
Perhaps.

111
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,915
But no man has ever seen him and lived.

112
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,473
You will need more than men and swords.

113
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,038
You will need the power of the Glaive.

114
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,229
The Glaive is nothing
but an ancient symbol.

115
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,958
lt doesn't really exist.

116
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,119
lt exists, up there.

117
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,351
ln a cave on the highest peak.

118
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,477
Without the Glaive,
you will never be able to reach Lyssa.

119
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,395
l need weapons, not symbols.

120
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,554
Once, the Glaive was
a very powerful weapon.

121
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,438
lt can be so again.

122
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,829
But only in the hands of the right man.

123
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,152
For only the right man
can retrieve the Glaive.

124
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,989
Am l that man?

125
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,353
l wish l knew.

126
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,833
l cannot go with you.

127
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,512
Don't worry. lf it's there,
l'll come back with it.

128
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,750
lf you do not come back with it...

129
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,796
...you'll not come back at all.

130
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,272
<i>You have been brought here for a marriage.</i>

131
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,355
<i>l am the king you will choose.</i>

132
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,989
Do not use it until you need it.

133
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,668
-How will l know when?
-You'll know.

134
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,438
lf you lead me to the Black Fortress,
l'll use it soon enough.

135
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,238
That will not be so easy.

136
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,710
At each sunrise, the Black Fortress moves.

137
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,712
Sometimes it is in the mountains,
sometimes in the desert...

138
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,313
...sometimes in the sea.

139
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,312
Never the same place twice.

140
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,914
But you told me you knew where to find it!

141
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,433
There are kingly virtues other than bravery.

142
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,958
Courtesy is one of them.

143
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,633
l'm sorry.

144
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,871
lt's the thought of Lyssa there.

145
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,911
l, too, was young...

146
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,269
<i>:::</i>once<i>:</i>

147
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,150
l, too, loved as you do.

148
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,758
But your love will be...

149
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,433
...luckier than mine.

150
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,037
What l told you is that l knew
how to find the Fortress...

151
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,193
...and that is by seeking the vision
of the blind Emerald Seer.

152
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,918
But his place isn't known either.

153
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,197
lt is known to me.
lt is a day's journey from here. Come.

154
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,075
Help!

155
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,353
Help! l'm drowning!

156
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,354
This might have been uicksand!

157
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,914
l might have been sucked to my death
while you stood there gawking!

158
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,159
Where is this place?

159
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,035
The forest near the Granite Mountains.

160
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,551
Blast! 1,000 miles off course.

161
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,434
l was rushed.

162
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,030
There was a difference of opinion
concerning a gooseberry pie.

163
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,477
The man left it sitting on his windowsill.

164
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,910
-What did he expect?
-Perhaps he expected to eat it.

165
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,068
For that rudeness, lout,
l think l'll turn you into a bat.

166
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,029
Might teach you some manners
to hang upside down for an hour or two.

167
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,348
The Hill People lack the power to do harm.

168
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,030
We shall see about that, old man.
We'll see about that!

169
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,436
No, that's a recipe for hot fudge sauce.

170
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,156
lt'll have to be a goose.

171
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,036
Fat and ugly.

172
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,912
Very fat. Very ugly.

173
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,230
From that, you see what l could've done
to you if l were a vengeful man.

174
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,637
You may leave me now.

175
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,071
Dear, dear. Let me see now....

176
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,319
The forest is not safe.
You'd best travel with us!

177
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,552
Me, travel with you?
Do you know who l am?

178
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,870
No.

179
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,751
l am Ergo the Magnificent.
Short in stature, tall in power...

180
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,673
...narrow of purpose and wide of vision.

181
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,469
And l do not travel with peasants
and beggars. Goodbye.

182
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,799
Wait! Wait for me!

183
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,910
l've just remembered
l have urgent business in this direction.

184
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,228
What business?

185
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,593
Staying alive.

186
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,512
<i>l will allow you to go</i>
<i>wherever you please within these walls.</i>

187
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,553
<i>For this is the palace from which you</i>
<i>will rule this world and countless others.</i>

188
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,952
<i>You cannot escape me.</i>
<i>You will be my queen.</i>

189
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,472
You're no great chooser of roads, old man.

190
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,348
This way will save us half a day's travel.

191
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,435
Robbers.

192
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,994
They're men, we don't know yet
whether they're robbers.

193
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,958
Faces that ugly
could only belong to robbers.

194
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,588
Don't worry. l'll turn them all into pigs.

195
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,555
You're surrounded by 100 men!

196
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,398
100 is not enough!

197
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,277
What have we here? A fighter!

198
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,231
Besides, you're short about 90 men.

199
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,550
Let's just kill them and be done with it.

200
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,599
Soft, Rhun! l don't kill men
without good reason.

201
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,629
Nor do l. And be thankful for it.

202
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,799
You're escaped prisoners.

203
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,795
Every one. Slaves, bandits,
fighters and brawlers.

204
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,389
Desperate men.

205
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,153
-As desperate as you'll ever see.
-Good.

206
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,190
Those are the kind of men l need.

207
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,709
You need?

208
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,110
Well, see, these men
follow no man but me...

209
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,472
...and l follow no man at all.

210
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,270
-Would you follow a king?
-A king?

211
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,479
There are many lunatics wandering
through the country claiming to be kings.

212
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,913
Would you follow a king
to the Black Fortress?

213
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,031
Now l know you're a lunatic.

214
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,588
l wouldn't follow my own father
to the Black Fortress.

215
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,638
-lf he could find it!
-He wouldn't be so foolish.

216
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,269
ls it foolish to defend your world?
To fight for your homes and families?

217
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,238
lf the invaders conuer,
you'll be slaves with the rest of us.

218
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,959
Noble sentiments, but we fight for profit.

219
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,749
-You know what l mean?
-The profit's freedom. And fame.

220
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,951
Freedom? But we have it.

221
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,798
And fame, it's an empty purse.

222
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,351
Count it, go broke...

223
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,030
...eat it, go hungry...

224
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,038
...seek it and go mad.

225
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,919
That is true.

226
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,229
But this fame and this freedom
you could leave to your sons.

227
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,958
How did you know l had sons?

228
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,999
lf the Slayers conuer Krull,
your sons will be enslaved forever.

229
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,434
l have no sons, but l will go with you.

230
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,191
The boy shames you all.

231
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,269
Only the king and the lord marshal
have the keys to these manacles.

232
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,519
-You don't look like a lord marshal.
-No.

233
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,639
You look about the right age
to be Turold's son.

234
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,433
The exact age.

235
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,912
Toruil, you're growing old.
Your brain's softening.

236
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,870
Nine men like you are worth an army.

237
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,668
lf we succeed, unlock them.
Otherwise, l'll die with them.

238
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,432
Well, you heard him! We're now an army!

239
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,839
An unpaid army.

240
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,433
You got a problem, Rhun?

241
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,671
Can't a man even talk to himself
without being interrupted?

242
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,916
Let's go!

243
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,037
-Come along!
-Nennog! Move!

244
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,519
Gooseberries!

245
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,875
Ergo!

246
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,314
Ynyr, help!

247
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,356
Horrible! There was
a terrible creature over there.

248
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,313
And over there,
a creature with only one eye.

249
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,391
-One eye?
-A Cyclops.

250
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,750
He was aiming a spear straight at me.

251
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,154
Had it been so, you would now be dead.
He was aiming at a Slayer...

252
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,152
...for they have ancient hatred
between them.

253
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,469
Long ago, his ancestors lived
in a world far from Krull.

254
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,154
And had...

255
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,554
...two eyes like other men.

256
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,594
Then they made a bargain with the Beast
who is the leader of the Slayers.

257
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,116
They gave up one of their eyes
in exchange for the power...

258
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,037
...to see into the future.
But they were cheated.

259
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,398
For the only future
they are permitted to see...

260
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,078
...is the time of their own death.

261
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,676
They're sad, solitary creatures,
born to know...

262
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,272
...the day they will die.

263
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,072
Today would have been my day,
if it hadn't been for him.

264
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,916
Up you go.

265
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,079
We three will go on.
The rest will remain here.

266
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,159
We four will go on. l'm not staying behind
with these criminals!

267
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,958
We four will go.

268
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,308
He marches us
towards a solid face of rock.

269
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,035
The man has raisins in his braincase.

270
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,710
l recognise an old friend.

271
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,594
Mad. They're all mad!

272
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,116
We seek the Black Fortress.

273
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,869
Such a vision will be opposed.
Who seeks it?

274
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,639
The new king.

275
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,118
With an old voice?

276
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,478
You know the voice?

277
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,759
Yes, my friend.

278
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,915
We're trying to find the--

279
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,708
l will seek the Fortress for you.

280
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,796
-Got any sugarballs?
-No.

281
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,188
-Gumdrops?
-No.

282
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,238
What kind of boy are you?
Boys always have candy.

283
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,552
l have a cinnamon bar.

284
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,192
Share and share alike.

285
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,075
l am Ergo the Magnificent.

286
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,036
Short in stature, tall in power,
narrow of purpose and wide of vision.

287
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,038
That is very impressive.

288
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,788
l should hope so.

289
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,949
l'm Titch.

290
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,840
That's not impressive, but adeuate.

291
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,078
The Black Fortress.

292
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,559
Where is it?

293
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,839
Are you all right?

294
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,589
Yes.

295
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,158
The Beast does not like
curious Seers poking into his affairs.

296
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,918
His power is too great
for you to overcome?

297
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,433
Yes. Here. But there is one place
where his power cannot reach.

298
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,634
The Emerald Temple.

299
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,951
Yes. ln that place,
he cannot oppose my vision.

300
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,551
Will you travel there with us?

301
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,752
lt is in the Great Swamp:
a treacherous place.

302
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,958
Our need is great.

303
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,353
The Temple is at the centre of the Swamp,
where three trees grow as one.

304
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,119
How can anything grow in that place?
lt smells of death.

305
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,555
Death and power are close cousins.

306
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,474
Don't think l like your relatives, old man.

307
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,988
Have a look.

308
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,032
The profit of this journey.

309
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,718
They're worth a fortune.

310
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,749
Maybe. To someone
who's very nearsighted.

311
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,995
What?

312
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,798
But they were emeralds.

313
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,752
Hey, Rhun, emeralds.

314
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,031
l swear it! They were emeralds!

315
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,597
Rocks in our pockets and gravestones
above our heads is all we'll get from this.

316
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,594
Slayers!

317
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,957
-From the lake!
-Take cover!

318
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,036
-Over here!
-Get down.

319
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,839
Get down there!

320
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,438
Quick, over there!

321
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,549
Colwyn!

322
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,788
Over here!

323
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,152
That's the second time
you've saved my life.

324
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,074
-l am Ergo.
-The Magnificent.

325
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,393
Hasn't he got a name?

326
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,159
His name is Rell.

327
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,756
He visits the Seer sometimes.
He doesn't speak much.

328
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,913
So l've noticed. Except to be sarcastic
to people who wish to be friends.

329
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,357
Or jest with those
who already are his friends.

330
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,960
My name is no jest, beanpole. lt's nice
to have a short name if you're 20 feet tall...

331
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,231
...but small people need large names
to give them weight.

332
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,032
Your actions give you weight, my friend.
l saw you save the boy from a spear.

333
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,152
That's what friends are supposed
to do for each other.

334
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,549
Quite so.

335
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,949
You've been with us for a long way now.

336
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,959
Since the beginning. When l learned
that the Old One had come down...

337
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,190
...l knew that the time had come.

338
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,152
Join us, then. All men need company.

339
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,949
Yes.

340
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,354
All men.

341
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,269
That way.

342
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,274
lf l had my wish,
l'd be out of this gloomy place right away.

343
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,271
lf l really had my wish,
l'd be sitting on top of a gooseberry pie...

344
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,271
...as big as a mountain.

345
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,876
No, that's a bit greedy.
l'll settle for one as big as a house.

346
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,518
l'd wish for a puppy.

347
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,474
Only one puppy? lf you're wishing,
why not wish for 100?

348
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,749
l only want one.

349
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,992
That's a foolish wish.
And you, Rell, what would you wish for?

350
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,429
lgnorance.

351
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,796
No!

352
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,828
-Nennog!
-Help!

353
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,035
Help him!

354
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,792
The ground. lt's sinking!

355
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,075
lt is the power of the Beast.

356
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,511
-Link up! Make a chain!
-Help! Get me out!

357
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,158
Rhun, get hold of him!

358
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,468
Hurry!

359
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,828
-Hang on!
-Pull!

360
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,038
Give me the axe!

361
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,836
Here!

362
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,629
Pull!

363
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,155
Pull!

364
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,199
l'm slipping!

365
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,795
Pull it!

366
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,315
Menno!

367
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,029
Help me!

368
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,713
Get me out! Help me!

369
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,478
Menno! Keep still! Don't struggle!

370
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,069
Hold on!

371
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,355
Reach!

372
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,592
Keep still, Menno!

373
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,159
Don't struggle!

374
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,995
Pull!

375
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,829
Menno!

376
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,838
ls that you, Titch?

377
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,469
-How far to the Temple?
-Not far now.

378
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,595
Stay here, make sure
we're not being followed.

379
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,910
-l will stay.
-Be careful.

380
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,548
Thank you.

381
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,280
l'll lead the Seer. Titch, you go ahead.

382
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,478
Thank you, brother.

383
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,915
l'll lead the Seer. You go ahead with Titch.

384
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,913
-This way?
-No.

385
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,109
You sure?

386
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,558
l recognise this tree.

387
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,836
l recognise the place now.

388
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,916
We're in sight of the trees, brother.

389
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,072
He who seeks the knowledge
must lead me.

390
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,791
No one else may approach.

391
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,400
Here is the knowledge you seek.

392
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,193
The Beast has many weapons.
This was one of them.

393
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,159
The Changeling.

394
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,319
How did you know?

395
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,074
l found the Seer's body in the uicksand.

396
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,198
He gave his life for us.

397
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,878
He was my only family.

398
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,438
We're your family now.
