1
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:21,620
A hundred years ago,
all was right with our world.

2
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:24,723
Prosperity and peace filled our days.

3
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:26,381
The Four Nations:

4
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:32,362
Water, Earth, Fire and Air Nomads
lived amongst each other in harmony.

5
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:37,231
Great respect was afforded to all those
who could bend their natural element.

6
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,363
The Avatar was the only person
born amongst all the nations

7
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:44,237
Who could master all four elements.

8
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:48,313
He was the only one who could
communicate with the Spirit World.

9
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:52,976
With the Spirits' guidance,
the Avatar kept balance in the world.

10
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:57,722
And then, a hundred years ago,
he just disappeared.

11
00:02:34,427 --> 00:02:36,361
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

12
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,464
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

13
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:42,557
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey!
It worked better that time.

14
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:46,160
I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?

15
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,432
Yeah. I guess so.

16
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:55,042
Just stop doing that stuff around me.
I always get wet.

17
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:01,644
My brother and I live
in the Southern Water Tribe,

18
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:06,383
Which was once a big city.
Our father is off fighting in The War.

19
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:09,854
My mother was taken prisoner
and killed when I was young.

20
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,988
In this time of war, food is scarce.

21
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:16,294
My brother and I often
go hunting for food,

22
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:20,633
But, unfortunately, my brother
isn't the best hunter in the world.

23
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:27,472
- Tiger seal.
- Are you sure?

24
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:52,829
I did everything Dad said to do.

25
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:55,338
I watched Which side of the fin tracks
are more indented.

26
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:56,941
That shows Which
direction they're going.

27
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:00,773
I saw how long the drag skids are.
That shows you how fast they're going.

28
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,782
There's something under there.

29
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:28,537
It's a cave-In!
Move away from the cracks!

30
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:01,265
Katara, don't go near it.
This is probably some Fire Nation trick.

31
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:05,066
Just back away really slow.

32
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,244
Katara! Do not hit that sphere!

33
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,957
Uncle, look!

34
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,909
Is he breathing?

35
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:17,741
Did you see that light
shoot into the sky?

36
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:19,578
What's your name?

37
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:24,646
How did you get here?
How did you get in the ice?

38
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:27,152
He's exhausted.

39
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:30,655
We need to get him back to the village.

40
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:38,726
What is this thing?

41
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:45,404
It's trying to eat me!

42
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:55,285
Look. See?

43
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,426
How'd you get all the way out here?

44
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,600
I ran away from home.

45
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:14,732
We got in a storm. We were forced
under the water of the ocean.

46
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:16,603
I see.

47
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:19,438
It wasn't very smart. I was just upset.

48
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,380
- Thanks for saving me.
- Lucky.

49
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:25,951
I probably should get home.
They'll all be worried.

50
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:29,213
- You're not still upset?
- Not as much as I was.

51
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,198
The Fire Nation is here.

52
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,205
- What?
- And they brought their machines.

53
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:54,744
Don't come out
till I tell you it's safe.

54
00:07:56,549 --> 00:08:00,508
- Is something wrong?
- No. Please wait here.

55
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:04,145
- Hurry, now!
- Secure the area!

56
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:18,061
It can't be coincidence
that we break him out of the ice,

57
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:21,765
Light shoots into the sky and now the
Fire Nation is here with their machines.

58
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:35,120
Sokka, don't.

59
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:46,197
I am Prince Zuko...

60
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:50,963
...son of Fire Lord Ozal
and heir to the throne!

61
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:55,265
Bring me all your elderly!

62
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:57,238
- Papa!
- Move!

63
00:08:57,376 --> 00:08:58,434
Yeah?

64
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:03,643
Grandma!

65
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:10,981
Please don't... don't harm him!

66
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,656
Come on!

67
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,991
Katara, don't.

68
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:23,228
- Form a line!
- Come on!

69
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:28,700
Here.

70
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:30,769
Hey.

71
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,118
Grammy!

72
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:49,925
You're scaring these people.

73
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,862
Who are you? What's your name?!

74
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:03,031
- I don't need to tell you anything.
- Firebenders!

75
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,045
I'm taking you to my ship.

76
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:14,383
If you don't come,
I'll burn down this village.

77
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,478
I'll go with you.
Don't hurt anyone.

78
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:36,500
They were looking for someone old
and they were looking for someone

79
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:38,337
With the same markings the boy had.

80
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:41,742
They dragged Mom away
the same way when we were babies.

81
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,213
She wouldn't have watched us being
taken away. She would have fought.

82
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:48,878
We found that boy. He's our
responsibility. We should fight.

83
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,785
What would you do
if they tried to take me away?

84
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:54,415
I'd kill them all.

85
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:58,522
- why?
- Because you're my sister.

86
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:01,860
Because Dad told me
to protect you with my life.

87
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:08,968
Because I'm your responsibility.
And this boy is our responsibility.

88
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,504
What do you want us to do, Katara?
How are we supposed to save him?

89
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:19,048
They're on a ship.
We'd need a miracle to catch them.

90
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:22,176
I know you think everything's
going to work out, but I don't.

91
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:40,127
His bison creature thing floats.

92
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:02,052
What do you want with me?

93
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:06,828
My nephew wants me to perform
a little test on you.

94
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:12,296
- What kind of test?
- I assure you, it won't hurt.

95
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:15,930
I've performed it hundreds of times.
It only takes a few moments.

96
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,599
And then you're free to go.

97
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:22,545
Would you mind if I put a few things
in front of you at the table?

98
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,173
It will only take a moment.

99
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:27,745
That's all you want?

100
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:31,083
My name is Iroh,
and you have my word.

101
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:34,825
Grandma, I know
you're gonna try to stop us,

102
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,758
- But this is just something I need...
- Sit down.

103
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:43,460
I knew from the first time
we discovered you were a Bender,

104
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:46,537
That one day,
I would realize your destiny.

105
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:52,206
There hasn't been a Waterbender
in the Southern Water Tribe

106
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:55,245
Since my friend Hama was taken away.

107
00:12:56,882 --> 00:13:00,545
Today, I found out that destiny.

108
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:03,214
Did you see that boy's tattoos?

109
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:07,557
Tattoos like that haven't
been seen in over a century.

110
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,155
I believe they are Airbending tattoos.

111
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,396
How can that be?

112
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:19,561
I believe that little boy
might be the Avatar.

113
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:27,936
Once, a long time ago,
the Spirit world kept balance over us.

114
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,105
What is the Spirit world, Grandma?

115
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:33,275
It's not a place made up
of things you can touch.

116
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:36,148
But it exists, nonetheless.

117
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:42,258
It is filled with the most amazing forms
of dazzling creatures...

118
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:48,358
...that exist in the most
exotic valleys, mountains and forests.

119
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:53,034
Each of these creatures is a Spirit.

120
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:55,697
They've watched over us
since the beginning.

121
00:13:55,841 --> 00:14:00,505
They have guided us. And only
the Avatar can go speak to them.

122
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:02,375
Aren't there Spirits here?

123
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:06,448
Yes, there are some Spirits
that live hidden among us,

124
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:09,850
Sure they're watching us
with great sadness...

125
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:16,018
The Fire Nation doesn't wish
to live by the Spirits.

126
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:19,619
That's why they're so frightened
by the existence of the Avatar.

127
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:23,590
- What can he do?
- With his mastery of the four elements,

128
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:27,637
He will begin to change hearts.

129
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,974
And it is in the heart
that all wars are won.

130
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:38,806
Now, go help this boy.

131
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,880
He will need you two.

132
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:46,150
And we all need him.

133
00:15:48,754 --> 00:15:51,621
You are my prisoner...

134
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:54,385
...Airbender.

135
00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:58,220
I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.

136
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,098
- You said...
- I apologize.

137
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,167
I should have explained further.

138
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:08,239
If you failed the test, as all others
did, you were free to leave.

139
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:13,333
But, as it turns out, you are
the only one in the entire world

140
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:15,378
Who could pass this test.

141
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:18,978
It is truly an honor
to be in your presence.

142
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:23,582
Don't even try to escape.
This is a warship!

143
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:30,093
Stop! There's no way you can...

144
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:11,465
Don't move! You have nowhere to run!

145
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,759
Halt!

146
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:14,862
Don't let him escape!

147
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:16,296
Get him!

148
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,493
Thanks for bringing Appa to me.

149
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:43,658
The Fire Nation is up to something.
I have to go back now.

150
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:46,896
- We'll come with you.
- I can take you back to the village.

151
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,167
We're going with you.

152
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:55,405
You found the Avatar.

153
00:17:57,249 --> 00:18:00,582
For a moment, I had my honor back.

154
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:07,423
Your destinies are tied, Zuko.
That, you can be sure of.

155
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:17,358
Aang flew us to his home. He told us
how he left there in a storm on Appa,

156
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:20,435
And got forced into the ocean
where they almost drowned.

157
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:23,336
Aang Airbended a sphere around them,
and ice formed.

158
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:25,943
And he couldn't remember
anything after that.

159
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:29,444
Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back!

160
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:32,875
Hey, guys! I want you to meet someone!

161
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,446
This is where you live?

162
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,782
They must be playing some trick
or something.

163
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:40,790
Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out
and scare me at any moment.

164
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:43,193
He's the teacher responsible for me.

165
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:47,391
He's kind of like my father.

166
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,463
- Is it OK if you tell me your name?
- The monks named me Aang.

167
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:56,134
OK, guys! Enough!

168
00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:01,310
Spider-Rat!
They're poisonous! Get behind me.

169
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:05,143
He's a Flying Lemur-Bat.
We keep them as pets.

170
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,975
Weren't they extinct a long time ago?

171
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:11,422
Extinct? No, there must be thousands
of them on this mountain.

172
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:16,160
Your friends were monks?

173
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:19,127
I know where they are right now.
They're at the prayer field!

174
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:26,501
Aang, wait! I have to talk to you!

175
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:38,513
Aang...

176
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:44,353
...I think you were in that ice
for almost a hundred years.

177
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:51,651
- The Firebenders started a war.
- I left a few days ago.

178
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:57,366
Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar
would be born into the Air Nomads...

179
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,202
...so they exterminated
all the Air Nomads.

180
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:12,705
You're lying!

181
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:14,879
You're lying!

182
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:28,289
This is Monk Gyatso's.

183
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:30,895
I made it for him.

184
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:47,316
No!

185
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:06,532
Katara! Stay away from him!

186
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:11,598
Katara!

187
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,537
Stay away from him!

188
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:19,808
Your friends were monks?

189
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:51,045
The Avatar?

190
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:55,351
where have you been?

191
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:56,818
Aang!

192
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:59,783
You can't bring Monk Gyatso back,

193
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:03,587
But Sokka and I can be with you
as long as you need!

194
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:07,728
Don't give up! We can do this together!

195
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,323
Aang!

196
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:48,033
The banished prince.

197
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,536
Let's offer him lunch.

198
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,275
I wanted to thank
the great General Iroh

199
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:02,682
And young Prince Zuko
for dining with us.

200
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:09,918
As you know, the Fire Lord
has banished his son, the Prince,

201
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:13,224
And renounced his love of him, and will
not let him return to the throne

202
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:15,059
Unless he finds the Avatar.

203
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:19,399
The Fire Lord believes his son
is too soft,

204
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:22,438
And by doing this,
he will become strong

205
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:25,566
And become a worthy heir
to the throne.

206
00:23:26,911 --> 00:23:29,436
I commend the Fire Lord's discipline.

207
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:33,574
For example, it seems
I need to remind Prince Zuko

208
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:38,087
That, during his banishment,
he is an enemy of the Fire Nation

209
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:41,351
And is not allowed
to wear the Fire Nation uniform.

210
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:45,327
But we will let him wear it today,

211
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:47,693
Like a child wearing a costume.

212
00:23:55,774 --> 00:24:00,609
One day, my father will take me back
and you will bow before me.

213
00:25:13,518 --> 00:25:14,576
You OK?

214
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:17,711
I'll be fine.

215
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:21,690
You know, my grandma thinks
because you're an Airbender,

216
00:25:21,826 --> 00:25:23,191
That you could be the Avatar.

217
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:28,191
How much does
the Fire Nation control?

218
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:32,336
A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom,
like around here.

219
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,735
They haven't been able to conquer
big cities, like Ba Sing Se,

220
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:38,035
But they're making plans, I'm sure.

221
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:40,708
So...

222
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:43,810
...are you the Avatar, Aang?

223
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:51,886
What is this?

224
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:54,283
Stay hidden.

225
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,697
- That child is being arrested.
- For What?

226
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:08,169
He was bending tiny stones at us
from behind a tree. It really hurt.

227
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:09,534
He can bend earth?

228
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:13,002
Earthbending is forbidden
in this village.

229
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:17,579
Leave him alone.
You're not taking him anywhere.

230
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:21,483
No one is taking anybody away!

231
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:26,047
She's a bender!

232
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,261
Katara!

233
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,280
Move.

234
00:26:58,122 --> 00:26:59,282
You, too.

235
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:00,413
Dad!

236
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:07,226
- This is my father.
- Hello.

237
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:11,131
That's the Fire Nation's plan,
suppress all other bending.

238
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,636
How did this happen to your village?

239
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:21,475
Fire Nation sent soldiers.
We fought them and defeated them.

240
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:27,516
Then they sent their machines,
huge machines made of metal.

241
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:29,643
There was nothing we could do.

242
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:34,248
Those Who could not bend were
allowed to live in peace,

243
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:35,984
If we were imprisoned.

244
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:49,332
Earthbenders!

245
00:27:52,844 --> 00:27:58,180
why are you acting this way?
You are powerful and amazing people!

246
00:27:58,316 --> 00:28:02,685
You don't need to live like this!
There is earth right beneath your feet.

247
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:07,519
The ground is an extension
of Who you are!

248
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:12,696
If the Avatar had returned...

249
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:16,056
...would that mean anything to you?

250
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,137
The Avatar is dead.
If he was here, he would protect us.

251
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,373
My name is Aang...

252
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:27,376
...and I am the Avatar.

253
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:32,046
I ran away, but I'm back now.

254
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:38,044
It's time for you to stop doing this!

255
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:43,717
The Avatar would have to be an
Airbender. Are you an Airbender, boy?

256
00:28:46,564 --> 00:28:48,225
Leave him alone!

257
00:28:54,572 --> 00:28:56,437
How is he doing that?

258
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:58,633
I don't want to hurt anyone.

259
00:28:58,776 --> 00:29:02,803
All Airbenders should be dead.
Kill him! Firebenders, positions!

260
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:10,247
OK! Everybody can help us now!

261
00:29:33,377 --> 00:29:35,436
Don't be afraid!

262
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:14,641
Just leave them!

263
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:17,086
Fall back!

264
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:20,148
Go! He's an Airbender!

265
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:44,277
They took away any tools
related to bending.

266
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:01,797
The Fire Nation took this scroll
from a member of your Water Tribe.

267
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:05,525
A Waterbending scroll.

268
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,939
This is rare.
My mom told me about these.

269
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:19,271
This was you when
you were born an Earthbender,

270
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,885
Two lifetimes ago.

271
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,418
You came to our village.

272
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:28,655
Avatar Kyoshi loved games.

273
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:32,194
I do, too.
I mean, I still do.

274
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:35,995
A lot of the villages in this part
of the Earth Kingdom are occupied

275
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,226
By the Fire Nation,
like this village was.

276
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:42,397
They prey on the weakest towns
and villages.

277
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,508
We should go visit
some of these towns, Aang.

278
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:47,202
- I need to tell you something.
- What is it, Aang?

279
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:52,204
I ran away before they trained me
to be the Avatar.

280
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,341
I don't know how
to bend the other elements.

281
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:57,480
why did you run away?

282
00:31:57,989 --> 00:32:01,254
The day they told me I was the Avatar,
they said I could never

283
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:04,327
Have a normal life,
that I could never have a family.

284
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:07,856
They said it cannot work with
the responsibilities of the Avatar.

285
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:11,196
- why can't the Avatar have a family?
- I asked that!

286
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:14,702
They said that's the sacrifice
the Avatar always has to make.

287
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,366
OK. So, What if we found you teachers.
Teachers to teach you bending?

288
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,374
Which element would you
have to learn first?

289
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:23,776
Water. Water comes
after Air in the cycle.

290
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:26,474
Air, Water, Earth, Fire.

291
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:29,677
But there are really powerful benders
in the Northern Water Tribe.

292
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,615
My dad told me about it before he left.

293
00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:34,122
It's led by a princess because
her father died.

294
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:37,318
There are teachers there, but all
the way on the other side of the world.

295
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:40,123
- We can get there on Appa.
- That's What I was thinking.

296
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:42,357
And maybe we can stop
in the villages on the way,

297
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,025
Start a change in The war
in these small villages.

298
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,395
- Should we try it?
- Yes, we should.

299
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,720
The scroll we had
was proving to be helpful.

300
00:33:45,863 --> 00:33:49,526
Aang was practicing,
but for some reason,

301
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,101
He was having trouble
with Waterbending.

302
00:33:59,343 --> 00:34:02,471
We moved from town to town
in the Earth Kingdom.

303
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:04,137
We tried to stay out of sight,

304
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:08,877
But Sokka became concerned
we were being followed.

305
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:43,851
Sire, I have good news.

306
00:34:43,988 --> 00:34:46,354
As you know, I conducted a raid
on the Great Library,

307
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,720
- Which most said didn't exist.
- Get on with it.

308
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:53,920
I found scrolls in the library.
We are deciphering them.

309
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:56,055
But I believe they may
contain information

310
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,431
As to where the Ocean and Moon
Spirits live in this world.

311
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,265
With this information,

312
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:03,930
We could bring down
the Northern Water Tribe city,

313
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:07,771
We could show the world
the true strength of fire.

314
00:35:07,912 --> 00:35:09,573
I am pleased.

315
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:14,980
Well, Commander Zhao,
are the rumors true or not?

316
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,180
Our spies have discovered someone
claiming to be the Avatar.

317
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:22,358
They describe him as just a boy.

318
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:25,920
We should set a trap for this person.

319
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:28,657
We have many Earth Kingdom people
under our control.

320
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:31,996
I can leave soldiers
hidden in certain locations.

321
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:36,903
- And my son?
- He had his chance. He missed it.

322
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,200
Let's hope, for your sake,

323
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:45,213
My son doesn't find this person first
and he turns out to be the Avatar.

324
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,243
He would return as a hero and,
for all purposes, be your superior.

325
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:56,083
Well, I suppose it's a race, then.

326
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,241
We're close, Uncle.

327
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:21,750
They've been moving
farther and farther north.

328
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:24,919
We're catching them.

329
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:32,095
There are a lot of pretty girls
in this town, Zuko.

330
00:36:33,097 --> 00:36:35,190
You could fall in love here.

331
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:39,769
We could settle down here,
and you could have a blessed life.

332
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:44,939
We don't have to continue this, Zuko.

333
00:36:47,111 --> 00:36:49,602
I'll show you why we must, Uncle.

334
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:56,179
Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.

335
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:03,624
You look like a very smart boy.

336
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:09,927
Tell me What you know about the
Prince, the Fire Lord's son.

337
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:14,936
- He did something wrong.
- He spoke out of turn to a general,

338
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:17,063
In defense of some of his friends

339
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:21,143
Who were going to be sacrificed
in a battle.

340
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:25,806
Then Prince Zuko
was sentenced to an Agni Ki duel,

341
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,417
But when he showed up,

342
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:31,419
- It was his father he was to fight.
- That's right.

343
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:34,180
He would not fight his father.

344
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:38,352
Then his father mocked him and said,

345
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:41,157
"I should bring your sister
up here to beat you. "

346
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:45,229
Then the father burnt his son...

347
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:47,827
...to teach him a lesson.

348
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:00,180
We'll catch him soon, Uncle.

349
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:03,845
Then we can think
about the pretty girls.

350
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:15,662
Aang...

351
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:18,029
Try to keep your Wrist bent,
like it's showing.

352
00:38:21,872 --> 00:38:25,899
What's wrong?
You've really been distracted today.

353
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:29,911
I saw Sokka's maps.
We're near the Northern Air Temple.

354
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:33,813
Do you think it would be OK
if I just visited there and came back?

355
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:36,715
- I'd be back in less than a day.
- why?

356
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:39,721
He had a vision
at the Southern Air Temple prayer field.

357
00:38:39,857 --> 00:38:42,849
He talked to a Dragon Spirit
Who he thinks can help us.

358
00:38:42,993 --> 00:38:45,518
He thinks if he goes
to another spiritual place,

359
00:38:45,663 --> 00:38:47,392
He can get back to the Spirit world.

360
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:51,297
I don't think that's a good idea.
We started a rebellion.

361
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:53,900
Try to talk him out of it.

362
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:48,453
I can't do this.

363
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:50,219
I need help.

364
00:40:01,472 --> 00:40:04,373
- I guess your talk didn't work.
- He'll be back in a day.

365
00:40:04,942 --> 00:40:08,571
The Fire Nation is following us. If we
make a wrong move, they'll catch him.

366
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:48,751
Who are you?

367
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:54,020
why, it cannot be!

368
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:58,191
I've heard stories. Are you...?

369
00:40:58,996 --> 00:41:00,588
My name is Aang.

370
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:05,191
I cannot believe
I've lived to see your return.

371
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:10,199
I'm an Earth villager,
but I visit these temple remains often.

372
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,436
The Fire Nation destroyed this temple.
They have ruined everything.

373
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:17,741
No, no, no, not everything.

374
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:21,749
You know, there's
a hidden chamber of statues

375
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:24,649
I think you, of all people, should see.

376
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:27,883
These are all the Avatars.

377
00:41:28,892 --> 00:41:32,885
These are the reincarnations
of you over the years.

378
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:39,565
The Avatar Roku was your last life.

379
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:47,068
Now, how did the Airbenders know
you were the Avatar, little one?

380
00:41:49,112 --> 00:41:50,909
They gave me a test.

381
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,751
They put 1,000 toys in front of me
and asked me to choose four.

382
00:41:56,587 --> 00:42:00,489
They said I chose the same four objects
that belonged to the previous Avatars.

383
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:06,026
That's when they told me
I could have no family.

384
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:11,163
Told me I had a responsibility
to the Four Nations.

385
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:18,503
There's a ceremony
when everyone bows to me.

386
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:23,110
That's when I accept my role
as the Avatar.

387
00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:27,045
But when everyone bowed...

388
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:32,678
...I didn't bow back.

389
00:42:33,123 --> 00:42:35,455
You seem like a nice young man.

390
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:42,666
You really do.
You will forgive me, won't you?

391
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:46,797
- For What?
- For luring you down here.

392
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:54,303
I have lived in poverty
because of your absence, Avatar.

393
00:42:54,444 --> 00:42:57,880
So you will understand
my actions today.

394
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:23,336
I have lived in poverty
because of your absence, Avatar.

395
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:33,616
I have seen a vision
of the moon turning red.

396
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:39,549
The Fire Nation has stolen knowledge
of us from the Great Library.

397
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,989
They are planning
to misuse this knowledge.

398
00:43:43,126 --> 00:43:44,457
I will stop them.

399
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:48,655
You must go
to the Northern Water Tribe.

400
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:52,394
If they take that city,
more will suffer and die,

401
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:54,766
As your Airbenders have.

402
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:57,739
You must go now!

403
00:43:57,874 --> 00:43:59,136
Will I stop them?

404
00:43:59,276 --> 00:44:00,607
Wake up, young man!

405
00:44:03,547 --> 00:44:07,608
My name is Commander Zhao.
I set this trap for you.

406
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,721
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.

407
00:44:13,924 --> 00:44:18,418
Besides, you'd just be reborn Again,

408
00:44:18,562 --> 00:44:20,723
And then the search would continue.

409
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:27,898
So where have you been all this time?

410
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:31,905
And how is it that you're still a boy?

411
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:37,477
I understand that when you freed
that handful of towns,

412
00:44:37,614 --> 00:44:39,912
You were very impressive, but...

413
00:44:41,618 --> 00:44:45,247
...you only used Airbending
Against my soldiers.

414
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:49,248
Now, why is that?

415
00:45:02,105 --> 00:45:04,573
The Fire Lord and I have a plan

416
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:09,236
To ensure our reign
and the downfall of our enemies.

417
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:12,439
I am sending a personal message
to the Fire Lord,

418
00:45:12,682 --> 00:45:15,480
Informing him
that the once feared Avatar

419
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:19,817
Is our prisoner
and no threat to our might.

420
00:45:56,626 --> 00:45:57,923
Who are you?

421
00:46:00,797 --> 00:46:01,889
Wait! Don't!

422
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:04,330
Stop!

423
00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:33,026
Fools.

424
00:46:34,631 --> 00:46:38,294
Close the inner gates!
The Avatar has escaped!

425
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:48,806
Lock down the gate!

426
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:52,378
Lock down all the gates!

427
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,330
To the main post!

428
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,160
This was their practice area.

429
00:47:11,301 --> 00:47:13,895
Go Again!

430
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,457
Do not kill the Avatar!

431
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:20,290
He will just be reborn Again!

432
00:49:21,931 --> 00:49:23,523
why are you doing this? Who are you?

433
00:49:35,078 --> 00:49:36,136
Open the gates.

434
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:39,471
Let them out!

435
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:59,332
- Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
- Not at all.

436
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:02,335
Do it.

437
00:50:52,922 --> 00:50:54,219
What is this?

438
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:55,274
And how did he escape?

439
00:51:57,287 --> 00:52:01,781
I fear that your son
is not only incompetent,

440
00:52:01,925 --> 00:52:03,790
But also a traitor.

441
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:06,691
Of course, I cannot prove this, Sire.

442
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:12,128
You think...

443
00:52:12,802 --> 00:52:15,965
...my son is this person

444
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:19,370
The soldiers are calling
the Blue Spirit.

445
00:52:22,479 --> 00:52:23,946
Yes.

446
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:32,478
Zhao's men were searching the coast,
looking for you.

447
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,651
They also searched the ship.

448
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,827
I told them you went
on vacation with a girl.

449
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,627
where were you the past four days?

450
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:49,502
Nowhere.

451
00:52:51,274 --> 00:52:53,071
We have to keep moving.

452
00:52:54,377 --> 00:52:56,402
The Avatar is traveling Again.

453
00:52:57,514 --> 00:52:59,345
Take rest first.

454
00:53:00,183 --> 00:53:02,743
It looks like you
went through a great deal.

455
00:53:03,586 --> 00:53:08,353
when you wake, we'll have tea together
before we start the engines.

456
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,861
Do not harm my son.

457
00:53:20,837 --> 00:53:23,362
Leave him to his isolation.

458
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,067
You have my word, Sire.
I will not harm him.

459
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,731
Zuko!

460
00:54:08,017 --> 00:54:09,917
And what of the Avatar?

461
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:13,051
We assume he has
rejoined with his supporters.

462
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:25,600
It has been confirmed
that he's traveling north.

463
00:54:25,868 --> 00:54:29,497
It is my strong belief that he is
traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.

464
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,104
I believe the child Avatar has only
knowledge of his birth element, Air.

465
00:54:36,045 --> 00:54:40,175
I believe he is trying to learn
in the discipline of Water.

466
00:54:40,316 --> 00:54:43,547
He's gone to seek out someone
in the Northern Water Tribe,

467
00:54:43,686 --> 00:54:48,589
where they have lived beyond our reach
and openly practice Waterbending.

468
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:37,263
We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe.

469
00:55:37,407 --> 00:55:40,171
We presented ourselves
to the royal court.

470
00:55:43,246 --> 00:55:46,841
My brother and the princess
became friends right away.

471
00:56:01,364 --> 00:56:04,492
Aang showed them he
was the last Airbender,

472
00:56:04,634 --> 00:56:07,364
And was accepted
to train with the master.

473
00:56:23,386 --> 00:56:26,651
The city knew our arrival
would bring great danger.

474
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:30,885
And they prepared for war they knew
would come in the ensuing weeks.

475
00:56:34,897 --> 00:56:38,060
The city was designed
to withstand any assault.

476
00:56:38,401 --> 00:56:41,837
If we keep them to the courtyard
and the marketplace till night falls,

477
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:45,131
where we have the advantage,
we will succeed.

478
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:47,571
If we let too many of them
into the city,

479
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,076
Their sheer numbers
could overwhelm us.

480
00:56:50,747 --> 00:56:54,513
As many fires in this city should be put
out as possible when the alarm sounds.

481
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:58,177
We want to minimize
their bender sources.

482
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:02,490
I must assign a guard
to be with you at all times, Princess.

483
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:06,417
Your presence is our inspiration.

484
00:57:06,562 --> 00:57:09,531
I'll do it. That's me.
I'll be her guard.

485
00:57:09,665 --> 00:57:11,223
Nothing will happen to her.

486
00:57:13,536 --> 00:57:16,004
I had a feeling you might volunteer.

487
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:21,842
I've heard no word of my son
for quite some time.

488
00:57:21,978 --> 00:57:25,778
- Do you know where he is?
- I've not heard of anything, Sire.

489
00:57:25,915 --> 00:57:28,816
I'm sure word of him
will come to us soon.

490
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:31,715
The Northern Water Tribe benders
are given their strength

491
00:57:31,854 --> 00:57:35,620
By the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
They will be difficult to defeat.

492
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:40,056
Now, if for some reason
the Spirits were not involved,

493
00:57:40,196 --> 00:57:41,959
That would be different.

494
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,801
What have you learned
from the stolen scrolls?

495
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,702
We have deciphered the location
of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.

496
00:57:54,477 --> 00:57:59,471
It is our destiny to have found
this information, Zhao.

497
00:58:02,919 --> 00:58:05,353
Eliminate the Spirits,

498
00:58:05,488 --> 00:58:09,982
Take the city and we will have
thwarted the Avatar in the process.

499
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:23,996
Water is What?

500
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,734
The flowing element.
The element of change.

501
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,173
To master Water,
you must release your emotions,

502
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:33,544
wherever they may lead you.

503
00:58:33,683 --> 00:58:36,345
Water teaches us acceptance.

504
00:58:37,353 --> 00:58:40,015
Let your emotions flow like Water.

505
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:45,924
Aang, would you like to spar?
You haven't sparred in a few days.

506
00:59:18,427 --> 00:59:20,054
Now, use offense, Aang!

507
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:17,716
General Iroh, I'm glad you could
accept my invitation to join us

508
01:00:17,853 --> 01:00:22,119
- On this historic event.
- Your invitation was most gracious.

509
01:00:22,258 --> 01:00:25,625
You are a gifted strategist.
No one can argue that.

510
01:00:26,028 --> 01:00:30,965
Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege
of Ba Sing Se won't be held Against you.

511
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:34,960
Your son died in that siege, didn't he?

512
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:38,134
Yes, he did.

513
01:00:39,742 --> 01:00:42,768
Again, I offer my condolences
on your nephew burning to death

514
01:00:42,912 --> 01:00:44,812
In that terrible accident.

515
01:00:47,149 --> 01:00:48,275
Thank you.

516
01:00:56,325 --> 01:00:58,793
I've loved spending
these weeks with you, Sokka.

517
01:00:58,928 --> 01:01:00,418
Me, too.

518
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:07,435
Should we see What the ocean
is doing today?

519
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:16,144
when there is some safety for all of us,

520
01:01:16,278 --> 01:01:19,111
I will come visit our sister city
in the Southern Water Tribe

521
01:01:19,248 --> 01:01:21,478
And spend some time in your home.

522
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:23,508
That would be great.

523
01:01:25,688 --> 01:01:27,451
But I warn you...

524
01:01:28,457 --> 01:01:32,188
...my grandmother will ask you
a lot of questions.

525
01:01:39,268 --> 01:01:40,860
What might she ask me?

526
01:01:42,705 --> 01:01:47,699
She'll say, "why is your hair white,
young lady? You look very odd. "

527
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:52,909
I would say to your grandmother, my
hair is white because when I was born

528
01:01:53,049 --> 01:01:55,074
I was not awake.

529
01:01:55,217 --> 01:01:59,051
My mother and father could not get me
to make a sound or move.

530
01:01:59,722 --> 01:02:01,747
So they prayed for days
to the Moon Spirit

531
01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:04,724
And dipped me into the sacred Waters.

532
01:02:06,896 --> 01:02:11,890
My parents said that my hair turned
white then and life poured into me.

533
01:02:13,736 --> 01:02:14,896
Wow.

534
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:18,400
You didn't tell me that.

535
01:02:19,575 --> 01:02:21,566
You didn't ask me.

536
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:23,907
Only your grandmother did.

537
01:02:29,919 --> 01:02:33,082
I'm sure Zhao was the one
Who ordered the attack on you.

538
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:38,420
Any problems?

539
01:02:39,495 --> 01:02:42,862
We have arrived at the Northern
Water Tribe's stronghold.

540
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:44,431
They believe the boy is there.

541
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:48,669
why do you seem upset, Uncle?

542
01:02:50,272 --> 01:02:52,467
Zhao has no sacredness.

543
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:55,010
Are you sure you want to be here?

544
01:02:58,447 --> 01:03:02,941
I will not be allowed to live in peace
until I bring the Avatar to my father!

545
01:03:03,285 --> 01:03:05,014
Is that not clear to you?

546
01:04:15,357 --> 01:04:16,847
What is this?

547
01:04:18,194 --> 01:04:19,525
Yue...

548
01:04:21,363 --> 01:04:22,955
...the Fire Nation is here.

549
01:04:46,055 --> 01:04:49,218
Now be sure to keep your uniform
closed up to your neck.

550
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:52,049
And remember, your Chi can warm you.

551
01:04:53,395 --> 01:04:54,794
I know, Uncle.

552
01:05:07,576 --> 01:05:08,907
Be safe.

553
01:06:11,874 --> 01:06:13,466
Aang needs to ask you something.

554
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,540
I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit.

555
01:06:17,313 --> 01:06:19,304
He can help me defeat the Fire Nation.

556
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:22,746
Is there a spiritual place
where I can meditate?

557
01:06:22,885 --> 01:06:27,413
There is a very spiritual place.
The city was built around this place.

558
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,020
But we must hurry.

559
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:53,041
Momo, be nice.

560
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:57,982
To get your Airbending tattoos,

561
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:03,217
You have to meditate for long
periods of time without losing focus.

562
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:07,352
Some of the great monks
can meditate for four days.

563
01:07:23,479 --> 01:07:26,346
- I have to get back.
- I'll take you.

564
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,384
I'll stay with him.

565
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:51,967
Aang?

566
01:07:54,743 --> 01:07:56,574
Aang, can you hear me?

567
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:01,739
I knew you were real.

568
01:08:03,085 --> 01:08:05,918
I always knew you'd return.

569
01:08:06,922 --> 01:08:08,321
Me, too.

570
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,589
The Fire Lord's son.

571
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,023
You took him from our village.

572
01:08:43,392 --> 01:08:44,950
Who are you?

573
01:08:45,661 --> 01:08:47,253
My name is Katara,

574
01:08:47,396 --> 01:08:50,297
And I'm the only Waterbender left
in the Southern Water Tribe.

575
01:09:11,787 --> 01:09:13,721
- Go for the children.
- Yes.

576
01:09:27,169 --> 01:09:30,002
I'm not allowed to go home without him.

577
01:10:08,544 --> 01:10:10,944
The Waterbenders get power
from the moon.

578
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:13,309
They will get stronger
as the day comes to an end.

579
01:10:15,117 --> 01:10:17,881
General Iroh,
I've been keeping a secret.

580
01:10:18,754 --> 01:10:20,153
And What is that?

581
01:10:20,556 --> 01:10:23,923
In my raid of the Great Library
earlier this year,

582
01:10:24,059 --> 01:10:26,493
I found a scroll that tells

583
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:29,188
The location
of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.

584
01:10:29,898 --> 01:10:32,492
To meet a Spirit would be a great honor.

585
01:10:36,605 --> 01:10:38,732
Well, I hope I can give you that honor.

586
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:20,775
What happened?

587
01:11:22,451 --> 01:11:23,611
What happened?

588
01:11:24,386 --> 01:11:28,345
Prince Zuko's here in the city.
He took Aang Again.

589
01:11:41,136 --> 01:11:44,071
We'll just wait
till everyone's fighting everyone.

590
01:11:45,774 --> 01:11:48,470
Then in the night, we'll slip out.

591
01:11:49,978 --> 01:11:51,969
Aang, can you hear me?

592
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:57,247
I knew you were real.

593
01:11:58,654 --> 01:12:01,487
I always knew you'd return.

594
01:12:03,892 --> 01:12:06,156
Hello! Hello!

595
01:12:09,064 --> 01:12:12,659
Please, tell me how
to beat the Fire Nation!

596
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:29,046
You are not dealing
with the loss of your people,

597
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:32,676
And your responsibility
for their deaths.

598
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:35,851
You are stopping yourself
from grieving.

599
01:12:36,191 --> 01:12:37,852
You are angry.

600
01:12:38,193 --> 01:12:41,526
You must let this go.

601
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:46,690
As the Avatar,
you are not meant to hurt others.

602
01:12:59,114 --> 01:13:00,376
Use the ocean.

603
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:04,576
Show them the power of Water.

604
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,212
Go! Do this now.

605
01:13:11,226 --> 01:13:15,162
My sister Azula
was always the special one.

606
01:13:15,764 --> 01:13:17,959
She was a Firebending prodigy.

607
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,727
My father loves her.

608
01:13:28,076 --> 01:13:30,567
He can't even look at me sometimes.

609
01:13:32,714 --> 01:13:34,409
He says I'm like my mother.

610
01:14:27,335 --> 01:14:29,462
I advise that you
pull back your men soon.

611
01:14:29,604 --> 01:14:32,573
They will be trapped in the city
when the moon's power comes out.

612
01:14:32,707 --> 01:14:35,608
Do not worry about the moon's power,
General Iroh.

613
01:14:35,744 --> 01:14:37,837
why should you not be worried
about the moon's power?

614
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:40,140
Because your brother,
Fire Lord Ozal, and I

615
01:14:40,382 --> 01:14:44,216
Have decided it is in our best
interests to kill the Moon Spirit.

616
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,480
What?

617
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:10,560
Calm down. We'll find him.

618
01:16:53,114 --> 01:16:56,345
Are you OK?
Did the Spirits tell you anything?

619
01:16:56,484 --> 01:17:00,443
Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me.
I know What to do.

620
01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:03,784
Aang, we have to go.

621
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:29,810
You won't be killed by Waterbenders
if you stay hidden here.

622
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:34,982
We could be friends, you know.

623
01:17:47,335 --> 01:17:49,235
They're getting stronger.

624
01:17:50,839 --> 01:17:55,173
This is a scroll from the Great Library.
This is our map.

625
01:17:55,977 --> 01:17:58,571
Our world is going to change soon,
gentlemen.

626
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,043
Right there and right there.

627
01:18:24,139 --> 01:18:26,699
See where they're going!
I'll go join the fight!

628
01:18:49,064 --> 01:18:54,559
Yin and Yang, push and pull.

629
01:18:55,403 --> 01:19:00,170
May I introduce you to the mysterious
Ocean and Moon Spirits?

630
01:19:16,825 --> 01:19:19,885
why do Spirits take the form
of such benign things?

631
01:19:20,028 --> 01:19:22,929
It leaves them so vulnerable.

632
01:19:23,064 --> 01:19:24,656
To teach man kindness and humility.

633
01:19:26,701 --> 01:19:28,669
Commander Zhao,

634
01:19:28,803 --> 01:19:32,466
There are certain things
humankind should not tamper with.

635
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,939
The Spirits and the Spirit world
is one of them.

636
01:19:37,412 --> 01:19:39,175
What are you doing here?

637
01:19:39,314 --> 01:19:40,941
Stop, Zhao.

638
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:45,215
The world will go out of balance.
Everyone will be hurt.

639
01:19:46,955 --> 01:19:51,324
The Fire Nation is too powerful

640
01:19:51,459 --> 01:19:55,293
To worry about children's superstitions,
General Iroh.

641
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:59,227
Commander Zhao, don't.

642
01:20:07,809 --> 01:20:09,572
We are now the gods!

643
01:20:10,478 --> 01:20:11,809
No!

644
01:20:27,829 --> 01:20:30,263
Man all battle stations!

645
01:20:35,837 --> 01:20:38,397
You are too soft, General Iroh.

646
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:55,681
He's making fire out of nothing!

647
01:21:21,049 --> 01:21:22,880
They're breaching the wall!

648
01:21:24,252 --> 01:21:26,015
To the front!

649
01:21:46,507 --> 01:21:50,910
As the Avatar,
you are not meant to hurt others.

650
01:21:51,813 --> 01:21:54,907
You must show them
the power of Water.

651
01:21:59,087 --> 01:22:00,884
All is lost.

652
01:22:02,323 --> 01:22:04,757
You have been anointed
by the Moon Spirit.

653
01:22:05,493 --> 01:22:10,226
- He gave me life when I was a child.
- Then there is still a chance.

654
01:22:11,266 --> 01:22:13,666
You can give your life
back for the Spirit's.

655
01:22:14,269 --> 01:22:18,569
- Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
- Nothing is ever truly lost.

656
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:27,209
- Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
- There are reasons each of us are born.

657
01:22:28,116 --> 01:22:30,380
We have to find those reasons.

658
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:43,794
- This was the reason I was born.
- Yue, please.

659
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:47,931
There is no love without sacrifice.

660
01:22:48,069 --> 01:22:50,936
Yue, What are you doing?
You don't know What will happen.

661
01:22:51,072 --> 01:22:54,508
I believe my life force will leave my
body and return to the Moon Spirit.

662
01:22:54,642 --> 01:22:55,666
And then What?

663
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:58,335
My soul will no longer exist
in this form.

664
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,607
Please don't do this.
There must be another way.

665
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:04,183
I can't let you do this.
I'm supposed to protect you.

666
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:06,446
My people are dying, Sokka.

667
01:23:06,587 --> 01:23:09,351
Those who are in charge of others
have a responsibility.

668
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:12,220
It is time we show the Fire Nation
we believe in our beliefs

669
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,351
- As much as they believe in theirs.
- But Yue...

670
01:23:14,495 --> 01:23:18,659
I'm scared.
Don't make me any more scared.

671
01:23:20,668 --> 01:23:23,660
I will miss you more than you know.

672
01:25:01,102 --> 01:25:02,296
I killed you.

673
01:25:04,505 --> 01:25:06,564
Come away from him, nephew.

674
01:25:08,242 --> 01:25:10,301
There are too many soldiers now.

675
01:25:10,445 --> 01:25:13,209
They will never
let you take the Avatar.

676
01:25:14,182 --> 01:25:16,480
We must leave immediately.

677
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:19,884
He wants to fight you
so he can capture you, Zuko.

678
01:25:20,855 --> 01:25:22,345
Walk away!

679
01:25:25,259 --> 01:25:26,453
Come!

680
01:25:58,559 --> 01:26:00,049
You stand alone.

681
01:26:00,962 --> 01:26:03,760
And that has always
been your great mistake.

682
01:28:01,616 --> 01:28:04,346
Water teaches us acceptance.

683
01:28:05,019 --> 01:28:09,547
Let your emotions flow like Water.

684
01:32:13,934 --> 01:32:15,265
Aang?

685
01:33:17,665 --> 01:33:20,327
They want you to be their Avatar, Aang.

686
01:33:24,838 --> 01:33:26,328
We all do.

687
01:34:02,876 --> 01:34:06,573
Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe
have failed to take the city.

688
01:34:06,714 --> 01:34:09,581
General Zhao was killed in battle
and my brother has become a traitor.

689
01:34:09,717 --> 01:34:11,912
My son's proven himself a failure.

690
01:34:13,387 --> 01:34:18,654
Now, Sozin's Comet
is returning in three years.

691
01:34:18,792 --> 01:34:22,421
It will give all Firebenders the ability
of the highest Firebenders,

692
01:34:22,563 --> 01:34:27,432
The ability to use their own Chi
to create Fire.

693
01:34:27,568 --> 01:34:31,766
That is the day we will win this war

694
01:34:31,905 --> 01:34:34,738
And prove the Fire Nation's dominance.

695
01:34:35,309 --> 01:34:39,939
Now you must stop the Avatar
from mastering Earth and Fire.

696
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,072
You must give us the time
to get to that day.

697
01:34:44,084 --> 01:34:48,043
Do you accept this
unspeakably important task

698
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:49,314
I'm putting in your hands?

699
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:57,920
I do, Father.
