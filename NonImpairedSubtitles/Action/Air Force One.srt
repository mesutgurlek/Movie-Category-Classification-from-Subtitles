00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,981
Check. Head count.
Head count. Two. Three.

00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,516
Four. Five.

00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,018
Six.

5
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,620
Demo set.

6
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,022
Let's move.

7
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,736
Clear.

8
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,857
Low Boy, this is Black Cat.

9
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,693
ETA Romeo, L-Z-one-niner.

10
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,361
We are hot. Copy.

11
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,167
Come on. Get out there!
Go, go!

12
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,103
Come on.

13
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,009
Get in!

14
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,181
Cover! I'm on the roof!

15
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,420
Go!

16
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,399
This is Low Boy.
Package is wrapped.

17
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,217
Ladies and gentlemen...

18
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:55,255
three weeks ago,
Russian and American special forces...

19
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,292
apprehended the self-proclaimed leader
of Kazakhstan...

20
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,694
General Ivan Radek.

21
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:08,268
The forces of Radek were directed
toward the suppression of democracy.

22
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,739
His nuclear arsenal
could have brought the world...

23
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,842
into a new cold war.

24
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,612
But thanks to the support of one
of the world's greatest leaders...

25
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,015
Radek is now in prison.

26
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,223
Today we are honoring this brave man.

27
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend...

28
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,497
the president of the United States
of America.

29
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:55,148
The dead remember our indifference.

30
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,551
The dead remember our silence.

31
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,020
I came here tonight
to be congratulated.

32
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,557
But today when I visited
the Red Cross camps...

33
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,994
overwhelmed by the flood of refugees...

34
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,463
fleeing from the horror
of Kazakhstan...

35
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,201
I realized I don't deserve
to be congratulated, none of us do.

36
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,637
- What's he doing?
- That's not the speech.

37
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,138
The truth is...

38
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,574
we acted too late.

39
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:25,212
Only when our own national security
was threatened did we act.

40
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:31,318
Radek's regime murdered over 200,000
men, women and children...

41
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,320
and we watched it on TV.

42
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,523
We let it happen.
People were being slaughtered...

43
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,859
for over a year.

44
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:43,764
We issued economic sanctions and hid
behind the rhetoric of diplomacy.

45
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,265
How dare we?

46
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,568
The dead remember.

47
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,069
Real peace...

48
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:54,041
is not just the absence of conflict,
it's the presence of justice.

49
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,612
Tonight I come to you with a pledge
to change America's policy.

50
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,881
Never again...

51
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:04,651
will I allow
our political self-interest...

52
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,921
to deter us from doing what we know
to be morally right.

53
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,458
Atrocity and terror
are not political weapons.

54
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,460
And to those who would use them...

55
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,197
your day is over.

56
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,734
We will never negotiate.

57
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:26,473
We will no longer tolerate
and we will no longer be afraid.

58
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,645
It's your turn to be afraid.

59
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,116
The Russian was a nice touch.

60
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,552
Tell my mother.
She wanted me to study French.

61
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:16,490
- Do you know what you committed us to?
- I know exactly what I committed us to.

62
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,132
Gentlemen,
welcome to "Air Force One."

63
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,801
Please present your equipment
for inspection.

64
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,270
We were just inspected at the gate.

65
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,773
This plane carries the president
of the United States.

66
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,775
I understand. I'm terribly sorry.

67
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,379
Please place your thumb
on the I.D. pad.

68
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,857
Access cleared.

69
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,209
Hello. I'm Melanie Mitchell,
deputy press secretary.

70
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,645
- I'll be taking you in from here.
- Oh, Miss Mitchell.

71
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,014
It is so nice to finally meet you
in person.

72
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,383
The president and I were delighted
we could accommodate your news crew.

73
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,752
So, if you boys are all cleared?

74
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:23,223
The president's on a very tight schedule
so this is how it works.

75
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,225
During the flight,
two members of your crew...

76
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,494
will be allowed outside the press area
for filming.

77
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,697
You'll get exactly 10 minutes
with the president, 20 with the crew.

78
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,840
Gary, the president is ready
to take Congress on.

79
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,642
He's not gonna kiss their ass
for each vote.

80
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,078
Let them vote us down
and stand on their record.

81
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,481
Yeah, I'm with him now.
I'll call you from the plane.

82
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:50,951
- What did they say about the speech?
- Your speech is leading the news.

83
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,953
They're calling it
the "Be Afraid" speech.

84
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,454
Good.

85
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,623
With all due respect,
next time you want to make...

86
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,692
a major policy departure,
you might want to discuss it...

87
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,561
with your national security advisor
first.

88
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,398
- We did discuss it, Jack.
- We discussed it...

89
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,867
in private, which is where I thought
it would remain.

90
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,870
Now it's public.
Now it's policy.

91
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,639
Get behind it.

92
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,509
The allies are going to be very upset
they weren't consulted about this.

93
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,811
It might come back and bite us
in the ass in November.

94
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,280
It's the right thing to do.

95
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,782
You know it.

96
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,586
There goes the neighborhood.

97
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,423
If you'd like,
we have time for a quick tour.

98
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,458
- We'd be delighted.
- Good.

99
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,193
Andrei, Boris.

100
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,895
Follow me.

101
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:38,298
Ahead of this staff cabin
is Secret Service. Right here.

102
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,069
Never try to go past them without
an escort or you'll be very sorry.

103
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,304
- Hello.
- Hi.

104
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,940
Thanks for the warning.

105
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,243
Here we have
our in-flight offices.

106
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,404
A lot of the plane's features
are classified.

107
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,840
But I can tell you
it's bullet-resistant...

108
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:23,544
and it's even protected against
the pulse of a nuclear blast.

109
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,746
I'm not sure that's very comforting.

110
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:31,118
Upstairs is the cockpit along with the
most advanced communications center...

111
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,787
on or above the face of the earth.

112
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,689
We could run the whole country
from here.

113
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,858
Or even a war if we had to.

114
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,861
Just last week, the president called
the shuttle astronauts from there.

115
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,198
The president's arriving.
They should take their seats.

116
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,699
Right away.

117
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,402
I'll get out of here and let you all
get some sleep.

118
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:06,320
- Mr. President, welcome aboard.
- Hey, Danny. How are you?

119
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,821
Mr. President!

120
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:12,626
Change in plan, Danny.
Let's go to Barbados.

121
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,561
Anything you want.
You're the president.

122
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,230
Boy, I wish.

123
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,565
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Gibbs, where's my bunch?

124
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,868
Ballet ran late.
They'll be here in five minutes.

125
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,071
- Lewis, you tape the game?
- It was a real squeaker, sir.

126
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,441
Don't brief me on it.
I wanted to watch it, for Christ's sake.

127
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,277
We'll be underway
in about 30 minutes, sir.

128
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,312
Mr. President.

129
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,848
Could you put the game on now?
Yeah, Jack?

130
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,050
The lraqis have mobilized
two armored brigades toward--

131
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:40,554
Just got it. Give me 15 minutes.
Get the guys together.

132
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,891
"Repel them.
Make them relinquish the ball."

133
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,827
- Did you hear about Notre Dame?
- Don't. Don't tell me the score.

134
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,762
- Great game.
- Mr. President.

135
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,265
We need to strategize,
smooth some things out politically.

136
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,267
- What was that?
- It's not so important.

137
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,802
- Damage control. What if--
- Give me a minute alone.

138
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,338
What it a "high-ranking
White House official"--

139
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,340
Just give me a few moments alone.

140
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,343
A "high-ranking official" were
to quality what you said last night?

141
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,812
Drop it. Do yourself a favor.

142
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,581
It's policy.
Drop it.

143
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,684
- Or find another ride home. Yeah?
- The Russian news crew's with us.

144
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:13,220
I told them you'd give them a sound bite
about life in the White House.

145
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,055
There is no life in the White House.

146
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,425
You said it.
The president needs some time alone.

147
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,162
14-13 Michigan!

148
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,565
All right, Mr. President!

149
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,237
That wasn't you napping
during the performance, was it, Tom?

150
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,773
No, ma'am. It was very enjoyable.

151
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,076
Alice, you can finish it on the plane.
Let's not keep your father waiting.

152
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,379
Try and smile, sweetheart. Okay?

153
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,016
- Alice, one picture, please!
- Thank you very much.

154
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,495
Great, something from Tom.

155
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,497
Shh. Daddy's asleep.

156
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,135
How was the ballet?

157
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,605
It was great!

158
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,610
You trying to kill me?
Was it really good? Did you enjoy it?

159
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,513
Did you love it? Men in tights?
Did you hear my speech?

160
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,615
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

161
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:18,085
- You're gonna get yourself reelected.
- That's what I keep telling them.

162
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,760
This is the aircraft commander.
We'll take to the runway in a moment.

163
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,863
- Are you guys comfortable?
- Yes, very.

164
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,933
- I brought you V.I.P. press kits.
- Thank you.

165
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,468
You're welcome.

166
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,583
Pass interference.
That's cheating.

167
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,619
- Only if they get caught.
- Dad!

168
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,655
The way of the world, kiddo.

169
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,063
Why didn't you take me with you
when you went to the refugee camp today?

170
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,002
For one thing,
it's not 100 percent secure.

171
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:16,410
You've got your whole life to live.
You don't need to see that stuff.

172
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,314
Come on, Dad. It's not like
I don't see it on the news.

173
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,349
It's different on the news.

174
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:26,186
All I'm saying is I'm ready for things
you don't think I'm ready for.

175
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,355
Maybe I'm not ready.

176
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,525
I'm 12 years old, Dad!
In the caveman days...

177
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,894
I'd be having children of my own.

178
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,965
That's what we call progress. You're
missing the best part of the game.

179
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,601
God!

180
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,973
We're so looking forward to seeing you.

181
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,211
- She is so anxious to grow up.
- I know. She's--

182
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,447
Yes, the both of us.

183
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,616
Okay. Bye, bye.

184
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:00,888
Well, she couldn't stay
your little girl forever, Jim.

185
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:04,458
I was hoping it would last
till she was 14 or 15.

186
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,227
Or 50.

187
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,732
They hated your speech, didn't they?

188
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:14,301
They're afraid we won't have the guts
to back it up.

189
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,337
And, then, if we do,
it'll be political suicide.

190
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,007
Remember our first campaign?

191
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,042
- In the House?
- Yeah.

192
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,512
- Downstate, driving around with--
- Who was that kid, our volunteer?

193
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,048
- Henry.
- Henry with the convertible.

194
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,717
- With the broken top.
- And the snow coming in.

195
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,921
We were the only three people
who thought you could win that.

196
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:37,591
You didn't give a damn. You knew
what needed to be done and you did it.

197
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,795
And you spoke from your heart.
That's what I heard tonight.

198
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,633
Well, it felt good.

199
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,070
I'll bet it did.

200
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:01,014
Sorry to interrupt.
Everybody's assembled, sir.

201
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:08,288
United States "Air Force One. "

202
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:12,693
It is an honor to clear you
for immediate takeoff on runway 2-5.

203
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,928
"Air Force One" cleared for takeoff.

204
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,064
Thank you for your hospitality, Moscow.

205
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,554
In Moscow tonight,
President Marshall defended...

206
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,956
the military action
against the Radek regime...

207
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:19,426
an act the administration had
been calling a one-time intervention.

208
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,428
But in a rare display of emotion...

209
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:25,265
the president alluded to a change
in U.S. foreign policy when he stated...

210
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,802
that America will no longer tolerate
any terrorist government.

211
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:32,906
Meanwhile in Kazakhstan, Radek's ouster
stalled the neo-communist revolution.

212
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,776
These are two of Saddam Hussein's
Republican Guard brigades...

213
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,878
that have been moved north.

214
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:39,847
He knows we're watching,
knows we'll retaliate.

215
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,182
Why the hell is he sending tanks
to the border?

216
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:45,052
Could be a response to your speech,
Mr. President.

217
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:47,187
- Maybe he's got a son-in-law up there.
- Very funny.

218
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,890
I think there's one or two
he hasn't shot yet.

219
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,959
What does State have to say?

220
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,194
The lraqi ambassador is claiming
it's just an exercise.

221
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,031
Let's not waste more time.
Send the "Nimitz" back in.

222
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,038
- Gibbs.
- Guys.

223
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,383
- Sleeping on the job?
- No, sir.

224
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,100
Hey, guys...

225
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:37,204
these are the advance team reports
from the Miami field agent.

226
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:39,473
- Take a look at them.
- Thank you.

227
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:32,626
Smoke.
There's smoke!

228
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:40,033
Steward, there's smoke in the cabin.

229
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:44,138
Everybody move to the back of the plane.
Now! Please!

230
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:46,807
Smoke! Notify the cockpit!

231
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,822
Mr. President, stay back.

232
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,728
Everybody down !

233
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:22,109
Code red! We have a code red!
I repeat. Shots tired on board.

234
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:25,078
Code red acknowledged.
Lock that door now.

235
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,414
Flight control, this is "Air Force One"
declaring emergency.

236
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,717
Cover us!

237
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,286
Stay back.

238
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:36,757
Move up!
I'll cover you.

239
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,959
Go! Go!

240
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,795
- What's going on?
- Shots fired, sir.

241
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,598
- What about my family?
- We're handling it, sir.

242
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:47,034
Boy Scout coming out!
Cover!

243
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,869
- Give us cover!
- Daddy?

244
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:50,404
Alice, get back!

245
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:54,475
Alice, get down !

246
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,110
- Take him around here.
- Get down.

247
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:58,579
This is "Air Force One."

248
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:01,315
We are code red.
Shots tired on board.

249
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,218
Request emergency assistance.
ETA 15 minutes.

250
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:08,055
Acknowledged. We are scrambling
our fighters. Emergency equipment...

251
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,190
will be standing by.

252
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,935
Get him to the escape pod!

253
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:23,804
Boy Scout is headed to the vault.

254
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:26,740
The football!
The football!

255
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,079
Get him around here.

256
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,848
Get him down to the pod!

257
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,451
Don't move!

258
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,992
- They're on us.
- Where's my family?

259
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,528
- Get in the pod, sir. Get in!
- What about my family?

260
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:58,739
"Air Force One," landing runway 0-9.
I repeat, runway 0-9.

261
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:02,376
Roger. Turning to heading 1-8-5.
Descending to 5,000 feet.

262
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,909
Ramstein, this is "Air Force One."

263
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:39,713
Emergency pod has been deployed.
I repeat.

264
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,483
- The emergency pod has been deployed.
- Ramstein tower, acknowledge.

265
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,252
We are picking up the homing beacon
and deploying search and rescue.

266
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,461
- Is the locking ready to look at?
- Just about, sir.

267
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,030
- Has General Northwood arrived?
- Yes, he has.

268
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,768
- Give me an update.
- Madam Vice President, this way.

269
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,238
- We'll avoid the press.
- Is the president secure?

270
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:06,406
Not yet. The recovery team
will have him very soon.

271
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,288
"Air Force One"...

272
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:23,757
this is Halo Flight Lead;
you are under escort.

273
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:27,194
All airspace has been cleared.
Alert force has been mobilized.

274
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:29,229
- Is everyone here?
- We're working on it.

275
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:32,132
How did this happen?
How did they get "Air Force One"?

276
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,501
Gentlemen. Mr. Secretary.

277
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,539
Ramstein tower, we are at ten mile--

278
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,874
Final coming in red-hot.

279
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:45,479
Roger, "Air Force One." Wind is
0-niner-0 at 1-2. You are clear to land.

280
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,027
Get down! Now!

281
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,167
Open the door!

282
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,948
Open!
Open the door!

283
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:24,351
No matter what happens, we land
this aircraft. Is that understood?

284
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,122
Come on. Flaps 30.

285
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,991
Flaps 30.

286
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,458
- No!
- Get the fuck in the air!

287
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,698
Now!
Take this plane up!

288
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,135
Up! Up!

289
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:19,673
- Get us back in the air now!
- Artie!

290
00:27:21,608 --> 00:27:23,744
Take it up!

291
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:26,713
Get this plane back in the air now
or you die.

292
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:30,584
Get up now!

293
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:01,381
No! Jesus!

294
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:09,616
Contact those F-15s.

295
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:12,786
I want them to keep "Air Force One"
in visual contact.

296
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:15,923
- What are our airborne scenarios?
- There are no airborne scenarios.

297
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:19,693
Then we'd better start generating them.
They better be good and better work.

298
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,695
How long can they stay up there
with the fuel they have?

299
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,298
- That's a question of airspeed, wind.
- Altitude.

300
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:28,001
We need an "Air Force One" pilot. Any
educated guesses where they might go?

301
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:31,271
- Iraq, Libya, Algeria.
- Those are guesses, but not educated.

302
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:33,607
Notify our allies.
We'll need secure airspace.

303
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:35,609
- Can we keep that under wraps?
- We'll do our best.

304
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:39,379
Try and relax, Kathryn.
I'm in charge here.

305
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,149
I don't know.
It seems to me they're in charge.

306
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,502
- Don't hurt me.
- Go.

307
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:03,003
Go.

308
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:33,667
Moscow police found six members
of a Russian TV news crew murdered.

309
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:36,770
The same crew that was cleared to fly
on "Air Force One."

310
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:39,506
Tell me it's not that easy.

311
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:42,276
No. You would have to generate
fake I.D., photos.

312
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,611
- Fingerprints.
- Could be with help from Moscow.

313
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,413
How would they get weapons on board?

314
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,283
There's no way to get weapons on board
"Air Force One." It's impossible.

315
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,753
There are enough weapons on board to
take Panama, but who has access to them?

316
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,588
You think someone on the plane
helped them?

317
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:57,391
What it somebody did
and they're still on the plane?

318
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,527
Who do they trust up there?
Who do we trust?

319
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:05,699
Madam Vice President,
Mr. Secretary.

320
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:08,135
All compromised nuclear launch codes
have been cancelled.

321
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,170
New codes are active.

322
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,608
Ramstein, the president's escape pod
has been located.

323
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:17,244
We're honing in at 2-8-5 degrees.

324
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:24,585
There it is.
Ramstein, we have a strong signal.

325
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,222
ETA, two minutes.

326
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,399
Where is the wife and daughter?

327
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:54,081
Where is my husband?

328
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,287
He had fled.
The coward chose to save himself.

329
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:06,527
But one can always
strike a bargain.

330
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:10,164
You listen to me.

331
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,600
I don't know who you are
or what you want...

332
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,236
but you will never get it.

333
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,640
He will not negotiate.

334
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,843
Really?

335
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,680
His wife. His daughter.

336
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:31,118
A man could not live with himself.

337
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:35,289
And it would be such bad politics.

338
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:44,131
I think he'll negotiate.

339
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:58,212
The escape pod is visually acquired.

340
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:01,415
Location of Ramstein is 2-8-4 degrees.

341
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,484
Twelve miles out.

342
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:03,737
It's "Air Force One."
They want to talk to the vice president.

343
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:16,917
Hello. Can you hear me

344
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:22,156
This is the vice president
of the United States.

345
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:25,259
To whom am I speaking

346
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,328
This is the person who controls
"Air Force One. "

347
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:32,032
The world's most secure aircraft.

348
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,536
What is it that you want?

349
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:38,272
We'll get to that.

350
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:43,110
- I want to speak to the First Lady.
- No.

351
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,214
- No. Why
- I need to know they're sate.

352
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,683
The president is safe.

353
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:51,885
But then you must know that.

354
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:55,589
He ran from here like a whipped dog.

355
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:58,859
I'm sure you can't wait for him
to get back to making the decisions...

356
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:03,864
so you can stop sweating
through that silk blouse of yours.

357
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,904
What is the condition
of the people on board?

358
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,639
Some are dead.

359
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,210
What are your intentions?

360
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:21,315
What arrogance to think
you could ever understand my intentions.

361
00:36:21,381 --> 00:36:24,818
I want to understand
what it is that you want.

362
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:26,920
What do I want?

363
00:36:27,988 --> 00:36:32,626
When Mother Russia becomes
one great nation again...

364
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:37,197
when the capitalists are dragged
from the Kremlin...

365
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:40,300
and shot in the street...

366
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:46,273
when our enemies run and hide in fear
at the mention of our name...

367
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,044
and America begs our forgiveness...

368
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:55,482
on that great day of deliverance...

369
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:58,018
you will know what I want.

370
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,189
We can give you a forum
for your grievances.

371
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:04,591
We can contact the Russian government.

372
00:37:04,658 --> 00:37:07,327
But you must understand
that it will take some time.

373
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,464
Really
When you talk to the president...

374
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:14,701
you might remind him that I am holding
his wife, his daughter...

375
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:17,404
his chief of staff,
his national security advisor...

376
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:21,241
his classified papers
and his baseball glove.

377
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:27,714
It he wants them back, he will prevail
upon the puppet regime in Moscow...

378
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:30,884
to release General Radek.

379
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:32,886
Fifty for one.

380
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:35,622
It's a good deal.

381
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:37,124
How's your blouse?

382
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:43,997
What assurances do I have
that you'll keep your word?

383
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,668
I'll wait for confirmation that
General Radek has been released.

384
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,404
Until then...

385
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:55,509
I will execute a hostage
every half an hour.

386
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:00,214
You have my word.

387
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:06,253
You must understand that we--
Hello?

388
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,754
They're off!

389
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:13,293
Damn it!
Nobody does this...

390
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,262
to the United States.

391
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:18,932
The president will get back his glove
and play catch with this guy's balls.

392
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:21,802
We can't do anything in half an hour.
We need more time.

393
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:25,272
He's a zealot. Tough to negotiate with.
All you can do is wear them down.

394
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:26,773
Mr. Secretary!

395
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:38,051
We found the escape pod.

396
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:39,553
It's empty.

397
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,759
So where's the president?

398
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,566
I think we have to acknowledge
the possibility...

399
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:56,303
that the president
may be dead.

400
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:01,175
Why wouldn't they tell us?

401
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:06,480
Diversion.
Try to buy some time.

402
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:09,249
It could have happened in a cross fire,
and they're afraid we'll retaliate.

403
00:39:09,316 --> 00:39:12,719
Damn right, we'll retaliate.
We'll release Radek into the atmosphere.

404
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:16,924
It doesn't add up. That terrorist knew
we'd recover the pod in short order.

405
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,059
He expected that we'd be talking
to Marshall.

406
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:22,663
Let's not bury him yet.
He could still be alive in that plane.

407
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:25,399
Let's not forget this president
is a Medal of Honor winner.

408
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:29,236
In Vietnam, he flew more helicopter
missions than any man in my command.

409
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:31,238
He knows how to fight.

410
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:33,707
Then he's taking a terrible chance
with his life.

411
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:37,511
The element of surprise
is a formidable advantage in combat.

412
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:40,481
If he's up there,
he's the best chance that we have.

413
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:43,150
That pod was designed
for a reason, General.

414
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:46,086
He has no right to take chances
with his life.

415
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:52,913
What does the psych profile say?
How far will he go?

416
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,917
He's a Radek loyalist. That tells us
all we need to know, doesn't it?

417
00:41:56,984 --> 00:42:00,087
He'll see this thing through
to the last hostage or his own death.

418
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:02,890
Release this bastard
and Central Asia will go up in flames!

419
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:04,224
I'm aware of that.

420
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:07,628
Bring back the old Soviet empire
under a flag of genocide?

421
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:09,830
Radek with a nuclear arsenal?

422
00:42:10,964 --> 00:42:13,066
I hate to say this,
but 50 people...

423
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:15,869
is a small price to pay
to stop that from happening.

424
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,571
Even if one of them is the president?

425
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:21,041
The presidency is bigger than any man.
Didn't they teach you that at Yale?

426
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:24,545
Can't we release him today
and pick up the pieces tomorrow?

427
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:26,313
We caught him before,
we'll catch him again.

428
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,782
If Petrov releases Radek,
his government will fall.

429
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:32,152
I promise you that.
Then who's gonna stand up to Radek?

430
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,488
You go to catch him again,
you'll find him in Moscow.

431
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:39,393
With respect, Mr. Secretary, we don't
need more dramatics, we need options.

432
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,395
- It's not an option.
- We need a decision.

433
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:43,330
It's not her decision.

434
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:46,033
This is a military situation.
I'm the secretary of defense.

435
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,903
Check your regs. In the absence
of the president, the buck stops here.

436
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,139
Get the attorney general
with a copy of the Constitution.

437
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:55,442
We have-- Oh, my God!
Nineteen minutes.

438
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,480
I'm going to consult
with President Petrov.

439
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:19,473
Madam Vice President, I'm sorry.
I cannot release him.

440
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,974
We would train...

441
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:24,011
all our military might
against this one target.

442
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:26,180
- He wouldn't stay at large for long.
- Maybe so.

443
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:28,549
But millions of lives
are hanging in the balance.

444
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:30,551
I am trying to save a nation!

445
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:32,052
As am l.

446
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,056
No nation can survive the loss,
nor soon replace, a great leader.

447
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:39,059
Let us be pragmatic.
Fifty lives means nothing...

448
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:40,561
in the grand scheme.

449
00:47:40,627 --> 00:47:42,396
Let me be equally pragmatic.

450
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:45,098
Our president took a great risk
to come to your aid...

451
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,901
against strong opposition
in both parties and among our allies.

452
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:50,270
It would be politically impossible
to do so again.

453
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:53,407
If it meant saving his life,
I would gladly do it.

454
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:55,442
But I would have to know for sure.

455
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:57,811
And you cannot tell me he's alive,
can you?

456
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,948
No, Mr. President, I cannot.

457
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:05,285
Then there is nothing I can do.
I am truly sorry. Good-ye.

458
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:10,824
Okay, Walter,
you and your generals get to work.

459
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,641
Okay, they can't keep the plane
in the air indefinitely.

460
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:03,143
There are only four possible
landing sites in Kazakhstan...

461
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,145
that are still controlled
by Radek's forces.

462
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:08,315
We have to go in and take all of them.
Can we do it?

463
00:49:08,415 --> 00:49:10,384
I'd rather take my chances in the air.

464
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:12,920
I just looked at the airborne scenarios.
They're no good.

465
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:16,924
- Can we do this?
- In the time we have? Messy.

466
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,560
Three more minutes
before they execute the first hostage.

467
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,595
You'll have to buy us more time.

468
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:23,096
All right.

469
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,870
You both, come here.

470
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:08,142
Now!

471
00:50:23,557 --> 00:50:26,026
They will transfer the call here.

472
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:29,663
So...

473
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:32,499
Let's just wait.

474
00:50:38,405 --> 00:50:39,640
Excuse me.

475
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:45,512
Sir, if you will permit me,
I am the national security advisor.

476
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:47,514
I'm the man the president
would be listening to.

477
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:50,818
I believe you are negotiating right now
with the vice president.

478
00:50:50,918 --> 00:50:54,555
In our system, the vice president
is like the queen of England.

479
00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:56,890
She can't even get airline tickets
without talking...

480
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,794
to somebody like me; therefore,
let me speak to the White House.

481
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:05,099
I promise you, I'm the one person
who can make this all work out.

482
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:13,107
Has he been released?

483
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:17,411
I've contacted the Russian government.
We've set things in motion.

484
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:19,613
But at this point,
we have to be realistic.

485
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:21,648
It's going to take more time.

486
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:24,051
More time?

487
00:51:30,224 --> 00:51:34,228
Your national security advisor
has just been executed.

488
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:36,230
He's a very good negotiator.

489
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,767
He bought you another half hour.

490
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:51,578
Mrs. Marshall.

491
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,515
Alice.

492
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,718
If you please, come with me.

493
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:38,792
That's the first time
you ever seen a man killed, huh?

494
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:40,794
Leave her alone.

495
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:45,132
You think I'm a monster?

496
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,267
That I would kill this man?

497
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,770
Somebody's son?

498
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:53,273
Somebody's father?

499
00:52:54,808 --> 00:52:57,144
I am somebody's son, too.

500
00:52:58,312 --> 00:53:01,014
I have three small children.

501
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:04,384
Does that surprise you?

502
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:10,324
- Tell her to answer.
- Leave her alone!

503
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,658
Shut up!

504
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:19,199
Why did you kill him?

505
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:22,236
Because I believe.

506
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:28,175
And when I shoot this man,
I know in that instant...

507
00:53:28,242 --> 00:53:31,411
how deep was my belief.

508
00:53:31,478 --> 00:53:34,615
That I would turn my back
on God Himself...

509
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:38,819
for Mother Russia.

510
00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:41,755
My doubts, my fears.

511
00:53:41,822 --> 00:53:44,591
My own private morality.

512
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,395
It dissolve in this moment...

513
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:51,899
for this love.

514
00:53:55,102 --> 00:53:57,738
You know, your father,
he has also killed.

515
00:53:58,939 --> 00:54:02,075
- Is he a bad man?
- That's not true.

516
00:54:02,142 --> 00:54:04,044
Why?

517
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:09,416
Because he does it in a tuxedo
with a telephone call and a smart bomb?

518
00:54:10,984 --> 00:54:13,587
You are a monster.

519
00:54:13,654 --> 00:54:16,089
And my father is a great man.

520
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:19,893
You're nothing like my father.

521
00:54:47,688 --> 00:54:49,656
What's the goddamn number?

522
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:58,899
- What city please?
- Washington D.C., the White House.

523
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:02,503
- Just a moment. Here's the number.
- Can you connect me to that number?

524
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:05,172
- There's a connect fee of one dollar.
- Fine.

525
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,489
White House switchboard.
How may I direct your call?

526
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:26,026
All right, listen.
Listen carefully.

527
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:29,363
This is an emergency call from
"Air Force One." This is the president.

528
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,265
Connect me to the vice president.

529
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,200
Who did you say is calling?

530
00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:39,840
- This is the president!
- Right, and I'm the First Lady.

531
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:41,842
Don't cut me off.
This is an emergency.

532
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:46,113
The president doesn't call this
particular number, so whoever you are--

533
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,348
Trace the call.

534
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:51,318
Follow your standard security procedure.

535
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,888
Trace the goddamn call!

536
00:55:54,955 --> 00:55:59,026
Okay, sir. You want to make
a federal case out of this, fine by me!

537
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:10,204
Hello. Anyone there?

538
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,705
Don't move.

539
00:56:12,606 --> 00:56:15,242
- I traced the call, sir.
- Give me the gun.

540
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,978
- Are you there?
- Slowly.

541
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,880
Oh, my God!

542
00:56:19,947 --> 00:56:22,082
I'll put you right through,
Mr. President.

543
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:30,424
The switchboard has a call from someone
claiming to be the president.

544
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,527
She traced it back to
the White House satellite account.

545
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:35,696
The caller's gone,
but the line is still active.

546
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:37,698
Put it through.

547
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,434
Listen to me.

548
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:43,437
Listen to me.
You know who I am.

549
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:46,673
I'm the president of the United States.

550
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,375
- Yes!
- Quiet!

551
00:56:48,442 --> 00:56:50,377
Don't think that means
I don't shoot you.

552
00:56:50,444 --> 00:56:52,446
Put your hands behind your head
and move.

553
00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:04,091
This is your lucky day.

554
00:57:04,158 --> 00:57:07,127
What more can my people do?
Tell the F-15s to fire at the plane?

555
00:57:07,194 --> 00:57:09,630
Even if they tried, we're equipped
with tactical countermeasures.

556
00:57:09,696 --> 00:57:12,599
- He's talking to us.
- What do you mean?

557
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:16,136
I just want you to feel secure.
That way no one will get hurt.

558
00:57:16,203 --> 00:57:18,872
The computer will fly circles
around any missile they fire at us.

559
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:21,875
- And no hit, just a shock wave.
- He's telling us what to do.

560
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:25,179
Believe me, all that would happen
is that we'd get knocked off our feet.

561
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:26,914
- That's all !
- Shut up!

562
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:31,318
My God! Is he saying
what I think he's saying?

563
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:33,654
-If we're going to act, we must act now.
-It's too risky.

564
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,823
The president is up there
with a gun to his head.

565
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:38,559
He's asking us to do that
to "Air Force One"?

566
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,260
He's not asking.

567
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:44,164
Your commander in chief has issued
a direct order. Do it!

568
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:51,538
Are you sure that's what
you want me to do?

569
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:55,275
You heard me. Let's pray it works
the way it's supposed to.

570
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:57,277
Boys, give me room.

571
00:57:57,344 --> 00:58:00,781
I've been ordered to fire
on "Air Force One. "

572
00:58:13,393 --> 00:58:16,930
I'm in position.
Missiles are armed.

573
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,370
The target is acquired.
I have a good lock.

574
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:27,407
God, I hope this works.
Fox Three.

575
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:25,826
This is Marshall.

576
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:29,229
- Anyone there?
- We're here, Mr. President.

577
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:31,098
Where's my family?
Are they safe?

578
01:00:31,165 --> 01:00:33,600
The terrorists claim they're
holding them. We can't confirm.

579
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:35,102
Who are they?

580
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:37,504
What do they want?

581
01:00:37,571 --> 01:00:40,007
They're Russian ultra nationalist
radicals. They want General Radek...

582
01:00:40,073 --> 01:00:42,209
released from prison.

583
01:00:43,744 --> 01:00:46,346
- What are our tactical options?
- We're working on that.

584
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:50,417
- But the bastards have us in a corner.
- There is no rescue attempt?

585
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:53,854
I ruled out a midair rescue. We can
do nothing while the plane's in the air.

586
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:57,424
We gotta get this plane on the ground.
Take me off the speakerphone.

587
01:00:57,491 --> 01:01:00,360
- Where's Bennett?
- Mr. President.

588
01:01:00,427 --> 01:01:02,496
We cannot release Radek.

589
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:06,100
They're gonna shoot a hostage
every half hour until we do.

590
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,302
I don't want a plane
full of dead people.

591
01:01:10,104 --> 01:01:12,039
They shot Jack Doherty.

592
01:01:13,907 --> 01:01:15,342
Christ!

593
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,446
We can't give in to their demands.
It won't end there.

594
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:22,015
If you die in the plane,
does it end there?

595
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:24,485
We've got a job to do...

596
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:26,520
whatever the cost.

597
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,825
If you give a mouse a cookie--

598
01:01:34,061 --> 01:01:35,996
He'll want a glass of milk.

599
01:01:37,631 --> 01:01:40,067
We gotta get this plane
on the ground.

600
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,362
Get the plane on the ground.

601
01:04:04,878 --> 01:04:07,848
I thought I'd ask you
to come and join us.

602
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:10,884
It is starting to feel
a little empty up here.

603
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:15,122
Sit down. Please.

604
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:23,630
Come.

605
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:41,415
Tell me your name again...

606
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:43,951
for the record.

607
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:45,753
Melanie.

608
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,622
Melanie Mitchell.

609
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:52,059
You travel often...

610
01:04:52,126 --> 01:04:54,561
with the President?

611
01:04:54,628 --> 01:04:55,896
Yes.

612
01:04:55,963 --> 01:05:00,033
So you know everyone on the plane?

613
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:03,270
Yes.

614
01:05:04,705 --> 01:05:07,174
I bet they like you, huh?

615
01:05:07,274 --> 01:05:10,577
You're a nice person, yes?

616
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:17,117
I guess so.

617
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:36,670
You are trembling.

618
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:39,706
Why are you afraid?

619
01:05:40,841 --> 01:05:44,678
Because I don't wanna die.

620
01:05:48,749 --> 01:05:50,117
Tell me...

621
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:53,587
what am I doing at this moment?

622
01:05:54,721 --> 01:05:57,591
You're pointing a gun at me.

623
01:05:58,525 --> 01:06:00,194
Thank you, Melanie.

624
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:04,798
This is to the secret service agent
in the baggage deck.

625
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,302
I will count to ten.

626
01:06:08,402 --> 01:06:12,272
And if you do not surrender,
this nice woman will die.

627
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:15,776
One.

628
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:17,945
- Please don't.
- Two.

629
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:21,215
- Don 't do this!
- Three.

630
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:23,984
- Let me talk to him!
- Four.

631
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,719
- I beg you, please.
- Five.

632
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,955
Let me talk to the agent.

633
01:06:28,055 --> 01:06:30,290
- Six.
- He might listen to me.

634
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:32,593
Seven.

635
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,895
- I beg you, don't do this.
- Eight.

636
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:38,499
- Don't do this, please!
- Nine!

637
01:06:51,612 --> 01:06:53,147
Oh, God.

638
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:02,222
Let's think about that one
for a moment.

639
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:06,059
And then we'll start again.

640
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,228
Next time...

641
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:10,931
I'll choose someone
more important.

642
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:32,886
I know what you are thinking,
First Lady.

643
01:07:34,755 --> 01:07:36,857
You want me dead.

644
01:07:36,957 --> 01:07:40,494
It may come to that.
In a war, people die.

645
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:42,563
This isn't war!

646
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:46,366
You just murdered
an unarmed woman.

647
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:50,804
You, who murdered 100,000 lraqis
to save a nickel on a gallon of gas...

648
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:54,074
are going to lecture me
about the rules of war?

649
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:55,375
Don't!

650
01:07:58,178 --> 01:08:00,080
Mr. President,
how can I help you?

651
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,417
Chief, you can help me
dump some fuel.

652
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:05,886
Who's down there in the baggage deck?

653
01:08:05,986 --> 01:08:08,889
- It's a secret service agent. Who?
- We have no idea.

654
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:11,592
Melanie was shot because one of your men
wouldn't show himself.

655
01:08:11,692 --> 01:08:13,961
- I want to know who he is.
- We'd like to know ourselves.

656
01:08:14,061 --> 01:08:16,997
Sir, it's someone
smart enough to know...

657
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,500
if you're hunting with one bullet,
you wait for a clean shot.

658
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,769
What are you saying?

659
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:25,506
Whoever that is down there,
he may be our only hope.

660
01:08:25,606 --> 01:08:29,777
Our only hope is that Washington
complies with this bastard.

661
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:32,679
Because any minute now
another one of us is dead.

662
01:08:34,248 --> 01:08:35,916
And you know what?

663
01:08:36,984 --> 01:08:39,720
I'm afraid it might be me.

664
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,624
- Sir, do you see the maintenance panel?
- I see it.

665
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:46,460
- Sir, do you see the maintenance panel?
- I see it.

666
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:49,863
Pop it open. There should be
a red switch. Toggle it up.

667
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:52,099
Hang on.

668
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:56,203
We got some indicator lights here.

669
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,273
To dump the fuel, you have to close
the circuit for the pump.

670
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:02,509
There's no switch,
so you'll have to cross the wires.

671
01:09:02,576 --> 01:09:05,846
- Open the fuel control door.
- Hang on.

672
01:09:07,648 --> 01:09:09,983
There should be five of them.

673
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:12,719
- Do you see them, sir?
- I see them. Yeah.

674
01:09:12,786 --> 01:09:16,590
Jesus. There's a lot of goddamn wires.
All right, wait a second.

675
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:18,092
We got five.

676
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:21,328
Green, yellow, red, white and blue.

677
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:22,930
Let me double-check.

678
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:25,065
Come on. For Christ's sake, hurry up.

679
01:09:25,132 --> 01:09:27,935
Get the wrong wire, you'll cut
the engine feeds. The plane will crash.

680
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:31,138
Then we don't want to get
the wrong wire, do we?

681
01:09:31,205 --> 01:09:32,906
Cut the green wire.

682
01:09:37,277 --> 01:09:38,612
Cut.

683
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:43,951
- Then, cross the-- With the--
- With the what?

684
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:47,387
Hello? Cross it with the what?
Say again.

685
01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:50,657
Cross the green wire with the--

686
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:56,230
For Christ's sake!

687
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:59,032
Wait, green...

688
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:00,534
yellow...

689
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:02,636
red, white and blue.

690
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:07,975
I'm counting on you,
red, white and blue.

691
01:10:26,627 --> 01:10:30,364
Sirs, it looks like "Air Force One"
is losing fuel.

692
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:18,639
Madam Vice President, the time has come
for you to demonstrate your good faith.

693
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:21,108
I've been reading through
your press kit.

694
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:26,480
I understand "Air Force One"
is able to refuel in midair.

695
01:12:27,648 --> 01:12:30,417
We need fuel.
And we need it now.

696
01:12:31,385 --> 01:12:34,555
I'm sure we can come
to some sort of arrangement.

697
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:38,158
If you'll land the plane,
we'll trade fuel for hostages.

698
01:12:38,225 --> 01:12:40,227
This is bullshit!

699
01:12:40,294 --> 01:12:44,832
It's simple physics. Without fuel,
the plane crashes. Everybody dies.

700
01:12:44,898 --> 01:12:47,201
We're trying to do everything
that we can.

701
01:12:47,267 --> 01:12:51,538
Tell me what I want to hear, or I will
execute a member of the senior staff...

702
01:12:51,605 --> 01:12:55,576
and continue killing one hostage
every minute...

703
01:12:55,642 --> 01:12:59,613
until the plane crash
or refueling plane arrive!

704
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:05,886
What do you say?

705
01:13:08,021 --> 01:13:09,823
Fuel's on its way.

706
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:11,425
Thank you.

707
01:13:46,059 --> 01:13:47,561
Move.

708
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:08,048
- Jim, what are you doing here?
- I never left.

709
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:16,123
Watch the door.

710
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,724
Where's my family?

711
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:20,060
Another part of the plane.
We haven't seen them.

712
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:22,296
We got weapons now.
We should try to retake the plane.

713
01:14:22,362 --> 01:14:24,598
Not while they've got Grace and Alice.
I can't take that chance.

714
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:27,868
What about trying to disable the plane
and force them to land?

715
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:31,672
I tried. I dumped some fuel.
Now they're gonna refuel us in midair.

716
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:35,642
A refueling tanker?
Jesus! Sir?

717
01:14:35,709 --> 01:14:40,247
- There may be a way to get people off.
- What do you mean?

718
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:43,484
We have emergency parachutes
in the tail cone, but we're too high.

719
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:46,520
If we could get a message
to the refueling tanker...

720
01:14:46,587 --> 01:14:48,756
get him to drop to 15,000 feet,
we could jump.

721
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:51,825
They've disabled the phones.
They control the radios.

722
01:14:51,892 --> 01:14:57,231
- Mr. President? Sir? The fax machines.
- The phone lines are out.

723
01:14:57,297 --> 01:15:01,502
No. Voice lines and faxes are on
two different systems of encryption.

724
01:15:01,568 --> 01:15:04,171
If you disable one,
it'd be easy to overlook the other.

725
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:11,278
If this works, you get to be
postmaster general. Come with me.

726
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,280
- Get these people ready.
- Yes. Remember.

727
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:17,484
15,000 feet and 200 knots.
Otherwise it's suicide.

728
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:19,686
You'll need this.

729
01:15:21,155 --> 01:15:23,223
Good luck, people.

730
01:15:34,234 --> 01:15:36,470
- Where are we sending it?
- Situation Room.

731
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:39,973
It makes me so proud
that you stuck with us.

732
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:44,111
- Thanks.
- Whatever happens.

733
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:14,641
Yes!

734
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:36,130
Madam Vice President,
the attorney general is here.

735
01:16:40,234 --> 01:16:43,971
- Thank you for coming, Andrew.
- Good that you're here.

736
01:16:44,037 --> 01:16:48,208
You want my interpretation of what the
Constitution says about the situation?

737
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:50,711
Yes. Andrew,
my understanding is...

738
01:16:50,778 --> 01:16:54,014
that if the president is out of contact
in a military situation...

739
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:56,817
the secretary of defense
is in charge as second in command.

740
01:16:56,884 --> 01:16:59,453
- Yes, of course.
- Good. Then that settles it.

741
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,488
It doesn't settle it at all.

742
01:17:01,555 --> 01:17:05,893
The president is not merely out
of contact. He is also under duress.

743
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:09,496
His family is held hostage,
possibly himself a hostage.

744
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:14,435
It creates an incapacity to discharge
the office under the 25th amendment.

745
01:17:14,501 --> 01:17:16,770
Surely just as if he'd had a stroke.

746
01:17:16,837 --> 01:17:19,907
I think the president would dispute
that any incapacity exists.

747
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:24,978
It exists if a majority of the cabinet,
including yourself, says it exists.

748
01:17:25,045 --> 01:17:28,982
The president may be alive,
but he may not be the president.

749
01:17:29,049 --> 01:17:31,418
Madam Vice President?
I think you need to see this.

750
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:34,021
This is CNN breaking news.

751
01:17:36,023 --> 01:17:39,760
We interrupt programming to bring you
this breaking news bulletin.

752
01:17:39,827 --> 01:17:43,063
CNN has received
unconfirmed reports...

753
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,599
that "Air Force One" has crashed.

754
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:48,302
- Oh, my God! How did they get that?
- I don't know.

755
01:17:48,368 --> 01:17:51,872
The aircraft was en route from Moscow
when it began its Mayday hail.

756
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:54,208
I repeat.
We have unconfirmed reports...

757
01:17:54,274 --> 01:17:56,210
Call the press room.
We have to issue a statement.

758
01:17:56,276 --> 01:17:59,146
that the president's plane
has crashed in Eastern Europe.

759
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:34,148
- Has "Air Force One" crashed?
- That is a rumor.

760
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:37,785
- Where'd the story come from?
- I don't know where it came from.

761
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:40,954
Listen.
I cannot confirm anything...

762
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:42,990
at this point.

763
01:18:48,295 --> 01:18:51,298
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a statement.

764
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:58,405
The president's plane,
"Air Force One," has been hijacked.

765
01:19:00,941 --> 01:19:02,843
Please.

766
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:05,946
Ladies and gentlemen,
please let me finish.

767
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:08,582
For security reasons,
I cannot divulge...

768
01:19:08,649 --> 01:19:12,119
the identity of the hijackers
or who was on board the plane.

769
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:15,689
But I'm here to assure
the American people...

770
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:19,059
that we are doing everything we can
to resolve the situation.

771
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:23,697
For the safety of all the people
on the plane...

772
01:19:23,764 --> 01:19:27,101
I cannot tell you any more than I have,
and I'm sure you understand that.

773
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:29,002
Is James Marshall still the president?

774
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:32,539
I'm coordinating with
the National Security Council...

775
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:34,742
pending the president's return.

776
01:19:34,808 --> 01:19:36,844
And, yes, James Marshall
is still the president.

777
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:41,515
At this time--

778
01:19:41,582 --> 01:19:46,019
At this time,
I would like to ask all Americans...

779
01:19:49,923 --> 01:19:53,560
to pray for the safety of everyone
on board "Air Force One."

780
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:55,596
Thank you.

781
01:19:58,632 --> 01:20:00,167
The president.

782
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:10,778
Where is the president?

783
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:57,024
Folks, listen up.
This is your main rip cord.

784
01:20:57,091 --> 01:20:59,293
As soon as you clear the plane,
give it a yank.

785
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:02,329
If your chute doesn't open,
this is your reserve chute.

786
01:21:02,429 --> 01:21:04,098
Pull it down. Clear?

787
01:21:26,754 --> 01:21:30,023
"Air Force One," do you read?

788
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:33,060
Yes, we read. Go ahead.

789
01:21:33,127 --> 01:21:35,996
"Air Force One, "
this is "Extender 1-0. "

790
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:39,433
- We have been instructed to refuel you.
- Go ahead.

791
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:43,904
Drop to 15,000 feet
and slow to 200 knots.

792
01:21:43,971 --> 01:21:46,640
Acknowledged. Two hundred.

793
01:21:50,377 --> 01:21:53,480
- They got it!
- They got the fax.

794
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:56,016
Sir, your chute.

795
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:58,886
- Please, sir.
- I'm not leaving without my family.

796
01:22:00,554 --> 01:22:03,690
Okay, "Air Force One,"
you need to open your receptacle door.

797
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:06,727
Pull the yellow lever
on the upper control panel.

798
01:22:07,694 --> 01:22:08,796
Done.

799
01:22:08,896 --> 01:22:11,632
Go ahead and close distance
nice and easy.

800
01:22:15,335 --> 01:22:16,837
Almost there.

801
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:22,376
- Where are your chutes?
- We stay with the president, sir.

802
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:25,679
Thank you.

803
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:35,556
All right, that's close enough.
Here we go!

804
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:44,998
Go! Go!

805
01:22:45,099 --> 01:22:46,700
Go! Come on !

806
01:22:50,003 --> 01:22:52,706
Go! You, come on !

807
01:23:28,242 --> 01:23:30,043
We got...

808
01:23:30,144 --> 01:23:33,614
so far 25 chutes.

809
01:23:55,569 --> 01:23:58,806
- I can't hold her.
- What are you doing?

810
01:23:58,906 --> 01:24:01,375
Break away! Break away!

811
01:24:08,115 --> 01:24:10,451
Sir, take my hand!

812
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:26,033
Everybody, break now!

813
01:24:41,014 --> 01:24:43,283
- Don't move!
- Let me save him!

814
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:46,687
He's the president,
for God's sake!

815
01:24:46,754 --> 01:24:48,822
Go get him!

816
01:24:56,897 --> 01:24:58,832
Grab my hand!

817
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:02,336
Major!

818
01:25:06,407 --> 01:25:08,375
I got you.

819
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:24,291
We've lost the tanker?
What else?

820
01:25:24,358 --> 01:25:27,628
- They're counting 32 survivors.
- That means they still have hostages.

821
01:25:27,694 --> 01:25:29,997
- What about the first family?
- No word yet.

822
01:25:30,064 --> 01:25:32,232
Losing hostages will make
the terrorists more desperate.

823
01:25:32,299 --> 01:25:35,736
Madam Vice President,
we've got "Air Force One" on the line.

824
01:25:35,803 --> 01:25:39,640
This is Vice President Bennett.
We're listening.

825
01:25:39,706 --> 01:25:41,675
I now hold hostage...

826
01:25:41,742 --> 01:25:45,145
the president of the United States
of America.

827
01:25:46,447 --> 01:25:50,284
Soon we shall enter
the sovereign airspace of Kazakhstan.

828
01:25:51,452 --> 01:25:55,622
You will cease your military escort
at the border.

829
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:58,859
If you violate our airspace...

830
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:02,396
I will execute a member
of the first family.

831
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:05,866
Tell our fighters to back off.

832
01:26:08,635 --> 01:26:10,170
Get me Ops.

833
01:26:12,973 --> 01:26:16,810
You said a presidential incapacity
could be declared by a cabinet majority.

834
01:26:16,877 --> 01:26:19,780
- Would you sign it?
- Under the circumstances.

835
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:21,982
See who else would.

836
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:33,293
Move! Come on, move!

837
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:39,600
Fast! Move! Quick! Right here.

838
01:26:44,705 --> 01:26:48,208
- It'll be all right.
- I know.

839
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:12,833
You've been very busy downstairs.

840
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:15,636
Haven't you?

841
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:18,939
Killing my men.

842
01:27:39,059 --> 01:27:41,462
You don't wanna do that.

843
01:27:42,529 --> 01:27:46,033
I'm what you came for.
Don't forget that.

844
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,736
Then I kill them.

845
01:27:48,802 --> 01:27:50,571
Or just one.

846
01:27:50,637 --> 01:27:52,773
You pick.

847
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:56,643
That's what you do in the White House.
You play God.

848
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:06,019
Go ahead.

849
01:28:06,086 --> 01:28:08,021
Which one lives?

850
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:11,892
Go ahead.

851
01:28:20,534 --> 01:28:24,405
You're not here for this.
You want something.

852
01:28:26,373 --> 01:28:28,542
- What is it?
- Radek.

853
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:32,579
- How can I do that? I can't.
- Then you die, the three of you.

854
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:35,249
I'll do anything to save my family.
Don't ask something I can't give!

855
01:28:35,315 --> 01:28:39,453
The most powerful man on the earth.
Suddenly, there are things you can't do.

856
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,690
This is very curious.
Stop with your fucking lies!

857
01:28:54,368 --> 01:28:58,505
- Petrov will never give up Radek.
- Petrov is a dog.

858
01:28:58,572 --> 01:29:01,375
He does what you tell him.

859
01:29:04,712 --> 01:29:07,081
Tell him to do this.

860
01:29:07,147 --> 01:29:12,286
Petrov used me.
I just wanted to stop the bloodshed.

861
01:29:12,352 --> 01:29:15,556
He wanted a personal victory.
Petrov hates Radek.

862
01:29:15,622 --> 01:29:19,493
Of course he hates Radek.
Radek is everything he is not.

863
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,096
A great man, a strong man.

864
01:29:22,162 --> 01:29:24,932
Are you saying...

865
01:29:24,998 --> 01:29:27,067
he would refuse you?

866
01:29:27,134 --> 01:29:31,805
You'd be playing right into his hands.
Are you an idiot?

867
01:29:31,872 --> 01:29:36,710
You'd make him into a hero.
The man who stopped the terrorists.

868
01:29:36,777 --> 01:29:39,613
Or better yet,
the man who stopped me.

869
01:29:41,181 --> 01:29:43,617
You talk as if you have nothing
to do with this.

870
01:29:46,186 --> 01:29:49,523
This is all your doing.

871
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:52,426
This infection you call freedom.

872
01:29:52,493 --> 01:29:54,862
Without meaning, without purpose.

873
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:57,998
You have given my country...

874
01:29:58,065 --> 01:30:00,534
to gangsters and prostitutes.

875
01:30:02,102 --> 01:30:05,806
You have taken everything from us.

876
01:30:09,176 --> 01:30:11,678
There is nothing left.

877
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:21,221
Call him.

878
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:39,840
No! Leave her!

879
01:30:39,907 --> 01:30:41,508
Sit!

880
01:30:41,575 --> 01:30:43,844
- No.
- I have no choice.

881
01:30:46,346 --> 01:30:48,882
- You have the choice.
- Leave her alone. It's between us.

882
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:51,752
You lose a child,
it hollows you out.

883
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:53,754
We're soldiers.

884
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:57,224
You take my life.

885
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:00,227
Have you no honor?

886
01:31:01,095 --> 01:31:03,163
- I'll count to five.
- No!

887
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:05,365
- It's gonna be all right, honey.
- One.

888
01:31:05,432 --> 01:31:07,735
- It's gonna be all right.
- Two.

889
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:10,504
I'll do it.

890
01:31:10,571 --> 01:31:12,039
Yes.

891
01:31:12,106 --> 01:31:14,074
I'll do it.

892
01:31:17,945 --> 01:31:20,514
You just leave my family alone.

893
01:31:27,921 --> 01:31:29,890
Leave 'em alone.

894
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,815
Mr. President!

895
01:31:57,317 --> 01:31:59,386
We just got an intercept.

896
01:31:59,453 --> 01:32:01,922
The president called Petrov
and asked him to release Radek.

897
01:32:03,157 --> 01:32:05,592
- He can't do that!
- He must have no choice.

898
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:08,028
We have a choice.

899
01:32:08,095 --> 01:32:12,566
I have the signatures of the cabinet
attesting to the president's incapacity.

900
01:32:12,633 --> 01:32:16,070
- Sign it and you can overrule him.
- No. I won't do that.

901
01:32:16,136 --> 01:32:19,807
The United States does not negotiate
with terrorists.

902
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:21,809
It's been our principle
for 25 years.

903
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:24,111
You can't give in to them now.

904
01:32:24,178 --> 01:32:27,014
It'll be open season on
the United States. Many more will die.

905
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:34,154
Jim isn't making this decision as
president, but as a husband and father.

906
01:32:37,624 --> 01:32:40,194
History will judge you
by what you do right now.

907
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,329
For God's sake, sign it.

908
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:25,706
I can now confirm that General Radek
is in the process of being released.

909
01:33:25,773 --> 01:33:29,243
I repeat. General Radek
is now being released.

910
01:33:50,798 --> 01:33:54,902
Yes, yes.
General Radek has been released.

911
01:33:59,506 --> 01:34:01,442
It is confirmed.

912
01:34:04,311 --> 01:34:06,714
They are releasing the general.

913
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:09,083
Now what?

914
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:12,119
Now we return to our homeland...

915
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:15,122
where Radek will decide
how best to use you...

916
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:17,291
now that we know you are willing...

917
01:34:17,357 --> 01:34:19,059
to negotiate.

918
01:34:20,327 --> 01:34:22,796
Our nation needs so many things.

919
01:34:22,863 --> 01:34:26,967
- You said you were gonna release us.
- Forgive me. I lied.

920
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:11,245
Listen.

921
01:36:47,741 --> 01:36:50,110
- Sir, are you hit?
- Stay with the major, honey.

922
01:36:50,177 --> 01:36:53,013
- Alice, get in the cockpit.
- Lie down.

923
01:37:23,143 --> 01:37:26,613
- Let her go!
- Not until Radek is safely away.

924
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:30,551
Call it off.
Don't give up Radek.

925
01:37:30,651 --> 01:37:34,722
If anything happens to the general,
your wife will die!

926
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:51,905
You hear that?
It's almost over, Mr. President.

927
01:38:26,106 --> 01:38:27,541
Drop the gun !

928
01:38:39,086 --> 01:38:44,324
You made one mistake when
you killed my pilot, Mr. President.

929
01:38:44,425 --> 01:38:47,528
No one left to fly the plane.

930
01:38:50,831 --> 01:38:53,434
And no parachute.

931
01:38:55,202 --> 01:38:57,671
Whatever happens...

932
01:38:59,073 --> 01:39:01,709
you lose and I win.

933
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:58,065
Get off my plane!

934
01:40:17,618 --> 01:40:19,019
You all right?

935
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:24,058
Go.

936
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:26,760
Go! Call Petrov!

937
01:41:29,156 --> 01:41:31,091
They killed him.

938
01:41:31,158 --> 01:41:32,793
Mr. President.

939
01:41:41,101 --> 01:41:45,439
He almost got away.
Did you hear me? Radek is dead.

940
01:41:45,506 --> 01:41:48,842
Yes! It's the president.
We have retaken the plane!

941
01:41:58,685 --> 01:42:02,723
- How's he doing?
- Not good, sir.

942
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:05,392
- I don't suppose you know how to fly.
- No, sir.

943
01:42:05,459 --> 01:42:08,028
- Come along. I'll need a copilot.
- Yes, sir.

944
01:42:09,596 --> 01:42:11,632
How long since you've flown?

945
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:15,736
Twenty-five years.
Little planes. Never jets.

946
01:42:17,905 --> 01:42:19,606
Nothing like this.

947
01:42:19,673 --> 01:42:21,875
- Anybody there?
- We're here, sir.

948
01:42:21,942 --> 01:42:24,011
You got somebody
that can help me fly this?

949
01:42:24,078 --> 01:42:27,948
Sir, this is Colonel Jackson. We need
to get you out of hostile territory.

950
01:42:28,015 --> 01:42:31,819
- Good idea, Bob.
- Look above the central video screen.

951
01:42:31,885 --> 01:42:36,156
There's a series of L.E.D. numbers.
One of them should read 1-1-0.

952
01:42:36,223 --> 01:42:38,659
- Got it.
- That's your course heading.

953
01:42:38,726 --> 01:42:42,196
Just below, there's a knob
surrounded by hash marks.

954
01:42:42,262 --> 01:42:45,933
Turn that knob counterclockwise
to 290.

955
01:42:47,601 --> 01:42:49,370
- We're turning.
- Good.

956
01:42:53,173 --> 01:42:55,409
- This will take you out of Kazakhstan.
- We're gonna be okay.

957
01:42:56,377 --> 01:43:00,447
We can't land this plane on autopilot,
so well need to go over a few things.

958
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:04,651
Where's the nearest safe landing site?

959
01:43:04,718 --> 01:43:07,488
Incirlil, Turkey.

960
01:43:07,554 --> 01:43:09,490
- General Northwood.
- Madam?

961
01:43:09,556 --> 01:43:12,092
What's that?

962
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:17,264
-That red dot represents MiGs.
-On course to intercept "Air Force One."

963
01:43:17,331 --> 01:43:19,700
Christ! They took off from Aktubinsk.

964
01:43:19,767 --> 01:43:22,636
The base commander there
is loyal to Radek.

965
01:43:22,703 --> 01:43:26,640
General, send our fighters
into Kazakhstan.

966
01:43:26,707 --> 01:43:30,077
Order them to use any and all means
to protect the president.

967
01:43:30,144 --> 01:43:33,414
When you're on final approach,
keep the throttles mid-range.

968
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,716
- Mr. President, can you hear me?
- Yes, Kathryn.

969
01:43:35,783 --> 01:43:38,886
We're tracking six MiGs closing
on your position. I'm sending in...

970
01:43:38,952 --> 01:43:40,888
our F-15s to protect you.

971
01:43:40,954 --> 01:43:43,157
- Shit!
- Did she say MiGs?

972
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:45,726
Yes, she said MiGs.

973
01:43:45,793 --> 01:43:48,796
Get in that seat and put a seat belt on.
We're having trouble.

974
01:43:51,398 --> 01:43:55,269
These MiGs get closer,
I'm gonna have to maneuver this thing.

975
01:43:55,335 --> 01:43:57,337
How do I get it off autopilot?

976
01:43:57,404 --> 01:44:00,607
Push the button on the yoke
by your left thumb.

977
01:44:00,674 --> 01:44:03,110
I'll try a little right turn.

978
01:44:03,177 --> 01:44:05,746
Keep your moves smooth and steady.
It's all flying.

979
01:44:05,813 --> 01:44:09,083
Just step on the ball.

980
01:44:09,149 --> 01:44:11,318
That's right.
Just like riding a bike.

981
01:44:11,385 --> 01:44:15,622
Halo Flight, we are cleared to commit,
bearing 0-9-0.

982
01:44:15,689 --> 01:44:17,825
Jettison tanks and push it up.

983
01:44:22,663 --> 01:44:25,599
These MiGs, how far away are they?

984
01:44:28,402 --> 01:44:29,837
Never mind.

985
01:44:48,355 --> 01:44:52,459
- One coming. Countermeasures activated.
- Left turn.

986
01:44:56,663 --> 01:44:58,198
Jesus Christ!

987
01:44:58,265 --> 01:45:01,368
-We need some help.
-U.S. fighters, this is "Air Force One."

988
01:45:01,435 --> 01:45:03,170
We are under attack.
Where are you?

989
01:45:03,237 --> 01:45:07,708
This is Halo Flight closing
on your position. E.T. A. two minutes.

990
01:45:07,775 --> 01:45:09,476
We may not be here!

991
01:45:17,418 --> 01:45:18,385
We're hit!

992
01:45:19,987 --> 01:45:23,557
Christ. We're on fire.
We've got an engine on fire.

993
01:45:23,624 --> 01:45:26,727
- Number four engine is on fire.
- Pull the fire handle overhead.

994
01:45:26,794 --> 01:45:28,762
I got it.

995
01:45:31,598 --> 01:45:35,269
- We're rolling right.
- Left rudder. You have to compensate.

996
01:45:35,335 --> 01:45:38,172
- Do I pull back on number one engine?
- Negative. You'll slow down.

997
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:40,274
- Trim it out.
- How do I do that?

998
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:43,577
- Knob. Aft pedestal.
- Jesus Christ!

999
01:45:43,644 --> 01:45:48,082
We got a red light.
Looks like we're losing fuel.

1000
01:45:49,817 --> 01:45:51,085
Halo Flight.

1001
01:45:51,151 --> 01:45:53,353
Everybody lock a bandit.

1002
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:55,622
Stand by for max range.

1003
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:57,758
And Fox Three!

1004
01:46:14,475 --> 01:46:16,377
Kill one!

1005
01:46:21,181 --> 01:46:25,652
Kill two! Four more bandits
bearing 0-9-0. Halo Flight engage!

1006
01:46:28,722 --> 01:46:30,958
Ha, ha! Good guys are here.

1007
01:46:33,694 --> 01:46:36,964
- Bug out west. We'll cover you.
- You got it.

1008
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:42,403
-Sir, pull up! You got one on your tail.
-Get him off my tail !

1009
01:46:44,471 --> 01:46:45,672
Missile away.

1010
01:46:45,739 --> 01:46:50,010
- Break left and climb!
- Shit! Sir, we've lost countermeasures.

1011
01:46:51,412 --> 01:46:54,615
This is "Halo 2." They've lost
countermeasures. I'm going in.

1012
01:47:03,257 --> 01:47:05,492
Two's down! "Halo 2: is down!

1013
01:47:05,559 --> 01:47:07,828
"Air Force One, "
are you still with us?

1014
01:47:07,895 --> 01:47:10,130
Yes! We're still here.

1015
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:18,272
Not so fast, you son of a bitch!

1016
01:47:26,947 --> 01:47:28,782
The last three MiGs
are bugging out, sir.

1017
01:47:28,849 --> 01:47:30,884
We're clear!

1018
01:47:33,721 --> 01:47:35,456
- Bob, are you still there?
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:47:35,522 --> 01:47:39,193
Got a little problem here.
My rudder is sluggish.

1020
01:47:39,259 --> 01:47:40,828
Let me look.

1021
01:47:44,865 --> 01:47:46,700
Oh, man !

1022
01:47:46,767 --> 01:47:49,036
Sir, you're torn up pretty bad.

1023
01:47:49,103 --> 01:47:51,739
Do you have any elevator control?

1024
01:47:51,805 --> 01:47:55,008
It's sluggish, too.
And we're still losing fuel.

1025
01:47:57,978 --> 01:48:02,182
We got a problem up here.
Sirs, "Air Force One" is badly hit.

1026
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:07,187
With the damage,
there's no way they can land.

1027
01:48:10,557 --> 01:48:12,059
I'm sorry, sir.

1028
01:48:14,094 --> 01:48:17,498
- Thanks for your help.
- I'll stay on your wing, sir.

1029
01:48:17,564 --> 01:48:20,267
Take it straight and steady
until we figure out what to do.

1030
01:48:21,335 --> 01:48:22,569
Sir.

1031
01:48:24,838 --> 01:48:27,274
You did great.

1032
01:48:47,127 --> 01:48:50,464
They can't control the plane. Engines
are failing and they're losing fuel.

1033
01:48:50,531 --> 01:48:52,666
There must be something
we can do to help them.

1034
01:48:52,733 --> 01:48:57,204
- Is that our airstrip strike team?
- Yeah. Why?

1035
01:48:57,271 --> 01:48:59,473
I just had a wild idea.

1036
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:02,409
Time is critical.
Start turning north.

1037
01:49:02,476 --> 01:49:05,612
- You'll get more details en route.
- Yes, sir.

1038
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:08,048
Change of orders acknowledged.

1039
01:49:12,953 --> 01:49:18,792
Try to hold your heading, sir.
They'll rejoin in about 25 minutes.

1040
01:49:18,859 --> 01:49:20,094
All right.

1041
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,229
- We know it's risky.
- Understood.

1042
01:49:22,296 --> 01:49:24,832
But we are all out of options.

1043
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,702
Yeah, baby?

1044
01:49:28,769 --> 01:49:32,139
It'll be okay.
Everything's gonna work.

1045
01:49:47,588 --> 01:49:50,024
Concerned Americans have gathered
at the White House...

1046
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:52,493
to await word on the president
and his family.

1047
01:49:52,559 --> 01:49:54,728
But CNN has learned
that "Air Force One"...

1048
01:49:54,795 --> 01:49:58,232
is severely crippled
and virtually unlandable.

1049
01:49:58,298 --> 01:50:01,535
Sources report that the first family
is still trapped on board.

1050
01:50:01,602 --> 01:50:05,672
And a daring midair rescue operation
is said to be underway.

1051
01:50:08,375 --> 01:50:10,878
"Air Force One," this is "Liberty 2-4"
approaching on your left side.

1052
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:13,447
- Do you read?
- "Air Force One." Loud and clear.

1053
01:50:13,514 --> 01:50:17,284
Gibbs, they're here.
Get the door.

1054
01:50:17,351 --> 01:50:21,055
- We'll need 10,000 feet and 200 knots.
- We've got to get her slowed down.

1055
01:50:23,323 --> 01:50:26,694
"Air Force One" and "Liberty 2-4,"
this is "AWACS Blue Star. "

1056
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,396
We have you in radar contact.

1057
01:50:41,542 --> 01:50:44,378
"Liberty 2-4,"
they're almost out of fuel.

1058
01:50:44,445 --> 01:50:45,913
Roger.

1059
01:50:45,979 --> 01:50:48,182
"Air Force One," keep the wings level.

1060
01:50:48,248 --> 01:50:52,086
If the engines fail, sacrifice altitude
to maintain airspeed.

1061
01:50:57,958 --> 01:50:59,426
Ready!

1062
01:50:59,493 --> 01:51:02,529
"Liberty 2-4," ramp leader.
First man is on his way.

1063
01:51:02,596 --> 01:51:05,232
Back up. Easy.

1064
01:51:05,299 --> 01:51:08,569
"Air Force One," come left, six.

1065
01:51:12,272 --> 01:51:16,176
- How's my speed?
- It's good. See if you can hold it.

1066
01:51:16,243 --> 01:51:19,913
A little more left, sir.
Three, two, stop.

1067
01:51:30,024 --> 01:51:32,259
Take my arm! Pull me in!

1068
01:51:34,161 --> 01:51:36,563
Come on! Come on!

1069
01:51:39,933 --> 01:51:41,969
- Unhook me.
- I got it.

1070
01:51:43,037 --> 01:51:44,671
Good.

1071
01:51:47,775 --> 01:51:50,244
"Liberty," locked in.
Where's the president?

1072
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:52,513
Up in the cockpit.

1073
01:52:03,657 --> 01:52:07,461
- We lost another engine.
- "Liberty," we lost another engine.

1074
01:52:07,528 --> 01:52:08,996
"Liberty 2-4." Acknowledged.

1075
01:52:10,597 --> 01:52:12,132
Sir, time to go.

1076
01:52:12,232 --> 01:52:16,904
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- I'll take care of that, sir. Got it.

1077
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:18,505
Go!

1078
01:52:18,605 --> 01:52:21,308
Ramp to pilot.
Second P.J.'s on the way.

1079
01:52:31,485 --> 01:52:34,722
- Mr. President, this way!
- My family first.

1080
01:52:34,788 --> 01:52:38,359
- Sir, I have orders to take you off.
- Them first.

1081
01:52:41,362 --> 01:52:44,198
"Blue Star," the third parajumper
is boarding "Air Force One. "

1082
01:52:44,264 --> 01:52:47,701
- Standing by for recovery.
- Roger. Moving into receiver position.

1083
01:52:51,939 --> 01:52:54,908
- Dad?
- You'll be all right, honey.

1084
01:52:55,008 --> 01:52:57,378
- Promise?
- Promise.

1085
01:52:57,444 --> 01:52:59,313
Close your eyes.

1086
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:01,849
You can do it.
Just hold on tight.

1087
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:04,785
It's okay. Don't worry.

1088
01:53:09,923 --> 01:53:11,191
She's okay.

1089
01:53:16,563 --> 01:53:19,967
- Hang on!
- Ramp to pilot. We got her!

1090
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:28,108
I'm right behind you.

1091
01:53:39,887 --> 01:53:41,889
Come on there!

1092
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:43,924
Hang on. Good.

1093
01:53:43,991 --> 01:53:47,628
- You're next, sir.
- Him next. He's wounded.

1094
01:53:47,728 --> 01:53:50,964
- You go.
- Come on, Shep. Come on, pal.

1095
01:53:56,970 --> 01:53:58,639
We've lost another engine.

1096
01:54:04,311 --> 01:54:08,749
You're sinking too fast. We only
have time for one more retrieval.

1097
01:54:11,085 --> 01:54:14,054
We're passing 3,000 feet.
Impact in less than two minutes.

1098
01:54:14,154 --> 01:54:17,091
Get the president out of there!

1099
01:54:17,157 --> 01:54:18,992
Right here.

1100
01:54:19,059 --> 01:54:21,595
Easy there.

1101
01:54:21,695 --> 01:54:23,564
He's on.

1102
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:27,568
- Get your arms ready. It's time to go.
- What about the other team?

1103
01:54:27,668 --> 01:54:31,372
There's no time.
I can only take one more.

1104
01:54:31,472 --> 01:54:33,407
No! We're all going!

1105
01:54:33,474 --> 01:54:37,378
That's impossible, sir.
I have to take you.

1106
01:54:37,444 --> 01:54:40,914
It's time to get you off this plane.
Go, sir.

1107
01:54:41,015 --> 01:54:42,583
Go!

1108
01:54:44,184 --> 01:54:46,053
Please go!

1109
01:54:55,462 --> 01:54:56,930
It was you?

1110
01:55:11,278 --> 01:55:14,448
- Give me the strap!
- I trusted you with my life.

1111
01:55:14,548 --> 01:55:17,551
So will the next president.
Now, give it to me.

1112
01:55:21,355 --> 01:55:24,491
We have to release the cable.
We're descending from 1200 feet.

1113
01:55:26,427 --> 01:55:29,163
I'm getting off this plane!

1114
01:55:43,444 --> 01:55:44,778
Seven hundred!

1115
01:55:47,781 --> 01:55:49,083
Five hundred!

1116
01:55:49,183 --> 01:55:51,151
We have to pull up!

1117
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:22,683
"Blue Star. "
"Air Force One" is down.

1118
01:56:22,783 --> 01:56:25,386
I repeat.
"Air Force One" is down.

1119
01:56:25,486 --> 01:56:28,122
"Liberty 2-4,"
do you have the president?

1120
01:56:31,825 --> 01:56:33,861
Right. You can do it.

1121
01:56:37,464 --> 01:56:41,001
- "Liberty," do you have the president?
- Stand by.

1122
01:56:57,818 --> 01:56:59,319
Hang on !

1123
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:01,088
We got him!

1124
01:57:04,558 --> 01:57:08,429
"Liberty 2-4" is changing call signs.
"Liberty 2-4" is now...

1125
01:57:08,495 --> 01:57:10,230
"Air Force One"!

1126
01:57:19,473 --> 01:57:23,210
Mr. President, welcome aboard, sir.
