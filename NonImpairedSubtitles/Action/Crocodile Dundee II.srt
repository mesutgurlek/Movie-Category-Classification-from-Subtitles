1
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,112
You in the dinghy! This is the police.

2
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,356
Put your hands on your head.

3
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,471
Mick?

4
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,238
G'day, Sarge!

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,034
I might have known it would be you.

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,233
It's these New York fish, Sarge,
they won't take the bait.

7
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,396
Breakfast.

8
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,273
Get outta here! Come on, let's go.

9
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,992
Mick?

10
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,713
Breakfast.

11
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,833
What are you doing? You scared me.

12
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,396
- Just admiring the view. Want coffee?
- Yeah.

13
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,914
- Thinking about home?
- Yeah.

14
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,908
- You must miss it.
- The bush? A bit.

15
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,510
I could be in the bar
at Walkabout Creek right now,

16
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,315
gazing across at Wally
and Nugget and Donk.

17
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,037
Or I could be here looking at you.
No contest.

18
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,438
- I'm thinking about looking for a job.
- You're kidding.

19
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,076
No. A man can't stay
on holidays for ever.

20
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,749
Well, you seem to have
managed OK so far.

21
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,397
I'd have done it last week, but I wanted
to see Doug meet his twin brother.

22
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,593
- Doug who?
- On TV. Days of Our Lives.

23
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,635
Oh, Mick! We definitely
have to get you a job!

24
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,319
Mick, my friend didn't see you throw.
Could you show him?

25
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,559
- You can play. I've got to go to work.
- Play?

26
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,797
- Don't forget lunch.
- No worries. Right...

27
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,594
- Where's the rabbit?
- Here it is.

28
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,031
Put the rabbit down there
and get out of the way.

29
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,879
- Rocks.
- Don't miss, Mick.

30
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,792
- Close your eyes!
- Oh, all right.

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,877
One...

32
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,991
...two...

33
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,633
...three...

34
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,956
...four. OK, you can look.

35
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,396
- Any good?
- That was the best.

36
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,754
Know how come he can do that?
In the bush, if you miss, you don't eat.

37
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,431
Yes, but that's only half of it.
First, you gotta find the animals.

38
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,200
What's this?

39
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,278
- A snake. That's a snake trail.
- Quick.

40
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,835
Snakes are good eating.

41
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,155
What's this one?

42
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,232
- That's a goanna, a real big lizard.
- Right.

43
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,432
You can eat it,
but it tastes like shit, right?

44
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,519
Yeah... Here's another one, real quick.

45
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,830
What's that? Don't know?

46
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,952
Dunlop radials, Tony's bike.

47
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,676
- That was a good one.
- All right, practise. Bye.

48
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,359
- See you later!
- Bye!

49
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,597
- Don't forget lunch!
- That was good.

50
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,870
G'day, all.

51
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,436
- What'll you have?
- Just a beer, mate.

52
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,591
- Mind if I make an announcement?
- Go ahead.

53
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,916
Thanks.

54
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,157
Mick Dundee's the name.
Fairly new in town.

55
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,999
Looking for some kind of a job.

56
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,915
Any suggestions?

57
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,914
That's enough job hunting for one day.

58
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,510
- Yo, Mick, my man!
- G'day, Leroy.

59
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,993
- You're looking for work?
- Kinda.

60
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,509
Well, then look no further.

61
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,156
- I can get you into something sweet.
- Great.

62
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,319
Let me grab some cigarettes,
then we'll talk business.

63
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,632
Hey.

64
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,230
- You're pretty tight with Leroy.
- Yeah, nice fella.

65
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,318
Let me warn you, he's a bad dude.

66
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,273
He's into some pretty heavy shit.

67
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,393
- Leroy? Seems harmless enough.
- Just so you know.

68
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,192
Yo, Mick, let's walk.
Less ears on the street.

69
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,868
OK... Back in a sec.

70
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,318
OK, like... I got a little
supply business going, right?

71
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,594
- Hey, like you will work for me.
- What would I be doing?

72
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,712
- Delivering stuff.
- Stuff?

73
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,154
This is just between you and me.
It goes no further, right?

74
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,873
Right.

75
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,516
Stationery.

76
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,472
Stationery?

77
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,475
You know. Pens, erasers,
office supplies...

78
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,149
- And that's heavy shit?
- No, man, it ain't.

79
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,237
I'm strictly legit.

80
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,912
But if you have a name like Leroy Brown,
people expect you to be bad.

81
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,669
- Like the song.
- Oh, right!

82
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,155
But...

83
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,318
- I kinda like the image.
- Yeah.

84
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,478
- You dig?
- Yup. Dig.

85
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,434
Is that part of the job? Digging?

86
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,349
Man, you really are prehistoric.
You want the job?

87
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,872
I dunno, Leroy.
Don't really know what I wanna do yet.

88
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,470
OK. When you make up your mind,
you let me know.

89
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,557
OK.

90
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,748
In the meantime...

91
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,428
...I gotta split.

92
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,634
You be cool.

93
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,874
Beast. The perfect gift for Donk.

94
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,990
Well, it makes a man irresistible.

95
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,312
You don't sound very convincing.
I think I'll test it.

96
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,390
Doesn't work.

97
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,989
Well, it doesn't!

98
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,231
I'd like to get Wally the kind of thing
you can only buy in America.

99
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,998
Hello.

100
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,389
Maybe cushions saying "I love New York"
that you put in your car.

101
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,515
Hi, Sue. What are you doing?

102
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,555
Hi, Doris. Nothing exciting,
just going through some mail.

103
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,156
- Bob Tanner. Isn't he your ex-husband?
- We still keep in touch.

104
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,796
Sue, he's cute!
Where was I when you two broke up?

105
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,073
- I could have consoled him!
- That's gonna be difficult.

106
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,559
He spends most of his time in Colombia.
That's where the action is.

107
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,629
Que sera, sera... Speaking of action,
when am I gonna meet Tarzan?

108
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,230
- You mean Mick?
- You have another hot jungle lover?

109
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,352
- Soon, I promise.
- Sue...

110
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,552
What's he like in bed?

111
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,830
I dunno. He still sleeps on the floor.

112
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,473
OK, some visitors.

113
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,793
This must be Rico.

114
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,075
Hello, Rico. Nice suit.

115
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,675
Cómo está, huh?

116
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,995
A little slimy...

117
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,274
What the hell's this?

118
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,038
Shit!

119
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,435
- Operador.
- This is Seòor Tanner in Room 1 1.

120
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,278
Would you get me...

121
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,677
...Bogota 6-3-7?
- Sí, senor.

122
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,598
Gracias.

123
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,590
- Hello.
- Your call.

124
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,155
- Brannigan.
- Something's happened.

125
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,874
Get me out. I want protection.

126
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,231
OK, you'll get it. Just calm down.

127
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,512
So, what have you got?

128
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,752
Rico was at the cocaine plant.

129
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,393
Yeah, it was him.

130
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,991
And he killed a guy, personally.
I took pictures of the whole thing.

131
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,273
- Great. Did you send them off?
- Yeah, but not to you.

132
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,678
- But I'll send you framed copies.
- Where did you send them?

133
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,031
Sure, I tell you,
and you kiss me goodbye.

134
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,516
They shot at me!
Now come and get me!

135
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,350
OK, stay put. We'll be there in an hour.
You'll be on the next flight.

136
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,949
- Great.
- You did a great job.

137
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,119
Thank you very much.
Just come and get me.

138
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,070
- Operador.
- Hi, it's me again.

139
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,274
Would you get me
New York City 21 2-555-6432?

140
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,153
- Sí, senor. Nueva York.
- Thank you.

141
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,678
Sue, listen...

142
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,072
Hello. This is Mick Dundee here.

143
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,955
I'm not really here,
this is a recording. Good, isn't it?

144
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,673
Sue's not here either,

145
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,838
and you should leave a message
after the beep.

146
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,959
Hey, great message.
Sue, this is Robert.

147
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,914
I sent you a letter. Don't open it
until you hear from me.

148
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,910
There's nobody else that I trust.
This is big with a capital B.

149
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,917
Bye.

150
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,275
- G'day, Ralph.
- How's it hangin'?

151
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,758
- Good, mate. Anything for me?
- Got something for your lady friend.

152
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,315
There you go.

153
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,915
What about this one?

154
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,588
My fellow Americans,

155
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,758
let me make one thing perfectly clear.

156
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,156
That's funny, Ralph. Who is it?

157
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,633
It's Nixon! You know, Tricky Dicky?

158
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,235
No, I don't know him.
Does he live round here?

159
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,716
He used to be the President!

160
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,912
Oh, right. Yeah, that was just like him.

161
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,554
- I'll work on it.
- See you, mate.

162
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,115
See you later, Mick.

163
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,913
Hey, you ugly mother.
Gimme your wallet!

164
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,680
Hey, relax! It's just me, man.

165
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,757
- Leroy!
- How you doin'?

166
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,599
- Fancy a drink?
- Sounds good.

167
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,509
- I got a couple of deliveries to make.
- Can I help?

168
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,589
This goes to Moore, Bank and Patterson,
on the 23rd floor of that building.

169
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,349
- No worries. See you back here.
- In five minutes.

170
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,475
- G'day.
- Yes.

171
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,593
- Can I help you?
- That's your stationery.

172
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,678
Can you wait while I check this?

173
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,512
Yeah, sure.

174
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,269
Hey, there's a guy
walking past your window.

175
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,472
- OK, what's the gag?
- No, serious.

176
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,879
Oh, my God. It's a jumper.
I'd better call the police.

177
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,758
- A what?
- A jumper. A suicide!

178
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,912
Maybe I should go and talk to him.

179
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,553
Don't try to stop me.

180
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,072
- I don't want to. I just wanna get past.
- What?

181
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,636
- I wanna get by. You're in the way.
- You're kidding.

182
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,669
No. I walk around here every day.

183
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,190
Get away from the noise and traffic,
get fresh air.

184
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,278
You had the same idea yourself,
did you?

185
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,715
I don't give a damn about the air!
I'm about to throw myself off the building.

186
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,988
You could kill yourself.

187
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,509
That's the whole idea.

188
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,474
Oh, right. I'll just wait
till you've finished.

189
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,235
Would you mind getting a move on?
I'm on my lunch break.

190
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,352
I can't do it with you watching.

191
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,199
Oh... Sorry.

192
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,838
Just out of curiosity, why...?

193
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,153
Have you ever been hopelessly
and completely in love,

194
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,590
only to find out that...

195
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,792
...that you've been used?

196
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,958
No, I can't say that I have.

197
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,759
I loved that bitch!

198
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,278
- It's all right.
- And he betrayed me.

199
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,879
He?

200
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,474
Screw that!

201
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,557
Hello, Sue. No trouble, darling.
Let's get into the car, OK?

202
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,316
Sit.

203
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,156
Sue Charlton.

204
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,955
You got something for me?

205
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,030
- Who are you and what do you want?
- Forgive me. I am Luís Rico.

206
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,075
Your ex-husband Bob sent you a film.
It belongs to me. I want it back.

207
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,238
Bob? I don't know
what you're talking about.

208
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,639
This is very simple.
We do business and you go home.

209
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,358
He sent you a letter. Where is it?

210
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,472
I don't know what you're talking about.

211
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,910
It's here by now.
He left a message on your machine.

212
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,079
I never got any message.
The machine's been broken.

213
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,076
Felipe.

214
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,352
He says the boyfriend is back.

215
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,313
What do you want him to do?

216
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,598
- His name?
- Mick.

217
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,709
He lives with you?

218
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,153
- Does he check the mail?
- Yeah, I guess.

219
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,956
Tell Felipe to bring Mick
around for a coffee.

220
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,869
He says that the DEA...
they staked out the place.

221
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,238
- Brannigan just went inside the building.
- Mierda!

222
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,955
Tell him to just sit tight.
This is getting out of hand.

223
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,479
Call Mick. And pray he has some brains.

224
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,037
He does like I tell him,
you both come out alive.

225
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,393
Sue?

226
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,076
Just a second.

227
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,317
- Yeah?
- Mick.

228
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,035
- You should see the joint...
- Listen, I'm in trouble.

229
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,630
- Did you check the mail today?
- Yeah, why?

230
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,718
Was there a letter for me
from Colombia?

231
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,276
Hang on a second... Colombia.
Yeah, I've got it here.

232
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,789
- Thank God.
- What's going on?

233
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,754
- Mick, I'm being held prisoner...
- Shut up and listen.

234
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,475
- Who's this?
- There's a cop coming to see you.

235
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,434
Give him nothing. Get rid of him,
or your lady is dead.

236
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,518
Call you back in two minutes.

237
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,073
Listen...

238
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,994
Brannigan.
Drug Enforcement Administration.

239
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,352
- Is Sue Charlton in?
- Not at the moment, no.

240
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,832
- When do you expect her?
- I'm not sure.

241
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,192
You know these big-time reporters,
out reporting all hours.

242
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,995
Would you ask her to call,
if you bump into her?

243
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,553
Sure.

244
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,469
- Aren't you gonna ask what it's about?
- Not my business.

245
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,193
OK, fine.

246
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,079
Yes?

247
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,716
Bring the letter to Hoyt Street station,
downtown side.

248
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,388
Wait till someone comes. You got that?

249
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,751
Yes. I wanna talk to Sue. Now.

250
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,839
- Mick, do what they say and be careful.
- You just hang on.

251
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,600
One thing more, amigo.

252
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,110
If you're followed, if you screw this up...

253
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,518
...your lady is dead. Comprendes?

254
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,676
Yeah, I got it.

255
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,474
- A little mustard?
- Yeah.

256
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,232
Ketchup?

257
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,269
OK, here she is.

258
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,038
Mom?

259
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,591
- Finished?
- What?

260
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,677
Are you finished?

261
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,510
Don't put it away.
Put your hands up on the wall.

262
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,269
- Now, where's Sue Charlton?
- Who's that?

263
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,435
Lord! Man, no!
How should I know where she is?

264
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,269
I've been following you.
Brannigan told me to follow you.

265
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,552
- Brannigan. So you're a cop?
- Yeah, DEA.

266
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,716
- Can I do up my fly?
- No.

267
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,037
- All right.
- What do you want with Sue?

268
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,231
Pictures. We think she's got...

269
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,194
...photographs of a guy named Rico.
Evidence, you know.

270
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,597
- Who's Rico?
- A big-time drug dealer, a killer.

271
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,758
- Where is he? Where does he live?
- How do I know?

272
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,396
Look, I think I've been
more than reasonable, so...

273
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,311
What do you say you and me just forget
this little incident ever took place, OK?

274
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,115
'Cause it's kind of embarrassing,
you know?

275
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,151
He's gone.

276
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,040
Are you OK, buddy?

277
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,073
You gotta be Dundee.

278
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,035
- Where's the girl?
- Coming in on the next train.

279
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,871
- The item?
- We'll wait.

280
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,835
She must have got off at the wrong stop.

281
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,199
No, no, no...

282
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,556
Keep going.

283
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,954
Now, that's a knife.

284
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,557
...the legendary New York City subway,
completed in nineteen hundred and...

285
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,070
...it's the most extensive subway
system in the world,

286
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,592
encompassing 481.2 real miles.

287
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,755
Feel free to take pictures.

288
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,238
Please get on the train
in an orderly fashion...

289
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,271
No, no... Go on...

290
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,113
Yeah.

291
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,398
How does this work?

292
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,238
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

293
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,877
He'll kill somebody, he's crazy!
Where are you going?

294
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,514
I'm gonna get into trouble!

295
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,956
- Thank you.
- Slap me five.

296
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,553
You know who that was?
Clint Eastwood!

297
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,716
Clint Eastwood?

298
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,636
Yes, very tall.

299
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,430
Yes.

300
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,153
Clint Eastwood.

301
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,029
You know what this is?

302
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,633
- Cocaine.
- Wrong. It's money and power.

303
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,515
With this, you can do
anything to anybody.

304
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,276
Five, ten years from now,

305
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,712
I'm gonna retire,
buy myself a little island.

306
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,592
Hawaii, maybe.

307
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,035
Who do you think you are?

308
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,711
You threaten to kill people and then
act like you're some sort of a rock star.

309
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,673
You're a drug dealer.

310
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,996
Grubby little parasite.

311
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,598
You should watch your mouth.

312
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,469
It's not wise to annoy me.

313
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,036
Bob Tanner did and I had
his head blown off like that.

314
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,470
You killed Bob?

315
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,990
And if your Mick screws this up...

316
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,760
Wakey, wakey.

317
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,913
You kill people for a living.
Not very good at it, are you?

318
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,998
- You should try another business.
- Shove it!

319
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,476
- You're too heavy to be clever.
- Are you kidding?

320
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,511
You ain't gonna...!

321
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,636
Scary, eh?

322
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,154
Please! What do you want?

323
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,958
Please! What do you want?

324
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,273
- Where's the girl?
- Rico's got her. At his place.

325
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,594
And where exactly is that?

326
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,593
Thank God! I thought
you were gonna leave me here.

327
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,554
- Long Island. That's east of here, right?
- Yeah.

328
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,512
- Thanks.
- Hey!

329
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,309
Freeze! Hold it!

330
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,192
Excuse me.

331
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,072
Shall I go after him?

332
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,589
- Be my guest.
- Yeah.

333
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,677
Mick, this is serious shit
you're talking about.

334
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,395
DEA, international drug rings...

335
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,398
This is all hazardous to your health.

336
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,752
Yeah, but... Think what it'll do
for your reputation.

337
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,439
Oh, yeah!

338
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,395
Leroy Brown, the baddest man
in the whole damn cemetery!

339
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,108
I don't know how these people think.

340
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,392
I need someone who's... roadwise.

341
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,390
Roadwise.

342
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,710
Let's go.

343
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,072
The car's... I mean, like,
the wheels are out back.

344
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,748
I'm cool.

345
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,393
I'm cool.

346
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,117
You mustn't let these minor disruptions
ruin your appetite.

347
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,553
Try the lobster. I had it flown in
from Maine this morning.

348
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,231
There's nothing wrong with the food,
it's the company.

349
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,993
Would you look at this stuff!

350
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,440
There's TV cameras...

351
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,870
...infra-red beams!

352
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,232
They're gonna know you're there
before you do.

353
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,674
Maybe we should just call the police.

354
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,790
Mick...

355
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,709
Guys like this own cops.

356
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,311
Even if the guys you call are straight,
what are they gonna do?

357
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,193
Come with sirens wailing
and guns blazing?

358
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,359
She'll be dead in two seconds,
if she's still alive.

359
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,472
She's still alive.

360
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,194
How do you know that?

361
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,313
That's the only way I can see her.
Up here.

362
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,152
If I even start to think she's hurt,
my guts twist up, I can't think straight,

363
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,796
and I'm no good to her.

364
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:20,632
- So, what do we do now?
- We need some kind of distraction.

365
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,236
When we get in, whatever you do,
be cool, go easy. These dogs bite.

366
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,750
Fortunately,
they know my rep round here.

367
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,952
I'll just smooth the way.

368
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,753
- Yo, Rat.
- Leroy.

369
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,080
I would consider it a personal favour
if you'll hear my man here.

370
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,190
- You're the crocodile man, ain't you?
- Yeah.

371
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,633
I've seen you around.

372
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,839
- I'm Rat.
- Hey, Rat.

373
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,669
What d'you want, crocodile man?

374
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,908
- I've got a problem. I need your help.
- You've come to the right place.

375
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,078
That's what we're here for, huh?

376
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,756
Nice jacket.

377
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,794
How can we be of service?

378
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,592
Well, these heavy dudes
kidnapped my woman.

379
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,237
They're holding her in a big mansion
and I'm gonna bust her out.

380
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,556
"Heavy dudes"?

381
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,151
Lots of guys with machine guns,
shit like that?

382
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,112
Probably.

383
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,676
So, you want us
to charge down the guns.

384
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,429
Death before dishonour, all that stuff?

385
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,359
I'm the only one that's gonna get shot at.

386
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,475
What I want from you is a distraction,
so I can get in.

387
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,240
So, what's in it for us?

388
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,837
Leroy tells me that your gang
is the coolest gang in New York.

389
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,600
That's the word.

390
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,158
- What did you do last night?
- We didn't do nothin'.

391
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,156
We was here all night.

392
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,631
That's what you call cool, is it?

393
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,672
So tomorrow,
if someone asks you that question,

394
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,032
you can say, "We didn't do nothin'."

395
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,598
Or say, "We went to Long Island and
helped this lunatic storm a fortress."

396
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,112
At least you could watch me
get my head blown off.

397
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,039
What are your chances?

398
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,673
Fair.

399
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,795
What are your chances of getting
outta here with that jacket on?

400
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,514
Better than average.

401
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,516
Yeah, I'll go along with that.

402
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,230
He wants to drive, let him drive!

403
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,718
- I didn't think you'd get anybody.
- Would you miss this?

404
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,036
- No.
- Exactly.

405
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,470
Hey, yo! Like, be cool with the clutch!

406
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,032
Hey, Judy, what's going on?

407
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,789
Looks like these guys
are gonna blow up Long Island.

408
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,551
- What the hell, let's check it out!
- Yeah, let's go, man!

409
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,873
Go!

410
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,678
OK, Kemo sabe. We're set.

411
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,395
It's time for you to do
your Lone Ranger stuff.

412
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,397
Thanks, Rat.

413
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,512
Souvenir.

414
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,190
Good luck, Mick.

415
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,916
Miguel, there's something
going on outside, man.

416
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,078
There is all this weird howling.

417
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,513
They're only kids, punks.
Go get rid of them.

418
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,794
Don't start shooting at shadows.
We don't want the cops around.

419
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,956
Do we?

420
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,553
Shit.

421
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,990
They don't even have machine guns!

422
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,515
Yeah, like, he's cool.

423
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,113
That's my man!

424
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,276
What's happening here?

425
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,318
What's going on here?

426
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,274
- I'm in. What are we doing?
- What are you, a penguin?

427
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,755
Who are these people?

428
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,315
There he goes.

429
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,876
Damn! He's going in!

430
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,516
- He's going in!
- All right!

431
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,430
- What's happening?
- Just kids.

432
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,191
- They set off the alarm.
- Check the house anyway.

433
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,837
- Leroy!
- Hey, Mick!

434
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,916
Thought you might need a hand.

435
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,032
It looks like
you've taken care of business.

436
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,595
Check out this party!

437
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,076
It don't fit.

438
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,238
Where did all these people come from?

439
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,799
Better ask Leroy.
He's in charge of the cavalry.

440
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,878
It's like, curiosity, my man.

441
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,514
Like, the word gets around,

442
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,713
that bad, bad Leroy Brown
got something going down,

443
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,549
they can't stay away.
I mean, with my reputation...

444
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,109
Mick, I gotta split.

445
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,153
Looks like explanation time.

446
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:44,034
- How do you like your eggs, mate?
- Over easy, thanks, Mick.

447
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,630
- Morning, Miss Charlton.
- Morning.

448
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,197
I was assigned to guard your door.
Mick invited me in.

449
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,156
- Morning.
- G'day.

450
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,070
- Don't you have a post, mister?
- Yes, sir.

451
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,712
- Do you mind? I'm starving.
- Dig right in.

452
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,832
Got a fork? Thanks.

453
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,909
Well, we haven't found Rico yet.

454
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,750
He'll have skipped the country by now,
but he'll be back.

455
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,396
He has to, you don't walk
away from $1 00 million.

456
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,555
Just how exactly
was Bob involved in this?

457
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,750
He owed us a favour.

458
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,468
Here's the photos Bob took.
They can really stir things up.

459
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,516
Rico blew it when he kidnapped you.
Now we can put him away for keeps.

460
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,392
What now?

461
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,991
The first thing is to put you two
into protective custody.

462
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,556
We go to jail
while Rico walks around free?

463
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,072
No, not jail. We'll hide you away
somewhere safe...

464
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,475
You got any ketchup?

465
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,673
...till we get Rico off the streets.
Guys like that should be...

466
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,917
Building across the street!

467
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,397
Roof, I think. Move it!

468
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,589
- Is this what you call safe custody?
- I didn't expect it to start so soon.

469
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,792
Maybe you can protect her,
but I know I can.

470
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,958
Not here.
Somewhere I can see 'em coming.

471
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,628
What have you got in mind?

472
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,032
You see, the Northern Territory
is wilderness.

473
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,874
Now, if any of you city folk
went out there and got lost,

474
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,356
you would last about three days.

475
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:19,317
Gosh! And you were out there alone
and wounded for 1 2 days, Mr Reilly?

476
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,479
Gator. No, I wasn't really alone,
you see, I...

477
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,592
...I had old Bessie.

478
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,948
And how is old Bessie, Gator?

479
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,355
Mick! You're back!

480
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,198
You're back!

481
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,755
- I missed you.
- I know.

482
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,156
Sue! Sue Charlton.

483
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:47,195
Here's one of your fellow countrymen,
a brilliant New York journalist.

484
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,190
She's the one that put Walkabout Creek
on the international scene.

485
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,233
Good to see you again, Gator.

486
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,433
- Mick!
- Donk, you old bastard! How are you?

487
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,552
G'day, mate!
Bet you've got some stories.

488
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,991
Have I ever, son. But not on a dry throat.

489
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,192
- Ida?
- The drinks are on the house.

490
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,156
That's a first!

491
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,228
- So what were those New Yorkers like?
- They were a lot like us, Nugget.

492
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,434
In fact, I saw Donk's twin brother
over there, in the Bronx Zoo.

493
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:28,031
- I don't have a brother.
- In a cage, Donk!

494
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,279
- He's still quick.
- Nothing's changed.

495
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,076
- Son of a bitch!
- What's stopping you?

496
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,590
- Here, what's stopping you?
- Donk!

497
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,268
Cheers, Mick!

498
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,238
Luís.

499
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,437
Jefe.

500
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,520
It's like they jumped off the planet.

501
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,156
Nobody knows nothing,
not even the Feds.

502
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:11,515
Somebody knows. Double the price.
The girl's got to die.

503
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:16,271
But no one touches Dundee.
He's for me.

504
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:09,114
Mick, this area we're in now,
does it have a name?

505
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,151
Billongamick.

506
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,876
Billongamick...
Does that mean something?

507
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,036
Mick's place.

508
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,913
OK, why does it mean that?

509
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,837
- 'Cause I own it, I guess.
- You own it?

510
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,237
Yeah, an uncle of mine
left it to me years ago.

511
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,279
How big is Mick's place?

512
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,110
It's not very big. You could walk
across it in three or four days.

513
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:43,155
Three or four days! You can walk
across New York State in two!

514
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,708
But this is the Territory. Anything under
1,000 square miles is a hobby farm.

515
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,959
And Mick's Place, it's all swamps
and rocky mountains.

516
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,516
The only things you can raise here
are mosquitoes.

517
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,316
Well, I don't care if it is worthless.
I'm glad it's yours, I love it.

518
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,675
I wouldn't say it's worthless.
It does have some redeeming features.

519
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,714
- Is this what I think it is?
- M-hm.

520
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,913
Tomorrow, at my weekender,
I'll show you the Reserve Bank.

521
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:27,433
That's what I call my mine.
It's like my retirement fund.

522
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,150
Hey, Miguel!

523
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,069
It's been a long time, amigo.

524
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:27,669
You look good, Frank.
This is Mr Rico. He pays the bills.

525
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,474
How're you doin'?

526
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,958
That's Denning. And Erskine in the truck.
