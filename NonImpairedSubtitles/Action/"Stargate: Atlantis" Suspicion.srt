0
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:07,356
Previously on Stargate Atlantis...

1
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:10,403
Major Sheppard,
who are all these people?

2
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:12,954
I am Teyla Emmagan,
Daughter of Tagan.

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:16,197
If the Wraith haven't touched your world,
you should go back.

4
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:17,957
We'd like to, but we can't.

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,356
I don't see a life form like this
dying of natural ageing.

6
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:26,235
You trespassed upon our feeding ground.
You don't know what you have done.

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,476
(Stargate alarm)

8
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:42,921
- It's Major Sheppard's IDC.
- They've only been gone a few hours.

9
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,475
Atlantis, this is Sheppard.
We're coming in hot.

10
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:49,796
Lower the shield.

11
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:02,755
(blast)

12
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,320
Raise the shield.

13
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:17,953
(Sheppard) McKay!

14
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,880
(Weir) Medical team to the gate room!

15
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:27,513
(Sheppard) I got a pulse.

16
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:41,002
How you feeling?

17
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,282
(slurred) I can't feel anything. I can't talk.

18
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:47,323
- You can't talk either.
- That's what I said.

19
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:51,478
Your body experienced an overload
to its sensory and motor nervous system.

20
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,283
What?

21
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:56,278
You took one of those Wraith stunners
in the face.

22
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:58,242
It's quite fascinating, actually.

23
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:01,203
The Wraith weapon
impedes a fire of neurons...

24
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:05,483
- I'm paralysed?
- The paralysis is only temporary.

25
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:08,364
Don't worry.
You'll be up and about in no time.

26
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:12,803
Good thing that Wraith weapon is only
designed to incapacitate, or he'd be dead.

27
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,240
What?

28
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:17,760
Major, could I see you for a second?

29
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:25,961
Hello? Hello?

30
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,559
- He's gonna be fine.
- I've heard.

31
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:33,635
- I want to know what happened out there.
- The same old thing.

32
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:37,161
Which makes it the fifth time
your teams encountered the Wraith

33
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,839
out of how many missions?

34
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:44,521
Nine. So probably not a coincidence.

35
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:50,043
I think it's pretty damn obvious now.
We've got a spy in Atlantis.

36
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:01,761
Could you please not do that here?

37
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,155
My foot is still numb, if you'll excuse me.

38
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:06,680
At least your mouth still works fine.

39
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,636
All right, let's get started.

40
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:22,834
- Shouldn't we wait for Teyla?
- Teyla wasn't invited.

41
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,597
She's a member of my team.

42
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,676
- She's also an Athosian, sir.
- So?

43
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:29,882
If we've been compromised,
as indications suggest,

44
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:32,036
one of them is probably responsible.

45
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,196
We're talking about Teyla.

46
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:36,356
- I don't like it either...
- Good.

47
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:40,404
...but the safety of this base
and its personnel are my main concern.

48
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,318
As they should be yours.

49
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:47,444
The Wraith have shown up on five
of the nine planets your team has visited,

50
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:50,438
and given that
two of those worlds were unpopulated,

51
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:54,678
we can assume they have been alerted
to your missions by someone on this base.

52
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:57,917
If that is so,
then why hasn't Atlantis been attacked?

53
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:00,204
Good point.

54
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:03,163
Maybe we should stop
using the Stargate indefinitely.

55
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:04,838
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

56
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,441
- We need ZPMs to power this place.
- They seem to be running fine.

57
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:12,644
When the Wraith do show up, and
they will, how do we defend ourselves?

58
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,238
Or get back to Earth?

59
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:17,681
This is the only Stargate in the galaxy
that can reach Earth.

60
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:21,599
We'll have to use the self-destruct
before the Wraith take the city.

61
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:25,120
Bottom line, we need to use the gate.

62
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,799
We've got to find out
who's responsible ASAP.

63
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:32,516
We should confine all non-base personnel
to the south side of the complex.

64
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:34,915
- Are you kidding?
- That's the minimum.

65
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,724
- If Colonel Sumner was still...
- He's not.

66
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,642
- I am.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:46,957
We're not gonna start
treating anyone like prisoners.

68
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,638
Well, that's good.

69
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:55,074
But steps should be taken to safeguard
the more sensitive areas of this facility.

70
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:57,042
It's only reasonable.

71
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:59,844
No-go zones should start
with Stargate operations.

72
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:02,155
Labs, power generation
and the jumper bay.

73
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:05,078
I'd like to meet
with every Athosian on this base.

74
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,395
I only know a handful by name.

75
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:10,033
I'll set up interviews
when we're done here.

76
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:15,677
In the meantime, all gate travel
is suspended until further notice.

77
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,395
- Sorry, you can't come up.
- I'm on my way to see Dr Weir.

78
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:32,797
- That area's off limits.
- Since when?

79
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:37,843
I believe there's been a misunderstanding.

80
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:41,554
I was unaware a meeting had been called.

81
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:44,239
Let's take a walk.

82
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:50,564
- What is happening?
- There may be a security leak on Atlantis.

83
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:54,638
- Are you certain?
- Not certain certain, but pretty certain.

84
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:58,320
- We have to take temporary precautions.
- Such as?

85
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,955
Like suspending gate travel,
tightening security...

86
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,713
getting to know your people a little better.

87
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,795
You suspect an Athosian?

88
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,525
Dr Weir wants to meet them.
It's not personal.

89
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:14,882
It is in the sense that
she wants to meet them personally...

90
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:18,640
You know the horrors my people
have faced at the hands of the Wraith,

91
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,602
yet you question their loyalty?

92
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:25,043
Teyla, that's not fair. People are running
around Atlantis that she's never met.

93
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:28,720
I know each one of them.
I would stake my life on their innocence.

94
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:33,117
Perhaps you've noticed that
every time we step through the Stargate,

95
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,435
bad guys try to kill us.

96
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:39,393
- I'm getting tired of it. How about you?
- That does not mean...

97
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:45,083
Look, all we're asking for
is a little cooperation, that's all.

98
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,239
You shall have it.

99
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:58,317
Halling, how's Jinto?

100
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:03,196
Well enough for a boy
confined to his living quarters.

101
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:08,564
I'm sorry. It's temporary,
but it is a necessary precaution.

102
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:12,125
So I've heard.

103
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:15,641
Then I assume you know
why we've arranged these meetings?

104
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:19,684
The same reason my people cannot
go offworld or enter parts of the city.

105
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:24,873
- You no longer trust us.
- The truth... We don't know who to trust.

106
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,362
Information about offworld excursions
has obviously found its way to the Wraith.

107
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:34,723
- Obviously?
- They can't be lying in wait everywhere.

108
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:38,321
They are tracking our movements
and we need to find out how.

109
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,999
Your help would be greatly appreciated.

110
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,843
Then by all means.
How can I be of assistance?

111
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,324
Thank you.

112
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,874
You've been offworld three times?

113
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:53,799
I've been a guide for Sergeant
Stackhouse's reconnaissance team,

114
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:58,595
helping establish relations between your
people and our former trading partners.

115
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:02,599
Stackhouse reported he lost track of you
on a couple of these outings.

116
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,074
I did visit some close friends.

117
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:10,273
Interesting. Two of your visits predated
Wraith attacks by approximately a day.

118
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,913
- What are you suggesting?
- Nothing.

119
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,555
You think I would betray my own people?
Jeopardise my son's life?

120
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:19,922
- No one is making accusations.
- I disagree.

121
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:22,645
You have concluded
an Athosian is responsible.

122
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:25,683
Because it can't possibly
be one of our own people.

123
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:27,995
No?

124
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:32,440
We just need to clarify a few things.

125
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,076
Then allow me.

126
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:40,523
I lost my closest friend in the Wraith attack
that forced us from our home world.

127
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:45,002
Selana, the woman you just spoke to,
lost both her parents.

128
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:47,360
You'd be hard pressed to find an Athosian

129
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:51,438
who has not experienced loss
at the hands of the Wraith.

130
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:54,601
These are the people you accuse.

131
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:59,156
We are not accusing anyone.

132
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,714
I came here expecting an interview.

133
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:08,996
Not an interrogation.

134
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:24,203
- I don't think it's too much to ask.
- What is it?

135
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:28,916
Nothing. Just can't bear the same meal
day after day after day.

136
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:32,282
- Buck up. I'm trying to run a diagnostic.
- Sorry.

137
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:36,404
We are stranded
with limited resources in another galaxy.

138
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:39,637
The nearest Bob's Big Boy
is 300 million light years away.

139
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,081
If you have to eat my favourite food
twice in a row, so be it.

140
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:46,954
- You enjoy military rations?
- I know, it's weird. Hospital food, too.

141
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,481
I don't like airplane food
because you can't get seconds...

142
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:52,237
- (beep)
- Hello.

143
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:56,318
- What is it?
- A new command subroutine.

144
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,402
What is its function?

145
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:02,875
I don't know
because I've never seen it before.

146
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:06,594
I'm gonna cross-reference this
with the Ancient database.

147
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:09,325
- I'm gonna grab the...
- (bang)

148
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,282
- What did you touch?
- Nothing.

149
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:14,084
- No, I...
- (whirring)

150
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,038
- I had no idea the roof could do that.
- Neither did I.

151
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,679
The gate room has been closed to us.

152
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:50,360
We no longer have access
to the medical facility without escort.

153
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:53,278
We're under constant surveillance.

154
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:57,358
- How long must we put up with this?
- It's already been too long.

155
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,675
I'd have expected
to be included in this.

156
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:06,564
As we would have expected you
to take a stand for us.

157
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:10,559
They will protect everyone on this base.
That includes all of you.

158
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:13,364
A Wraith collaborator threatens us all.

159
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:18,519
- You support the decision to confine us?
- Halling, we are their guests.

160
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:24,157
We're more like their prisoners, but
unlike prisoners we can choose to leave.

161
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:27,840
- Where would you go?
- Do you not mean, where would we go?

162
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,879
Our friends in other worlds
would take us in.

163
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,924
For how long? Good trading partners
do not necessarily make good hosts.

164
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:40,122
- There are many worlds.
- No world is safe.

165
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:44,278
Nor is it safe to remain. They will
continue until they find someone to blame.

166
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:47,084
You know none of our people
could be responsible.

167
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:51,158
- Of course.
- Then we have nothing to fear.

168
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:57,475
- You trust Dr Weir that much?
- I do.

169
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:00,034
- More than you trust your own people?
- No.

170
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:03,038
I understand her responsibility.

171
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:09,235
Halling, we have met with the Wraith
offworld so often and so quickly,

172
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,283
there must be a reason
beyond coincidence.

173
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:14,959
Give them a chance to find it.

174
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:28,113
I do not approve
of some of their measures,

175
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:32,198
but I do know that in the end
they will help to prove our innocence.

176
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:35,437
Atlantis is far more than shelter. It is hope.

177
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:39,234
Not only for us, but for everyone
who would stand against the Wraith.

178
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:43,519
We must not abandon that hope.

179
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,996
They may reside here, Teyla,

180
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,156
but they are not the Ancestors,

181
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,885
no matter how much
you wish them to be.

182
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:01,799
- Sir?
- Ford.

183
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,274
They got the sunroof open
on the jumper bay.

184
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,005
- Yep.
- You're planning to take a jumper out.

185
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:09,804
I figure that's what
the door on the roof is for.

186
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:12,195
Anyone else call shotgun?

187
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:15,118
Just gonna drive around the planet,
check it out.

188
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:18,960
You're just checking out the planet?
Never mind. That's cool.

189
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:24,279
I got better things to do than
cruise around the planet in a spaceship.

190
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,118
- You're like a kid, you know that?
- Yes, sir.

191
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,845
- I brought something to eat on the ride.
- What?

192
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:32,235
How about a nice turkey sandwich?

193
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,076
Let's go.

194
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:40,955
Send in whoever's next, please.

195
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,837
Teyla. I wasn't expecting you.

196
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:57,042
I was surprised to be left off your list.

197
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:00,197
I didn't feel it was necessary in your case.

198
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:05,320
On the contrary.
You should have spoken to me first.

199
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:13,356
You're right. I should have.

200
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:16,756
I can tell you anything
you need to know about my people.

201
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:20,076
Is it possible you don't know them all
as well as you think?

202
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:25,442
I empathise with you, Dr Weir.

203
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:28,517
As leaders, we often
have to make difficult decisions

204
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:30,516
in the interests of those we serve,

205
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:34,724
but many of my fellow Athosians
are not so understanding.

206
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:38,400
I know. But there's nothing
I can do about that now.

207
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:42,035
People can suspect my motives
for these meetings all they want.

208
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:44,719
You and I need to agree
that we have a problem.

209
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,116
I have to do what I can to solve it,

210
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:51,641
and right now that means
talking with every single person here.

211
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:54,922
You should know
there is talk of leaving Atlantis.

212
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:03,361
I hope it doesn't come to that.

213
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,240
Not all change is for the worse.

214
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,199
This is Jumper Three.
We are go for bay launch.

215
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,514
Jumper Three, you are good to go.

216
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:37,482
Yes, we are.

217
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,116
It's strange not pulling any Gs.

218
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:52,674
Yeah. Kinda miss it.

219
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,917
Although at this rate of acceleration,
we'd be dead by now.

220
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:57,484
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

221
00:16:57,645 --> 00:17:01,797
Without inertial dampening, we'd be hit
by so many Gs our eyes would pop,

222
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:05,924
skin would come off our faces,
our brains would hit the back of our skulls

223
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:10,078
and our internal organs
would be crushed into these chairs.

224
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:13,553
What about that sandwich?

225
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,913
We're orbiting the planet. We'll advise
when we're back in radio range.

226
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,883
Copy that, Jumper Three. Good luck.

227
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:29,277
- We still haven't named the planet.
- I'm sure the Ancients have a name for it.

228
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,642
How about Atlantica,
something like that?

229
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:36,115
Didn't we agree you weren't
gonna name anything any more?

230
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,596
Sir...

231
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:45,194
Is that... land?

232
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:50,522
Yes, it is.

233
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:53,404
I wonder how big it is.

234
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:56,079
- Big.
- Really big.

235
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:58,315
- It's huge.
- Define huge.

236
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:03,115
15 million square miles. Well, give or take.

237
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:07,676
That would make it the size of...
I have no idea, but it sounds huge...

238
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:11,474
- How long would it take us to get there?
- 25 minutes by jumper.

239
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:14,000
I saw some sweet breakers
on the south tip.

240
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:16,042
There may be surfing in our future.

241
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:18,514
We should get soil and water samples.

242
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:21,722
Arable land could solve
our food-production problems.

243
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:24,558
- I was thinking of something else.
- Not surfing?

244
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:28,877
No. We can't resume offworld missions
while the Athosians remain in the city.

245
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:30,922
You want to dump them
on the mainland?

246
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:34,077
- We're not sending them to die.
- How would you know?

247
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,713
- It looked wild.
- Just now we were going surfing.

248
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:42,755
That was after we check for monsters
and bugs and other space-related things.

249
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:45,393
I can't imagine it's worse than their home.

250
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:47,283
That may be failure of imagination.

251
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:50,243
A survey would tell us
what we need to know.

252
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:56,239
You're not seriously thinking about this?

253
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:00,484
We're the reason
they had to leave their planet.

254
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:04,437
- This is a complicated situation.
- What does that mean?

255
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:09,156
It means I'm not about to rule anything out
at this point.

256
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:21,841
Dr Weir. Is it true
you've discovered land on this world?

257
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:24,235
Yes, it is.

258
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:29,877
- My people wish to explore it.
- You would?

259
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,320
- We're not welcome here.
- That's not true.

260
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:36,000
It will make us useful as long as
we have no access to the gate.

261
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:39,441
- We don't even know if it's safe.
- We can determine that...

262
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,156
for both our people.

263
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,515
Up until now you've been insisting
on access to the Stargate.

264
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,438
Now you're proposing
to cut yourself off from it?

265
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:53,960
We cannot leave... and we cannot stay.

266
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:59,194
- The mainland gives us a third option.
- I see.

267
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,799
- You said this was a temporary measure.
- Yes.

268
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:06,277
You have the means to assure us passage
between Atlantis and the mainland

269
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:09,005
when you decide
to resume use of the gate.

270
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:11,599
If we resume our missions
through the Stargate

271
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:14,882
and stop encountering
the Wraith at every turn,

272
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:17,479
it will prove
that there is an Athosian spy.

273
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:21,558
And when you continue to encounter
the Wraith at every turn,

274
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:24,114
it will only prove our innocence.

275
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:27,958
Have you discussed this with Teyla?

276
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:31,879
Teyla has made her decision.

277
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:03,634
I understand you're not coming with us.

278
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,319
Dr Weir has arranged for communications
between Atlantis and the mainland.

279
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:23,316
Should you ever need assistance...

280
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:25,476
Thank her for us.

281
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:31,601
I hope...
I don't want anyone to believe that I'm...

282
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,756
Teyla.

283
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,001
The time has come.

284
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:59,236
Go safely.

285
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,236
And you.

286
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:25,915
I've never been separated
from my people before.

287
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:29,316
It must be hard,
but you know you'll see them again.

288
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,713
Do you doubt
you will one day return to Earth?

289
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,955
I can't afford to have doubts.

290
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:41,724
You mean you cannot afford
to let them show.

291
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:45,842
You're still a leader, Teyla.

292
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:50,078
You're doing this
for your people and for their future.

293
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,156
They know that.

294
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:13,441
Anxious to step through the gate again?

295
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,402
- Yes, I am.
- We all are.

296
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:17,840
- Like us to bring back anything?
- No.

297
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:23,796
- Groceries? A new outfit?
- No, just yourselves in one piece, please.

298
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:26,115
- Dial it up.
- (gate revs up)

299
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:28,276
Be safe.

300
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,962
Well, good stuff?

301
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,685
I can't begin to tell you
how fascinating this is.

302
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:59,405
Anthropologist fascinating
or actual fascinating?

303
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,635
Maybe fascinating isn't the right word.

304
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:03,602
Maybe not. How much longer?

305
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:07,880
We'll probably need to come back.
There's just so much here.

306
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:11,117
I can see that.
Is there any way to speed things up?

307
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:14,322
Sure. Find me someone
to translate some of the runes.

308
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:18,797
- Did you say there were natives here?
- They are very shy.

309
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:21,354
They've probably gone into hiding.

310
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:24,437
Can you coax them out,
have them give us a hand?

311
00:24:24,605 --> 00:24:27,039
It is unlikely, but I could try.

312
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,844
Lieutenant, go with her.

313
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:35,557
- It would be better if I went alone.
- You will be alone. With Ford.

314
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:53,196
(Teyla shouts in foreign language)

315
00:24:57,645 --> 00:24:59,636
(Teyla continues shouting)

316
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,556
Maybe they're not around.

317
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:16,037
They are near,
but you are a stranger to them.

318
00:25:16,205 --> 00:25:18,719
They will not come out if you are with me.

319
00:25:20,245 --> 00:25:24,204
They are not a dangerous people,
Lieutenant. I will be fine.

320
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:30,475
All right. I'll wait here.

321
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:35,196
(calls out in foreign language)

322
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:39,999
Call me on the radio if you need me.

323
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,915
(whooshing)

324
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:04,836
Wraith! Get back to the gate now!

325
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,599
(gunfire)

326
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:23,962
Teyla!

327
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,763
Major, what's the situation?

328
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:30,794
We're taking fire. You'll have to
circle around to get back to the gate.

329
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,082
- Teyla's not with me. She went to...
- Find her. Get back.

330
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,756
Move out!

331
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,475
Argh!

332
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,877
(gunfire)

333
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:04,434
Yamato! McKay! Grab the major.

334
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:08,723
- What about Teyla and Ford?
- Now!

335
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:20,763
(Stackhouse) Shut it down.
They're right behind us.

336
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:29,996
OK. On three. One, two, three.

337
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:36,034
- We have to go back.
- Teyla? Lieutenant Ford?

338
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:39,003
- Still there.
- You have Wraith all over the gate.

339
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:41,042
We can't just leave them there.

340
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,878
- How many?
- It's hard to say.

341
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:50,036
We need to mount a rescue operation.

342
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:54,118
I am not gonna send anyone
through that gate until I have all the facts.

343
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:56,640
How did Teyla and Ford get separated?

344
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:59,160
They went to make contact
with the natives.

345
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:04,353
- And whose idea was that?
- Mine. She was following my orders.

346
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:09,645
- Shouldn't you be back in the infirmary?
- No, I'm fine. I didn't take a full blast.

347
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:14,481
- Why didn't you go with them, Major?
- The natives are easily spooked.

348
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:16,795
Teyla thought we'd scare 'em off.

349
00:28:16,965 --> 00:28:19,399
- Teyla did.
- What's that, Sergeant?

350
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,795
She was absent during the ambush.

351
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:25,321
- So was Ford. Maybe it was him.
- I'm just stating a fact.

352
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:28,795
Sergeant, I am only
gonna say this once.

353
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:31,604
With all due respect,
reprimand me if you wish,

354
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:34,677
but it's been six times
your team's been compromised.

355
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:38,235
Only one Athosian
knew about this last mission.

356
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:43,516
- (Stargate alarm)
- Unscheduled offworld activation.

357
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:47,915
It's Teyla's IDC.
Receiving a radio transmission.

358
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:50,883
This is Teyla.
Lieutenant Ford has been wounded.

359
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:53,400
The Wraith are closing in on our position.

360
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,637
Put down that shield
and we could have a Wraith attack.

361
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:59,194
Atlantis, please let us through.

362
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:10,680
Lieutenant, can you confirm the situation?

363
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:13,405
He is unconscious.
Our situation grows desperate.

364
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:16,125
We have no choice
but to go through the Stargate.

365
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:19,163
Who knows what
she'll bring through that gate with her.

366
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:24,762
Open up the damn gate!

367
00:29:32,325 --> 00:29:35,397
Lower the shield.

368
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:56,881
If she were helping the Wraith,
why bother bringing Ford back?

369
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,161
In fact, why bother coming back at all?

370
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:03,318
She's of more use to them in Atlantis.
As for apparently rescuing Ford...

371
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:05,999
She carried him through the damn gate!

372
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:09,316
- We still don't know what happened.
- Oh, that's enough.

373
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:12,682
- It's my job to express concerns.
- I've heard enough.

374
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,962
I believe you're putting
your personal feelings...

375
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,081
You're dismissed.

376
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:27,315
Yes, sir.

377
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:47,564
- What?
- I put him in charge of security.

378
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:52,435
Yes, you did, and if you want
to dismiss me, go ahead.

379
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:57,635
Why don't you go and see
how Lieutenant Ford is doing?

380
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:20,641
You want me to go through her stuff?

381
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:25,881
We're looking for weapons,
transmitters, recording devices.

382
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:29,003
Anything beyond
the Athosians' level of technology.

383
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:31,440
And then we move on to a strip search?

384
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:34,635
Just do it.

385
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:46,200
We were on our way back when
we came under fire. Didn't even see them.

386
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:49,721
We returned fire then broke for the gate.
I was hit from behind.

387
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:52,160
- She saved my ass.
- Of course she did.

388
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:55,522
Major... Ford, how are you feeling?
Pins and needles all over?

389
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:57,004
Welcome to the club.

390
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,202
No, I managed to dive out of the way
of the stunner blast.

391
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:02,925
- I hit my head on the way down.
- Hit your head?

392
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:05,280
Major, I need you to see something.

393
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:09,921
I'll be fine.

394
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:22,635
- What the hell is this?
- It was a request from Sergeant Bates.

395
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:25,763
I'm gonna bust him.
Teyla has nothing to do with this.

396
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:27,802
The thing is, he was right.

397
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:33,834
- Bates was right?
- I was as surprised as you are. Look.

398
00:32:36,085 --> 00:32:40,795
It's her locket. It's a transmitter.
It's been broadcasting a signal.

399
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:44,082
- I wouldn't even have noticed...
- I found it.

400
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:46,918
- What?
- Back on her planet the first time we met.

401
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:51,875
Teyla took me to the old ruins.
That was half-buried in dirt. I gave it to her.

402
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:57,804
I lost this years ago.

403
00:32:57,965 --> 00:33:02,117
The locket isn't powerful enough
to send a signal far through subspace.

404
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:05,118
My guess is there are relay devices
on certain planets

405
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:08,004
that pick up the transmission
and alert a hive ship.

406
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:11,840
- The planets where we were attacked.
- We owe a few people an apology.

407
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:15,957
Teyla had no idea
she was giving away your position?

408
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,481
It was a present from her father.
She lost it when she was a kid.

409
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:22,364
It was dormant
until Major Sheppard picked it up.

410
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:24,959
How come they weren't attacked
back then?

411
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:28,242
- I said it was dormant.
- But if it was activated by touch?

412
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:31,636
You're not listening.
I said Major Sheppard activated it.

413
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:35,161
To the Wraith,
Teyla is just another human being.

414
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,998
They have no interest in her.
Now, Major Sheppard...

415
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:40,554
- Has the Ancient gene.
- Exactly.

416
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:43,523
At one point the Wraiths
and the Ancients were at war.

417
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:46,040
The Wraiths made a device
to detect Ancients.

418
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:49,993
Some Athosian thought
this would make a nice little necklace?

419
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:53,123
How could I know that?
What am I, Answer Man?

420
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:56,834
It wasn't Teyla.
Or any other Athosian, for that matter.

421
00:33:57,005 --> 00:33:59,394
If that's the case...

422
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:04,074
we can use it against 'em.

423
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:14,080
- You seem nervous.
- No, I'm doing this.

424
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:16,964
Yes, you are.
I just said you seemed nervous.

425
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,764
I thought you said,
"You don't have to do this."

426
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:24,237
I'm doing this, despite the fact that feeling
hasn't returned to my extremities.

427
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:31,838
- You're late.
- Sorry.

428
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:35,918
Now, given the Wraiths'
regenerative abilities,

429
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:38,360
killing one
requires some amount of effort.

430
00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:40,481
Capturing one live is another deal.

431
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,842
For these options to work,
your Wraith must be on the ground.

432
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:48,874
The ruins around the Stargate should
force the Wraith to come through on foot.

433
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,754
In which case...
you'll be able to use these.

434
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,484
This is a stun grenade.

435
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:59,761
It contains aluminium
and potassium perchlorate

436
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:02,485
that, when ignited,
produces a high-pressure wave

437
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:06,160
that will overwhelm the target
with intense light and sound.

438
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:12,159
If that doesn't get his head ringing,
in addition... you've got your taser.

439
00:35:13,165 --> 00:35:15,235
(Ford) With a range of 15 to 20 feet,

440
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,316
it delivers a high-voltage charge

441
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:22,479
that limits the body's electrical signals,
temporarily paralysing the victim.

442
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:24,636
(on radio) Major, this is Ford.

443
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:27,558
What you got, Lieutenant?

444
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:31,919
We got company.

445
00:35:33,085 --> 00:35:34,564
Four of them.

446
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,922
- All right, then. We go as planned.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:53,801
- You still seem nervous...
- No, no. It's good. All good.

448
00:36:17,285 --> 00:36:20,004
Teyla.

449
00:36:57,645 --> 00:37:00,205
(Stackhouse)
This one's ours, boys. Tasers!

450
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:39,916
Self-destruct. Take cover!

451
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:53,081
Major! Dr McKay!

452
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:02,078
- You OK?
- I'm fine. This is... This is fun for me.

453
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,962
Easy. Don't go blowing yourself up.

454
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:43,120
Teyla. Excuse me.

455
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:46,402
I hoped to catch you
before you headed back to the mainland.

456
00:38:46,565 --> 00:38:48,635
- I hear they're doing well.
- Very well.

457
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:51,797
Halling says they're planting crops
for the next harvest.

458
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:55,560
- I'm glad to hear it.
- I will tell them what has happened.

459
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:59,195
Hopefully we will be able
to put the past week's events behind us.

460
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:05,042
Yes. I am aware that the last few days
have been particularly difficult for you.

461
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:10,962
I believe, Dr Weir, that in your place
I would have done the same.

462
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:14,560
Thank you.

463
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:48,639
Again? Your kind is persistent.

464
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:51,273
I would have thought
you'd given up by now.

465
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:57,918
Hell, I've got all the time in the world.
Now, you, on the other hand...

466
00:40:02,085 --> 00:40:05,043
The Ancients were pretty good at shields,
weren't they?

467
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:07,082
(grunts)

468
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:10,282
I give you a week. Maybe two, tops.

469
00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:15,394
You waste your time.
I will provide you with no information.

470
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:18,921
I wonder what hurts more:
The gunshot wound or the hunger?

471
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:22,873
Because I'd love to help out,
but how did McKay put it?

472
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:28,122
We can't meet your dietary requirements.

473
00:40:30,285 --> 00:40:35,359
When I am free,
you will be the first that I feed upon.

474
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:37,516
Okey-dokey.

475
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,802
I'm gonna go make myself a sandwich.

476
00:40:40,965 --> 00:40:43,798
Human.

477
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:48,882
You think you've won a victory
by my capture,

478
00:40:49,045 --> 00:40:53,596
but by bringing me here
you've only hastened your own doom.

479
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:58,964
It's only a matter of time before
the others of my kind come to rescue me,

480
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:05,642
and when they do, there'll be
nowhere in this world you can hide.

481
00:41:10,525 --> 00:41:12,595
Stay positive, now.

482
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:40,081
