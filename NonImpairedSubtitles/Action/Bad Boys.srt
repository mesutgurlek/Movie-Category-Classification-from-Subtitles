1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,281
What is this having-a-picnic shit in my car?

2
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,949
Please, man, I'm not getting my sex at home.

3
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,787
Don't deny me this.

4
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,293
You sleep with a beautiful woman every night.

5
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,296
I'm married. That's what married means.

6
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,026
It means you sleep together, but you can't get none.

7
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,663
Watch it with all that shit, all right?

8
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,571
Look, where's your cup holders?

9
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,272
- I don't have one. - You don't have one?

10
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,373
$80,000 for this car, and you ain't got no cup holder?

11
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:28,851
It's $105,000. This is one of the
fastest production cars on the planet.

12
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,083
Zero to sixty in four seconds,
sweetie. This is a limited edition.

13
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:36,127
You damn right it's limited. No cup holder, no backseat.

14
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,595
It's a shiny dick with two chairs in it.

15
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,495
I guess we the balls just dragging the fuck along.

16
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,504
Damn. Sorry.

17
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,177
- Get it. - I can't get down there.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,716
You got an engine floor up here.
My shit won't go down in there.

19
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,911
Go. Titty-titty, strutty-strutty.

20
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,749
Go on. Make them want it.

21
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,552
I ain't your wife to be cleaning up after you.

22
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,526
Watch my hand. My shit can't get down there. It gets stuck.

23
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:13,257
- You come up with this shit. - Get that fry.

24
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,733
This ain't no goddamn Denny's. Don't eat in my car.

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,338
I wouldn't buy shit from Denny's. I
don't like the way we been treated.

26
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,339
They bit, Jack. Let's skank these fools.

27
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,572
You ain't interested in the fry. You all up in that.

28
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,738
- Get out of the car, man. - Shit.

29
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,646
- What the fuck? - Me and my team have had a big week...

30
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,719
so just get the fuck out of the car.

31
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,312
Damn. What are you weighing, 350?

32
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,550
I bet you're a big chicken-eating motherfucker.

33
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:43,321
- Get the fuck out. - I always get the big motherfuckers.

34
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,364
- Get out of the car now! - All right!

35
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,799
- Hold on. - Now this is some funny shit.

36
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,530
Let me tell you how bad a day you're having.

37
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,230
You're jacking two cops.

38
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,467
Yeah? I'm a stand-up comedian, and I suck!

39
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,840
- That's why I need your car. - I ain't no Wesley Snipes.

40
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,643
I just hang out with stupid-ass
friends that drive stupid-ass cars...

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,844
that attract a lot of motherfucking attention!

42
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,285
I need to jump over this car and smack you in your head.

43
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,416
- You're arguing over a French
fry! - It's not about the French fry!

44
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,994
It's about your lack of respect for other people's property!

45
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,060
- Shut the fuck up! - This shit is stupid.

46
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,156
Hold the fuck on!

47
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,565
You want something bad enough? Come get some!

48
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,440
You like that shit?

49
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,169
Wesley Snipes, Passenger57.

50
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,041
Now give me a motherfucking Handiwipe.

51
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,115
Let's hear one of those jokes, bitch.

52
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,809
What do you think, guys? Looks like the real thing.

53
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,607
You remember your assignment?

54
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,546
Yeah, I'm the decoy.

55
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,208
Yes, you are.

56
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,050
What the fuck you doing?

57
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,962
Hello. Police?

58
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:35,467
I just saw a policeman shot on
South Miami and First Street.

59
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,967
Help, please.

60
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,004
All units, officer down.

61
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,164
Officer down. Respond code three.

62
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,344
All units in the vicinity, respond and identify.

63
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,193
This is Air Unit Two. We've got a full perimeter.

64
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,497
Officer down. We need additional ground units.

65
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,574
Air Three, roger. Suspector suspects unknown.

66
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,449
Gentlemen, it's clear.

67
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,984
We're inside.

68
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,096
- We're in. - You got 20 minutes.

69
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,101
Goddamn taco is gonna kill me.

70
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,788
Guys, you got 12minutes. Let's go.

71
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,144
Clear. We're in.

72
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,972
Move your ass. We've got six minutes.

73
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,139
Ready.

74
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,181
Ready to fire. Go!

75
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,824
Fire!

76
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,427
- Clear. - Go.

77
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,546
Come on! Let's go! Get out of here! Move it!

78
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,711
Damn.

79
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,281
Did you have sweet dreams?

80
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,011
You're so nasty.

81
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,385
You're always saying you want quality time.

82
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,449
Right now, I got the time and
you damn sure got the quality.

83
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,995
- Come on now. - You know what it is?

84
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,602
I can't remember the last time we fell asleep together.

85
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,877
Baby, it's my job. It's what it requires.

86
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,416
I'm a better cop when I get some in the morning.

87
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,576
- I feel lighter on my feet. - Keep it in your pants, baby.

88
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,586
I hear three little Burnetts coming down the hall.

89
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,124
That's cold. You're leaving me here like a humping dog.

90
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,292
- Hi, baby boy. - Mommy.

91
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,660
- Boy, what's up? - Daddy!

92
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,003
Dad, at school, people say I look weird.

93
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,302
They say my ears look funny.

94
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,276
Boy, your daddy has that same problem. I got the ears.

95
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,906
You know what? They just out there
for you to listen to people's problems.

96
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,246
You're an angel. These are your wings.

97
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,841
That's all.

98
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,045
James, stop. Would you take them off...

99
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,022
Your ears are better for you to listen with.

100
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,184
Don't let me come down to school. I'll arrest the principal.

101
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,193
- Mom! - What?

102
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,263
- James keeps pushing me! Quit
it! - Talking about my boy's ears.

103
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,888
Do what your mama said.

104
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,991
- Uncle Mike's in the house. - What's up, Uncle Mike?

105
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,967
- Partner. - What's going on?

106
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,504
Quincy, check it out.

107
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,769
- Why did you take my food? - Hey, girl.

108
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,004
Don't kiss me. I don't know
where your lips were last night. Move.

109
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,313
Uncle Mike, did you have a date last night?

110
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,317
Did I!

111
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,115
- Let me tell you, boy. This girl was... - Hey!

112
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,019
Don't tell my son your sleazy sex stories.

113
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,025
I only tell your husband my sleazy sex stories.

114
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,618
I don't want him knowing about
them either; gives him ideas.

115
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,166
Why you putting me in this? I'm with my babies.

116
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,963
- Thank you. - Hello?

117
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,834
- Eat. Go on, girl. - No problem.

118
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,940
- You're on the mike with Mike. - 
Want Daddy to wipe your mouth?

119
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,074
I think you mean to say, "Get our
asses down there, please, " Captain.

120
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,086
- Now! - Maybe not.

121
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,861
What's up, boy?

122
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,631
- Hey, baby! - Hey, Francine. Where's Howard?

123
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,898
He's down there. He's looking
for you. He's been in better moods.

124
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,372
Damn.

125
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,706
Get it done, goddamn it.

126
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,946
Welcome to our nightmare, boys.

127
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,544
See this? What's wrong with this picture?

128
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,553
Remember this room?

129
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,491
Don't these flats look familiar?

130
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,050
There were these silver packets. They looked like bricks.

131
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,596
Little red tags on them, about so high.

132
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,495
- All that heroin is gone. - This was our career bust...

133
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,659
worth $100 million.

134
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,100
- Gone. - This is bad.

135
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,729
No, let me call it what it is. This is fucked up.

136
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,503
- You got that right, detective. - Hello, Alison.

137
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,445
You guys know Captain Sinclair,
Internal Affairs' top watchdog.

138
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,381
I'd actually take that as a compliment
if I didn't know you so well.

139
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,887
Excuse me, but if you two want to
get personal, I could step out...

140
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,718
There's nothing personal here. I'm just doing my job.

141
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,258
I love knowing that one leak...

142
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,761
one headline could turn this nightmare into a media frenzy.

143
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,629
That won't happen. We'll get the
dope back before that ever happens.

144
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,429
Good. Start by looking right here.

145
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,472
This had to be an inside job, and I'll find out about it.

146
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,604
Sanchez, Ruiz, you're late.

147
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,911
Somebody put this in for toxic drug fumes.

148
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,881
Yeah, this was a brilliant design.

149
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,111
This was really intelligent. I like this.

150
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,984
I didn't ask how he feels. I said, "What did he see?

151
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,023
What does he know?"

152
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,027
Where werey'all last night?

153
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,460
Have your cousins bring the shit
back, and we can all get some sleep.

154
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,466
We were gonna do that, but we came up with a problem.

155
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,900
Your mama snorted up all the dope.

156
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,630
You two, get over there.

157
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,801
O'Fee will be all right, but he's got nothing to tell us.

158
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,471
So they kill a decoy, it empties the station. Very smart.

159
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,015
But they don't kill a real cop because
they had the whole force on their ass.

160
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,950
This was your case. You're back on it.

161
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,455
Sanchez, Ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need.

162
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,151
- Shut your mouths. - But wait a second.

163
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,353
It was Carrera's drugs in the first place.

164
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,623
But it couldn't have been him
because he was killed in prison.

165
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,528
What about the rest of his crew?

166
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,601
Those idiots don't have the precision to do this, but...

167
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,999
just in case I'm wrong, you check them out.

168
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:36,131
They'd have been up here with Uzis,
splashing O'Fee all over the place.

169
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,970
Takes a lot of brains to pull this off.

170
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,069
- Big cojones too. - What the hell are you talking about?

171
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,183
It would take me a month to explain to you what cojones is.

172
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,309
- You're in Miami. You don't know... - In English.

173
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,319
What's the matter with you? We've got nothing!

174
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,360
The guy who pulled this off knew what he was doing...

175
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,862
and he left us nothing but a big "Fuck you."

176
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,727
Find out who installed the ventilating system. Do that now.

177
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,199
- That's cold. - Yeah, so is your mama's bed.

178
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,606
This could definitely be an inside job. Don't rule it out.

179
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:16,379
We've got 72 hours before the FBI and the DEA...

180
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,883
walk in here and shut us down, and we'll be the bad guys.

181
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,011
Politics demand that somebody take the rap for this.

182
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:28,422
It's going to be us. Just do what you do, only faster.
 
183
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,222
Jo jo, what's up?

184
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,389
You're still a chemist, right?
Cutting drugs and shit like that?

185
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:37,401
I don't know nothing about that.
I'm out of the drug business.

186
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,528
- You know something. - You don't know nothing?

187
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,435
I just said no to drugs.

188
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,840
- What are you into, Jo? - I'm into rubber.

189
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,244
- You're selling tires? - Yeah.

190
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:53,340
- Jo jo don't know nothing. - Nothing. I know tires.

191
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,888
- You're telling me the truth? - Would I lie to you?

192
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,751
- Would you lie to me? - I'm driving.

193
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,562
- Man, this is a waste of time. - Come on.

194
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,160
In Max's line of work, she definitely gets the 411.

195
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,900
Maxi! How did I know I would find you up in here?

196
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,280
We have to talk. Is there someplace we can go?

197
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,042
Yeah. Equipment room?

198
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,379
- Behave your self. - I'm cool.

199
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,490
Listen, I need some help, again.

200
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,090
What else is new?

201
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,606
Major ill shit happened down at the police department.

202
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,447
There's a lot of hero in involved.
There will be a lot of cash involved.
 
203
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,818
There will definitely be some jolly young
men who want to party.

204
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,447
What do you need?

205
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,958
A lot of people will talk to you that won't talk to me.

206
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,996
You mean customers?

207
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,622
I'm not asking you to get into any wild shit.

208
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:19,033
- Just call me if you hear something. - I think I will call you.

209
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,971
What the hell are you doing?

210
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,051
Trying to keep my shit quick.

211
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,642
That's right. You ain't getting none at home.

212
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,153
You got extra energy. Go ahead. Burn it off, baby.

213
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,120
We got anything, Francine?

214
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,820
Sanchez says the air-conditioning contract went...

215
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,522
to Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.

216
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,658
He's working out of his house this week. That's the number.

217
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,508
He's not answering.

218
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,841
I guess we should just leave.

219
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,940
What? Make a trip all the way down
here to high society for nothing?

220
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,677
That's why they have windows.

221
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,685
- We can peek in. - Yeah, that should do it.

222
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,528
- I tripped. - The handle just opened?

223
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,358
Right after I tripped, it just opened.

224
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,697
I guess they want us to come in, take a peek.

225
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,031
Hello?

226
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,504
We're your new neighbors.

227
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,132
Don't be alarmed. We're Negroes.

228
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,041
Man, there's too much bass in your voice.

229
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,637
That scares white folks. You've got to sound like them.

230
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,377
We were wondering if we could borrow some brown sugar?

231
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,721
- You fart? - No, man.

232
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,460
Dead guy.

233
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,741
Looks like somebody's home.

234
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,584
Let me take a stab at this one.

235
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,284
He sells the ventilation plans to the bad guys.

236
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,760
- He gets rich, but he gets dead. - You're right on that one.

237
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,889
- I'll go call Homicide. - Whoa. Wait.

238
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,127
Why do you act like this every
time we're around a dead body?

239
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,703
It's cool. I just...

240
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,965
Please, look around.

241
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,802
The smell and the fumes...

242
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,811
It's just unexpected, that's all.

243
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,320
Looks like our buddy Arrona was a bit of a gambler.

244
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,290
He's got dog track, jai alai.

245
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,157
Probably needed the money to pay off his debts.

246
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,661
Bookie.

247
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,959
- Whoops. - Damn, man.

248
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,899
Watch where you're swinging a dead leg.

249
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,471
My bad.

250
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,235
Damn this. I'm calling Homicide.

251
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,207
I'm a narcotics cop.

252
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,207
Dead bodies.

253
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,810
Dead ends.

254
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,859
Maggots.

255
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,661
- What's wrong with you? - A little nauseous...

256
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,897
I'm gonna...

257
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,573
What do you say we grab a couple burritos?

258
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,851
You drive almost slow enough to drive Miss Daisy.

259
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,282
Man, the transaction is done, all right?

260
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,793
- We ain't got shit, so it's over. - Relax.

261
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,363
We got it before. We'll get it again.

262
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,025
Yeah, you got it all figured out, don't you?

263
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,863
You got to have faith, player.

264
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,495
By the time we figured out how, we'd be out of a job.

265
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:19,043
No, scratch that. Everybody in
the damn unit will be out of a job.

266
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:24,138
But don't worry. They tend to
think Mike Lowrey will be all right.

267
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:28,413
Especially since they think you some rich kid playing cop.

268
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,853
Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund.

269
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,393
For me: No job, no check.

270
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,590
That's like all the other guys in the unit. Most of us.

271
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,723
So I'm playing cop now?

272
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,162
This is a game. I'm just joking around.

273
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,738
You always wanted to be Starsky or Hutch.

274
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:54,575
Know what? I'm so sick of this bullshit.

275
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,207
I'm supposed to apologize for
my family leaving me money?

276
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,911
All I ever wanted to be was a cop.

277
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,521
I get up early and take it to the max every day.

278
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,921
I'm the first guy through the door
and the last to leave the crime scene...

279
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,255
so fuck you and fuck them...

280
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,592
and fuck everybody who got a problem with Mike Lowrey.

281
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,334
- I love you, man. - Fuck you, Marcus.

282
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:24,098
I do. You're cool with me. You're my partner.

283
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,372
Shut up. Slow-ass driver.

284
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,379
- Driving like a bitch. - Why I got to be all that?

285
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,609
- Slow-ass Miss Daisy. - I'll take me and you off this cliff...

286
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,277
you keep fucking with me.

287
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,787
Then it will be two bitches in the sea.

288
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,949
- Is that what you want? - Shut up.

289
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,994
My wife know I ain't no bitch.

290
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,792
- Yeah. - I'm a bad boy.

291
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,664
Badboys, badboys What you gonna do

292
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,567
What you gonna do when they come for you

293
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,799
Shelly, only models, and that's all.

294
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,670
Max just dropped by. I have to go.

295
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,539
Bye.

296
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,473
You want me to call around looking for the newly rich?

297
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,679
Are there any new guys partying
a lot, spending a lot of money?

298
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,982
Actually, this guy called me this morning, desperate...

299
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,989
every two hours... looking for new girls in town.

300
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,581
Are you available this afternoon?

301
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,856
- It will be a quick $2,000. - I've got plans with Julie.

302
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,988
- She's your roommate, right? - Yeah.

303
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,498
Bring her. She's cute. She's sexy. Go on.

304
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,162
- She's not a working girl, Lois. - 
Doesn't matter. He's on speedballs.

305
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,671
He's probably so messed up, he can't even get it up.

306
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,833
Maybe we'll go check it out.

307
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,308
It could be the party I'm looking for.

308
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,007
A party at the Bilt more? That will really rock.

309
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,675
- Julie, I owe you one. - Forget about it.

310
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,686
I'll just deduct it from the hundreds
off avors I already owe you.

311
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,348
Am I turning into the guest that won't leave?

312
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,857
I like having you live with me.

313
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,860
I'm an out-of-work photographer
who doesn't know how to cook.

314
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,795
- Not a big upside for you there. - Come on.

315
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:58,029
What incredibly hip individual
inspired this visit to the Bilt more?

316
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,366
- It's a favor for Mike Lowrey. - Right.

317
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,373
The cop who I think you may be a little bit in love with.

318
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,875
Maybe I am, but we're just friends.

319
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:10,539
And if I were ever in trouble, he's
the only person I would call.

320
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,641
I know. I think I've heard this before.

321
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,819
- Hello. - Hi.

322
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,255
You must be Max.

323
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,258
Welcome. I'm Eddie.

324
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,555
The Al Capone suite.

325
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:29,100
- I guess we're a little early. - This is my friend, Julie.

326
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,333
You like Al Capone, don't you?

327
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,340
I hadn't really thought about it much.

328
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,839
I'm not kidding about this being Capone's.

329
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,940
He had the place rigged with secret passageways.

330
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,951
Ten minutes, we're out of here.

331
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,078
- Five. - One drink.

332
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,780
- What's the whispering about? - One sip.

333
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,585
It's Eddie here.

334
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,421
Just girl chat.

335
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,722
Where's the bathroom?

336
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,694
Upstairs on your right.

337
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,857
Watch your step.

338
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,603
Come. Sit.

339
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,765
Enjoy your self. Relax.

340
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,867
Eddie's got some favors to play with.

341
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,208
Yes, Eddie does.

342
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,941
I should have told you sooner about Eddie's private party.

343
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,780
Now it's a surprise party.

344
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:32,288
Okay, Max, we've been here about five minutes too long.

345
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,638
I see you treat your self well.

346
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,139
Yeah.

347
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,805
I needed to blow off a little steam
after the move, you know?

348
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:54,113
So a little party with a couple of friends. That's all.

349
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,347
I was gonna invite you guys.

350
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,323
Invite? It looks like I'm catering this.

351
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,652
I was looking for my two keys of dope,
and now I know where they are.

352
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,665
Yours? It's our score.

353
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,667
- And the girl? - Nobody.

354
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,469
- Just entertainment. - Hi, I'm Max.

355
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,271
Nice to meet you.

356
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:25,613
I like a woman who takes pride in her appearance.

357
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,852
Don't you?

358
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,618
Yeah, I hate when a bitch lets her self slide.

359
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,626
You look like a model in that dress.

360
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,127
Will you model for me, Max?

361
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,363
Great. It's the goon squad.

362
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,501
You were a cop for so long, you should know hookers talk.

363
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,629
You couldn't wait four more days until I made the deal?

364
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,071
I can't work with that kind of stupidity!

365
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:28,009
Stupidity? I got you connected inside!

366
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,605
I brought you my family.

367
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:36,016
Eddie, it's my family now.

368
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,424
Fouchet, we're still friends.

369
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,961
- What are you guys doing? - You pissed him off.

370
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,024
Use a smaller gun. You got blood on me again.

371
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,035
- Somebody's upstairs. - Where? Go!

372
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,971
Get her! Move, Fergie!

373
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,288
Get her!

374
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,186
What the fuck?

375
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,154
Fucking shoes suck! Get her!

376
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,199
- God! - Move it!

377
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,800
Go!

378
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,968
Shoot her!

379
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,659
- I got her. Bullshit. - I got her.

380
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,495
No, I got her. What do you know about shooting?

381
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,535
I can't believe she made it.

382
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,729
- Jesus. - Are you serious?

383
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,535
- She jumped. - Fuck.

384
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,010
Find out who she worked for and where she lives.

385
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:22,359
It's about fucking time. Lowrey, Burnett, come here!

386
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,224
Look at this. You see this guy?

387
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,957
- He's dead, right? - Yeah.

388
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,363
- He look familiar? - Eddie Dominguez.

389
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,560
- The ex-cop. - Two points for you.

390
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:34,069
There's some of our high-grade heroin over there.

391
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,005
Sinclair will love that headline.

392
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,042
There's no signs of forced entry.

393
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,738
What the fuck is all this? It looks like Beirut.

394
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,507
It's the Al Capone suite.

395
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,776
What can I say? Shit happens.

396
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,683
This is a real shitty day.

397
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,916
Looks like we have two shades of lipstick here, gentlemen.

398
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,049
Somebody is missing from the party.

399
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,627
Listen to me.

400
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,663
Your only function in life right now
is to find that person. Find her.

401
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,926
It's the only good lead we got all day.

402
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,468
Man, I'll check all calls to the room.

403
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,648
What you got over there, partner?

404
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,527
Cover her.

405
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,728
He knew the girl?

406
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,481
Look, man...

407
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,518
we'll get the witness and the fools who did this.

408
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:58,053
Yeah. Listen, catch a ride with Howard.

409
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,454
- Where you going? - Eight calls were made to Lois Fields.

410
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,925
That's who Max used to work for. I'll check that out.

411
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,156
- I'll come with you. - I'm all right. We'll catch up later.

412
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:11,531
- You okay? - I'm cool.

413
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,811
Hello?

414
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,484
Shit.

415
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:37,486
Yeah, baby. Look, I know quality time was my idea.

416
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,655
- Don't talk about quality time. - But... Hold on, baby.
 
417
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,996
Look here, I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez.

418
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,797
- That will take a minute. - Hold on.

419
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,802
- Marcus, I got on there done. - Baby?

420
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,670
You have on the red one? The one with the snaps?

421
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,800
- Why couldn't you wait till... - You're never home.

422
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,139
- Theresa... Hold on. - All his file sareblocked.
 
423
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,714
I don't give a damn about his personal files.

424
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,273
- The man's dead. Unblock it. - Screw you. That's illegal.

425
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,818
Screw you!

426
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,019
- Fucking... - Marcus, are you talking tome?

427
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,185
I'm not talking to... It's a term you use, baby.

428
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,025
- "Screw you" is a cop term. - You ain't screwing nothing!

429
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,698
Goddamn it!

430
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,238
Where's Lowrey?

431
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,829
I just paged him.

432
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,442
He's following up this Lois Fields lead.

433
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,941
The madam?

434
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:46,127
21-2, request backup. 614 Reach Road.

435
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,218
Don't mess with us.

436
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,559
That might be him.

437
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,360
Yeah. Lowrey's desk.

438
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,405
I need to talk to Detective Mike Lowrey.

439
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,235
This is Captain Howard. Can I help you?

440
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,106
You can get me Lowrey.

441
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,179
This is not another paternity case, is it?

442
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,340
No, it's another murder case, you twerp.

443
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,078
Are you talking about the murder
case at the Biltmore Hotel tonight?

444
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,316
Listen, I've just seen my best friend get murdered...

445
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,587
and I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.

446
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,787
Why only Mike Lowrey? I have a detective here...

447
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,829
None of your fucking business.

448
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,399
Either I talk to Lowrey or I'm blowing town.

449
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,559
Mike, telephone!

450
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,105
He's coming right now. Hold on, please.

451
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,765
- Talk to her. - I ain't got time for these games.

452
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,241
This is the witness, the girl at the hotel.

453
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,781
Yeah, he just got out of the john. Hold on. Talk to her.

454
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,942
- If you don't talk to her, she'll
walk. - Captain, I can't be Mike.

455
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,643
Just talk to her now. She's gonna walk.

456
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,948
- This is our witness. - Calm down.

457
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,463
Hello. This is Mike Lowrey.

458
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,963
He doesn't talk that way. Try to talk sexy.

459
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,967
- Come on. - You don't sound sexy enough.

460
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,766
Captain! I've been there.

461
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:41,607
You don't know me. My name's Julie Mott.

462
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,805
I was Max Logan's best friend.

463
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,476
Whoa. Calm down. Talk to me now.

464
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,187
- Yeah. - She said if she ever needed anything...

465
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,429
I need your help.

466
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,987
Give me the address. All right.

467
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,624
It's gonna be all right. Mike's to the rescue.

468
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,499
- I'm on the way. All right. - I'll see if I can find Lowrey.

469
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,105
- I can't go. - You have to go.

470
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,834
- Go! - Get Mike down here to handle this.

471
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,503
Get to this address now. Get out of the chair.

472
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:19,048
- You won't see your wife for a month! - Goddamn it, man.

473
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,629
Get this fucking door fixed.

474
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,705
Easy.

475
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,401
Shit.

476
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,910
- Who's there? - Mike Lowrey.

477
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,986
How do I know it's Mike Lowrey?

478
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,647
'Cause I'm Mike Lowrey.

479
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,552
We ain't got much time.

480
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,989
Hold your badge up to the peephole.

481
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,927
I'm not letting you in until you do!

482
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,896
No way.

483
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,875
- What was that for? - You're not Mike Lowrey!

484
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,775
What do you mean? You never even met him... me.

485
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,747
- Max described you differently! - I'm undercover!

486
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,681
- All right! - Prove it!

487
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,082
I knew Max from way back.

488
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,213
- I helped her brother get out of jail. - Yeah, so?

489
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:37,761
So, from time to time, we'd get
together, a little bump and grind.

490
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,592
- Wrong. - Give me that!

491
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:44,792
Give me the bat! You want to go out? Fine!

492
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,961
You don't want to believe me, you go at this shit alone!

493
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:53,469
I forgot! The bad guys probably know where you live.

494
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,172
Which means they're coming for your ass. Good luck.

495
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,878
I saw the whole thing.

496
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,247
I watched them shoot her like she was nothing.

497
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,558
Please shut the door.

498
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,161
Look, lady...

499
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,668
do you have any more bats, golf clubs...

500
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,729
or anything like that you could swing at me?

501
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,900
I knew Max.

502
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,640
I care about Max also.

503
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,649
I'm just here to help you.

504
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,547
You're not what I expected.

505
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,052
I didn't expect to walk into Yankee Stadium either.

506
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:48,927
Now, we have to get out of here. Let's go.

507
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,660
I have to get my dogs. Come here, Dukie.

508
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,669
Come here, Lukie, Dukie, whatever.

509
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,205
You got a back door?

510
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,865
Where are we going?

511
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:02,139
- Protective custody. - Fuck that. I'm only dealing with you.

512
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,010
That was a cop that threw that
little party back at the Biltmore.

513
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,051
Former cop. We got rid of him a long time ago.

514
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,245
- Come on, Luke. - Listen, lady.

515
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,585
If you want to live, you ain't got
no choice. You got to trust me.

516
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,559
- My God! - Go!

517
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,889
Move!

518
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,033
Run!

519
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:49,059
- Get the dog! - Here, doggie!

520
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,186
Jesus Christ! Who the hell was that?

521
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:56,027
- Let's go! - There is too much killing going on!

522
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,761
- Go after them! I'll go around front! - I got them!

523
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,839
Come on! Move your ass! Let's go!

524
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,635
Fuck.

525
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,988
- Get in the car! - Damn it.

526
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,626
- Go, goddamn it! - Fucking door!

527
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,246
How did you miss them? You fat fuck!

528
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,975
Watch your fucking mouth!

529
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,914
If you'd lose some weight, you would have caught them!

530
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,748
I'd like to squeeze your little fucking head, you bastard!

531
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,823
Now you're in fucking trouble!

532
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,289
- You get the license plate? - Yeah, I got the fucking plate.

533
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,883
You cockeyed fuck.

534
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,825
This is your getaway car?

535
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,696
We won't get away from anything in this.
Is this a goddamn family station wagon?

536
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,668
My God, you have a baby seat in the back.

537
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,467
It's an undercover car.

538
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,440
Shit! I know they got a look at my license plate.

539
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,340
Were those the guys who shot Max?

540
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,935
What guys? I only saw bullets.

541
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,570
You tell me what they looked like.

542
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,582
I don't know! I was too busy trying
to keep a bullet out your ass!

543
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:24,176
Julie, I'll need you to look through some mug shots...

544
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,279
until you can identify Max's shooter.

545
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,415
- Where will we do that? - Protective custody.

546
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,757
No way! I told you I am not going into protective custody!

547
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,956
Look, lady, I'm not playing. You're really pissing me off!

548
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,623
I'll book your narrow ass!

549
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,531
Yeah? I'll develop amnesia.

550
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,503
I suddenly feel a little case of it coming on right now.

551
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,438
Fine, lady. Where would you feel safe?

552
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,772
You want to do protective custody?

553
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,572
We'll do in-home protective custody.

554
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,512
At your place, all right? I can handle going to your place.

555
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,139
Yeah, my place.

556
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,775
My place is... No way.

557
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:02,181
Right. My place. Yeah, my place is shit.

558
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,160
Mike Lowrey place. You right.

559
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,287
That's the best idea you came up with tonight.

560
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,368
Wait here.

561
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:23,677
- Detective Burnett, how are you ? - I'm cool.

562
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,646
- Mr. Lowrey's not here. He's out. - I know.

563
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,580
- He said I could use his place tonight. - Really?

564
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,778
He didn't mention it to me.

565
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,215
Who's the chick? How's your wife?

566
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,721
She's fine.

567
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,228
Your kids are good?

568
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,323
- Family's the most important thing. - Is it?

569
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,527
Mr. Lowrey told me you got a baby
factory going on at your house.

570
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,434
- Is that true? - Here you go.

571
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,865
If that ain't enough, I'll run you in for extortion.

572
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,207
You know, I'm so stupid sometimes.

573
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,246
- Are you ? - Now that you mention it...

574
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,714
Mr. Lowrey did mention you coming by tonight.

575
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,307
What did he say? Did he say he had a key?

576
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,948
- Hang out. Here you go. - Hang out?

577
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,853
- Is this it? - Yeah. You're hurting me.

578
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,085
- Thank you . - Good to see you.

579
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,788
- Good to see you . - Have fun.

580
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,627
- It's not like that. - Sure.

581
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,406
Yeah, come on. Watch your step walking through.

582
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,070
Damn, I must have left some incense burning.

583
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,012
Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.

584
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,910
This is kind of...

585
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,250
I'm always moving my switches.

586
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,619
I'm always decorating, so sometimes
I just don't know where shit is.

587
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,392
Damn! Shit!

588
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,189
Why am I tripping on shit I know is there?

589
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,167
You found a light switch.

590
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:55,067
I should have known it was there
since I decorated the place.

591
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,969
Yeah.

592
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,769
Hi, Mike. This is Yvette.

593
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,936
Ignore this. It's one of my freaks, Yvette.

594
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,276
She's always calling. Got to have it.

595
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,475
Don't call no more now, freak.

596
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:12,454
- All this on a cop's salary? - I feel like having your ight now...

597
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,955
It's honest money.

598
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,356
I'm a second generation rich kid.

599
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,826
So if you're not in it for the paycheck...

600
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,261
are you some kind of action junkie?

601
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,697
Yeah. If that's what you want to call it.

602
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:27,999
I don't mind bats swung at my head,
bullets damn near grazing my ass.

603
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,972
Gives me a rush. Look...

604
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,600
let me give you a broad stroke of the place.

605
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:37,112
Got some T-bones in the fridge for Luke and Dukie.

606
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,478
Sorry. Your fridge is this way.

607
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:43,542
- I confuse my own shit. - Wait a minute.

608
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:48,216
- You're leaving me here alone? - 
Yeah, I have to get back to work.

609
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:53,024
- These are Miami's peak crime hours. - Apparently.

610
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,861
They said that this deal was going down in four days.

611
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:02,632
I obviously seem to be kind of a major glitch...

612
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,267
You ain't with the bad guys now.

613
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,844
You're with the cops...

614
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,811
with Mike Lowrey.

615
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,712
Everything will be all right. Trust me.

616
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,682
I'll be back.

617
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:19,244
I know there's no time to joke, but remember in the movie...

618
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,018
All right.

619
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,425
Thanks for everything, Mike.

620
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,297
I'm going.

621
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,571
- Chet. - That was quick. You one of those guys?

622
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,267
- In and out. - It's not like that.

623
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,173
The girl's a witness. I need you to keep an eye out.

624
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,905
- No problem. - Now listen to me.

625
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,504
- Hear me. That's right. - Me?

626
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:50,576
The moment Lowrey gets in, have him call me at home.

627
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,280
- At my home. - Call you at home.

628
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,254
Use this phone. Do not let him go upstairs.

629
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,383
Don't let him go upstairs? But he lives here.

630
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,757
I don't want to argue with Mr. Lowrey. I could lose my job.

631
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,023
Trust me on this, okay?

632
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,793
Call you from here. Don't let him up.

633
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,766
- No problem. - Important witness.

634
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,097
Thank you.

635
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,502
I got a better idea. I'm getting off in two hours.

636
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,234
Lf you want, I could go upstairs and watch the door.

637
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,276
Like the cops do in the movies? They sit on a stool?

638
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,777
I got a magazine and everything.

639
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,278
I don't let anybody in or out.

640
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,310
Seriously, all kidding aside, I want to help.

641
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,114
You're helping. Can you do it from here?

642
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,281
- Yeah, I can do it from here. - Fine.

643
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,882
- That helps. From here, okay? - All right.

644
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,258
It's funny that you ask me, because I was going to be a cop.

645
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,762
I took the test.

646
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,800
Just didn't work out. Politics.

647
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,199
Yeah. I know.

648
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,238
- You're my deputy. - I'm your deputy.

649
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,933
- Watch out for everything. - You got it.

650
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,043
Take care, Chief.

651
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,610
I'm a deputy.

652
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:52,773
Don't "honey baby" me. You smell like perfume.

653
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,316
It was just...

654
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,444
You don't even have your wedding ring on!

655
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,481
Damn.

656
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,492
I went undercover.

657
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:08,327
It required taking off the ring
for a second, but I got the ring.

658
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,162
I just put my hand in my pocket
because that's where it was...

659
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,065
and it's right back on, baby.

660
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,703
Can I get a pillow?

661
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:19,104
If it isn't the guy who doesn't return phone calls.

662
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,476
Where have you been the last 12 hours?

663
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,516
I've been paging you all night.

664
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,348
We got a situation here you need to know about.

665
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,184
Look, I got a dead madam...

666
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,724
I got a concussion and I got a real bad headache.

667
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,556
You got a headache? Let me tell you what I did last night.

668
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,653
I had to sleep on my couch.

669
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,198
I wake up with a Power Ranger stuck up my ass.

670
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,134
And while we're discussing my
ass, I damn near got it blown off.

671
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,172
But the good news is I got a witness.

672
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,505
Let me tell you about this witness. She likes to...

673
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:58,308
- You sound like a nagging wife. - I'm nagging.

674
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,714
You see what happens when you go
off with out me? You get into shit.

675
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,515
Like shit don't happen when you're there.

676
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,885
That ain't the point.

677
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,390
The point is if your partner pages you ...

678
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,324
 you might want to get back to your partner.

679
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,862
I want to meet the man who whupped your ass.

680
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,330
I want to meet who whupped Shaft's ass.

681
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,870
Look at me, man. You don't know what I've been through.

682
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,532
My wife kicked me out of the house,
kicked me out of my happy home.

683
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:29,237
But you got to go off by your self. "I got this, partner."

684
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,371
Bullshit.

685
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,415
I am feeling much better, though, thank you.

686
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,348
- Yeah. - And I'll get his ass.

687
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,417
Be cool. Watch your self.

688
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,924
What did I say? Did you hear what I said?

689
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,756
I heard what I said 'cause I was
standing there when I said it.

690
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:49,992
I told you to secure a witness.

691
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,866
Not to shoot up a neighborhood!
Not to do another dead body!

692
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,565
Just get the dope back, and do it quietly.

693
00:47:56,673 --> 00:48:00,268
Look, Captain, this whole situation is getting out of control.

694
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,436
- You're goddamn right! - Look, man...

695
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,277
I damn near had to pass a pop
quiz before she believed I was him.

696
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,954
Going, going... Shit. A little off.

697
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,387
I haven't killed anybody yet today, Captain.

698
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,425
Do you want me to yell at you ? I can do that.

699
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:22,590
Let me tell you something. This
witness is my only good news.

700
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,191
You guys are bad news. So what does that mean?

701
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,430
Lf you have to be Mike Lowrey, Santa Claus, FD Hutton...

702
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,507
that's what you're gonna be!

703
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,304
Wait a minute. What the hell is going on here?

704
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,244
I was getting them all in before you showed up.

705
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,512
Can somebody talk to me, please?
Can I know what's going on?

706
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:47,488
Captain, these fools could have got
a look at my license plate last night.

707
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,616
Where's the girl now?

708
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,496
- His place. - What?

709
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,293
You left her by herself? Our only fucking witness?

710
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,596
You left a strange hooker alone in my apartment?

711
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:03,331
The girl is not a hooker, as far as I know.

712
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,967
I had to stash her somewhere; her
and her dogs, Luke and Dukie.

713
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,477
So you left dogs in my house?

714
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,945
There's dogs and a hooker in my house?

715
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,517
How about you add some chimps? We can have a carnival.

716
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,312
I said she isn't a hooker.

717
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,411
- Can you please... - Shut up!

718
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,450
For years, Sinclair has been up my
ass, trying to pin something on me.

719
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:26,187
I'm always taking it for you . Do it for me!

720
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,464
If we get this witness to identify the shooters...

721
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,365
maybe we catch our bad guys.

722
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:39,431
But until then, you are Mike Lowrey.

723
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,703
You be him. That's what you are. You're him.

724
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:44,177
I don't want to hear it. And you ...

725
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,512
You're you . You be you , but not in front of her.

726
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,084
You're him! You're you!

727
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:58,059
Can we get a time-out, Captain?
Am I the designated homeless?

728
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,186
Does it look like I care?

729
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,026
Whatever it takes, all right?

730
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,363
What did she say to you ? The shooters
are making their drop in four days?

731
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,960
So we got four days.

732
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:11,563
Captain, what kind of plan is that?

733
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,801
I can't be shacked up with that woman.

734
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:17,471
I have a family to look after. My wife will kill my ass!

735
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,414
You don't like your job? Quit.

736
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,252
Damn!

737
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:29,216
Look, I'll stay at the house with Theresa and the kids.

738
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,224
Thank you , but no thanks.

739
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,420
You wouldn't last five minutes with my family.

740
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:37,465
Please, married life is easy. You
only got one woman to satisfy.

741
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,632
Yo, man. We ain't the Cosbys.

742
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,230
Let's go. I got this.

743
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,740
Go.

744
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,513
Every body wants to be like Mike.

745
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,742
Yeah, and you're gonna be retired like him too.

746
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,081
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

747
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,486
Cleveland? I have never...

748
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,588
Look, woman, I done told you.

749
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,184
It's a federal subpoena.

750
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,695
Am I supposed to tell them no?

751
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,392
I don't know what you'll tell them. Why can't he go?

752
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,435
- Why can't you go? - I wanted to...

753
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,097
but Captain Howard said I'm irresponsible.

754
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:20,074
No, he said, "A loose cannon,"
because I've been shooting in public.

755
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:25,113
- Out of now here sometimes. - Mike, please.

756
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,980
Look, baby, the neighborhood has had a lot of break-ins.

757
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,985
I can handle it. I don't need Mike to handle it.

758
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,956
I know you can handle it, but I'm worrying about me.

759
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,494
Mike's going to stay here with you
and the kids, take care of y'all...

760
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,062
just till I come back.

761
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,961
Who will pick the kids up from day care and all that?

762
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:46,502
- Mike can't do it. - Are you listening to me? I said...

763
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:50,734
I read a book that could probably help y'all. I saw it on...

764
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,401
Mike, can you go down and have a Coke and a smile?

765
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,978
- Please? - All right.

766
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,613
Y'all want something?

767
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,512
Bring me a Coke.

768
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,052
- Baby, you want a Coke? - I'm fine, thank you.
 
769
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,313
All right.

770
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,987
Explain it to me, Elliot.

771
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,032
We've got a problem with our chemistry set?

772
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,533
It's not a chemistry set.

773
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:21,535
He knows it ain't a chemistry set, asshole.

774
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,843
What is it?

775
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,971
The cutting agent is a highlyvolatile substance.

776
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:35,950
- The ether... - I don't care.

777
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,680
I'm not a fucking chemistry teacher.

778
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,689
- What is the problem? - There's too much moisture here.

779
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:47,194
- Yeah, it's totally fucked. - You shut up!

780
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,865
What else?

781
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,697
It's taking longer to cook than we originally planned.

782
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,772
If we rush it, we'll have a lot of drugs we can't sell.

783
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,037
You're fucking with my timetable. I gave you a deadline.

784
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,135
- Do you understand? - Yeah, I understand.

785
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,683
Yeah.

786
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:17,092
- You dressed? - Yeah. I am.

787
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:21,058
Look, we have to go through some mug shots.

788
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,792
I'll hook into the computer. We can do this.

789
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,300
Mike, who's the guy in all the photographs?

790
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,338
Sometimes I don't even look at my shelves.

791
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,534
I forget all the pictures were here.

792
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:37,670
That's my partner, Marcus Burnett.

793
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:41,114
I've never seen anything like this before.

794
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,187
I can see how it may throw you a little bit.

795
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,914
It's a cop thing.

796
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,253
These pictures are up here for every time he saved my life.

797
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,921
Lf you go to his place ain't nothing but pictures of me.
 
798
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,498
It's like a shrine. Just a reminder.

799
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,367
Because when I saw it, and it was the whole wall...

800
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,463
I thought maybe they were pictures of your lover.

801
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,305
- Of who? - I thought maybe you were gay.

802
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:13,975
That I was gay? No, baby.

803
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:18,714
I didn't mean to offend you . It's okay to be a homosexual.

804
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:22,280
You're not listening. It's not registering.

805
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,622
Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?

806
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:28,562
Didn't you feel the dents? The dents come from all that.

807
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,223
That's how I get down.

808
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,961
That's sweet.

809
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,969
Gay.

810
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,369
If I was, I'd change the drapes in this motherfucker.

811
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:49,309
- Want some? - No, thanks. I don't eat flesh.

812
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,081
What?

813
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:55,988
That's flesh that you're shoveling into your mouth.

814
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:59,152
That was a living, breathing creature.

815
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,492
It probably had a name.

816
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,633
It's just baloney.

817
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,964
My baloney has a first name.

818
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,506
Actually, your baloney has about 30 names...

819
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:14,168
because they take odd parts from all different ones...

820
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:18,145
Like the leftovers: The hooves and stomach lining...

821
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,647
ears, stuff like that.

822
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:23,617
They put it into this machine and grind it all up.

823
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,689
Then out comes this sheet.

824
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,884
That's what you're eating now.

825
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,493
You know what? I won't eat baloney no more.

826
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,863
How about a pickle? Can I eat it?

827
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:41,698
It has a lot of salt, but it's fine. It is a vegetable.

828
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:46,037
A lot of salt in the pickle? Let me rinse it off.

829
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,269
There we go.

830
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,803
How's that?

831
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:56,215
- Just keep going. - I don't even taste the salt now.

832
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,318
Go back.

833
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,331
That's the guy.

834
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,593
He was there in the room.

835
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:16,138
We got a tip they were running major
drugs, something like 50 keys.

836
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,173
So we step to the door. Boom!

837
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:21,107
Freeze! Miami Police Department! Get down!

838
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:26,239
Out of now here, this little crazy pimp
named Chino punched me in the head.

839
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:29,011
Chino had been running whores.
Your dad will explain that to you.

840
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,078
Look at it. Your dogs are shitting all over my place.

841
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,747
Liquid shit.

842
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:39,090
It doesn't help when you shell ack
it in with furniture polish.

843
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,220
There's a piece right there. Please, get that.

844
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,765
- Fine. - It looks like a chip of shit.

845
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,071
Can I please have the parole jacket on Noah Trafficante?

846
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:51,037
- Thank you . - You know what?

847
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,075
I'm getting tired of this witness.

848
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:56,077
I want to get back to my life the way it was.

849
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:59,671
I'm tired. I got married so I could stop lying.

850
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,683
I cannot believe you're complaining.

851
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:05,721
You got it easy compared to me,
living in that zoo you call home.

852
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,222
Why you have to call my place a zoo?

853
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,121
- I'm tired of you saying that. - You want to fight me.

854
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:13,286
- Don't call my place a zoo. - Listen... Francine, please...

855
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:20,559
- That's my silk shirt, man! - Yeah, it is kind of nice.

856
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,663
Since I'm gonna be like Mike, I
might as well dress like Mike.

857
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:28,471
I wanna be like Mike

858
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,973
You're sick. Something is wrong with you.

859
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,982
You have a problem, and you should have your self checked.

860
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,745
Yeah. Probably.

861
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:41,785
- Here's the file. He works at Club Hell. - Thank you.

862
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,825
Take care of this, please.

863
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:46,919
- I've got to call the wife. - Whose wife?

864
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,430
Can you please do some work?

865
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:52,023
One time today, just do something.

866
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,332
- Do something that helps this case. - Boy...

867
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,497
You look real handsome today.

868
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,837
See, it's not that kind of day.

869
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,173
Leave me the fuck alone.

870
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,007
Seriously. All right?

871
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:08,049
- What's up? PMS? - Damn the jokes.

872
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,483
Ring it. I ain't in the mood.

873
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,680
Yeah, that's cool. Hold on.

874
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,848
All right. Write it down.

875
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,357
Go ahead.

876
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,986
All right.

877
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:25,193
- How are things going with the
kids? - They're fine. You okay?

878
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:29,294
- How's potty training going? - Slowly but surely.

879
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:32,033
- You are so silly. - Are you going to be late tonight?

880
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:35,201
It will be 10:30, 11:00 before I get in.

881
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:39,145
- Later. - Don't wait up. I'll be all right.

882
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:47,047
Why don't you rent a movie?
Something we can kick back to.

883
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:52,385
- What you wearing? - Give me the phone!

884
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:55,055
- Baby! - She hung up a long time ago.

885
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,064
I was playing.

886
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,667
Hello?

887
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,898
Hey, man, don't play like that.

888
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:05,736
That's my family. Don't break up a happy home.

889
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,469
Stop wearing my clothes then.

890
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,747
Everybody's about the jokes today, ain't they? Hello?

891
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,217
I cannot believe this.

892
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,847
This Eddie Dominguez file cannot be that hard to get into.

893
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,255
I've tried three times. I just can't get in.

894
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,293
Besides, this is illegal.

895
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,420
Yeah, that never stopped you before.

896
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,359
Just let me know if you get anything.

897
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,765
Anything for you , but I can't get in. I tried.

898
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,444
What's up, Chet?

899
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,881
The Lowrey Brothers.

900
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:59,620
Let's just get down to Club Hell and pick up Noah.

901
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,630
Julie, it's me.

902
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:05,701
You're supposed to be getting us
into this Eddie Dominguez file.

903
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,293
It's gonna be a day or two before I can get Fletch out.

904
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:11,896
- We don't have a day or two. - I'm not the computerwhiz.

905
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,908
It's gonna take a while before we can hack the computer.

906
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,502
- You're not taking care of shit. - Mike,
I was thinking about something...

907
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,308
Hi.

908
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:23,476
- You must be Marcus. - I'm Marcus.

909
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:26,111
- That's right. - Right.

910
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:28,086
I'm Julie.

911
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,751
Julie. All right. It's nice to meet you.

912
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:35,923
You too. I recognize you from every one of the photographs.

913
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,762
Yeah. He's my man, so we...

914
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,602
All those on the wall.

915
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,140
- Yeah. - You must be very good.

916
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,210
I'm sorry?

917
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,838
As a partner. Your job, what you do.

918
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:55,543
What time are we doing this thing tonight?

919
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,880
- Excuse me? - Mike said we were going to a club.

920
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:03,850
Yeah. "We" as in me and my partner.

921
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,191
You wanted home protective custody. You're at my house.

922
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,957
That's just great.

923
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:11,625
So I'll just stay here again...

924
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,998
with Chet the mini-moron doorman to protect me?

925
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,798
Chet is very good.

926
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:19,397
I'm sorry. That looks like a stain on your rug.

927
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,841
- Damn. - That was my baby, Luke.

928
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,072
He gets kind of nervous in new surroundings.

929
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,308
- He just shits, huh? - Yeah.

930
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:31,376
It's like marking his territory. It's sort of a male thing.
 
931
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:34,479
I offered to pay Mike for the
cleaning, and he wouldn't hear of it.

932
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,150
- I'm getting rid of it. - Yeah, you don't need that.

933
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,423
I'm throwing that out anyway. I just want a new look.

934
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,431
Mike is a special guy. Boy, Mike is special.

935
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,933
I call him "Special Mike."

936
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,232
It's funny how you can just laugh at that.

937
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:51,670
That's why I love him. Now, me?

938
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:54,800
I'd be pissed.

939
01:01:56,345 --> 01:02:00,748
- Look at this cute dog on the couch. - That's Luke.

940
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:05,253
- Look how he crawls on the leather. - 
You want to meet Duke? He's in bed.

941
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:08,380
He's been feeling upset and having diarrhea...

942
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,186
and throwing up all morning.

943
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,760
Oh, baby.

944
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,125
Let's go see if little Duke is gonna be okay, shall we?

945
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,337
Me and you.

946
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,603
- Lady, who are you ? - Who the hell are you?

947
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:32,442
- You have to get out. - Get your hands off me!

948
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,778
- Lady, don't push me! - I'm Yvette.

949
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:38,115
- You're not any Yvette I know. - What are you doing?

950
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,121
Get out of here, all right?

951
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:45,160
Lf you don't stop stalking me, I'll
arrest your ass, you old psycho!

952
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:49,288
- You asshole! - Woman's into some weird shit.

953
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:52,060
- What is going on out here? - Excuse me.

954
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,135
That was crazy Yvette...

955
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,137
stalking me.

956
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:00,667
Yvette? I forgot she was coming. You threw her out?

957
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,413
Yvette is a masseuse.

958
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,382
She massages shit.

959
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,958
- She told me. - Listen...

960
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,789
are there any other totally hysterical...

961
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:23,797
half-naked women popping by
tonight that I should know about?

962
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,028
- She was naked? - Titties were out a little bit.

963
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,501
You threw Yvette out naked?

964
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:35,005
You're something... My wife would
hate... She hates womanizers.

965
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:40,978
- There's something wrong with you . - There is?

966
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,517
You don't respect other people's
shit. I've told you that for years.

967
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,884
Ever since we started, you always have your trash all over.

968
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,752
Enough! Please!

969
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,326
Me and my partner...

970
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:55,022
are going to Club Hell to bust this fool Noah.

971
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,962
Does anybody have a problem with that?

972
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,693
Fine.

973
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,133
Don't blow the case.

974
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,541
Frank, here's the deal: You stay put.
Anybody tells you to move, don't.

975
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:19,678
Tell them you're making a delivery
for Mr. Fouchet. You got it?

976
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:23,349
Jeez. It's ether! It will explode!

977
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:25,450
You dope!

978
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,530
Don't even breathe, you knucklehead!

979
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,143
I remember you.

980
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:08,601
Check it. We got two days left. Let's try to do this right.

981
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,400
No gunshots, no dead bodies.

982
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,474
I'm not trying to lose my job on this one.

983
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:17,068
If I recall correctly, the last couple
dead bad guys belonged to you.

984
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:19,613
And next time you have to kill them...

985
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,013
do it after you get the information we need.

986
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:23,812
That's just a suggestion.

987
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,912
Please. You ain't even trying to compare body counts.

988
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:30,787
One... Should I keep going? Damn, I'm out.

989
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,555
This guy Noah's parole jacket says he works in there.

990
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:38,793
We're standing out front arguing
like a couple of school girls.

991
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,062
Why don't we put an end to all this bickering?

992
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:44,764
- All right. - ' Cause you're getting on my nerves.

993
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:14,235
- Look at you . Can you stay focused? - What? I'm focused!

994
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:17,329
Yeah, focused on all this scattered ass here.

995
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,873
Let's do what we came to do and get out of here.

996
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,638
- Simple. - Fine. Let's split up, check around.

997
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,077
- Meet me at the bar in ten minutes. - Fine.

998
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:34,779
Holy shit. What the hell is he doing? Man!

999
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,290
That's the cop! There he is! See him?

1000
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,691
- That's him! - Yeah, I'm going!

1001
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,238
What's up?

1002
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,507
Budweiser. Feel like I had a million of them.

1003
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,249
What's up, motherfucker?

1004
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,773
Tell me where the dough is, jack-off!

1005
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,634
Fuck!

1006
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:16,249
Next time learn how to work the safety with your punk ass!

1007
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:17,791
I'll be back.

1008
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:31,400
- Who whupped your ass now? - 
This really ain't the fucking time.

1009
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:34,135
They know. Let's get Noah and get out of here.

1010
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,485
The chick!

1011
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,961
The girl! The bitch from the rooftop!

1012
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,907
- Let's go! - That was the guy who shot Max!

1013
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:47,439
The truck! Let's take the truck!

1014
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:51,183
Right there!

1015
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,950
Move! We're really in a hurry.

1016
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:00,027
- Let's go! - You're cops! Why are we running away?

1017
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:03,121
- He's in there! - Here! Go!

1018
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:16,067
This is good. Noah's chasing us!

1019
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:20,547
What was that?

1020
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:22,913
That was- - I don' t know.

1021
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:27,079
But I had a good shot at him if your 
friend Action Jackson over here...

1022
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,516
This is official police business!

1023
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,219
You had no business in there!

1024
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:36,058
And can you please drive this thing?

1025
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,531
Don't bring it here, all right?

1026
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,966
You picked this slow-ass ice cream truck!

1027
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,069
- What am I smelling? - Just drive!

1028
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:50,103
Ether. Extremely flammable ether.

1029
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,874
- Shit. - Goddamn.

1030
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,917
You the man! You the fucking man tonight!

1031
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,146
You pick an ice cream truck that's a damn bomb!

1032
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:05,422
Shit!

1033
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:09,258
- This is protective custody? - Yes!

1034
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,986
You better do something, boy! We're running out of road!

1035
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,921
Who picked this road?

1036
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,654
All the road in Miami, and you're running out of it!

1037
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:44,199
- You better get an idea fast! - Why
are the ideas always up to me?

1038
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:01,038
- Take this shit! - It's a dead end! There's no more road!

1039
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,926
We're out of fucking road!

1040
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:19,160
- Motherfucker's gonna blow! - Get the fuck out!

1041
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,249
Should I add this to your body count?

1042
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:43,349
There goes our only lead to the dope.

1043
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:46,519
Ain't this a bitch?

1044
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,687
"The dope"?

1045
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,766
What are you talking about?

1046
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,358
How about there goes our only lead to Max's killer?

1047
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,199
He's still out there.

1048
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,197
But that's not really important.

1049
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:02,072
It's not like it's your job to protect people. Holy shit.

1050
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,236
- She's crazy. - I'm crazy?

1051
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:10,381
- You're gone! - I'm out of here!

1052
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,386
- What is wrong with you ? Stop!
- She done fucking zoomed!

1053
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:16,151
- This is the witness! - That's it. You deal with her.

1054
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,885
- No way. - Listen.

1055
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:20,359
- Bullshit. - Yes, you're right.

1056
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:24,057
This started because of missing
drugs, but let me tell you something.

1057
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:28,432
There is absolutely nothing more important to Mike...

1058
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:31,165
than doing this guy that killed Max.

1059
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:36,267
I know he has a hard time expressing his feelings.

1060
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,581
Come on. It will be all right, okay?

1061
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:43,583
We need you.

1062
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,846
Part of the team.

1063
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,787
I thought he was supposed to be the smooth one.

1064
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:54,590
- This has not been a good day.
- Damn right. This is bullshit.

1065
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,926
We got two days to find these fools...

1066
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:00,433
and we got no leads because you
cooked Noah's ass on the freeway.

1067
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,773
- Shampoo? - Hello.

1068
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:10,106
- There. - Let's do that.

1069
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,779
What's up?

1070
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:20,784
It don't take that long to get shampoo.

1071
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,948
- Please, let's go. - Look at this.

1072
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,889
"Animal tested."

1073
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:27,791
Do you know how many chemicals are in this stuff?

1074
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:30,865
I don't care if you go bald. Just get it and let's go.

1075
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,558
He is a chemist.

1076
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,570
That's entirely too much heroin and too much ether...

1077
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,230
for nobody to know nothing.

1078
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,137
What is he talking about?

1079
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:43,405
You know the barrels of ether that
blew up on the ice cream truck?

1080
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,605
They were going to use that to process the heroin.

1081
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:48,478
Yeah, they do that to cut it. It quadruples the value.

1082
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:51,144
Yeah, you can't just stick it in the microwave.

1083
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:53,517
Maybe you're onto something.
Let's just pay for this, all right?

1084
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:00,084
- How much is that? - Fourteen twenty-five.

1085
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:02,493
Damn. I must have left my wallet somewhere.

1086
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:07,797
Freeze, mother bitches! Don't you move.

1087
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,463
- I'm not understanding. I really don't. - Shut up!

1088
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:15,669
- Do you just attract violent people? - Take it easy, all right?

1089
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:19,008
- We are police officers. - You're not police officers.

1090
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:22,515
- I'm not stupid. I've seen police. - What are you?

1091
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:27,385
- I'm going to reach for my badge.
- You want badges, mother bitch?

1092
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,150
I give you badges! Here!

1093
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,818
Ninety-nine cents each! I sell you some!

1094
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,828
You got eight badges! I told you this cop thing don't work.

1095
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,956
I blow you ! Then I blow you!

1096
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:40,967
Blow me? What the fuck? Hump me. That's all right.

1097
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:44,470
I'm from the Middle East! I kill before. I kill again!

1098
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:47,973
- Fuck me, please! Hold on! - No, you hold on!

1099
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,067
Do you see the emotion I'm going through now?

1100
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,078
That means this shit is serious.

1101
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,809
Me and this mother fucker's not vibing
right now. That's what that means.

1102
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:58,978
- You got something on your 
chest? - That's what I'm saying!

1103
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:02,352
- Hello? The guy has got a cannon. - What do you want?

1104
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,755
- Do you want some? Come get some. - I want some!

1105
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,851
- I'm gone. - Freeze, bitch!

1106
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:12,093
- You freeze, bitch! - Oh, shit. I'm fucked.

1107
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,226
Now back up, put the gun down...

1108
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:18,534
and give me a pack of Tropical Fruit Bubblicious.

1109
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,733
And some Skittles.

1110
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:27,713
Hell of a night. I'm going to bed.

1111
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:32,276
So make your self at home. It's your bed.

1112
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,322
I'll sit down for a minute...

1113
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,087
'cause I'm guarding shit, you know.

1114
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:41,754
I'm watching out for the bad boys.

1115
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:45,230
I can see things, you know...

1116
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,097
real well from my "peripheals."

1117
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:49,102
You know, for such a stud, Mike Lowrey...

1118
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:54,437
 you sure seem a little rigid about having a girl in your bed.

1119
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:57,103
Who? Me? Mike Lowrey?

1120
01:16:57,212 --> 01:17:00,943
I'm not rigid. I'm comfortable.

1121
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:03,108
This is my bed.

1122
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:06,016
- Why would I be uncomfortable? - I don't know.

1123
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:11,650
I think it's more than just wired.
Maybe it was all the guns and stuff.

1124
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:16,287
I've never really shot a gun
before, and that's... All that steel.

1125
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:20,801
I'm feeling... Don't you feel a little funny?

1126
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:25,966
- I'm not a comedian, but... - I don't mean that kind of funny.

1127
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,168
I mean like funny.

1128
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:39,577
Now, you don't want that.

1129
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:42,917
'Cause when I come...

1130
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,323
I come with the thunder.

1131
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:49,454
You sound like you're saving your self for marriage.

1132
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,999
That ain't me. That's Marcus.

1133
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:58,436
You know what I'm saying? He's the married one.

1134
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,667
I got some other... Oh, no.

1135
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:05,338
I've seen it now. Turn the page, girl.

1136
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:11,184
Don't laugh.

1137
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,516
I cannot believe he wore his Afro that big.

1138
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,591
- I forgot all about that. - I think he looked cute like that.

1139
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:19,216
What's Marcus's wife like?

1140
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,099
She's like a wife.

1141
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:30,296
I mean, she must be pretty
amazing to keep a guy like Marcus.

1142
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:37,904
- Keep a guy like what? - Like watching him tonight...

1143
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:41,346
He's very sort of take-charge.

1144
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:44,977
The way he was throwing guys this way and that.

1145
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,385
There's something about him. I don't know what it is.

1146
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,889
He's so smooth, you know?

1147
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:53,722
Boy, I bet his wife's...

1148
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:57,424
enjoying the smoothness right this minute.

1149
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:03,267
- He's got a quality women respond to. - Sure.

1150
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:04,895
I can't imagine the kind of woman...

1151
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:09,534
that wouldn't find Marcus attractive.

1152
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:13,409
Probably couldn't be around him and just...

1153
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,415
You know, like our situation.

1154
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:19,248
- If two people were alone... - Not with a guy like that.

1155
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:20,946
Excuse me.

1156
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:28,229
What is wrong with him? This one
goes on the bulletin board at work.

1157
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,558
Uh-uh. Don't do that.

1158
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:34,866
Putitback in. I cannot be lieve you took it out.

1159
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:37,905
Come on. Marcus will kill us if he finds out. Give it to me.

1160
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,870
I can't be lieve I let you see it.

1161
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,465
Motherfucker!

1162
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,150
Goddamn it.

1163
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:54,450
Got some jewelry for you . I'm sorry, but damn that.

1164
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:59,926
I think we need to address the serious
lack of trust in this relationship.

1165
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:03,088
- Please. - I don't think this is legal.

1166
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:08,795
I won't be long. It's legal. Out of sight.

1167
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:12,806
Sanchez, this is Lowrey. Yeah, your mother. Listen.

1168
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:15,433
These guys are about to make a move.

1169
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:18,513
Blue convertible, two visible
occupants. Check it out, all right?

1170
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,950
Here we go.

1171
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,612
- Is that our guy? - That's him.

1172
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:31,192
- Where's the girl? - I don't see any girl. There's no girl.

1173
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,124
Fuck off, barking-ass dog. Shut up.

1174
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,667
Sneak up on my own house.

1175
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:49,038
What in the world? Very strange.

1176
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:52,375
His ass upstairs. Supposed to be my boy.

1177
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,107
You motherfucker.

1178
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,308
Ducking and weaving up and down.

1179
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:59,147
Look at this shit. Is this what you want?

1180
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,687
Got me climbing like a chimp.

1181
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:04,281
But I ain't going out like that.

1182
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:07,088
It don't take anybody that long to get into bed.

1183
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:11,496
Got my babies in the house.

1184
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,898
Your man can't get no quality time...

1185
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,596
but my partner can get some quality time.

1186
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:17,831
I don't play that shit.

1187
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,448
- There's somebody out there. - Quick, get the kids.

1188
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:34,386
I knew it! I didn't have to call the fucking psychic line!

1189
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:35,717
Freeze!

1190
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,726
- Move and you're a dead man! - Motherfucker!

1191
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:47,097
Gun up to his head. They're going
to shoot each other. Unbelievable.

1192
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:50,899
- Miami Police! Freeze! - I am the police!

1193
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:53,133
- Marcus, what are you doing? - You're doing Theresa!

1194
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,801
- I'm not! - Nobody does my baby!

1195
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:01,176
We could sneak up and snuff them both right now.

1196
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:02,807
Yeah, but we're supposed to get the girl. Forget them.

1197
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,216
Never fuck with a cop's family, asshole.

1198
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,084
- Doesn't that piss you off? - That pisses the fuck out of me.

1199
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:11,124
Don't get me started. Get out of the car.

1200
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,525
Fuck it! Some shit is making you crazy.

1201
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,633
You know there's nothing going
on between me and Theresa!

1202
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:25,062
Man, I've been your partner for six years...

1203
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:27,232
and I've been your boy all my life.

1204
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,138
For you to even think...

1205
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,440
To let some dumb shit like that creep up in your mind...

1206
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,514
This is me! What is wrong with you?

1207
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:38,352
It was just... I don't know.

1208
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,920
I just...

1209
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:47,427
Yeah, I'm fine.

1210
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,929
Get the fuck out of here. Where's Julie?

1211
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:52,556
She's in the car, handcuffed to the steering wheel.

1212
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,726
Are you trying to blow this case?

1213
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,962
My bad, man. I ain't had no quality time.

1214
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,096
You know how that is. Sometimes you do dumb shit.

1215
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,437
- Let's go. - That's all that is.

1216
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:05,971
Yo, my bad.

1217
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,945
It's cool.

1218
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:11,280
Go. All right. Yeah.

1219
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,947
These calls were made to Club Hell...

1220
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,490
from this precinct.

1221
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,150
Explain.

1222
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:23,287
I'll ask you one more time. Give me a goddamn name!

1223
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,169
- All I know is his name. - Give me his name.

1224
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:33,297
You're looking at a lot of time. You know that?

1225
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:36,774
Fouchet, I think.

1226
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,642
That's his whole name?

1227
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:41,810
I'm just an errand boy.

1228
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,815
Stop it, please. You're gonna make me cry.

1229
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:46,819
I swear, watching the house was my first gig.

1230
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,924
How sweet. Does that make you union?

1231
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,984
Lf you were a real cop in the field working every day...

1232
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,154
you'd realize that sometimes shit happens.

1233
01:23:56,264 --> 01:24:00,098
Don't give me that crap. You're
on your way to being reassigned.

1234
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:02,669
- Shut down soon. - Who will reassign me? You?

1235
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,671
You don't have the authority to reassign me.

1236
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:07,537
Until you do, stay the hell out of here!

1237
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:11,100
They should just bone and get that shit over with.

1238
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:14,079
I'm getting really tired of this.

1239
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:16,309
You're tired?

1240
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:17,886
These guard dogs aren't cutting
it. They're overfed. They're lazy.

1241
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:18,750
These guard dogs aren't cutting
it. They're overfed. They're lazy.

1242
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,855
We need video surveillance 'cause
these guard dogs are nothing...

1243
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:27,223
Jo jo. Don't make this hard!

1244
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:33,260
Nice running into you.

1245
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:36,131
Always making it hard on your self.

1246
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:39,035
Gee, Julie, what have you been up to the last couple days?

1247
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,576
Nothing. Just hanging out, handcuffed to steering wheels.

1248
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,875
We're looking for someone who
can step on a shit load of heroin.

1249
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,881
Do it real fast, real well. We're looking for a real pro.

1250
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:52,043
I told you already, I'm in the rubber business now.

1251
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:54,713
Jo jo, we're not playing.

1252
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:57,917
I'm straight, man.

1253
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,153
I'm straight like a board, like an arrow.

1254
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,058
I'm so straight right now, I'm sick.

1255
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:05,655
It's a lot of dope. Who could cut it real quick?

1256
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:09,328
"Cut it"? You cut it up?

1257
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:12,463
- I don't know nothing about it. - I'm so sick of this bullshit.

1258
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:18,441
- What's up? - You're pulling a gun on me?

1259
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:22,004
You guys are cops! I can't believe this!
I should turn you in to Hard Copy.

1260
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,708
- Put your ass on the TV set! - What are you doing?

1261
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:28,687
I got this! I got 15 bullets in this gun.

1262
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:32,851
Lf you don't start talking to me,
I'll fill your ass full of hot shit.

1263
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,920
- Now, what's up? - Mike, he ain't worth it!

1264
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:39,659
Do you want some? I'll bust your ass too!

1265
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:43,637
So sad. You're on your own, Jojo.

1266
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,365
- What's up? - I'm telling you like this.

1267
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:51,934
You splatter his ass, he's no good to us!

1268
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,605
Fuck that. I'm not going down over this shit!

1269
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:58,880
I'm not going down for you killing Jojo the tire man!

1270
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,114
I don't want no brain fragments on me!

1271
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:03,554
That shit gets in your clothes, and it stinks!

1272
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:06,650
- Fuck that! - I'll tell you what I know.

1273
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:09,594
I don't know everything. I know a little bit.

1274
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:11,597
Tell him something!

1275
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:14,327
It's three guys. They got a laboratory...

1276
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:16,630
No, it's two guys.

1277
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:19,901
One guy died in a plane crash last year. It was fucked up.

1278
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:23,637
There should be more! Fuck, man!

1279
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:25,838
It's one guy, really. It's only one guy.

1280
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:27,812
- Don't fuck with me. - One main guy.

1281
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:31,317
This guy's an Einstein, motherfucking genius college boy.

1282
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:34,286
Egghead motherfucker. He got four eyes and glasses.

1283
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:36,516
He got a rich mama and daddy
who live out in Coconut Grove.

1284
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:38,785
Where? Tell him again, Jojo!

1285
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:41,691
- I don't want you to get hurt! - I'll tell you where he's at.

1286
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:45,823
- You would do that for us? - Yeah, I want to help you guys.

1287
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:47,333
You stick that gun down.

1288
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:51,997
I got the address in the office.

1289
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:56,300
Thanks a lot. You go grab that.

1290
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,345
- Cool. - You can go ahead.

1291
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:00,676
- Now? - Now is real good.

1292
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:02,909
Yeah. This is on me too.

1293
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:07,010
You guys pick out some whitewalls
as a little gift from me to you.

1294
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:12,825
You made me think you would shoot me for a minute.

1295
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,326
I was.

1296
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:19,531
When is this punk-ass chemist coming home?

1297
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:25,334
So this is a stakeout. Not what I imagined.

1298
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,204
Thought there would be more conversation.

1299
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:33,008
Sorry it's not up to your usual high standards.

1300
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,947
Is he always like this on a stakeout?

1301
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:40,716
Too much caffeine? Not enough sex?

1302
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:43,985
I can't believe she went there on you.

1303
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:49,394
You know who you're talking to?
That's Mike Lowrey over there.

1304
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,363
King Ding-a-ling.

1305
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:54,901
Why don't you whip it out for her, big boy?

1306
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:57,198
Uh-huh. Right on your forehead.

1307
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:58,465
- Shut up. - Yeah.

1308
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:11,151
- There he is! Let's go! Move! - I'm on him!

1309
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,258
What are our chances?

1310
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:30,428
Remember Club Hell? Worse.

1311
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:34,273
That's it. I'm calling major backup.

1312
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:37,105
- I want swimming ducks in here. - Whoa.

1313
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:40,442
Hold it. You know Sinclair has
every phone in the station tapped.

1314
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:43,642
- We have to do that in person. - Shit.

1315
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:45,776
By the time we deal with her bullshit...

1316
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:49,448
every junkie in America will be high off our bust.

1317
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:53,389
Can we help you?

1318
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:56,463
I staked out all night in that jalopy too.
 
1319
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:58,122
I think I earned a peek.

1320
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:02,635
This is real cop stuff. This is not Charlie's Angels.

1321
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:05,171
It can't hurt for her to take a peek.

1322
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:09,300
It can't hurt to look? If they fire
a bullet over here, it will hurt.

1323
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:20,815
We have guests. Have them followed.

1324
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:23,413
Don't do anything. Just call me with their location.

1325
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:30,962
This high-speed chase endingona trestle...

1326
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:33,795
near the RiverDrive and 34th Street intersection...

1327
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,632
was captured twonights ago b your 6Action News team.

1328
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,206
Mom!

1329
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:41,798
Both police officers involved in the incident were uninjured.

1330
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,343
I thought you said Daddy was in Cleveland.

1331
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:46,379
He can't be in Cleveland.

1332
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:49,041
The officers didn't like the presence of our camera.

1333
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,380
Your daddy just wishes he was in Cleveland.

1334
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:55,445
I'm telling you . This Fouchet is a slick one.

1335
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,726
FBI, DEA... They got nothing on him.

1336
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:02,193
But he has to deal with us today.

1337
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,209
What's that?

1338
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:19,177
That's the last time they handcuff me. That's what that is.

1339
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,872
Good boy.

1340
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,744
Excuse me, ma'am.

1341
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:26,945
All visitors must be announced!

1342
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:30,888
Pisses me off. Lady!

1343
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:34,052
I guess when you guys get back...

1344
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:35,891
this will all be over, right?

1345
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:38,898
You got that right. Don't worry, though.

1346
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,935
You'll be set free, cut loose.

1347
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,869
You'll be back to your old life.

1348
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:47,941
Oops. No more handcuffs.

1349
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:54,413
- Get up out of here. - That should be Chet...

1350
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:55,914
with my veggie burger.

1351
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:58,144
- Move your ass! - You got it.

1352
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,549
Hi. Can I help you?

1353
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,956
Yes, I'm here to kill my husband, Marcus Burnett.

1354
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:09,757
And that would be the tall one or the short one?

1355
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:13,698
- The short one. - Thought so.

1356
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:16,429
Is Chet ringing the...

1357
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:18,198
Baby...

1358
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:27,011
- Let me get your husband. - Marcus, get over here.

1359
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:33,379
I'm a... I know what it looks like. Did you get my message?

1360
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:41,685
Can you leave me and Mrs. Burnett alone for...

1361
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,296
Right.

1362
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:47,224
Y'all met?

1363
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,098
Baby...

1364
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:51,637
I know, so let me...

1365
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:56,267
As far as I'm concerned, you can keep
the wedding ring in your pocket...

1366
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:57,844
because you , your new little girlfriend...

1367
01:31:57,945 --> 01:31:59,640
Shit.

1368
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:02,807
And Mike will all be very happy living here.

1369
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:05,477
- Trust me. - Sweetie... Honey...

1370
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:08,453
It's not even...

1371
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:10,820
I saw it on the news.

1372
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:14,759
- That shit be having a slant. - It's...

1373
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,830
Baby, that's not even...

1374
01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:19,161
- You're no longer welcome in
my house. - He didn't tell you ...

1375
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,667
I was coming in the airport early?

1376
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:24,966
Remember I said call her? Hold on.

1377
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:27,199
Tell her what I told you.

1378
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:29,902
You were gonna bring me to your place...

1379
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:34,180
All right. I ain't even gonna...

1380
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:36,045
We're not arguing about this.

1381
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:39,313
I'm raising my... All right, here... Baby...

1382
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,047
Believe me, we wanted to tell you.

1383
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:43,248
It really doesn't matter anymore, Marcus...

1384
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:46,349
Mike. Kojak. Whatever your name is.

1385
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,690
Aside from that fact, I'll tell you something else.

1386
01:32:48,796 --> 01:32:53,028
If his wife could find us, I'm a lot better off on my own.

1387
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:56,467
This... I could see how it would look a trip.

1388
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:00,565
You see me run out. I got a shirt open.

1389
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:02,540
You see Mike half-butt-naked.

1390
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:04,372
Then you see the white girl.

1391
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:09,177
So this looks like we having one big
orgy here, and ain't nobody humping.

1392
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:11,717
Ain't nobody doing none of that.

1393
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:14,878
It's not what it looks like. Hear what I'm saying.

1394
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:17,719
Baby, she's a material witness.

1395
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:19,793
- That... - That's real!

1396
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,827
Baby, listen. That ain't...

1397
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:24,659
It was orders, baby.

1398
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,399
Can I talk to you?

1399
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:30,197
Can you stop so I can talk to you , please?

1400
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:33,796
Enough with the smooth shit, Mike. It won't work anymore.

1401
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:45,109
I don't care what you say.

1402
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:54,627
- Duck! - Julie, get down now!

1403
01:34:26,227 --> 01:34:29,253
- Get out, now! - Mike, help!

1404
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:36,564
911!

1405
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:41,839
Yeah, 911? Chet here.

1406
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:44,172
Go upstairs and take this. Take it!

1407
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,347
Don't worry. I'll keep everybody
calm until my backup arrives.

1408
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,145
I love you.

1409
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:54,047
Shit! I forgot to give them the address!

1410
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:30,189
Come on! Move!

1411
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:33,124
Go! Watch it!

1412
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:34,717
- Keep going! - Son of a bitch!

1413
01:35:37,164 --> 01:35:38,222
Get her in!

1414
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:42,091
I'll kill you if you stop running.

1415
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:47,131
Come on!

1416
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:08,393
Move!

1417
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:24,206
It's okay. I'm with the police.

1418
01:36:24,345 --> 01:36:26,142
It's cool. You look great.

1419
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,171
Drive!

1420
01:36:58,078 --> 01:37:00,774
- Stop shooting! - He's still on top!

1421
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:04,316
I'll get rid of him!

1422
01:37:08,389 --> 01:37:10,186
There he goes!

1423
01:37:30,377 --> 01:37:32,641
Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.

1424
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,092
What is it with you guys?

1425
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:49,321
How come it's always good news, bad news?

1426
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:52,558
You know exactly where the dope
is, but you lose our only witness.

1427
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:56,033
- I just don't get it. - Pick up your phone.

1428
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:03,836
I'm keeping your sweet little friend
for four hours until I make my deal.

1429
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:05,377
And I will make my deal.

1430
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:08,346
I've just put a bullet in the chemist...

1431
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:10,974
who fucked with my timetable.

1432
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:14,654
The other one is for the girl. Okay?

1433
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,415
Son of a bitch!

1434
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,994
Twisted motherfucker just shot one of his employees.

1435
01:38:22,129 --> 01:38:24,654
Said if we don't back off, he'll kill Julie.

1436
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:27,665
- Not now. - I told you to play by the rules.

1437
01:38:27,768 --> 01:38:30,362
I am on the verge of solving this case!

1438
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:32,405
You turned South Beach into a war zone.

1439
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:35,736
I finally got the authority to shut you
down. You're all reassigned.

1440
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:39,344
This is lovely.

1441
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:44,812
This guy is painting me into a corner.

1442
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:47,114
He'll kill the girl anyway, and we're won't let her die.

1443
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:50,621
We're not walking away from this
bust, I don't care what she says.

1444
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:52,885
The deal goes down in four hours.

1445
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:56,019
You guys have two hours to find them.

1446
01:38:57,131 --> 01:38:59,190
It's time to get lucky.

1447
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,564
Go do what you have to do.

1448
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:08,066
Fletcher, you told us this would
move a little quicker than this.

1449
01:39:08,175 --> 01:39:12,339
It's not that easy, okay? If it was, you'd be doing it.

1450
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:15,039
Work your magic. You say you're
a computer whiz. Come on.
 
1451
01:39:15,182 --> 01:39:19,050
Back up off me. I'm doing an illegal favor for you.

1452
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:21,586
This is what I got put in jail for.

1453
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:23,213
So you back up off me.

1454
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:26,986
You don't sit your lanky ass down... bottom line...

1455
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:29,085
I will knock you the fuck out!

1456
01:39:29,196 --> 01:39:31,391
- What the fuck is wrong with you ? - Can you have a seat?

1457
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:34,865
- You said you'd get me out of jail. - I wasn't lying.

1458
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:39,468
Cops are so dumb. Look, it's coming up.

1459
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:44,007
Remember, you promised to get me out.

1460
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:51,241
There is it. Voila.

1461
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:55,080
"Girlfriend"?

1462
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:06,694
It was New Year's Eve and my ex-boyfriend, Eddie...

1463
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,734
and this French guy...

1464
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:11,964
took some really horrible pictures of me.

1465
01:40:12,106 --> 01:40:16,042
They said they would put them on the bulletin board...

1466
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:17,770
of my kid's school...

1467
01:40:17,878 --> 01:40:20,813
unless I gave them a lot of narcotics information.

1468
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:25,112
But I never gave them you or the girl!

1469
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:27,915
Look, they got the girl. We need to get them now.

1470
01:40:28,055 --> 01:40:30,785
Because if we don't, they'll kill her.

1471
01:40:30,891 --> 01:40:34,292
- How do you make contact? - I
have their mobile phone number.

1472
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:36,795
God.

1473
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:40,162
I'm sorry. Listen, I'll make it up to you.

1474
01:40:40,267 --> 01:40:42,292
I'll do anything you want.

1475
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:44,404
We don't have a lot of time. Let's go.

1476
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:50,470
You have sexy ears. You know that?

1477
01:40:50,577 --> 01:40:53,137
I want to lick them.

1478
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:57,514
- Yeah? - Can I speak to Romeo?

1479
01:40:57,618 --> 01:40:59,176
There ain't no Romeo here, asshole.

1480
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:01,254
Why are you laughing?

1481
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:04,915
This cell phone will triangulate him...

1482
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:06,424
no matter where he goes.

1483
01:41:06,527 --> 01:41:08,552
We'll watch on this map until he stops.

1484
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:13,023
- Sector234. - The signal is still strong.

1485
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:14,930
- We still have a lock. - We got them.

1486
01:41:15,035 --> 01:41:19,529
- Come on, baby. - Thank you.

1487
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,098
Lucywas the queen, baby. Think about it.

1488
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:25,178
Lucille Ball was a bimbo. What are you talking about?

1489
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:28,180
- Desi was the brains. - How could you say that?

1490
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:32,183
- What do you mean? - Without those bongos, he's nothing.

1491
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:34,516
It's conga. Don't be so stupid. It's Desi and Lucy...

1492
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:36,521
Yo, what's up?

1493
01:41:36,623 --> 01:41:38,648
The fucking pencil squad.

1494
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:40,386
Did you get us assigned to traffic duty?

1495
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:45,555
- This is real. We got something
for you . - This shit could get you killed.

1496
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:51,333
Let's go.

1497
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:02,911
Here we go.

1498
01:42:04,418 --> 01:42:07,785
It's Conrad. I'm calling in a favor.

1499
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,281
Eastbound towards northwest 135th Street.

1500
01:42:13,927 --> 01:42:16,157
Keep going northeast.

1501
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:18,993
If I'm wrong about this, you can fire my ass.

1502
01:42:19,099 --> 01:42:21,226
This is what I need.

1503
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:23,565
I need a SWAT team, helicopters...

1504
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:27,436
We're calling all cars, baby. Only
I don't know where I need them.

1505
01:42:29,076 --> 01:42:33,911
- Very nice car you got there. - Yeah. That's my toy.

1506
01:42:34,014 --> 01:42:36,380
I'm taking it with me, for my collection.

1507
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:39,748
How about the wire transfers?

1508
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:44,479
Two wire transfers to your banks...

1509
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:47,754
totaling $180 million.

1510
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:50,329
And 20 in cash.

1511
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:56,766
Damn.

1512
01:43:01,575 --> 01:43:03,634
This has been a shitty week.

1513
01:43:04,912 --> 01:43:07,005
Getting full integration on that signal.

1514
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:14,786
Yeah, we're on the airfield now.

1515
01:43:14,888 --> 01:43:17,118
I bet you it's up in the old hangar section.

1516
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:24,262
Go ahead. Bring it up.

1517
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:28,628
Deposit confirmation requested.

1518
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:30,703
90 million, Geldersbank of zurich.

1519
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:37,008
No easy approach.

1520
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:38,771
No time. Fuck the backup.

1521
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:42,838
- We have to go now. - Not a problem.

1522
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:50,322
- Got an itch? I'd love to scratch it. - Scratch this.

1523
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:55,327
- I'll scratch whatever you want,
bitch. - Did you go to college?

1524
01:44:05,672 --> 01:44:07,071
Thank you.

1525
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:11,843
- You sure you want to do this? - Let's go.

1526
01:44:11,945 --> 01:44:13,469
Tuck in your skirt, baby. Come on!

1527
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:15,445
My shit always works sometimes!

1528
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:23,447
This is the best you can buy. It's
been nice doing business with you.

1529
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:36,029
Shit.

1530
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,195
It's a setup!

1531
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,309
If I get killed, I'm fucking you up!

1532
01:44:50,484 --> 01:44:52,076
Goddamn it, go.

1533
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:16,234
My God!

1534
01:45:45,205 --> 01:45:46,832
Fuck, man!

1535
01:46:12,733 --> 01:46:14,667
Mother...

1536
01:46:34,788 --> 01:46:36,415
Get down!

1537
01:46:38,191 --> 01:46:39,852
Shit!

1538
01:46:44,264 --> 01:46:45,925
You forgot your boarding pass.

1539
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:12,088
You motherfuckers!

1540
01:47:13,293 --> 01:47:17,059
- What's up? - Shit!

1541
01:48:10,617 --> 01:48:14,644
- Mike, let's go! - Shit! Get in the car!

1542
01:48:17,724 --> 01:48:19,783
Get in! Come on!

1543
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:24,961
This shit's gonna blow!

1544
01:48:26,366 --> 01:48:27,663
Get up!

1545
01:48:49,422 --> 01:48:52,448
Shit! Please catch that motherfucker!

1546
01:48:52,559 --> 01:48:54,584
- Hes hot me. - Hes hot you ? Hes hot me.

1547
01:48:54,694 --> 01:48:56,628
- You all right? - Just had a little run-in...

1548
01:48:56,730 --> 01:48:58,823
with your friend Jim Brown, but I'm fine.

1549
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:04,800
He steals our shit, kidnaps Julie, shoots at my wife.

1550
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:07,169
We beating him down!

1551
01:49:10,744 --> 01:49:13,474
Marcus, I just got one question for you , bro.

1552
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:16,242
How the hell you leave my ass
at a gunfight to go get the car?

1553
01:49:16,349 --> 01:49:19,341
You have got to shut up and let him drive!

1554
01:49:27,193 --> 01:49:29,855
Seems like that gunshot wound
has improved your driving skills.

1555
01:49:34,034 --> 01:49:35,763
You got the right to remain silent.

1556
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:42,106
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1557
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,199
- What are you doing? - Getting it out of the way.

1558
01:49:55,221 --> 01:49:56,586
Just punch it, man! Go!

1559
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:05,390
This car's faster! This is a faster car!

1560
01:50:05,498 --> 01:50:09,093
It's one or the other, baby! It's him or it's us!

1561
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:14,396
You better fucking win, that's all I know!

1562
01:50:14,507 --> 01:50:16,441
You better win!

1563
01:50:37,497 --> 01:50:39,727
Now that's how you supposed to drive!

1564
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:43,064
From now on, that's how you drive!

1565
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:10,591
Freeze!

1566
01:51:15,535 --> 01:51:17,162
He ain't even worth killing.

1567
01:51:51,237 --> 01:51:53,967
I bet when your punk ass woke up this morning...

1568
01:51:54,074 --> 01:51:57,874
 you didn't think about 5:00 you'd have a hole in your leg.

1569
01:52:01,414 --> 01:52:04,315
You couldn't kill me, you chicken shit, could you?

1570
01:52:04,417 --> 01:52:07,079
I could. You're talking like it's over.

1571
01:52:07,187 --> 01:52:09,121
I was just pausing.

1572
01:52:09,255 --> 01:52:12,281
I'm starting to get the hang of this marksman shit.

1573
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:16,452
Shooting them from 30 yards while
they're running away is not it.

1574
01:52:16,596 --> 01:52:20,259
Here's where it is, right here.
Point-blank, up close and personal.

1575
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,999
That's what I'm talking about.

1576
01:52:24,104 --> 01:52:25,731
Would you do it?

1577
01:52:25,872 --> 01:52:27,772
Mike, step off.

1578
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:29,967
Do it.

1579
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:42,046
It's over.

1580
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:51,529
He's a joke. He's a motherfuckin'joke.

1581
01:53:16,356 --> 01:53:20,019
I ever tell you I love you , man?

1582
01:53:20,126 --> 01:53:24,187
Yeah, you always be getting emotional after gunfights.

1583
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:26,389
It's 'cause I'm glad we survived.

1584
01:53:26,499 --> 01:53:28,524
Shit.

1585
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:31,399
What are you talking about?

1586
01:53:31,538 --> 01:53:34,098
I love you too, man.

1587
01:53:34,207 --> 01:53:36,198
Don't be looking at me. I said, "I love you ."

1588
01:53:36,342 --> 01:53:39,004
- I said that shit. - You my boy, man!

1589
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:41,409
No, you like my brother, man.

1590
01:53:41,514 --> 01:53:43,709
So what am I?

1591
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:48,053
- Man... - Julie, sweetie, you ...

1592
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:50,088
You're a little dangerous.

1593
01:53:50,156 --> 01:53:54,525
Yeah, you're like a magnet for random gunfire.

1594
01:53:54,627 --> 01:53:57,027
But you're all right. You're cool.

1595
01:53:57,096 --> 01:53:58,893
You down.

1596
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:02,763
So what's next?

1597
01:54:06,206 --> 01:54:10,108
See, there ain't gonna be no next.

1598
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:12,110
Whoa, Marcus. Come on.

1599
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:15,943
You wanted Mike Lowrey. You got him.

1600
01:54:16,049 --> 01:54:19,246
Right here. That's Mike. Old Mike Lowrey.

1601
01:54:19,385 --> 01:54:23,151
I'm going home to my wife to get my quality time.

1602
01:54:23,289 --> 01:54:25,120
Marcus, stop playing, man.

1603
01:54:25,225 --> 01:54:27,750
I been beat three times since we been out here.

1604
01:54:27,894 --> 01:54:32,263
I'm cool man. I don't need help. Please, back up.

1605
01:54:32,398 --> 01:54:34,298
Why are you going home to your wife?

1606
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,595
You got shot in the leg. Your dick probably don't work.

1607
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:39,103
Marcus, do you have the keys?

1608
01:54:39,205 --> 01:54:41,867
Mike wanted me to go to this gunfight.

1609
01:54:42,008 --> 01:54:44,602
Then there was this witness.

1610
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,776
My man! Sorry.

1611
01:54:48,915 --> 01:54:51,440
- Can you let me out of here? - I don't have the keys.

1612
01:54:51,584 --> 01:54:54,109
What do you mean? Why wouldn't you have keys?

1613
01:54:54,254 --> 01:54:56,119
Would you ... Ouch.

1614
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:59,988
Marcus, I thought you said you loved me. Show me love!
