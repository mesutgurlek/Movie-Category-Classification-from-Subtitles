We'll take

We'll go into quarantine
when we get back.

That's what
it's there for.

170

Quarantine's a fucking joke.
We're barely surviving here.

with Colony Five

173
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,261
and we need to
look after each other.

we should keep moving?

483
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:20,196
No! The temperature's dropping too fast.
We won't make it!

484
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,335
Come on.

485
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,319
Briggs?

486
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,486
Yeah?

487
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,357
Those people...

488
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,328
How could they...

489
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,864
I don't know, Sam.

490
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,969
When people are desperate,
they'll do

491
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,272
horrible things
to survive.

492
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:10,546
I told you I was an army captain
during the relief effort, right?

493
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:12,915
Yeah.

494
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,752
Yeah, well, I never
told you what I saw...

495
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,656
When...

496
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:22,491
When people
lose control like that.

497
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:25,794
When we go feral...

498
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,899
There's nothing
human left in us at all.

499
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,903
We might as well just
be a pack of wild dogs.

500
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,844
See, during
the relief effort,

501
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:45,981
we had, uh, 20,000 people
corralled in a stadium.

502
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,886
Food got handed out.

503
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:52,354
And the sick got treated.

504
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:58,460
But when the food
ran out...

505
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,964
The people with guns started taking
things from the people without guns.

506
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,301
And then,

507
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:06,935
when there was
nothing left to take,

508
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,673
they took people
upstairs and decided

509
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:12,408
who would live
and who would die.

510
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:19,882
It was...

511
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:22,618
It was the hunger.

512
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,753
People couldn't take it.
It just drove them mad.

513
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,625
We tried to stop it.
We really did, but...

514
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,362
We couldn't.

515
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:42,971
Me and Mason,
he was my squad back then. We left.

516
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:44,873
Tried to find a place
where we could make sure

517
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,575
that nothing like
that would happen.

518
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,415
You did.

519
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,052
Maybe.

520
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,456
You did.

521
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,703
When we get back,
we'll patch into the satellite.

522
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,637
Take a look.

523
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,509

we've got the seeds.

We're going to lead them right back to the colony.
