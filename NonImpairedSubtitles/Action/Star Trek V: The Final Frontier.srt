2
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:32,227
I thought weapons were forbidden
on this planet.

3
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:39,859
Besides...

4
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:46,783
..I can't believe you'd kill me
for a field of empty holes.

5
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:51,329
It's all I have.

6
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:19,107
- Your pain runs deep.
- What do you know of my pain?

7
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:23,486
Let us explore it...together.

8
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:26,823
Each man hides a secret pain.

9
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,994
It must be exposed and reckoned with.

10
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:35,832
It must be dragged
from the darkness into the light.

11
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:40,503
Share your pain.
Share your pain with me

12
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:43,757
and gain strength from the sharing.

13
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:05,320
Where did you get this power?.

14
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:12,660
The power was within you.

15
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:20,835
It is as if a weight
has been lifted from my heart.

16
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:25,840
- How can I repay you?
- Join my quest.

17
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:30,970
- What is it you seek?.
- What you seek.

18
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:38,812
What all men have sought
since time began.

19
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,899
The ultimate knowledge.

20
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,320
To find it we need a starship.

21
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,866
A starship? There are
no starships on Nimbus Ill.

22
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:56,121
- I have a way to bring one here.
- But how?.

23
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:04,921
Have faith, my friend.
There are more of us than you know.

24
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,924
You're a Vulcan.

25
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:41,614
'You'll have a great time
on shore leave, Bones."

26
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:44,617
'You'll be able to relax."

27
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,248
You call this relaxing?
I'm a nervous wreck.

28
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:53,710
If I'm not careful,
I'll end up talking to myself.

29
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:11,436
Greetings, Captain.

30
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:17,692
- Spock, what are you doing here?
- I'm monitoring your progress.

31
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:22,655
I'm flattered, but of all the
points of interest here why pick me?

32
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:28,912
The record for climbing EI Capitan
is in no danger of being broken.

33
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:33,208
I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

34
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:38,380
Not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain...

35
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:42,550
Because it's there.

36
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,762
I do not think you realise
the gravity of your situation.

37
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:53,853
On the contrary,
gravity is foremost on my mind.

38
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:58,900
I'm trying to make an ascent.
Go pester Dr McCoy.

39
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,155
Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.

40
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:08,118
Goddamn irresponsible...!

41
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:12,205
Playing games with life.

42
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:15,959
Concentration is vital.
You must be one with the rock.

43
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:19,879
If you don't stop distracting me...

44
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:48,908
Perhaps "because it is there" is not
sufficient reason to climb a mountain.

45
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,120
I am hardly in a position to disagree.

46
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:56,499
Hi, Bones.
Mind if we drop in for dinner?.

47
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:03,983
I am Caithlin Dar.

48
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:10,198
Yes! Our new Romulan representative.

49
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:16,913
Welcome to Paradise City,
capital of the Planet of Galactic Peace.

50
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:21,334
I'm St John Talbot, the Federation
Representative here on Nimbus Ill.

51
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:25,922
My charming companion
is the Klingon Consul, Korrd.

52
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:34,514
- I expect that's Klingon for hello.
- Come in, my dear.

53
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:56,494
20 years ago, our three governments
agreed to develop this planet.

54
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:02,876
- A new age was born.
- It died a quick death.

55
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:08,798
The settlers we conned
into coming here took to fighting.

56
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:12,927
We forbad them weapons,
but they fashioned their own.

57
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:16,264
It appears I've arrived just in time.

58
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:18,660
Get away from that transmitter.

59
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,210
Romulan.

60
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:31,214
Terran.

61
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:34,342
Klingon.

62
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:38,847
- Consider yourselves my prisoners.
- Prisoners?

63
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:43,435
We're already prisoners here
on this worthless lump of rock.

64
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:48,273
- What value could we be to you?
- Nimbus Ill is a worthless lump of rock.

65
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:54,529
But it is the only place in the galaxy
that has the three of you.

66
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:01,286
Our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety.

67
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:04,414
That's exactly what I'm counting on.

68
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:18,303
USS Enterprise,
shakedown cruise report.

69
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:21,723
I think this new ship
was put togetherbymonkeys.

70
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:29,314
Halfthe doors won't open, and guess
whosejob itis to make itright?

71
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:32,442
Borgus frat!

72
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:37,906
"Let's see what she's got, Scotty."
We found out, didn't we?

73
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:42,619
- I know you'll whip her into shape.
- Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

74
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:49,584
- I thought we were going together.
- I can't leave her when she needs me.

75
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:53,922
I had a feeling you would
say something like that.

76
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:56,758
So I brought us dinner.

77
00:15:57,008 --> 00:16:02,472
You're the most understanding woman
I know.

78
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:06,059
Red alert.

79
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,480
I just fixed that damn thing!

80
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,983
Turn it off, will you?

81
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,444
Red alert.

82
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:21,366
This is a red alert.
Enterprise, acknowledge.

83
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:26,788
This is Enterprise. Identify yourself.

84
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:33,586
This is Starfleet. We have a Priority 7
situation in the NeutraIZone.

85
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:37,340
- Scotty, this is for real.
- They can't be serious!

86
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,678
The ship's in pieces and we've got
less than a skeleton crew.

87
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:46,015
Starfleet, are you aware
of our current status?

88
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:51,813
Yes. Stand by to copy operational
orders and recall key personnel.

89
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,278
- Admit it, we're lost.
- Yes, but we're making good time.

90
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:04,075
- Commander Sulu, come in.
- I don't believe this.

91
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:06,536
Shore leave is cancelled.

92
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:11,708
- Rescued at last.
- Return to pre-arranged co-ordinates.

93
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:17,505
- You can't say we're lost.
- Is there a problem?

94
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:23,887
Yes. We've been caught in...a blizzard.

95
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,603
We can't see a thing.
Direct us to the co-ordinates.

96
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:37,192
My visual says
sunny skies and 70 degrees.

97
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:43,907
Look, the sun has come out.
It's a miracle.

98
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:48,161
Don't worry, your secretis safe
with me. I'll send the shuttle foryou.

99
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:50,580
Uhura, I owe you one.

100
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:55,293
Come and get it!

101
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:58,296
Bones, knock it off.

102
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:01,925
We're right here and we're starving.

103
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:06,638
- Bipodal seeds, Doctor?.
- Beans, Spock, but no ordinary beans.

104
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:11,226
These are from an old recipe
handed down to me by my father.

105
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:14,270
If you stick your Vulcan nose
up at these,

106
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:18,942
you're insulting
generations of McCoys.

107
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:23,238
In that case I have little choice
but to sample your beans.

108
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:36,251
Surprisingly good. It does have
a flavouring I'm not familiar with.

109
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:41,548
- That's the secret ingredient.
- Any more secret ingredient, Bones?

110
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,719
Be my guest.

111
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:52,559
- Your secret ingredient is alcohol?
- Tennessee whiskey.

112
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:56,938
Bourbon and beans, an explosive
combination. Can Spock handle it?

113
00:18:57,188 --> 00:19:03,862
With that Vulcan metabolism,
he could eat a bowl of termites.

114
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:11,244
- Doctor, I am half-human.
- It certainly doesn't show.

115
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:14,164
- Thank you.
- This guy never changes.

116
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:18,043
I insult him
and he takes it as a compliment.

117
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,426
- You two could drive a man to drink.
- What did I do?

118
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:33,767
Human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts.

119
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:39,481
You should have been killed
when you fell off that mountain.

120
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:42,567
It did cross my mind.

121
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,945
But even as I fell
I knew I wouldn't die.

122
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:51,493
- Isn't he the only one who's immortal?
- No, it isn't that.

123
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:56,664
I knew I wouldn't die
because the two of you were with me.

124
00:19:56,915 --> 00:20:01,378
- I do not understand.
- I've always known...

125
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:05,632
..l'll die alone.

126
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:13,556
I'll call Valhalla
and reserve a room for you.

127
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:24,818
All that time in space,
getting on each other´s nerves...

128
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:31,241
So what do we do on shore leave?
We spend it together.

129
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:36,496
- Other people have families.
- Other people, not us.

130
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:45,922
What are you doing?

131
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:49,926
I'm preparing to toast a "marsh melon".

132
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:56,599
I'll be damned! A marsh melon.
Where did you learn to do that?

133
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:03,898
I have familiarised myself with the
customs associated with camping out.

134
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:10,822
What do we do
after we toast the marsh melon?

135
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:16,119
- We consume them.
- No, I mean after that.

136
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:22,751
We are required to engage in a ritual
known as the sing-along.

137
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:26,838
I haven't sung around the campfire
since I was a boy in lowa.

138
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:29,758
What are we going to sing?

139
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:32,927
- "Camptown Races."
- "Pack up your troubles."

140
00:21:33,178 --> 00:21:36,306
- Are we leaving?
- It's a song title.

141
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:40,351
- "Moon over Rigel 7."
- "Row, row, row your boat."

142
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:46,733
- Do you know "Row your boat"?
- It didn't come up in my research.

143
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:49,402
The lyrics are very simple...

144
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:52,781
"Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream.

145
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:57,327
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream."

146
00:21:57,577 --> 00:22:02,040
The Doctor and I will start off
and you jump in.

147
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:08,463
- Doctor, if you please.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

148
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:29,401
- Spock, why didn't you jump in?
- I cannot comprehend the words.

149
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:36,199
It's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan.
The words aren't important.

150
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:42,122
- You just have a good time singing.
- I am sorry, Doctor.

151
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:48,002
- Were we having a good time?
- I liked him better before he died.

152
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:52,298
Let's just get some sleep.

153
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:05,979
- Captain...
- We're on leave. Call me Jim.

154
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:08,481
- Jim...
- Yes, Spock?.

155
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:12,235
Life is not a dream.

156
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:16,781
- Go to sleep, Spock.
- Yes, Captain.

157
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:21,745
- Good night, Bones.
- Good night, Jim.

158
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:26,541
- Good night, Spock.
- Good night, Doctor.

159
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,920
- Good night, Spock.
- Good night, Jim.

160
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,717
I don't know. I just don't know.

161
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:01,534
Captain Klaa, we have the target
in sight. A probe ofancient origin.

162
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:04,954
- Difflcult to hit?
- Most difflcult.

163
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:09,042
Good.
All weapons atmy control.

164
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,336
Scope.

165
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:41,991
Shooting space garbage
is no test ofa warrior's mettle.

166
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:45,370
I need a target thatfilghts back.

167
00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:49,332
Captain, new data,
hostages on Nimbus Ill.

168
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:58,550
- One ofthe hostages is a Klingon.
- And the others?

169
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,137
A Terran and a Romulan.

170
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:07,976
The Federation will be sending
a rescue ship ofits own.

171
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:12,355
Plot course forNimbus Ill.

172
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:18,069
I've always wanted to engage
a Federation ship.

173
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:26,536
Get the damn light out of my face.

174
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:40,592
We had to send the shuttlecraft.

175
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:43,762
The transporter is non-operational.

176
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:49,559
- We have received new orders.
- I had my communicator.

177
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:53,229
- You forgot to take it with you.
- I wonder why I did that.

178
00:25:54,189 --> 00:26:00,195
It appears shore leave has been
cancelled. Pack out your trash.

179
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:36,648
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by."

180
00:26:36,898 --> 00:26:40,527
- Melville.
- John Masefield.

181
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:45,698
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm well-versed in the classics.

182
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:50,036
Then how come you don't know
"Row, row, row your boat"?

183
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:04,509
- Enterprise, you have control.
- We're doing just fine.

184
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:43,923
All I can say is
they don't make them like they used to.

185
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:48,011
You told me you could have
this ship operational in two weeks.

186
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:51,556
I think you gave me too much time.

187
00:27:51,806 --> 00:27:57,145
How many times do I have to tell you?
The right tool for the right job.

188
00:27:57,353 --> 00:28:00,690
I've never seen him happier.

189
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,194
Bridge...l hope.

190
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:14,120
I could use a shower.

191
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:16,081
Yes.

192
00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:26,466
- Doesn't anything work on this ship?
- They can't send us out like this.

193
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,639
- Starfleet transmission on line.
- Put it on the view screen.

194
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:38,645
Can we have a little quiet, please?

195
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:47,237
Can you clear that up?

196
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:52,909
Can we have a little quiet?

197
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,912
- Bob!
- Jim!

198
00:28:56,162 --> 00:29:01,334
- We are dressing informally.
- I'm on my way to the shower.

199
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:04,629
I apologise for cancelling shore leave.

200
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:08,842
We have a dangerous situation
out on Nimbus III.

201
00:29:09,092 --> 00:29:11,970
On the Planet of Galactic Peace?

202
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,183
A terroristforce
has captured the only settlement.

203
00:29:17,434 --> 00:29:21,855
They've taken hostages. The Klingon,
the Romulan, the Federation Consuls.

204
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:29,320
- The Enterprise is not up to specs...
- The Enterprise is a disaster.

205
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:34,159
- We have ships in the quadrant.
- Butno experienced commanders.

206
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:37,537
- I need Jim Kirk.
- Please!

207
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:41,791
Proceed to Nimbus Ill
and assess the situation.

208
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:44,586
Avoid a confrontation.

209
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:48,715
Above all, however,
get those hostages back safely.

210
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:52,135
- Have the Klingons responded?
- No, butyou can bet they will.

211
00:29:52,385 --> 00:30:00,185
- Plot a course for Nimbus Ill, Mr Sulu.
- Course plotted.

212
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:03,813
I'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

213
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:09,402
I'm counting on each one of you
to give his best. Let's go to work.

214
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:14,074
Jim, if you ask me,
and you haven't...

215
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:18,161
I think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons.

216
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:22,791
- And they don't exactly like you.
- The feeling's mutual.

217
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:27,462
Engine room, we'll need all the power
you can muster, mister.

218
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:32,634
We'll beat those Klingon devils
even if I have to get out and push.

219
00:30:32,884 --> 00:30:35,678
I hope it won't come to that.

220
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,140
- All possible speed, Mr Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

221
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,484
- What's the matter?.
- I miss my old chair.

222
00:30:57,242 --> 00:31:01,830
The starship Enterprise
has been dispatched to Nimbus Ill.

223
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,252
Enterprise?
That's Kirk's ship!

224
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:15,051
Ifl could defeatKirk...

225
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:20,557
You would be the greatest warrior
in the galaxy.

226
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:24,894
Maximum speed! Success!

227
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:30,734
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

228
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:44,205
- Good morning, Captain.
- Forget it.

229
00:31:44,456 --> 00:31:50,128
- We have the hostage information.
- Put it on the screen.

230
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:56,885
This is an authorised transmission
from the Starfleetmemorybank.

231
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:04,476
- Not General Korrd!
- He's apparently fallen from favour.

232
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:09,689
Korrd's military strategies
were required learning at the Academy.

233
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:14,652
When they put me out to pasture,
I hope I fair better than Korrd.

234
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:20,241
This must be the hostage tape.

235
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:26,206
A short time ago, we surrendered
to the Galactic Army ofLight.

236
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:31,044
We are now in the protective custody
oftheir leader.

237
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:37,258
We will be treated humanely
as long as we cooperate.

238
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:42,430
He requests thatyou send a starship
to parley for our release at once.

239
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,268
We are in good health and would
appreciate your immediate response.

240
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:54,317
I regret this desperate act,
but these are desperate times.

241
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:59,239
I mean no harm to these innocents,
but do notputme to the test.

242
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:04,327
I implore you to respond immediately.

243
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:20,260
What is it?

244
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:26,516
- You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Perhaps I have, Captain.

245
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:56,296
Spock, what is it?
Do you know this Vulcan?

246
00:33:56,546 --> 00:34:00,050
- I cannot be certain.
- But he does seem familiar?.

247
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,887
He reminds me of someone
I knew in my youth.

248
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:09,809
- I didn't know you had one.
- I do not often think of the past.

249
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:16,024
- Who does he remind you of?
- A gifted young student.

250
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:20,028
He possessed a great intelligence.

251
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:27,327
It was assumed that he would join
the great scholars of Vulcan.

252
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:30,789
- But he was a revolutionary.
- What do you mean?

253
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,668
The knowledge he sought
was forbidden by Vulcan belief.

254
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,715
- Forbidden?
- He rejected his logical upbringing.

255
00:34:40,965 --> 00:34:43,927
He embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

256
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:52,977
He believed the key to self-knowledge
was emotion...not logic.

257
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:56,606
Imagine that, a passionate Vulcan.

258
00:34:56,856 --> 00:35:02,529
When he encouraged others to follow
him, he was banished from Vulcan.

259
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,447
Fascinating.

260
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:08,576
- Captain to the bridge.
- On my way.

261
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:16,668
- Spock?.
- Coming, Captain.

262
00:35:22,841 --> 00:35:28,847
- Approaching Nimbus Ill.
- Standard orbit, Mr Sulu.

263
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:36,062
Paradise City is demanding
to know our intentions.

264
00:35:36,312 --> 00:35:40,525
Respond with static.
Let them think we're having difficulty.

265
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:45,822
Paradise City, we are barely
receiving your transmission.

266
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:52,829
- Transporter room, status.
- Transporter is still inoperative.

267
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:58,209
If we could lock on to the hostages,
we couldn't beam them up.

268
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:04,299
- We'll have to get them out ourselves.
- Klingon vessel approaching.

269
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:08,344
Bird of Prey.
1 .9 hours till her weapons are in range.

270
00:36:09,095 --> 00:36:12,098
Damn! Let's go.

271
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:34,537
Their scanning equipment
is primitive, but effective.

272
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:39,667
- Land at co-ordinate 856.3.
- That's far from the city.

273
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:45,382
- We cannot risk detection.
- Mr Sulu, execute.

274
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:56,101
- This is the starship Enterprise.
- A Federation starship.

275
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:05,777
This is Captain Pavel Chekov.
You are in violation ofour treaty.

276
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:09,781
Release your hostages at once
orsuffer the consequences.

277
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:13,743
Your threats amuse me.
What consequences?

278
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:42,147
A Klingon warship
will arrive within the hour.

279
00:37:42,397 --> 00:37:47,736
- The Klingons will be quite angry.
- They are likely to destroy the planet.

280
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:52,073
Then it is fortunate I have you
and your starship to protect me.

281
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:58,121
You and your first officer
are to beam down to my co-ordinates.

282
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:04,753
We will be happy to beam down,
but we musthave certain assurances.

283
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,509
At foot speed, the journey
to the city will take 1 .2 hours.

284
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,429
We don't have 1 .2 hours.

285
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:21,144
Wait a minute... Perfect!
We'll have to get their attention.

286
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:39,954
What's that?

287
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:48,171
Is she naked?

288
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:29,629
Hello, boys.

289
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:34,801
I've always wanted to play
to a captive audience.

290
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:47,188
- Spock, be one with the horse.
- Yes, Captain.

291
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:55,572
Open the gate.
It's our lookout party.

292
00:39:57,198 --> 00:40:00,785
Federation soldiers are right behind us.
Close the gate.

293
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:12,255
Where are they going?

294
00:40:12,505 --> 00:40:15,967
- Spock...
- Hold your horse, I'm scanning.

295
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:26,394
The hostages are being held
in that structure.

296
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:31,983
Galileo, start your run.

297
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:38,073
Phasers on stun.
Sulu, take out that light.

298
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:58,343
- What's going on?
- Surrender, you are under attack.

299
00:40:58,593 --> 00:41:02,889
- It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
- Wait! Come back.

300
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:52,105
- Uhura, come on down.
- Roger, coming in.

301
00:42:38,693 --> 00:42:44,365
Nimbus Ill is famous forits wildllfe,
and the flshing is terrifilc!

302
00:42:44,616 --> 00:42:48,161
Easy flnancing through
Federation Federal can take you there.

303
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:52,540
- Thank God.
- Please cooperate.

304
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,502
Hand over your weapons.

305
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:01,674
Well done, my friends.

306
00:43:39,129 --> 00:43:41,381
Qualse tu?

307
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:45,260
Spock!

308
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:57,480
Spock, it's me.

309
00:43:57,731 --> 00:44:02,861
It's Sybok.
You've finally caught up with me.

310
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:08,450
Don't you have anything to say to me?

311
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:17,375
You are under arrest for 1 7 violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

312
00:44:28,511 --> 00:44:33,475
- You've developed a sense of humour.
- I did not intend to amuse you.

313
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:40,231
These are serious charges.
However, if you surrender now...

314
00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:46,654
I'm sorry, Spock, I'm not through
violating the Neutral Zone Treaty.

315
00:44:48,615 --> 00:44:53,078
In fact, I'm just getting started.
For my next violation,

316
00:44:53,328 --> 00:44:56,915
I intend to steal something.

317
00:44:57,165 --> 00:45:00,418
Something very big.

318
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:04,964
Your starship.

319
00:45:05,215 --> 00:45:09,260
You staged all this
to get your hands on my ship?

320
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:14,516
- Who are you?
- Captain James T Kirk.

321
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:21,439
I thought Captain Chekov...
I see... Very clever, Captain.

322
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:28,696
Spock, you have been given
a second chance to join me.

323
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,703
- I am a Starfleet officer.
- Of course.

324
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:41,543
Of course. Then I'll take the ship
without your help.

325
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:04,649
- Shuttle en route.
- Position of Bird of Prey?.

326
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,071
Closing!

327
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:20,040
Estimating attack range
in 8,000 kellicams.

328
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:25,253
Stealth approach,
slow to one quarterimpulse power.

329
00:46:25,503 --> 00:46:30,175
Prepare to cloak.
Engage cloaking device.

330
00:46:41,978 --> 00:46:45,440
- The Bird of Prey must have cloaked.
- Raise shields.

331
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,777
- The shuttle...?
- Do it. Go to red alert.

332
00:47:00,914 --> 00:47:04,751
Once we control your vessel,
we'll bring up our followers.

333
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:08,880
The Klingons are out there.
We'll be lucky to make it to the ship.

334
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,633
This is Enterprise, red alert.

335
00:47:11,883 --> 00:47:15,762
Bird ofPrey approaching.
Raising shields.

336
00:47:16,012 --> 00:47:19,099
Find a safe harbour.

337
00:47:20,433 --> 00:47:21,810
No!

338
00:47:24,104 --> 00:47:28,066
No reply. Remain on course.

339
00:47:28,316 --> 00:47:32,445
Listen to me. In order for this
craft to enter the landing bay,

340
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:37,117
Enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam.

341
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:42,622
- To re-raise the shields will take...
- 15.5 seconds.

342
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:47,335
An eternity, during which
we'll be vulnerable to attack.

343
00:47:47,585 --> 00:47:53,466
He speaks the truth. If my people
are cloaked, then they intend to strike.

344
00:47:54,968 --> 00:48:00,348
- We cannot turn back.
- Let me do something.

345
00:48:00,598 --> 00:48:04,227
Very well, do what you must,
but no more.

346
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:14,904
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

347
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,618
Kirk! He's on the shuttlecratf!
Alter the attack course!

348
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:25,790
Understand your situation.
Are unable to return to planet.

349
00:48:26,082 --> 00:48:32,380
Stand by to execute
emergency landing plan...B

350
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:43,600
- Emergency landing plan B?
- B as in barricade.

351
00:48:47,604 --> 00:48:50,356
What are you doing?

352
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:55,528
In order to lower and raise the shields
quickly, we'll forego the tractor beam.

353
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:58,948
We'll fly her in manually.

354
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:04,746
- How often have you done this?
- Actually, it's my first attempt.

355
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:10,877
He's good...really.

356
00:49:15,465 --> 00:49:17,634
Scotty, open bay doors.

357
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:28,728
Stand by to de-cloak forflring.

358
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:33,149
- Scotty, lower shields.
- Lowering shields.

359
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:46,454
- Bird of Prey bearing 105.2.
- Go, Sulu.

360
00:50:04,472 --> 00:50:06,015
They're in.

361
00:50:06,266 --> 00:50:10,478
- Bear on Enterprise.
- Enterprise targeted!

362
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:13,982
- Warp speed now!
- Firing!

363
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:23,408
Track her course!

364
00:50:25,452 --> 00:50:27,662
He's good.

365
00:51:08,411 --> 00:51:11,998
We must change course at once.

366
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:19,297
I'll take you to the bridge.

367
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:57,961
Pick it up.

368
00:52:04,175 --> 00:52:05,677
Sybok...

369
00:52:08,304 --> 00:52:11,349
You must surrender.

370
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:16,062
No!

371
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,402
- You must kill me.
- Shoot him!

372
00:52:33,788 --> 00:52:37,834
For a moment...
I thought you might actually do it.

373
00:52:44,466 --> 00:52:47,218
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

374
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:58,730
Spock, you will accompany me
to the bridge?

375
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:04,110
No...l will not.

376
00:53:06,237 --> 00:53:09,240
You know I'm right.

377
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:17,499
Then you must join them.

378
00:53:37,602 --> 00:53:42,774
- These two will be useful.
- Give us a moment alone.

379
00:53:43,024 --> 00:53:45,902
Don't be afraid.

380
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:07,132
Goddamn it, Spock.
You betrayed us all.

381
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:10,343
I do not expect you to forgive me.

382
00:54:10,593 --> 00:54:14,222
- I ought to knock you on your ass.
- If you think it would help.

383
00:54:14,472 --> 00:54:18,393
- You want me to hold him?
- Stay out of this... Why?.

384
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:23,273
- All you had to do was pull the trigger.
- Then Sybok would be dead.

385
00:54:23,523 --> 00:54:26,985
- I ordered you to defend your ship.
- And kill my brother.

386
00:54:27,235 --> 00:54:34,367
- A fellow Vulcan is not a...
- Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

387
00:54:34,617 --> 00:54:39,039
He's your brother brother?.
You made that up.

388
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:44,419
- I did not.
- You don't have a brother.

389
00:54:44,669 --> 00:54:48,840
- Technically I don't have a brother.
- See?

390
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:54,637
- I have a half-brother.
- I've got to sit down.

391
00:54:56,598 --> 00:55:00,769
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers?

392
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:07,817
SyboK´s mother was a Vulcan princess,
but we were raised as brothers.

393
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:15,200
- Why didn't you tell us this before?
- It is a personal matter.

394
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:20,205
- For that I am sorry.
- That makes everything all right. Sorry!

395
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:24,417
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

396
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:30,548
He's already in the brig. Besides,
we've got bigger problems to deal with.

397
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:33,676
Like how do we get out of here.

398
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:37,389
I'll say one thing,
you never cease to amaze me.

399
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:40,308
Nor I myself.

400
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:52,987
- I was beginning to worry.
- It's all right. Sybok will explain.

401
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:56,908
- What are you doing?
- Plotting our new course.

402
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:59,744
You have no authority.

403
00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:07,711
- What's going on here?
- Pavel, listen to this man.

404
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:13,675
- I don't understand.
- Each of us hides a secret pain.

405
00:56:13,925 --> 00:56:18,805
Share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing.

406
00:56:35,405 --> 00:56:37,907
Useless.

407
00:56:43,955 --> 00:56:45,749
Unwise.

408
00:56:54,591 --> 00:56:58,762
You could have warned me.
There's got to be a way out.

409
00:56:59,012 --> 00:57:03,767
- This new brig is escape-proof.
- How do you know?.

410
00:57:04,017 --> 00:57:09,355
The designers tested it using the most
intelligent person they could find.

411
00:57:09,564 --> 00:57:14,319
- He failed to escape.
- Did this person have pointed ears?

412
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:19,574
And an unerring capacity
for getting his shipmates into trouble?

413
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:23,828
He did have pointed ears.

414
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:35,507
- Following new course. Warp 7.
- Arrival in 6.7 hours at present speed.

415
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:42,472
Now that we're underway, I'll announce
my intentions to the rest of the ship.

416
00:57:43,431 --> 00:57:49,771
Brave crew ofthe starship Enterprise,
consider the questions ofexistence.

417
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:56,986
Questions that man has asked since
he first gazed at the stars and dreamed.

418
00:57:57,237 --> 00:58:01,116
My Vulcan ancestors
were ruled by their emotions.

419
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:04,202
They felt with their hearts.

420
00:58:04,452 --> 00:58:09,624
They made love with their hearts.
They believed with their hearts.

421
00:58:09,874 --> 00:58:16,965
And they believed in a place where
these questions would be answered.

422
00:58:18,174 --> 00:58:21,678
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth.

423
00:58:21,928 --> 00:58:25,932
A fantasy concocted by pagans.

424
00:58:26,182 --> 00:58:29,436
Itis no fantasy.

425
00:58:30,729 --> 00:58:35,358
I tell you...it exists.

426
00:58:35,608 --> 00:58:39,320
My brothers, we have been chosen

427
00:58:39,571 --> 00:58:44,826
to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time.

428
00:58:45,076 --> 00:58:48,371
The discovery of Sha Ka Ree.

429
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:56,379
Is it possible he's found Sha Ka Ree,
the reason he left Vulcan?

430
00:58:56,629 --> 00:59:00,967
Our destination
is the planet Sha Ka Ree.

431
00:59:01,217 --> 00:59:04,679
It lies beyond the Great Barrier...

432
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:07,849
..at the centre ofthe galaxy.

433
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:12,687
- The centre of the galaxy?.
- Where it is fabled to exist.

434
00:59:12,937 --> 00:59:18,109
The centre of the galaxy
can't be reached by any ship.

435
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:21,529
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect
I've ever known.

436
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:26,242
When I get the ship back,
and Sybok is in here,

437
00:59:26,493 --> 00:59:31,081
you can debate Sha Ka Ree
until you're green in the face.

438
00:59:31,331 --> 00:59:33,541
You're either with me or you're not.

439
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:38,671
- I am here, Captain.
- That's a little vague, Spock.

440
00:59:41,341 --> 00:59:43,885
What's that noise?

441
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,558
It's a primitive form of communication
known as Morse Code.

442
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:54,646
You're right. I'm out of practice.
That's an S.

443
00:59:54,896 --> 00:59:58,066
- T...
- A...

444
00:59:58,316 --> 01:00:01,111
N... D... End of word.

445
01:00:01,361 --> 01:00:03,363
- Stand.
- New word.

446
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:06,491
B... A...

447
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:10,745
C... K...

448
01:00:10,995 --> 01:00:14,124
- Back.
- Stand back!

449
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,882
What are you standing around for?.
This is a jailbreak.

450
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:29,055
These three are strong.
This will be quite a challenge.

451
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,892
We've got to find them.

452
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:36,312
- We can't trust anyone.
- Send a distress signal.

453
01:00:36,563 --> 01:00:41,359
There is an emergency
send apparatus in the observation room.

454
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:46,698
You might be able
to reach it by means of Turbo-shaft 3.

455
01:00:46,948 --> 01:00:51,411
- It's a long and dangerous climb.
- Some of us get off on that.

456
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:55,290
Get the transporter working
and contact a rescue ship.

457
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:00,712
- Which way to the Turbo-shaft?
- Down that tunnel and turn right.

458
01:01:00,962 --> 01:01:04,090
- You can't miss it.
- Mr Scott, you're amazing.

459
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:07,761
I know this ship
like the back of my hand.

460
01:01:18,063 --> 01:01:23,026
- We'll get a good workout.
- Yeah, or a heart attack.

461
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:47,050
Get Mr Scott to sick bay.

462
01:02:13,618 --> 01:02:16,955
This is going to take me forever.

463
01:02:22,585 --> 01:02:25,130
Where's Spock?.

464
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:30,760
I believe I've found a faster way.

465
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:47,652
- Bones?
- I'll wait for the next car.

466
01:02:47,902 --> 01:02:50,739
We're not splitting up.

467
01:02:56,161 --> 01:03:00,540
- We're too heavy.
- It must be the marsh melons.

468
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:07,130
- Spock, the booster rockets.
- I can't control their power.

469
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,507
Fire the rockets.

470
01:03:10,759 --> 01:03:14,179
Captain, please come back down.

471
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:19,434
Hit the brakes.

472
01:03:25,523 --> 01:03:30,612
- I overshot the mark by one level.
- Nobody's perfect.

473
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:42,957
Spock.

474
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:47,545
Emergency channel open.

475
01:03:47,796 --> 01:03:52,592
To anyone within range,
this is Captain James T Kirk.

476
01:03:52,842 --> 01:03:56,346
If you read me, acknowledge.

477
01:03:56,596 --> 01:03:59,057
Acknowledge.

478
01:03:59,307 --> 01:04:03,728
This is Starfleet Command,
we readyou. Over.

479
01:04:03,978 --> 01:04:10,193
A hostile force
has taken control of our vessel.

480
01:04:10,443 --> 01:04:17,534
Our co-ordinates are 000.2.
Request emergency assistance.

481
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:22,330
Understood, Enterprise. We are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately.

482
01:04:23,415 --> 01:04:26,668
Plot course 000.2.

483
01:04:26,918 --> 01:04:31,965
But Captain, that course
will take us into the Barrier as well.

484
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:35,093
Where Kirk goes, we follow.

485
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:43,977
- I trust your message was received.
- You can't expect us to stand by.

486
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:47,897
What you fear is the unknown.

487
01:04:49,315 --> 01:04:53,862
The people of your planet
once believed their world was flat.

488
01:04:54,112 --> 01:04:57,532
Columbus proved it was round.

489
01:04:57,782 --> 01:05:02,996
They said the sound barrier
could never be broken. It was broken.

490
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:06,833
They said warp speed
could not be achieved.

491
01:05:08,585 --> 01:05:14,424
The Great Barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear.

492
01:05:14,674 --> 01:05:17,427
It is an extension of personal fear.

493
01:05:17,677 --> 01:05:21,598
Captain Kirk, I so much
want your understanding.

494
01:05:21,848 --> 01:05:26,352
I want your respect.
Are you afraid to hear me out?

495
01:05:26,603 --> 01:05:31,983
- I'm afraid of nothing.
- Wait outside.

496
01:05:39,491 --> 01:05:42,160
I'm sure you have many questions.

497
01:05:42,369 --> 01:05:46,498
Here, amidst the stars
of our own galaxy,

498
01:05:46,748 --> 01:05:50,835
we shall seek the answers together.

499
01:05:58,676 --> 01:06:03,223
Easy, Scotty.
You're back with us.

500
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:09,020
I dreamt that a madman
had taken over the Enterprise.

501
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,732
- He's not a madman.
- He's not?

502
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:19,155
Sybok has put us in touch with feelings
we've always been afraid to express.

503
01:06:19,406 --> 01:06:23,702
- I have to get to the transporter.
- Scotty!

504
01:06:23,952 --> 01:06:30,667
- There's so much I want to tell you.
- Wait till I'm a wee bit stronger.

505
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:37,590
I don't think I could take it
in my present condition...or yours.

506
01:06:39,384 --> 01:06:43,263
Sha Ka Ree.
The Source.

507
01:06:44,514 --> 01:06:46,266
Heaven.

508
01:06:47,308 --> 01:06:50,687
Eden.
Call it what you will.

509
01:06:50,937 --> 01:06:53,690
The Klingons call it Qui Tu.

510
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:59,738
The Romulans, Vorta Vor.
In Andorian it is unpronounceable.

511
01:06:59,988 --> 01:07:02,741
Still, every culture shares
this common dream.

512
01:07:02,991 --> 01:07:08,830
A place from which creation sprang.
For us it will soon be reality.

513
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,792
My only reality is that
I'm a prisoner on my own ship.

514
01:07:13,043 --> 01:07:17,297
What is this power you have
to control the minds of my crew?.

515
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:21,593
I don't control minds... I free them.

516
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,347
How?.

517
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:33,063
By making you face your pain
and draw strength from it.

518
01:07:33,313 --> 01:07:36,566
Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.

519
01:07:43,073 --> 01:07:47,327
It sounds like brainwashing to me.

520
01:07:47,577 --> 01:07:50,497
Your pain is the deepest of all.

521
01:07:50,747 --> 01:07:53,500
I can feel it, can't you?

522
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,961
Leonard.

523
01:08:06,262 --> 01:08:08,973
This is some kind of trick.

524
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:12,894
Leonard.

525
01:08:15,063 --> 01:08:20,402
Father?.
My God! Don't do this to me.

526
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:23,071
Leonard.

527
01:08:33,748 --> 01:08:37,794
I'm here. I'm with you, Dad.

528
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:42,966
The pain. Stop the pain.

529
01:08:43,216 --> 01:08:49,264
I've done everything I can do.
You've got to hang on.

530
01:08:49,514 --> 01:08:52,392
I can't stand the pain.

531
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:55,311
Help me.

532
01:08:56,563 --> 01:09:00,150
All my knowledge and I can't save him.

533
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:05,447
You've done all you can.
The support system will keep him alive.

534
01:09:08,658 --> 01:09:12,537
- You call this alive?
- Son...

535
01:09:14,873 --> 01:09:18,835
- Release me.
- I can't do that, Dad.

536
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:25,550
But how can I watch him suffer
like this?

537
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,511
You're a doctor.

538
01:09:35,852 --> 01:09:38,354
I'm his son.

539
01:10:41,835 --> 01:10:44,754
Why did you do it?

540
01:10:48,091 --> 01:10:52,679
To preserve his dignity.

541
01:10:56,808 --> 01:11:00,478
- That wasn't the worst of it, was it?
- No!

542
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:02,647
Share it.

543
01:11:02,897 --> 01:11:07,360
Not long after, they found a cure.
A goddamn cure.

544
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:11,781
- If you didn't kill him, he'd have lived.
- I released him!

545
01:11:12,031 --> 01:11:15,535
- You did what you thought was right.
- Yes! No!

546
01:11:15,785 --> 01:11:18,621
Release this pain!

547
01:11:19,539 --> 01:11:23,418
This pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time.

548
01:11:25,754 --> 01:11:29,424
Now you've taken the first step.

549
01:11:29,674 --> 01:11:33,136
The other steps we'll take together.

550
01:11:39,642 --> 01:11:42,771
Each man's pain is unique.

551
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:45,607
I hide no pain.

552
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:52,739
- I know you better than that.
- Do you?

553
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:56,117
- Spock, don't.
- It's all right, Captain.

554
01:11:57,786 --> 01:12:00,163
Proceed.

555
01:12:05,043 --> 01:12:09,255
- What is this?
- I believe we are witnessing my birth.

556
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:48,670
Sarek, your son.

557
01:12:51,381 --> 01:12:53,758
So human.

558
01:12:59,139 --> 01:13:00,640
Spock?.

559
01:13:20,368 --> 01:13:24,539
- What have you done to my friends?
- Nothing. This is who they are.

560
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:29,461
- Didn't you know that?
- No, I didn't.

561
01:13:29,711 --> 01:13:33,214
- Now learn something about yourself.
- No, I refuse.

562
01:13:33,465 --> 01:13:37,844
- Jim, try to be open about this.
- About what?

563
01:13:39,137 --> 01:13:43,933
How I made wrong choices in my life?
Turning left instead of right?

564
01:13:44,184 --> 01:13:48,521
I don't need Sybok to take me
on a tour of my weaknesses.

565
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:52,567
To be brainwashed by a conman!

566
01:13:52,817 --> 01:13:59,282
- This conman took away my pain.
- With the wave of a magic wand?

567
01:13:59,532 --> 01:14:03,161
The things we carry with us
make us who we are.

568
01:14:03,411 --> 01:14:06,456
If we lose them, we lose ourselves.

569
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:10,043
I don't want my pain taken away.
I need my pain.

570
01:14:14,714 --> 01:14:19,844
Captain, you remain here.
Spock, Dr McCoy, come with me.

571
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:25,517
- Spock?.
- I cannot go with you.

572
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:29,729
- Why not?
- I belong here.

573
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:33,566
- I don't understand.
- Sybok...

574
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:36,861
You are my brother,
but you do not know me.

575
01:14:37,112 --> 01:14:40,740
I am not the outcast boy
you left behind many years ago.

576
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:47,539
I found myself and my place,
and I know who I am.

577
01:14:47,789 --> 01:14:50,917
I cannot go with you.

578
01:14:56,256 --> 01:14:59,342
You'd better count me out, too.

579
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:06,099
- Then I'll see you on the other side.
- Wait!

580
01:15:08,143 --> 01:15:11,062
We'll never make it
through the Great Barrier.

581
01:15:11,312 --> 01:15:15,191
If we do, will that convince you
that my vision was true?

582
01:15:17,694 --> 01:15:22,282
It was given to me by God.
He waits for us on the other side.

583
01:15:24,534 --> 01:15:26,786
You are mad.

584
01:15:29,914 --> 01:15:32,417
Am l?

585
01:15:33,752 --> 01:15:35,920
We'll see.

586
01:16:01,488 --> 01:16:04,365
They say no ship can survive this.

587
01:16:04,616 --> 01:16:07,285
They're wrong. Danger is an illusion.

588
01:16:07,494 --> 01:16:10,747
We have no instrument readings.

589
01:16:10,997 --> 01:16:16,127
- Mr Sulu, full ahead.
- Full ahead, aye.

590
01:17:13,643 --> 01:17:17,313
- Is it possible?
- Fascinating.

591
01:17:19,899 --> 01:17:22,694
Are we dreaming?

592
01:17:24,612 --> 01:17:29,242
If we are, then life is a dream.

593
01:17:55,727 --> 01:17:59,355
Instruments are back on line.

594
01:17:59,606 --> 01:18:01,357
Incredible.

595
01:18:01,608 --> 01:18:07,614
There is a power source emanating
from the planet like nothing I've seen.

596
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:15,705
- Sha Ka Ree.
- Qui Tu.

597
01:18:15,955 --> 01:18:18,833
Vorta Vor.

598
01:18:19,084 --> 01:18:21,503
Eden.

599
01:18:34,224 --> 01:18:37,102
- About the ship...
- The ship needs its captain.

600
01:18:37,352 --> 01:18:40,814
- No special conditions?
- No conditions.

601
01:18:43,525 --> 01:18:48,488
- I could turn us around.
- No, you too must know.

602
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:56,579
Well, if we're going to do it,
we're going to do it by the book.

603
01:18:56,830 --> 01:19:03,378
Standard orbital approach.
Alert the shuttlecraft to stand by.

604
01:19:03,628 --> 01:19:07,674
Sybok, Spock, McCoy, come with me.
The rest of you remain on board.

605
01:19:07,924 --> 01:19:10,969
Until I determine
what we're dealing with.

606
01:19:12,011 --> 01:19:16,307
Don't just stand there,
God's a busy man.

607
01:20:05,523 --> 01:20:08,359
I am no longer in control of the craft.

608
01:20:45,438 --> 01:20:48,316
All right, we'll play it your way.

609
01:21:20,974 --> 01:21:25,395
It's amazing. The land. The sky.

610
01:21:25,645 --> 01:21:28,565
Just as I knew it would be.

611
01:22:14,235 --> 01:22:17,906
- You have to see this.
- I don't have time.

612
01:22:18,156 --> 01:22:22,827
The Captain told me
to get the transporter working.

613
01:23:56,212 --> 01:23:59,132
We have travelled far.

614
01:24:03,762 --> 01:24:05,805
By starship.

615
01:24:14,189 --> 01:24:17,609
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

616
01:24:19,194 --> 01:24:21,613
We have...

617
01:24:31,873 --> 01:24:34,042
Sybok.

618
01:24:37,128 --> 01:24:39,381
Perhaps...

619
01:26:54,557 --> 01:27:00,939
Brave souls, welcome.

620
01:27:06,653 --> 01:27:09,322
Is this the voice of God?

621
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:14,536
One voice, many faces.

622
01:27:26,297 --> 01:27:29,926
Does this better
suit your expectations?

623
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:48,820
- Qualse tu?
- It is l.

624
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:53,533
Yourjourney
could not have been an easy one.

625
01:27:53,742 --> 01:27:57,162
It was not.
We had to breach the Barrier.

626
01:27:57,412 --> 01:28:03,793
Magnificent.
You are the first to find me.

627
01:28:04,044 --> 01:28:10,675
- We sought only your infinite wisdom.
- How did you breach the Barrier?.

628
01:28:10,925 --> 01:28:15,555
- With a starship.
- This starship...

629
01:28:15,805 --> 01:28:21,061
Could it carry my wisdom
beyond the Barrier?.

630
01:28:21,311 --> 01:28:25,523
- It could, yes.
- Then I shall make use of it.

631
01:28:25,774 --> 01:28:29,694
- It will be your chariot.
- Excuse me...

632
01:28:29,944 --> 01:28:36,951
- I will reach every corner of creation.
- I'd like to ask a question.

633
01:28:38,953 --> 01:28:44,209
- What does God need with a starship?
- Bring the ship closer.

634
01:28:44,459 --> 01:28:49,255
What does God need with a starship?

635
01:28:49,506 --> 01:28:52,717
- What are you doing?
- Asking a question.

636
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:58,640
- Who is this creature?
- Don't you know?. Aren't you God?

637
01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:04,312
- He has his doubts.
- You doubt me?

638
01:29:04,562 --> 01:29:10,318
- I seek proof.
- You don't ask the Almighty for his ID.

639
01:29:10,568 --> 01:29:13,571
Then here is the proof you seek.

640
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:30,672
- Why is God angry?.
- Why have you done this?

641
01:29:30,922 --> 01:29:34,801
- He doubts me.
- You have not answered his question.

642
01:29:35,051 --> 01:29:38,012
What does God need with a starship?

643
01:29:46,938 --> 01:29:49,691
Do you doubt me?

644
01:29:54,487 --> 01:30:00,952
I doubt any god who inflicts pain
for his own pleasure.

645
01:30:01,202 --> 01:30:05,165
Stop! The god of Sha Ka Ree
would not do this.

646
01:30:05,415 --> 01:30:11,755
Sha Ka Ree? A vision you created.

647
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:19,804
An eternity I've been
imprisoned in this place.

648
01:30:20,055 --> 01:30:25,727
The ship. I must have the ship.

649
01:30:25,977 --> 01:30:30,774
Now...give me what I want.

650
01:30:31,024 --> 01:30:32,901
Sybok...

651
01:30:33,151 --> 01:30:37,864
This is not the god of Sha Ka Ree,
or any other god.

652
01:30:38,114 --> 01:30:41,993
I don't understand.
Reveal yourself to me.

653
01:30:50,418 --> 01:30:53,380
What's wrong?
Don't you like this face?

654
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:58,343
I have so many,
but this one suits you best.

655
01:30:58,593 --> 01:31:02,514
No, it's not possible.

656
01:31:02,764 --> 01:31:07,310
- Bring me the ship or I will destroy you.
- The ship.

657
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:15,402
Bring it closer so that I might join with it.

658
01:31:16,152 --> 01:31:23,827
Do it, or watch these puny things

659
01:31:24,077 --> 01:31:26,830
die horribly.

660
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:34,629
- What have I done?
- Enterprise, listen carefully.

661
01:31:34,879 --> 01:31:39,634
This is my doing. This is my arrogance.
My vanity.

662
01:31:39,884 --> 01:31:43,179
- Sybok, we must find a way...
- No, save yourselves.

663
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:46,182
Forgive me, brother.

664
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:54,691
I couldn't help but notice your pain.

665
01:31:54,941 --> 01:31:57,736
It runs deep. Share it with me.

666
01:32:02,115 --> 01:32:05,869
- Enterprise, are you ready?.
- Torpedo armed.

667
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:10,623
- We're firing on your position.
- Send it down now!

668
01:32:19,382 --> 01:32:21,509
Run!

669
01:32:38,568 --> 01:32:39,861
Sybok...

670
01:32:46,951 --> 01:32:49,704
Let's get out of here.

671
01:32:51,623 --> 01:32:54,292
Sulu, I've lost them.

672
01:33:20,944 --> 01:33:23,780
Spock, get us out of here.

673
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:37,544
Thrusters are inoperative.

674
01:33:51,891 --> 01:33:56,813
Mr Scott, please tell me
the transporter is working.

675
01:33:57,063 --> 01:33:59,899
I might be able to beam up two of you.

676
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:05,113
- Beam up Spock and Dr McCoy now.
- Just a damn minute!

677
01:34:09,784 --> 01:34:11,995
Bring up the Captain.

678
01:34:37,604 --> 01:34:42,400
- We can't just leave Jim down there.
- Get a grip on yourself. Status report.

679
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:46,154
The Klingon captain
wishes to name his terms.

680
01:34:47,781 --> 01:34:50,825
This is Captain Klaa
ofthe Klingon Empire.

681
01:34:51,076 --> 01:34:56,247
Do not attempt to arm your weapons
orl will destroy you.

682
01:34:56,498 --> 01:35:02,962
You are alive for a single reason:
the renegade James TKirk.

683
01:35:03,213 --> 01:35:07,175
Hand him over
and I will spare your lives.

684
01:35:07,425 --> 01:35:12,389
- I'm ready to beam him aboard.
- Captain Kirk is not among us.

685
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:17,685
- You lie.
- Vulcans are incapable of lying.

686
01:35:17,936 --> 01:35:22,649
- Captain Kirk is on the planet below.
- Then give me his co-ordinates.

687
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:32,158
- I am in need of your assistance.
- My assistance?

688
01:35:32,409 --> 01:35:36,996
- You are his superior officer.
- I am a foolish old man.

689
01:35:37,247 --> 01:35:40,417
Damn you, sir. You will try.

690
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:50,885
Klingon commander,
someone wishes to speak with you.

691
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:43,980
So it's me you want, you bastards.

692
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:46,900
What are you waiting for?.

693
01:37:11,549 --> 01:37:14,094
Release him.

694
01:37:14,344 --> 01:37:19,682
Myjunior officer has something
he wants to say to you.

695
01:37:23,478 --> 01:37:27,315
I...apologise.

696
01:37:34,739 --> 01:37:40,078
The attack upon your vessel
was not authorised by my government.

697
01:37:42,789 --> 01:37:48,128
Now, may I present
our new gunner.

698
01:37:57,095 --> 01:38:03,059
- Spock!
- Welcome aboard, Captain.

699
01:38:09,899 --> 01:38:13,445
I thought I was going to die.

700
01:38:13,695 --> 01:38:17,532
Not possible, you were never alone.

701
01:38:22,495 --> 01:38:27,042
Please, Captain,
not in front of the Klingons.

702
01:38:46,811 --> 01:38:50,899
Would you care for a wee nip
of Scotch whisky?.

703
01:38:52,734 --> 01:38:55,862
I never thought
I'd be drinking with a Klingon.

704
01:38:56,112 --> 01:39:03,828
- What are you two conspiring about?
- About the progress we've made.

705
01:39:08,291 --> 01:39:11,378
She has wonderful muscles.

706
01:39:28,061 --> 01:39:31,106
Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?

707
01:39:31,356 --> 01:39:36,486
We were speculating...
Is God really out there?

708
01:39:39,155 --> 01:39:42,117
Maybe he's not out there.

709
01:39:42,367 --> 01:39:46,287
Maybe he's right here
in the human heart.

710
01:39:50,959 --> 01:39:55,004
- Spock?.
- I was thinking of Sybok.

711
01:39:55,797 --> 01:39:59,926
- I have lost a brother.
- Yes.

712
01:40:02,721 --> 01:40:05,640
I lost a brother, once.

713
01:40:07,559 --> 01:40:10,520
I was lucky. I got him back.

714
01:40:12,147 --> 01:40:15,525
I thought you said
men like us don't have families.

715
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,990
I was wrong.

716
01:40:41,176 --> 01:40:46,514
Are you just going to pluck that thing,
or are you going to play something?

717
01:40:52,896 --> 01:40:55,940
# Row, row, rowyour boat

718
01:40:56,191 --> 01:40:59,944
# Gently down the stream

719
01:41:00,195 --> 01:41:03,114
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

720
01:41:03,364 --> 01:41:06,201
# Llfe is but a dream... #

721
01:41:07,452 --> 01:41:11,623
