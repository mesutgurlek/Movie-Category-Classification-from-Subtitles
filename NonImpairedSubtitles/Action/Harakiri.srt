pays a visit to the Kandabashi mansion
of the Honorable Lord Doi

9
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:34,192
to present fresh river trout
from the Shirakawa River,

10
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,329
which arrived from our domain.

11
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,228
No other official business to record.

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,424
However,

13
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,604
at about 4:00 in the afternoon,

OFFICIAL RESIDENCE OF THE IYI CLAN

34
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:30,393
You were a retainer of the former
Fukushima Clan in Hiroshima?

35
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,695
That is correct.

36
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,234
My name is Hanshiro Tsugumo.

37
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,406
Written with the character
tsu as in "harbor"

38
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,346
and gumo as in "cloud."

39
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,511
What is the nature of your visit?

40
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,951
My master's house fell in 1619.

41
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,456
I subsequently left the domain
and moved here to Edo,

42
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,961
where I found shelter
in a back-alley tenement.

43
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,496
While eking out a meager living,

44
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:06,234
I sought connections
for employment with a new master.

45
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:11,537
But try as I might,
we live in times of peace,

46
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,272
and my every effort has been in vain.

47
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,817
Failing to find employment
and with little to do,

48
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,248
he finds himself in dire straits

49
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,049
and believes
he can endure it no further.

50
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,321
Rather than live on
in such poverty and disgrace,

51
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,790
he wishes to die
honorably by harakiri

52
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:40,336
and asks for permission
to use our forecourt.

53
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,841
Such is his request.

54
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,479
Not again.

55
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,549
Will they never stop?

56
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,052
How shall I respond?

57
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,991
Fine. Show him in.

58
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,377
This is the room, sir.

59
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,885
Please go in.

60
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,292
Thank you.

61
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,052
I am a former retainer

62
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,388
of Lord Masanori Fukushima
of Hiroshima,

63
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,831
Hanshiro Tsugumo by name.

64
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,394
I respectfully beg your favor.

65
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,667
I am senior counselor
of the House of Iyi, Kageyu Saito.

66
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,366
I am much obliged
for this immediate interview.

67
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,836
The purpose of my visit -

68
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,912
I've already been told
of your request.

69
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,580
Rather than live on
in endless poverty,

70
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,180
idly waiting for death,

71
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,484
you wish to end your life in a manner
befitting a samurai, by harakiri.

72
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,091
I believe that was the gist of it?

73
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,192
That is correct.

74
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,697
In these times,
it is a truly admirable resolve.

75
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,338
I can only express the highest esteem.

76
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,367
You mentioned

77
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,638
that you served
the former Lord Fukushima.

78
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,177
Did you happen to know
a man named Motome Chijiiwa?

79
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,044
Chijiiwa?

80
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,748
Yes.

81
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,123
Hmm...

82
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,728
You don't recognize the name?

83
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,130
I'm quite certain he said
he'd served the former Lord Fukushima.

84
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,634
In its prosperous days,
the clan's retainers

85
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,198
numbered some 12,000 men.

86
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,509
One could hardly know them all.

87
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,909
I see.

88
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,505
But never mind that.

89
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:41,143
Earlier this year,
perhaps around the end of January,

90
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,890
this ronin named Motome Chijiiwa
came calling,

91
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,850
and the purpose of his visit
was the same as yours.

92
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:54,258
He requested the use of our forecourt
to dispatch himself with honor.

93
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,430
Is that right?

94
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:08,441
Would you like me to tell you
what happened in that case?

95
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,579
I would indeed.

96
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:16,614
You say you were a retainer
of the former Fukushima Clan in Hiroshima?

97
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,855
That is correct.

98
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,288
I served the former
Lord Masanori Fukushima of Hiroshima.

99
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,593
My name is Motome Chijiiwa.

100
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,790
What is the nature of your visit?

101
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,866
After the fall of my master's house,

102
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,529
I moved here to Edo
and found shelter in a back-alley tenement.

103
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,275
While eking out a meager living,

104
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,246
I sought connections
for employment with a new master.

105
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,642
But try as I might,
we live in times of peace...

106
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,850
and my every effort has been in vain.

107
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,397
So now it seems it's our turn.

108
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,732
How shall we respond?

109
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,376
Let me think.

110
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,246
It's amazing how such foolishness
can take hold.

111
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,584
Blame it on what
the Sengoku Clan did.

112
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,150
Say what you will, that was a mistake.
- I disagree, Yazaki.

113
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,190
That's not necessarily true.
- Why not?

114
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:32,687
The fellow who went to the Sengoku house
was serious about disemboweling himself.

115
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,597
There was nothing dishonorable
about his intent.

116
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,696
Precisely because
they were touched by his sincerity,

117
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:44,706
the Sengoku house decided
to take him in as a back-room retainer.

118
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,574
That was good.
They made the right decision in that case.

119
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,845
The problem

120
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,782
is the shameless imitators
who have followed.

121
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,082
They have no intention whatsoever
of performing harakiri,

122
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,018
and just because they're hurting a little
for food and clothing,

123
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,021
they show up at our gate
to practice their thinly disguised extortion.

124
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:09,759
We can't very well allow him
to disembowel himself in our gateway.

125
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,872
Our only choice is to follow
the example of other clans;

126
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,133
give him a little something
and ask him to leave.

127
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,071
No.

128
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,079
That will not do.

129
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,641
If we give him money
and send him away,

130
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,881
he'll soon be followed by others.

131
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,147
One after the other,

132
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,392
like ants drawn to a mound of sugar.

133
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,389
Ever since the Battle of Sekigahara,

134
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,930
Edo has been teeming with ronin -
masterless samurai.

135
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,169
They're like wild dogs
roving about in search of prey.

136
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:52,075
Think what people will say.

137
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,711
"The House of Iyi has gone soft
like the others.

138
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,285
Everybody thought they had backbone,
so until now, the ronin avoided their gate.

139
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,626
But look what they've done now.

140
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,989
They boast of their martial valor,

141
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,324
but this is a time of peace,

142
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,127
so they're just
living in yesterday's dreams."

143
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,237
Would you have such laughable chatter

144
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,267
spreading all over Edo?

145
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,005
Especially when His Lordship
is away in his domain.

146
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,771
Under no circumstances can we allow

147
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:33,475
a stain to come upon our lord's name
while he's away.

148
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,917
Giving him money
and asking him to leave -

149
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,856
such lily-livered nonsense
is out of the question.

150
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,759
He hasn't the slightest intention
of killing himself,

151
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,430
yet he speaks of honorable harakiri.

152
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,296
Counselor!

153
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,273
If I may...

154
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,301
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

155
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,451
I am Umenosuke Kawabe,
a member of Lord Iyi's mounted guard.

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,412
My name is Motome Chijiiwa,
a ronin from Hiroshima.

157
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,018
Kindly come with me.

158
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,316
Excuse me?

159
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,223
I am to show you to the bath.

160
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,396
Since Lord Iyi is at present
away in his domain,

161
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:05,677
Senior Counselor Saito conveyed your
request to His Lordship's son, Bennosuke.

162
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,246
He finds your resolve most admirable

163
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,042
and wishes you to be brought forward
for an immediate audience.

164
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:18,787
I am to have an audience
with Master Bennosuke?

165
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,356
That is correct.

166
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,763
I must beg your pardon,
but your present attire will not do.

167
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,660
While you refresh yourself
in the bath,

168
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,964
we'll see to some new robes for you.

169
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,841
I place myself in your hands.

170
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,571
Your kindness overwhelms me.

171
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,925
I must be dreaming.

172
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,587
This is so...

173
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,592
completely unexpected.

174
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,598
Almost -

175
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,530
Pardon me.

176
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,421
My apologies
for keeping you waiting so long.

177
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,419
I must ask you to change again.

178
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,556
Your robes.

179
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,355
Is something wrong?

180
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,654
What about my audience
with Master Bennosuke?

181
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,528
I was told
I'd be granted an audience.

182
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,531
I don't believe so.

183
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,306
You must have misunderstood.
- No, I'm quite certain.

184
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,306
That was the word I received from
Umenosuke Kawabe of the mounted guard.

185
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,110
Kawabe?

186
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,717
Now that you mention it...

187
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,118
Yes, that must be it.

188
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,853
So I'm not mistaken?

189
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,094
I believe I understand.

190
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:47,769
When Senior Counselor Saito
personally conveyed your desire

191
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,838
to Master Bennosuke,

192
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,202
he noted how rare it is these days to find
men with such a great sense of honor.

193
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:58,247
"I would like to add this man
to the ranks of our retainers," he said.

194
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:05,655
"But when a man declares
that he wishes to tear his belly open,

195
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,491
it can only come
from a most profound resolve.

196
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,526
I am sure it would be no use
trying to dissuade him.

197
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,931
Grant him his final wish.

198
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,107
Although I would like to meet
this man of such uncommon valor

199
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,640
and tell him how much
I admire his purpose,

200
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:29,905
I am unfortunately scheduled to go
to Lord Doi's residence at this hour.

201
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,208
Extend to him
every courtesy of this house,

202
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,414
and have all our retainers
witness his final act,

203
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,590
that they may remember it
as a proud example."

204
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,855
Such were Master Bennosuke's words,
I was told.

205
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,247
Tell me;
What do you think of this story?

206
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,549
A most interesting tale,

207
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,549
worthy of the famous red armor
that symbolizes the House of Iyi

208
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,757
and its reputation for great martial valor.

209
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,455
May I ask what your intentions are?

210
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,834
You mean...

211
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,571
about this?

212
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,074
Exactly.

213
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,181
You may set your mind at ease.

214
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,010
I came here
with every intention of dying.

215
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,887
Well, well.

216
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,222
A most admirable resolve.

217
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,729
In that case, Master Tsugumo...

218
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,732
perhaps I should recount for you

219
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,099
a little more of Motome Chijiiwa's story.

220
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,869
By all means.

221
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,837
Now then,
we must be aware of the time.

222
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,808
Please change into those robes.

223
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,711
All other arrangements
are already in place

224
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,648
for a harakiri ceremony
with all the proper formalities.

225
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,790
I have a request.

226
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,860
I must beg a brief respite.

227
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,757
Respite?

228
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,734
I will not run or hide.
I will return to this house.

229
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,366
But I beg you
for a day or two respite.

230
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,472
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

231
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,309
- But this is absurd!
- Absurd?

232
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:50,618
We made the harakiri arrangements
at your own request.

233
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,847
My most abject apologies!

234
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,150
Just a day or two respite.
I will return without fail.

235
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,791
A samurai's word is his bond.

236
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,697
There can be no delay!

237
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,737
Master swordsman Hayato Yazaki.

238
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,044
Fit and eager,
his skills honed to perfection.

239
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,287
One false step
and he'll slice you in two.

240
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,390
The others will descend on you as well.

241
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,564
Rather than being chopped up
like a dead fish,

242
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,201
perform harakiri
and die like a samurai.

243
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,169
Now, change into those robes.

244
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,973
O ancestors of the House of Iyi...

245
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:56,279
I must beg your forgiveness
for defiling the mansion courtyard

246
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,973
with unworthy ronin blood.

247
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,996
I do this to preserve
the honor of this house,

248
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,327
as well as that
of the Tokugawa family,

249
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,637
and of the samurai code itself.

250
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,474
I beg you to be witness
to my decision.

251
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,687
His short blade is the same.

252
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,131
Look at it.

253
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:25,301
It wouldn't cut tofu.

254
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:31,300
He sells off his soul as a samurai,
replacing his blades with bamboo,

255
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,205
and then shows up
saying he wants to perform harakiri?

256
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,904
The nerve of the man!

257
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,145
Everything is in place
for the ceremony to begin.

258
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,038
Master Motome Chijiiwa...

259
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,100
rather than sit and wait
for death in dire poverty,

260
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:10,270
you've declared your wish
to die honorably by harakiri.

261
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,047
It is a commendable decision.

262
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,446
You are an example for all samurai.

263
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,155
I am ashamed to admit

264
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,856
that even in this house known for martial
valor since our ancestor Naomasa's day,

265
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,270
the resolve you've shown
is seen but rarely.

266
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,964
So that they may witness
the noble demise of a true warrior,

267
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,403
and engrave a lasting impression of it
upon their minds,

268
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,042
I've ordered all retainers
of this household to attend.

269
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,051
May your heart be at peace.

270
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,249
I beg of you!

271
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,754
What is it?

272
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:02,662
I beg for a brief respite -
a day or two's grace!

273
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,599
I swear I will not run or hide.
I'll return to this spot without fail!

274
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,339
Please! I implore you!

275
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,536
This is most unexpected.

276
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,770
I've heard lately
of incidents all across Edo

277
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,441
in which ronin who don't deserve
to call themselves samurai

278
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:26,583
demand the use of a clan's forecourt
to commit harakiri

279
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,753
but are happy to walk away
in exchange for a few coins.

280
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,395
Surely you're not -

281
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,263
Absolutely not, sir.

282
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,164
No, no.

283
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,096
Of course not.

284
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:47,445
I'd never believe that a man
of your noble character and mien

285
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,910
could be such a despicable extortionist.

286
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,146
Now then.

287
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,246
You may proceed.

288
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,672
Unworthy as I am,
I shall be your second.

289
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,643
I am an exponent
of the Shindo-Munen-Ichi school.

290
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,347
I imagine you are aware,
but let me note just to be sure.

291
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:35,023
The rite of harakiri
has changed over time.

292
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,754
In recent years,
it is often harakiri in name only.

293
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,098
The subject reaches for the blade
on the wooden stand,

294
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,995
and his second immediately
strikes off his head.

295
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,000
In other words,
there is no disembowelment at all,

296
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:55,176
and in fact sometimes
the stand holds not a short sword

297
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,473
but only a folding fan.

298
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,542
However,

299
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,619
our proceedings today will not sink

300
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,689
to such debased and empty forms.

301
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,224
We shall adhere strictly
to the traditional ways.

302
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,628
Is that understood?

303
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,533
You will rip your bowels open
crosswise, like this.

304
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,967
Once I see you have done so,
I will strike off your head.

305
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,916
Until I'm satisfied
you've fully torn open your bowels,

306
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,211
I will not bring down my sword.

307
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,947
Is that understood?
Now then.

308
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,494
It is your own sword.

309
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,761
That is the blade you will use.

310
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,161
A samurai's sword is his soul.

311
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:30,274
No blade could be more fitting
for this purpose than your own.

312
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,167
Come. What keeps you?

313
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,068
Proceed.

314
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:41,402
Strike! Strike me!

315
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,605
No, not yet!

316
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,341
Pull your blade across!

317
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,400
Why do you delay?

318
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,332
Draw your blade across!
Pull it to the right!

319
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,480
I suppose he had no other recourse,

320
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,254
but even so,
to bite off his tongue?

321
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:11,326
Would you say he was being resourceful,
or just unseemly?

322
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,955
Then again,

323
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:18,761
who in his right mind attempts harakiri
with just a bamboo sword?

324
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,467
Now then...

325
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,007
what are your intentions?

326
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,182
You mean...

327
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,412
about this?

328
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,718
The account I've given you

329
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:45,186
of Motome Chijiiwa's fate
is true in every detail.

330
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,890
Take my advice, Master Tsugumo.

331
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,403
Quietly take your leave.

332
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,537
You need have no such concerns with me.

333
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:04,007
Unlike this Chijiiwa fellow...

334
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,283
the sword in my belt
is not made of bamboo.

335
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,183
Rest assured, I will not bite off my tongue.
I will disembowel myself in grand form.

336
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,792
Very well.

337
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,892
Master Tsugumo,

338
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:28,300
since you are unswerving in your resolve,
I shall grant your wish.

339
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,334
Attendant!

340
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,039
This ronin from Hiroshima,
Master Hanshiro Tsugumo,

341
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,447
is to be granted use of the courtyard
to perform harakiri.

342
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,223
His present dress will not do.

343
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,656
Give him fresh robes befitting
one who journeys to the next world.

344
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,193
If I may.

345
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,694
What is it?

346
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,595
Please do not trouble yourselves
over such things.

347
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,306
For the final moments
of a down-and-out ronin like myself...

348
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:08,107
surely nothing is more fitting
than the clothes I now wear.

349
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:31,158
I am deeply grateful for the courteous
and considerate treatment

350
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,030
you have accorded me today.

351
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:39,276
I can find no adequate words
to thank you.

352
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,305
Now then, I shall begin.

353
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,479
Might I ask, Counselor,

354
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,621
who will be serving as my second?

355
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:58,228
I have assigned Ichiro Shinmen.

356
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,128
Master Shinmen?

357
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,032
Did you wish for someone else?

358
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,005
Yes, sir.

359
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:15,740
I would like Master Hikokuro Omodaka.

360
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,744
You request Hikokuro?

361
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,742
I believe he's a retainer in this house.

362
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:25,150
I've heard he's trained
in the Shindo-Munen-Ichi school.

363
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,218
Indeed.

364
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,019
Hikokuro is a fine choice.

365
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,252
Hikokuro.

366
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,626
I'm afraid he's not
in attendance today.

367
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:44,399
He sent a note saying he's ill
and requesting a few day's rest.

368
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,578
I see. That's too bad.

369
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,437
Master Tsugumo.

370
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,642
As you heard,
Omodaka is not present today.

371
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,947
You will need to make another choice.

372
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,125
That is most disappointing.

373
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,593
I had my heart set on Master Omodaka
performing the service.

374
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:12,166
I wonder if I might not beg
his special consideration.

375
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,267
Well,

376
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,576
he says he's ill,
but he seemed fine yesterday.

377
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,039
Surely it can't be anything serious.

378
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,883
Messenger!

379
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,991
Make all due haste
to Omodaka's residence.

380
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:44,562
Tell him to come immediately,
if his illness permits. Now hurry.

381
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,501
I'm putting you
to a great deal of trouble.

382
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,376
Please accept my apologies.

383
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,213
Now then,

384
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,984
do you wish to wait here

385
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,482
or would you like
to come inside and relax?

386
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,089
No.

387
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,954
The comfort of your residence
might cause my resolve to waver.

388
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,034
My journey into eternity mustn't grow
distasteful. I shall remain here.

389
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,271
You display remarkable discipline.

390
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,574
I can but express my admiration.

391
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,037
If I may, Counselor,

392
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:35,417
it could be quite tedious for us both
to sit here and wait in silence.

393
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,383
To pass the time,

394
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,718
perhaps you'll allow me to tell you
a little about myself.

395
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,625
About yourself?

396
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,028
Yes.

397
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:55,736
The hardscrabble tales of a half-starved
ronin don't amount to much,

398
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,439
but what befalls others today

399
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,703
may be your own fate tomorrow.

400
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,245
Perhaps your retainers

401
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,682
will find some small point or two
worth remembering

402
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,856
among my otherwise
useless ramblings.

403
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,556
"What befalls others today
may be your own fate tomorrow"?

404
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,530
This could be amusing.

405
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,538
I want everyone here
to listen carefully to this man.

406
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,144
The words of one
staring death in the face...

407
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,752
are unlikely to be useless ramblings.

408
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:48,013
I'm sure we'll all learn something.

409
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,461
Counselor.

410
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,137
That tale you related earlier -

411
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:05,533
may I be assured
it was true in every detail?

412
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,574
Indeed.

413
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,114
The ronin from Hiroshima
named Motome Chijiiwa

414
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,187
was a man of some acquaintance to me.

415
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,976
Motome Chijiiwa...

416
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,979
was a man of some acquaintance to me.

417
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,949
Motome was a lad of 15,

418
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,924
and my daughter Miho
was an angelic child of 11.

419
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,396
That was 11 years ago.

420
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,763
But when I close my eyes,

421
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:50,473
their images come back to me vividly,
as if it were only yesterday.

422
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,633
- My turn again.
- Never mind.

423
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,239
All we do all day is count stones
to repair the castle walls.

424
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,738
We won't be needing bows and arrows
for a good long while.

425
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:22,308
"The world is at peace.
The four seas are calm."

426
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:29,013
Incidentally, this coming 22nd

427
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,585
is the seventh anniversary
of Nui's passing.

428
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:36,081
I knew it was coming up,
but is it seven years already?

429
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:41,157
Yes, and I'm planning
a modest ceremony at my residence.

430
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,094
Don't bring any offerings.

431
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,767
Very well.

432
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,563
I can hardly believe it.

433
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,762
Seven years already.

434
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,243
What never ceases to amaze me

435
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,347
is how a rough warrior like you

436
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:01,143
has managed to raise Miho all these years
without taking a second wife.

437
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,751
Come, Jinnai.

438
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,953
Look who's talking.

439
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:10,718
When your Yuki died,
I wondered how you would ever manage.

440
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,561
But look at you.

441
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:16,699
You're a perfect example
of the kite begetting a hawk.

442
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,296
Kite begetting a hawk?

443
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,695
You were the widower kite,

444
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:25,467
doting so on your child
in every aspect of his upbringing,

445
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,007
that Io and behold,

446
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:32,046
the child grew not into a kite
but a magnificent young hawk.

447
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,739
Nonsense.

448
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,915
He certainly keeps growing,
but he's got a long way to go

449
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:42,487
before you can compare him
to a young hawk soaring freely overhead.

450
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,518
You know,

451
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,460
I never figured either of us would be good
for anything but battlefield laurels,

452
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,627
but we haven't done too bad
at raising children.

453
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:04,806
Had life gone on like that,
all would have been well.

454
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,582
But it was not to be.

455
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,087
When all is said and done,

456
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,657
our lives are like houses
built on foundations of sand.

457
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,330
One strong wind and all is gone.

458
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:30,068
How my master's house
with its 498,000-koku domain

459
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,208
was brought to ruin...

460
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:37,843
I'm sure you already know
even better than I do myself.

461
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,712
Owing to an unreasonable and one-sided
judgment by the Tokugawa shogunate

462
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:48,449
regarding the repairs
being performed on Hiroshima Castle,

463
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,760
in June of 1619,

464
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,993
my master, Masanori Fukushima,
was ordered into exile at Kawanakajima,

465
00:43:56,367 --> 00:44:00,667
leaving his 12,000 retainers
without any means of livelihood...

466
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,536
through no fault of their own.

467
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,997
Jinnai!

468
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,405
TO HANSHIRO TSUGUMO

469
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,653
In view of our long-standing friendship,
I ask your indulgence in the following:

470
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,023
The castle repairs commissioner,

471
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,560
the Honorable Masakatsu Fukushima,

472
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,833
will be electing death at any moment.

473
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:09,534
Therefore, I will precede him
on his journey.

474
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,001
My company alone will suffice.

475
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,371
I beg you not to follow.

476
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,215
Regarding my only child, Motome,

477
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,681
he has grown tall,
but he is still only 15.

478
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,590
Please look after him
as he finds his way in life.

479
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,772
Why did he have to be so hasty?

480
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,270
Committing harakiri
even before I have done so.

481
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,182
Hanshiro, I forbid you to follow.

482
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,985
If the house could still be saved, I might
wish you to accompany me in death.

483
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,951
But with the house abolished,
it would be pointless.

484
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,818
Jinnai's company will suffice.
- But, sire!

485
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,858
Don't be foolish, Hanshiro.

486
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:11,932
Jinnai died because he knew
you would if he didn't.

487
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,163
He died to accompany me
on your behalf as well.

488
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,232
Which means, Hanshiro,

489
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,834
that you must now live on.

490
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,612
Both for you and for him.

491
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,456
And also for his son, Motome.
Who will look after him if not you?

492
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:43,028
I go now to meet Jinnai.

493
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:49,103
Hanshiro, is there anything
you'd like me to tell him?

494
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,644
Do you have nothing for me to say?

495
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,380
Tell Jinnai...

496
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,842
Tell Jinnai this.

497
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,146
Have no fears about Motome.

498
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,719
I will watch over his every step
on the path to manhood.

499
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:15,397
I will not fail him.
I swear this on my life.

500
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,535
Go on, Master Tsugumo.

501
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,914
What did you find out?

502
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,712
It seems his illness
is indeed most serious.

503
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:42,116
What's the nature of the ailment?

504
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,851
According to his family,
a high fever

505
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:48,156
and excruciating pain
in all his joints.

506
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,191
Go on.

507
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,733
I asked if I might visit him
at his bedside,

508
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,838
but he sent word back
that his pain was so great

509
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,907
that he did not wish to be seen
in his present state.

510
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:04,272
All I could do was convey
the message you sent and return.

511
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:07,041
It seems
there's nothing we can do.

512
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:12,178
Perhaps he was overcome by
the relentless heat of recent days.

513
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,617
Master Tsugumo,

514
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,822
you heard what he said.

515
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,831
I must ask you to select
someone else as your second.

516
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,972
I am sorely disappointed,
but it appears I have no choice.

517
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,011
In that case...

518
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,617
I would ask for Master Hayato Yazaki.

519
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,445
Hayato?

520
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:53,184
Inaba, I believe he too
has been absent these four or five days?

521
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,762
That is correct.

522
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,992
He requested leave
because he wasn't feeling well.

523
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,366
Master Tsugumo,

524
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:07,405
I'm afraid Hayato Yazaki
is also absent due to illness.

525
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,715
Master Yazaki is also ill?

526
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,808
I'm sorry to hear that.

527
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,289
Again it seems I have no choice.

528
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,259
I request Master Umenosuke Kawabe.

529
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,592
Counselor,

530
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,901
surely it's not possible

531
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,707
that Master Kawabe
is also under the weather?

532
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,286
Well, well.

533
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,561
It seems he is indeed indisposed.

534
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:08,467
All three unavailable
on this particular day -

535
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,303
what a very odd coincidence.

536
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,274
Most curious.

537
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,513
- He's up to something.
- Clearly so.

538
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,617
Hikokuro was the one
who first insisted

539
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:36,496
that Motome Chijiiwa
be forced to go through with harakiri.

540
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,331
Yazaki was the one

541
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,567
who discovered his blades were bamboo
and insisted he be forced to use them,

542
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,969
and Kawabe was quick to agree.

543
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,237
That's why I urged that he at least
be spared the bamboo blade.

544
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,245
- Of what good is that now?
- Indeed, sire.

545
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,978
But how shall we deal with him?

546
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,453
I doubt he intends
to meekly disembowel himself.

547
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,561
He obviously has something
up his sleeve.

548
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,390
Whatever it is...

549
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,966
he won't get away with it.

550
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:18,498
We'll force his hand
and make him commit harakiri.

551
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,411
In fact, if he refuses,

552
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:26,173
we'll descend upon him in force
and cut him down.

553
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:35,621
What happens within the walls
of this compound...

554
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:40,090
is as secret as what happens
behind the walls of our castle back home.

555
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,030
One signal from me
and everyone will know what to do.

556
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:54,504
But I'm bothered
about Hikokuro and the other two.

557
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,379
I need to send someone
to find out more...

558
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,174
and under the circumstances,

559
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,344
I'd like you to personally hurry
and find out the real story.

560
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,868
Master Tsugumo...

561
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:29,472
summer days are long,
but the hour advances.

562
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,048
I must ask you to proceed
without further delay.

563
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,744
But, Counselor,

564
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,957
the ritual cannot take place
without a second.

565
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,990
I understand your concern,

566
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:47,095
but I've discussed the matter
with my senior colleagues.

567
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,623
With all three men of your choice ailing,
we cannot accommodate your wishes.

568
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,336
You will have to accept our selection.

569
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,435
Ichiro Shinmen!

570
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,943
I command you to serve
as second for Master Tsugumo.

571
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,975
Perform your duty with care.

572
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,343
I must protest!

573
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,879
To act as my second,

574
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:16,616
I have named
three specially selected men.

575
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:21,524
I must have one of these three.

576
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,327
Are you deaf?

577
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:33,031
All three you name are ill
and are not present today.

578
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:38,577
I explained this very clearly.
Did you not hear?

579
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:45,318
Then in that case,
I have no choice.

580
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,659
I must call off my harakiri for now.

581
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,823
Enough, Hanshiro Tsugumo!

582
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:57,031
Your extortion scheme
has gone too far.

583
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:03,172
It's bad enough to march in here
demanding a place to perform harakiri,

584
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,633
but then you quibble endlessly
over naming your second.

585
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,136
You never intended to commit harakiri.

586
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,241
All you really want is money!

587
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,144
Counselor!

588
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,909
If I were the extortionist you say,

589
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,752
would I be calmly sitting here
on this platform?

590
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:24,256
- Then why do you not quietly proceed?
- I am fully prepared to die.

591
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,692
But cutting my belly open
does not in itself

592
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,799
ensure smooth passage
to the netherworld.

593
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:35,402
I need someone to expeditiously
strike off my head -

594
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,766
a swordsman of reliable skill.

595
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:43,337
I do not perform harakiri
to atone for a crime or offense.

596
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,646
The least I can expect
is to choose my own second.

597
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,965
Further debate on the matter

598
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,173
is clearly a waste of time.

599
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,727
You are a fraud,
a disgrace to our class.

600
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,266
You never intended
to commit harakiri.

601
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,635
Insolent dog!

602
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,770
Stop!

603
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,112
Wait!

604
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,417
Wait, I say!

605
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,703
I beg of all those present

606
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,312
a moment - a brief moment.

607
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:06,587
You can't possibly have more to say.

608
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,317
But I do.
I do have more to say.

609
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,622
I haven't finished my story.

610
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:19,627
I have no ears
for your endless ramblings.

611
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,428
Counselor!

612
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,764
If you force me to,

613
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:30,209
I will fight desperately to the death,
no matter the odds against me.

614
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:36,384
Some of your men
will be wounded undeservedly.

615
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,618
Some may even lose their lives.

616
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,688
Would it not be better

617
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,186
to simply hear me out?

618
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,064
Once I have finished my story,

619
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,532
I will disembowel myself
with no further ado.

620
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,666
Or if you feel harakiri
is too good for me,

621
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:01,071
you may turn your men on me
to do what they will.

622
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,004
In any event,

623
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:10,477
I would first like you to hear
what I have to say.

624
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,993
As to these conditions you state,

625
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,062
do I have your word?

626
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,092
You have my word.

627
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,167
And as a samurai,
you will hold true to it?

628
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,514
Very well,

629
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,487
but make it short.

630
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:53,861
I will not listen
to your useless mutterings for long.

631
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,267
Men, fall back.

632
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,415
Now, where was I?

633
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,521
Oh, yes.

634
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,591
My master's house fell

635
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,857
and Jinnai Chijiiwa died,

636
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,295
but before doing so,

637
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:38,099
he asked me to look after Motome.

638
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:45,446
When my master's house fell...

639
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,947
we immediately left the domain
and moved to Edo.

640
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,890
The streets of Edo
were crowded with ronin,

641
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,286
flotsam from the Battle of Sekigahara.

642
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,257
In former times,

643
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:05,526
other clans would have gladly taken in
any ronin who'd earned a name for himself.

644
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,235
But in an era no longer in need
of warriors or horses,

645
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,239
so peaceful that no wind
even rustled the leaves on the trees,

646
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:18,072
it was a constant struggle
simply to find a meal.

647
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:22,012
Indeed, it shames me to recall

648
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:25,210
our miserable lives
of these last eight or nine years.

649
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,588
But amidst all our hardships...

650
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:38,333
my daughter Miho
was rapidly becoming a woman,

651
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:43,030
and soon it was
the spring of her 18th year.

652
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:11,895
Father.

653
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:18,004
I've set your lunch out
in case I'm not back in time.

654
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:23,368
The greatest delicacies
taste of nothing when eaten alone.

655
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,474
If you're not back, I'll wait.

656
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:31,744
I'll collect for these and then stop
by Yoshizakicho for dried fish.

657
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,485
Hello.

658
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,852
Welcome, sir.

659
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,358
Busy as usual?
Looks like you're on your way out.

660
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,826
Yes, to the wholesaler
in Kyobashi.

661
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,626
The Mikawaya, I suppose.
Take care.

662
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,503
Experience is the best teacher.

663
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,580
You've become very deft at that.

664
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,215
Forgive me.

665
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,610
I hate asking you
for advances all the time,

666
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:08,113
but my earnings
simply refuse to catch up.

667
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,293
You disarm me
by beating me to the punch.

668
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:16,591
I came intending
to lodge a complaint or two,

669
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,895
but when you make the first move,

670
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,436
what can I say?

671
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,632
By the way,

672
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:31,075
what are your thoughts
on that matter I raised the other day?

673
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:38,645
Have you come to a decision?

674
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:43,383
Yes, I have.

675
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:46,059
Glad to hear it.

676
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:50,224
It takes a load off my mind.

677
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,030
No.

678
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:56,265
I appreciate your proposal
regarding Miho,

679
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,233
but I've decided to decline.

680
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:10,885
In the end, her adoption
by the Joshuya family

681
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,146
would be a mere pretext
lasting perhaps six months.

682
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,618
Once established
as a member of their family,

683
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,954
she'd be sent to Lord Sakakibara
as his concubine.

684
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,421
Master Tsugumo,

685
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,727
the Sakakibara are a family
with a domain of 110,000 koku.

686
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,461
It may sound odd to seek benefit
from your daughter's connections,

687
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:33,130
but you need do nothing,
and doors will open to you.

688
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:35,242
I understand that.

689
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,770
But, Master Seibei,

690
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,845
no matter how far I've fallen,

691
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,213
I cannot make my daughter a concubine
to profit from her connections.

692
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,819
It's fine to uphold your pride.

693
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:50,925
But as a parent, you must consider
your daughter's feelings too.

694
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,893
What?

695
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:56,627
She's young and beautiful,

696
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:59,424
yet she doesn't have
a single fancy kimono to wear.

697
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:05,268
She can only look forward to endless days
of slaving at her father's side.

698
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,104
Master Tsugumo,

699
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,973
you can't fight the world you live in

700
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,839
nor go against
the tide of the times.

701
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,144
It's a good proposal for Miss Miho,
and for you,

702
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,151
no matter how you look at it.

703
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,387
In fact, to be honest,

704
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:27,427
is it not precisely because Miss Miho
was blessed with such beauty

705
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,428
that an avenue like this
remains open to you?

706
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,434
Confucius said;

707
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:42,744
"He who knows not the will of heaven
is not a superior man."

708
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:52,818
"He who knows not proper decorum
must not rise to his feet."

709
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:03,821
"He who knows not the heart of words
cannot know the heart of man."

710
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,638
That will be all for today.

711
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:14,810
Thank you, sir. Good-bye.

712
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,875
Hey, Katsuzo,
let's go sparrow hunting today.

713
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,662
Hello, Uncle Hanshiro.

714
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,629
It's good to see you.

715
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,472
Have some tea.

716
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,353
Much obliged.

717
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:03,657
I know this house well enough
to at least boil water.

718
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,260
As it happens, Motome,

719
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,131
I came today to discuss
a matter of some weight.

720
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,707
You sound so formal.
What could it be?

721
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,546
How quickly the days
and months fly by.

722
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,850
Miho is now 18.

723
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:33,612
She looks more
like her mother every day.

724
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:39,822
In fact, it's hard to see
how she could possibly be of my blood.

725
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:45,463
If she'd taken after me,
she'd never have grown so beautiful.

726
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:48,793
What are you trying to say, sir?

727
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,508
Well, Motome...

728
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,909
I'd like you to take Miho as your wife.

729
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,951
I realize this is all very sudden,

730
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,091
but what do you think?

731
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,860
Will you do it, Motome?

732
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,758
You know as well as I

733
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,098
the state of my livelihood at present.

734
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:29,476
I offer classes in the Chinese classics
to a handful of children

735
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:33,172
and live from hand to mouth.

736
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:39,349
How could I possibly take a wife?

737
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,820
Do you dislike Miho?

738
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,761
All I'm asking
is how you feel about her.

739
01:07:55,371 --> 01:08:00,206
It's not only because
of the promise I made to your father

740
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,003
that I hope you'll marry Miho.

741
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,380
Boorish and dull as I am,

742
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,010
I'm not entirely insensitive
to your feelings for each other.

743
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:16,047
It was more difficult than I expected

744
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:19,556
to persuade Motome.

745
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,055
I didn't realize

746
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:26,026
he had such a stubborn
and willful streak.

747
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,735
But I knew he loved Miho,

748
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:35,471
and I knew Miho
would have no objections to the match.

749
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:43,077
The crane that lives a thousand years

750
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:50,116
A symbol of myriad joys

751
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:57,829
The tortoise that lives 10,000 years

752
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:04,934
Bears on its back the three worlds
of heaven, earth and man

753
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:11,006
The sands upon the beach

754
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:15,374
Numberless and smooth

755
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:21,386
May they ever reflect the morning sun

756
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,820
After two years

757
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,758
a child was born.

758
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,828
It was a boy,
and they named him Kingo.

759
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,567
Of course,

760
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,871
I was the one who chose the name.

761
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,585
Hello, Father.

762
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,992
What's this? Asleep again?

763
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,307
Father, you're too generous.

764
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,879
Nonsense.

765
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,883
Even after I married you off,
you still cook for me.

766
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,487
And besides,
I now have only myself to support.

767
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:32,559
I save more money
than I know what to do with,

768
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,286
and I can't take it with me.

769
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,698
Well, well.

770
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,031
Did you wake up?

771
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:48,133
Now, none of that, you little rascal.

772
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:51,871
A warrior's son
should not be flashing dimples.

773
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,776
What did I tell you now?

774
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,258
Really? Even the Matsudaira Clan
of Dewa province?

775
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:07,360
That's right.

776
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,657
I can understand abolishing
the domains of newer vassals,

777
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:15,098
but to treat vassals who've supported
the Tokugawa for generations so harshly?

778
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:21,803
The shogunate's policy toward
the warlords is completely beyond me.

779
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:25,980
We'll see another jump
in the number of ronin.

780
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,045
Did you hear?

781
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,019
One of them tried to commit harakiri
at the Sengoku Clan's gate.

782
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:42,525
A ronin named Shume Ooi,
formerly of the Kurume Clan.

783
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:46,725
I heard the Sengoku
were so impressed

784
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,527
that they offered him employment.

785
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,535
That much was fine.
It's what happened next.

786
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,568
Yes, I heard.

787
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,978
Other ronin who got wind of the story

788
01:11:57,179 --> 01:12:01,878
began presenting themselves at the gates
of daimyo houses all over Edo,

789
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:04,751
insisting on committing harakiri
and refusing to budge.

790
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:08,081
In order to get rid of them,

791
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:11,492
the houses offered them money
to leave.

792
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:15,493
It's a shameful turn of events.

793
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,757
It certainly is.

794
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:20,696
No matter how hard-pressed
they may be,

795
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,235
it's a despicable thing to do.

796
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:29,567
In these difficult times,
it's no help growing desperate.

797
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:34,480
Becoming too impatient
in seeking employment

798
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,815
is a danger we must all
take care to avoid.

799
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:42,055
You are absolutely right.

800
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:45,384
If you stop worrying so much
about finding employment,

801
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:49,658
you can sit here like this
without answering to a superior,

802
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,231
at no one's beck and call.

803
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:59,038
What's the matter there, little one?

804
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:02,404
It's time for his milk.
I'll nurse him.

805
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:05,273
You mustn't give him
your breast every time he cries.

806
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,415
He'll develop bad habits.

807
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,015
Lookee here, Kingo.

808
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,415
Ready?
See my funny face?

809
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,615
All right?

810
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:21,290
Upsy-daisy. Here goes, Kingo.

811
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:27,063
In Kanda

812
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:32,606
At the Myojin Shrine

813
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:39,746
There's a festival

814
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,878
Tonight

815
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:48,312
Kingo was the center of our existence,

816
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,091
and the three of us lived happily

817
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:54,728
with the constant sound
of warm laughter

818
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,366
raising peaceful ripples around us.

819
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:03,162
It truly was
a time of greater happiness

820
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:06,637
than I'd ever known in the domain.

821
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:13,972
However,

822
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:18,985
good things never last for long.

823
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:51,883
One day, Miho suddenly coughed up
profuse quantities of blood.

824
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:56,220
She had always been
of weak constitution,

825
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:59,258
and with the endless burden
of our piecework labor...

826
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:06,567
she'd driven her frail body
too hard for too long.

827
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,527
Motome panicked.

828
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,237
The poor fellow.

829
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:52,770
Date Clan construction site.

830
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:56,513
Fifty laborers at 40 mon.

831
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,013
Fifty laborers at 40 mon.

832
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:04,990
Just a minute, samurai, sir!

833
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,125
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

834
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,422
There isn't enough work
even for the townsmen.

835
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:11,822
If the authorities spotted
a two-sworded laborer,

836
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,935
I'd be in for a real dressing-down.

837
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,299
Hosokawa Clan construction site.

838
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,633
Twenty laborers, 45 mon.

839
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:29,208
PAWN SHOP

840
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:42,858
Poor Motome.

841
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:46,691
He tried everything, but to no avail.

842
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:50,862
Miho was gradually wasting away,

843
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:55,072
and the worst was yet to come.

844
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,471
It's seared forever in my memory.

845
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,808
We'd just barely made it
through the end of the year,

846
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,485
and the plum blossoms
had begun to bloom

847
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:07,450
shortly after the beginning
of the new year.

848
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:31,405
What's wrong?

849
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:45,883
Is it Miho?

850
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,025
Is it Miho?

851
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,025
It's Kingo.

852
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,668
What? Kingo?

853
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:01,642
A fever.

854
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,042
Like he's on fire.

855
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:12,485
Why, Miho?

856
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,350
Why did you just sit by
until it came to this?

857
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:20,728
I thought it was an ordinary cold.

858
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,724
What did the doctor say?

859
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:30,031
You did have a doctor see him,
didn't you?

860
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:45,847
You haven't had a doctor see him?

861
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,990
Why haven't you had
a doctor look at him?

862
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,312
Kingo, fight it off.

863
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:20,118
Your grandpa,
like your mom and dad,

864
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:23,587
has already sold off
everything of value.

865
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:25,716
There's not a thing,

866
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,323
not a thing we can do for you.

867
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,759
There's nothing...

868
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,663
nothing we can do, Kingo.

869
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,744
But you're the son of a samurai.

870
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:46,740
You can't let a little illness
get the better of you.

871
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:56,016
Don't let it beat you.

872
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:21,605
Don't let it... Don't let it...

873
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:29,883
Father.

874
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:39,196
I have an idea.

875
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,101
What?

876
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:43,464
I need to go out.

877
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:46,100
Please look after Kingo.

878
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:51,543
What do you have in mind?

879
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:59,109
A former retainer of the Kato Clan
now lives in Nihonbashi

880
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,846
and makes his living
as a moneylender.

881
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:04,890
His rates are so high
that I didn't dare go to him before,

882
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:09,154
but I can't worry about that anymore.

883
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:14,165
You're right. If you know such a man,
hurry and go!

884
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,859
I'm on my way.

885
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:19,601
I'll be back by evening at the latest.

886
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,639
As you can see, Miho is too weak,

887
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,512
so please take care of Kingo.

888
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,277
Of course.
I know what to do.

889
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:33,984
But, Motome,

890
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,290
you can see
he's barely hanging on.

891
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:41,359
You must be quick,
and you mustn't fail.

892
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,559
I'll return by evening without fail.

893
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,999
I'll be off, then.

894
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:57,334
We're depending on you, Motome!

895
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:37,811
No, no, I'll do that.

896
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:56,529
It won't be long now, Kingo.

897
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,332
What's taking him so long?

898
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,177
He's getting worse.

899
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,675
What could Motome be doing?

900
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:49,449
No, no. Your getting up won't do
Kingo's fever any good.

901
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,600
Where can Motome be?

902
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:14,966
He swore he'd be back by evening.

903
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:19,203
What could he be doing?

904
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,542
I waited.

905
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:29,279
Every moment felt like an eternity.

906
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,093
But Motome did not return.

907
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:36,354
We never saw him again.

908
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:43,970
"I'll be back by evening,
so please look after Kingo."

909
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,935
Those were his final words
as he went out the door,

910
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:53,103
and that was the last I saw
of Motome Chijiiwa.

911
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,320
But then...

912
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:11,127
around 9;00 that night,
he did return home.

913
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,859
Only not on his own.

914
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:20,273
He was borne home by a party
of retainers from the House of Iyi.

915
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,335
Most courteously.

916
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:28,940
This was the request

917
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,675
with which Motome Chijiiwa
came to us.

918
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:36,014
But our forecourt is a busy place
and would have been most inconvenient,

919
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:40,626
so we offered him our courtyard and saw
to his needs with all due propriety,

920
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:44,797
thus allowing him to fulfill his wish
and perform harakiri.

921
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:50,433
We understand there have lately been
incidents all across Edo

922
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,705
in which ronin present themselves
at the gates of daimyo houses

923
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:58,345
and threaten to commit harakiri
unless given money.

924
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:04,775
This disgraceful practice has put
many houses at a loss as to what to do.

925
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:10,884
But now we have Motome Chijiiwa,
a samurai of true valor,

926
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:14,221
who carried out his resolve
to die honorably.

927
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:18,297
And we have
the members of the Iyi Clan,

928
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:22,063
who responded appropriately
to facilitate his wishes.

929
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:27,068
In contrast to many disgraceful ronin,

930
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:31,075
and the spineless timidity
of other daimyo households,

931
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:32,903
both parties in this instance

932
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:37,380
acted in an exemplary manner
that will open eyes and clear the air.

933
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:42,587
It is truly an occasion
for mutual congratulations.

934
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,619
We bid you -
- Wait.

935
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:49,527
To avoid any misunderstanding,
we must show the blades.

936
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,263
Oh, yes.

937
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:56,636
For the record, we wish you to examine
the swords Chijiiwa was carrying.

938
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:03,334
You will note

939
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,303
that both blades are of bamboo.

940
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,449
Bamboo?

941
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,062
As you can see,
both are made of bamboo.

942
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:32,330
No one must accuse us later
of having switched blades.

943
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,508
So take a good look.

944
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:41,879
Is it clear?

945
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:48,255
In that case,

946
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:53,951
Motome must have borrowed
a blade from your household?

947
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,153
No, he did not.

948
01:28:57,632 --> 01:29:01,124
He died magnificently
using his own blade.

949
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,540
Motome killed himself

950
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:10,239
with that bamboo blade?

951
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:13,608
Exactly.

952
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,049
The entire household
witnessed the spectacle

953
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,753
of harakiri performed
with a bamboo blade.

954
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,419
As you may imagine,
it was an unsightly affair.

955
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:26,052
It would have been more fitting
for a samurai

956
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:30,329
to end his life with a true blade,
which is a warrior's soul.

957
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,191
Now then.

958
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:36,330
We bid you good night.

959
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:27,676
Miho wept.

960
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:32,342
She wept...

961
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:35,652
and wept.

962
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:13,880
Motome!

963
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:17,848
Forgive me!

964
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:23,596
I...

965
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,866
I had no idea.

966
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:38,336
You had even sold your blades.

967
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:43,806
For Miho's sake
you even sold your blades.

968
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:06,735
But I... but I...

969
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:11,342
I would never let this go.

970
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:14,947
It never entered my mind.

971
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,677
The stupid thing
was too dear to me...

972
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,248
and I clung to it.

973
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,222
To this stupid -

974
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:47,481
With his fever still raging
and in a coma,

975
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:52,713
Kingo died two days later.

976
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:56,089
Three days after that,

977
01:34:57,391 --> 01:34:59,882
as if chasing after him,

978
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:03,292
Miho died as well.

979
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:09,160
Thus did Hanshiro Tsugumo

980
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:13,205
find himself utterly alone in the world,

981
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:17,810
having lost every last person
he had ever cared about.

982
01:35:18,512 --> 01:35:20,343
Master Tsugumo,

983
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:25,712
does that conclude your story?

984
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:30,883
Yes, I suppose so.

985
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,229
There's just one more thing.

986
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:46,172
May all those here listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

987
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:52,335
No matter how grinding
his poverty and hunger,

988
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:56,583
for a samurai to present himself
in someone else's entryway

989
01:35:56,917 --> 01:36:00,444
and declare that he wishes
to commit harakiri there

990
01:36:00,654 --> 01:36:05,921
is an unspeakable act
that can in no way be excused.

991
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:10,158
However...

992
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:17,134
the manner in which
the House of Iyi handled the matter...

993
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:23,610
surely left a great deal to be desired.

994
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,176
If a samurai risks shame and ridicule

995
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:35,188
to beg for a day or two's grace,
he must surely have good reason.

996
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:37,819
A simple inquiry

997
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:41,552
as to the reason for the request

998
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:44,196
would have told so much...

999
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:47,764
yet with this many
witnesses present...

1000
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:51,932
not a single one among you
had the consideration to ask.

1001
01:36:56,277 --> 01:36:59,337
His wife lay gasping for breath,
on the very verge of death,

1002
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:04,283
while his beloved son burned with fever,
in dire need of a doctor.

1003
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:09,286
Motome no doubt wished
to explain the situation to me,

1004
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:12,084
make whatever last effort
he could for his son

1005
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:15,160
before turning all further care
over to me,

1006
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:17,592
and then return here
to the House of Iyi.

1007
01:37:17,798 --> 01:37:19,322
Hanshiro Tsugumo!

1008
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:23,334
Enough of your self-serving excuses!

1009
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:26,368
What?

1010
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:29,141
As to Motome Chijiiwa -

1011
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:34,180
the circumstances that drove him here
were no doubt complex.

1012
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:38,617
But it was he who declared
his wish to commit harakiri.

1013
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,118
What followed upon that request
may not have been what he intended,

1014
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:46,350
but he reaped
what he himself sowed.

1015
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:52,390
He was in no position to complain,
or to blame or condemn anyone.

1016
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:55,358
At that point,

1017
01:37:55,569 --> 01:37:59,733
his was but to cast all else aside
and die a magnificent death.

1018
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:03,537
To face death without wavering -

1019
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,806
that is truly the way of the samurai.

1020
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:08,675
But what did this man do?

1021
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:12,351
He cravenly asked
for a day or two's grace.

1022
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,284
One might well accuse him
of having gone mad!

1023
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:18,792
True enough.

1024
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:22,159
Motome had indeed gone mad.

1025
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:25,762
But I say good for him!

1026
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:28,225
I praise him for it.

1027
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:31,835
He may have been a samurai,

1028
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:34,504
but he was also
a man of flesh and blood.

1029
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:37,506
He could not live on air alone.

1030
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:42,045
When he has reached
the point of no return,

1031
01:38:42,249 --> 01:38:45,582
even a man as strong as Motome
will go mad trying to protect his family,

1032
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:47,413
and I would praise him for it.

1033
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:51,247
They'll call him "the bamboo ronin."

1034
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:57,797
Not only samurai, but townspeople, too,
will scoff at his wavering.

1035
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:01,801
But let them laugh all they want.

1036
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:06,573
Who can fathom the depths
of another man's heart?

1037
01:39:08,642 --> 01:39:11,634
Thanks to the shogunate's ruthless policy
of wiping out the provincial lords,

1038
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:14,440
countless samurai lost their masters

1039
01:39:14,648 --> 01:39:18,778
and were cast out
to wander the depths of hell.

1040
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:22,349
How can those who never wanted for food
or clothing understand their misery?

1041
01:39:24,558 --> 01:39:28,551
To those who find Motome
loathsome for his pleading, I ask;

1042
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:31,458
What if you found yourself
in the same position?

1043
01:39:31,665 --> 01:39:34,759
Would you do any differently?

1044
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:41,370
After all,
this thing we call samurai honor

1045
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:45,105
is ultimately nothing but a facade.

1046
01:39:45,713 --> 01:39:47,271
Is that your grievance?

1047
01:39:48,182 --> 01:39:49,342
Grievance?

1048
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,684
Is that what you're trying to tell us?

1049
01:39:52,886 --> 01:39:55,116
That samurai honor
is nothing but a facade?

1050
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:57,981
Yes.

1051
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,122
"Even if I say I want
to commit harakiri,

1052
01:40:04,098 --> 01:40:06,191
they surely won't actually
make me do it."

1053
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,933
Such wishful thinking
is where these ronin go wrong.

1054
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:13,968
If a man says he wants
to commit harakiri, we will let him.

1055
01:40:14,174 --> 01:40:17,371
In fact, since he has proposed it himself,
we'll make sure he does.

1056
01:40:17,578 --> 01:40:20,274
That is the policy of the House of Iyi.

1057
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:23,774
For us, samurai honor
is no mere facade!

1058
01:40:42,002 --> 01:40:44,800
And so Hanshiro Tsugumo too

1059
01:40:45,606 --> 01:40:48,905
has come here
with no intention of committing harakiri,

1060
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:53,037
but rather out of deep bitterness

1061
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:57,809
over the manner in which the Iyi Clan
treated his son-in-law Motome Chijiiwa,

1062
01:40:58,318 --> 01:41:01,378
and the desire to vent
his many grudges.

1063
01:41:02,289 --> 01:41:04,519
Is that what you think?

1064
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:07,449
That's not for me to say.

1065
01:41:08,495 --> 01:41:10,759
You can only look into your own heart.

1066
01:41:11,865 --> 01:41:14,333
But all the same,

1067
01:41:14,535 --> 01:41:17,265
you have no intention
of letting me leave here alive?

1068
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:19,799
That is my decision to make.

1069
01:41:20,474 --> 01:41:23,375
I need make no excuses to you.

1070
01:41:24,445 --> 01:41:26,037
Counselor,

1071
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:30,673
there is a proverb, "The suspicious mind
conjures its own demons."

1072
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:33,277
Do you know it?

1073
01:41:35,222 --> 01:41:39,386
When I say I will disembowel myself,
I truly mean it.

1074
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:48,562
Yet, even after all I have said,
you still refuse to -

1075
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:54,565
Suppose I were to go on living.

1076
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:58,044
What could I possibly have
to look forward to?

1077
01:42:00,747 --> 01:42:02,612
The fact is, I can hardly wait

1078
01:42:02,816 --> 01:42:06,547
to join Motome and Miho and Kingo

1079
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:11,723
in that world to which
they have gone ahead.

1080
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:17,688
But I would never be able
to face them

1081
01:42:18,198 --> 01:42:20,530
were I to go empty-handed.

1082
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:23,798
I think you can understand that.

1083
01:42:28,942 --> 01:42:33,641
I thought perhaps once I had explained,
then even members of the Iyi Clan

1084
01:42:34,882 --> 01:42:37,180
would surely say,
"Oh, so that's how it was.

1085
01:42:37,384 --> 01:42:43,414
Perhaps we were overzealous that day
in rushing to that end.

1086
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:48,024
Anyone can see that our handling
of the situation was less than ideal.

1087
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:53,723
Perhaps there were ways
in which we carried things too far.

1088
01:42:55,068 --> 01:43:00,005
No doubt both parties could have
conducted themselves to better effect."

1089
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:05,137
If I could take with me
even a single word in this vein,

1090
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:07,836
it would be a comfort to Motome.

1091
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:16,947
Was this not the most fitting gift
I could hope to take him?

1092
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:19,387
Such were my thoughts,

1093
01:43:19,593 --> 01:43:22,926
but I see now it was nothing
but wishful thinking.

1094
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:26,197
If you can see that,
then it makes the rest easy.

1095
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,868
This world does not bend
to sentimental tales.

1096
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:34,471
If you really think
that samurai honor

1097
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:38,542
is ultimately nothing more
than a facade...

1098
01:43:39,947 --> 01:43:42,814
then you never had a chance
of swaying us.

1099
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,581
So in the end,

1100
01:43:48,789 --> 01:43:52,418
these have been nothing but the
useless grumblings of a cranky old man.

1101
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:59,088
But it does no good
to lament that now.

1102
01:44:04,571 --> 01:44:06,004
Well, then,

1103
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:08,970
forgive me
for my long-winded recitation.

1104
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:12,477
I will now proceed with the ritual.

1105
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:18,579
Wait.

1106
01:44:20,954 --> 01:44:22,615
Before that,

1107
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:27,924
I must return some items
that belong to this house.

1108
01:44:48,849 --> 01:44:53,786
For easier identification,
I have placed name tags on each.

1109
01:44:53,987 --> 01:44:56,455
Please examine them carefully.

1110
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,162
Master Hayato Yazaki,

1111
01:45:06,767 --> 01:45:10,362
and Master Umenosuke Kawabe -

1112
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:14,934
I understand they're both among
the best swordsmen of the Iyi Clan,

1113
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:18,669
held in high esteem
for their bravery and honor.

1114
01:45:19,379 --> 01:45:21,244
But, Counselor,

1115
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:25,715
gentlemen,
let me set your minds at ease.

1116
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:30,354
I took only their topknots,

1117
01:45:30,857 --> 01:45:33,451
not their lives.

1118
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,764
In the case of Hayato Yazaki...

1119
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:45,865
it was six days ago.

1120
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:43,987
Hold it!

1121
01:47:53,567 --> 01:47:56,127
In the case of Umenosuke Kawabe,

1122
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:59,963
it was five days ago, on May 8th.

1123
01:49:08,742 --> 01:49:10,403
However,

1124
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:14,979
when it came to that master swordsman
of the Shindo-Munen-Ichi school,

1125
01:49:15,515 --> 01:49:21,010
Master Hikokuro Omodaka,
I had a little more difficulty.

1126
01:49:21,888 --> 01:49:26,188
Perhaps aware of what had happened
to Yazaki and Kawabe,

1127
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,256
I could not catch him off guard.

1128
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:34,000
In fact, to be honest,
I found myself at quite a loss

1129
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:38,864
as to how to deal
with Master Omodaka.

1130
01:49:42,976 --> 01:49:44,500
May I enter?

1131
01:50:35,895 --> 01:50:39,092
If you reach for your sword,

1132
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:43,669
I'll slice you in one motion
from shoulder to waist.

1133
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,207
But I fear...

1134
01:50:56,616 --> 01:50:59,642
the lintel will catch
the tip of my blade.

1135
01:51:03,923 --> 01:51:06,221
If you lunge to the side,

1136
01:51:07,861 --> 01:51:10,421
then this pillar will get in the way.

1137
01:51:14,234 --> 01:51:17,726
It took a few days to locate your home.
My apologies for the delay.

1138
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,031
I ask you to make ready.

1139
01:51:25,412 --> 01:51:27,812
This is obviously no place
for a sword duel.

1140
01:51:28,214 --> 01:51:31,513
It's a bit far, but I must ask you
to accompany me to Gojiin-gawara.

1141
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:37,353
As miserable a hovel as this is,

1142
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:41,391
your landlord will be inconvenienced
if you do not return.

1143
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:48,258
And without someone to retrieve your
remains, your soul will wander aimlessly.

1144
01:51:50,937 --> 01:51:53,405
I suggest you leave a note.

1145
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:03,581
It should indicate you're going
to Gojiin-gawara

1146
01:52:03,783 --> 01:52:07,082
for a duel with Hikokuro Omodaka
of the Iyi Clan.

1147
01:56:43,429 --> 01:56:46,523
Taking advantage of the wind
was brilliant,

1148
01:56:46,733 --> 01:56:49,327
but a blade can do more than cut.

1149
01:56:49,535 --> 01:56:52,902
It can also stab,
or even snap another blade in two.

1150
01:56:53,506 --> 01:56:56,134
Swordsmanship untested in battle

1151
01:56:56,342 --> 01:56:58,776
is like the art of swimming
mastered on dry land.

1152
01:57:20,933 --> 01:57:22,924
On the other hand,

1153
01:57:23,403 --> 01:57:25,667
I had not seen battle either

1154
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:30,908
since the siege of Osaka Castle
16 years ago.

1155
01:57:31,611 --> 01:57:33,909
Taking his head
would have been difficult enough,

1156
01:57:34,113 --> 01:57:38,243
but taking only his topknot
proved more difficult still.

1157
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:46,021
Whatever the differences in skill,

1158
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:49,251
for a samurai to have
his topknot taken

1159
01:57:49,462 --> 01:57:52,158
is the same
as having his head stricken off.

1160
01:57:52,565 --> 01:57:54,726
It is an ineptitude, a disgrace,

1161
01:57:54,934 --> 01:57:58,028
that can scarcely be atoned for
even by death.

1162
01:57:59,172 --> 01:58:03,040
Yet these men claim illness
and shirk their duties

1163
01:58:03,242 --> 01:58:07,178
while waiting for their topknots
to grow back. Counselor!

1164
01:58:11,451 --> 01:58:14,511
This house boasts of its red armor
and martial valor,

1165
01:58:15,154 --> 01:58:17,452
but it seems that even
in the great House of Iyi,

1166
01:58:17,657 --> 01:58:21,115
samurai honor is nothing more
than a facade.

1167
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:37,603
Maniac!

1168
01:58:38,144 --> 01:58:40,078
Cut him down!

1169
02:05:34,126 --> 02:05:35,889
Fall back!

1170
02:06:46,498 --> 02:06:49,524
Hanshiro Tsugumo
has been killed, Counselor.

1171
02:06:52,838 --> 02:06:54,772
And our casualties?

1172
02:06:56,108 --> 02:06:58,542
What were the casualties
among our men?

1173
02:06:59,945 --> 02:07:02,539
Masakatsu Sugita, Sobei Uemura,

1174
02:07:03,082 --> 02:07:05,550
Ichiro Shinmen, Uemon Yoshioka -

1175
02:07:05,751 --> 02:07:07,150
four dead.

1176
02:07:07,786 --> 02:07:10,220
Eight more seriously wounded.

1177
02:07:12,725 --> 02:07:14,488
The ronin from Hiroshima...

1178
02:07:16,762 --> 02:07:19,424
Hanshiro Tsugumo,
committed harakiri.

1179
02:07:22,267 --> 02:07:25,327
All our own men died of illness.

1180
02:07:27,406 --> 02:07:29,966
The House of Iyi has no retainers

1181
02:07:30,976 --> 02:07:34,969
who could be felled or wounded
by some half-starved ronin.

1182
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:41,451
Former retainer of the Fukushima Clan,
Hanshiro Tsugumo,

1183
02:07:42,054 --> 02:07:44,750
committed harakiri honorably,
according to his wish.

1184
02:07:45,624 --> 02:07:47,854
All our men died of illness.

1185
02:07:48,193 --> 02:07:51,060
Their deaths have nothing to do
with Tsugumo's.

1186
02:07:55,768 --> 02:07:59,329
Furthermore, we cannot allow
any more to die of illness.

1187
02:07:59,938 --> 02:08:03,874
See that the wounded
are treated immediately.

1188
02:08:15,387 --> 02:08:17,548
I have just returned, Counselor.

1189
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:24,354
Hikokuro Omodaka,

1190
02:08:25,531 --> 02:08:27,726
last night at his home -

1191
02:08:32,137 --> 02:08:37,700
Kawabe and Yazaki both claim illness,

1192
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:40,436
but in fact -
- Fool!

1193
02:08:42,481 --> 02:08:45,279
Why did you not order them
to commit harakiri on the spot?

1194
02:08:46,618 --> 02:08:50,281
Go back immediately
and order them to do so.

1195
02:08:52,458 --> 02:08:54,358
And take some skilled swordsmen
with you.

1196
02:08:55,327 --> 02:08:59,923
If they fail to willingly disembowel
themselves, make them do it by force.

1197
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:07,434
Of course, these two men, and Omodaka
too, did not officially commit harakiri.

1198
02:09:08,741 --> 02:09:10,333
They died of illness.

1199
02:09:10,542 --> 02:09:12,533
- Sire?
- Imbecile!

1200
02:09:15,881 --> 02:09:20,477
You weren't born yesterday.
You know the ways of the world.

1201
02:09:21,286 --> 02:09:24,722
How can you not realize
the implications? Idiot!

1202
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:27,053
I am on my way, sire.

1203
02:10:56,849 --> 02:11:00,751
The former retainer of the Fukushima Clan,
Hanshiro Tsugumo,

1204
02:11:02,254 --> 02:11:05,690
died by harakiri
at 6:00 in the evening.

1205
02:11:07,326 --> 02:11:10,693
His speech and behavior
had been somewhat erratic.

1206
02:11:10,896 --> 02:11:15,230
Many of those present felt
he showed signs of derangement.

1207
02:11:17,236 --> 02:11:19,636
Furthermore, it has become clear

1208
02:11:19,838 --> 02:11:21,931
that when another former retainer
of the Fukushima Clan,

1209
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:25,371
one Motome Chijiiwa, asked to commit
harakiri in January of this year,

1210
02:11:26,245 --> 02:11:28,543
we did not err in our chosen response.

1211
02:11:29,114 --> 02:11:31,981
Word of the martial rigor of this house
echoed throughout Edo.

1212
02:11:34,987 --> 02:11:38,787
In the present case too,
word of our resolute handling

1213
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:43,557
spread across the city
before two days were out.

1214
02:11:44,796 --> 02:11:48,755
As a result, on the third day,
in a formal session at Edo Castle,

1215
02:11:49,935 --> 02:11:53,894
Lord Doi took the occasion
to confer words of praise

1216
02:11:54,373 --> 02:11:59,174
upon our young master Bennosuke
as follows:

1217
02:12:00,579 --> 02:12:03,446
"At peace, yet ever vigilant. '

1218
02:12:04,716 --> 02:12:06,980
Let the House of  Iyi
continue to embrace this principle,

1219
02:12:07,619 --> 02:12:11,783
and your fortunes are sure to prosper
for ages to come."

1220
02:12:13,358 --> 02:12:15,656
The 16th day of May,

1221
02:12:16,662 --> 02:12:18,596
1630.

1222
02:12:39,551 --> 02:12:41,348
HARAKIRI

1223
02:12:41,687 --> 02:12:44,588
THE END
