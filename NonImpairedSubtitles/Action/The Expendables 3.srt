1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,286
Lucky ring on.

2
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,610
I feel so much safer.

3
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,444
We're coming in hot.

4
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,849
Hold on.

5
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,282
Let's go.

6
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,402
What's the hold up'?

7
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,485
Nothing, we're on our way.

8
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,441
Let's go.

9
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,010
Your dude's trippin'.

10
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,566
Stay on the wall, beware.

11
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,731
- Hey, forget this maniac.
- I'm not leaving him.

12
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,602
Doc!

13
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,009
You're just gonna roll up on me huh'?
After 8 damn years.

14
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,281
What's up with that?

15
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,001
You're in a black ops prison that
doesn't officially exist.

16
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,685
I just got the location from a guy named Church.

17
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,925
An agency spook.

18
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,728
Excuse me'?

19
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,927
Agency's official relax.

20
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,570
Thank you for this, man.

21
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,845
What a waste of life!

22
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,002
You make one damn mistake.

23
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,605
It wasn't a mistake.

24
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,843
It was stupid. You'd done that to me,
I would've chopped you into pieces

25
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,251
You would've tried.

26
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,241
Hey, you want to thank the guys?

27
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,164
The guys'?
Whe're our guys?

28
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,846
- Hammer, Guzman..
- Gone

29
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,081
They've gone?

30
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,645
Yeah.

31
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,282
Damn!

32
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,690
Heard you killed more people than the plague!

33
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,250
How 'bout that?

34
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,208
That why they called you "Doctor Death"?

35
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,089
Used to be a medic.

36
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,405
But that was a long time ago.

37
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,767
So Why'd you get locked away?

38
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,404
Tax evasion.

39
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,201
So you're all that's left of The Expendables?

40
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,009
We're it.

41
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,764
We started out with 5...

42
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,165
built up to 22

43
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,168
I see Barney still hanging the tags up there.

44
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,005
See that jingling sounds the tags make,

45
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,891
that's a reminder that our brothers are still here.

46
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,608
Somewhere.

47
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,927
Come on viking.

48
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,886
Give me an old school of your blade.

49
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,611
Or else you might find your tags up there.

50
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,762
Jingling too.

51
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,164
Jingling... jingling jingling.

52
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,245
Sharpen it when you're done.

53
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,364
I think your friend is a little off.

54
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,125
Come on Christmas, he's been in
a hole for eight years.

55
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,361
How'd he get so lucky!

56
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,045
He tried pulling it off
his half-assed political...

57
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,283
assassination for a few bucks
in this place called Swaziland.

58
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,441
And he blew it.

59
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,926
Self destructive?

60
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,968
Yes something like that.
But in all those years he's a good medic.

61
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,001
Well, I don't need a checkup

62
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,924
- Why are you so sarcastic?
- You're vague

63
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,925
- Vague?
- Secrets, idiot.

64
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,564
I mean why do you take me off
half way round the planet?

65
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,689
To save this medical genius,

66
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,886
as you describe.

67
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,041
For what?

68
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,566
He's an Expendable.

69
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,129
Come on.

70
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,486
He's an Expandable.

71
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,527
So he's one of the ?ock

72
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,681
Well let me tell you something...

73
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,762
When you're incarcerated for years,

74
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,130
I'd come and save you.

75
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,611
Thanks hero!

76
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,841
But I doubt it.

77
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,609
And I know you'd do the same for me.

78
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,090
Truthfully?

79
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,650
You'd let me rot'?

80
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,607
Exactly.

81
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,165
Hey, Doc.

82
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,927
What's your name?

83
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,524
Christmas.

84
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,329
Is that real?

85
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,651
Authentic.

86
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,370
Is that real too?

87
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,446
Oh no, I uh... spend 3 hours every morning
putting this on with a black biro.

88
00:09:59,480 --> 00:09:59,969
This is real.

89
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,963
Authentic.

90
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,046
Original.

91
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,041
Look at that.

92
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,646
Balance is a little off

93
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,687
You uh, a knife man'?

94
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,081
Best, ever

95
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,530
I'm the knife before Christmas.

96
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,329
Ain't that right Barney'?

97
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,731
If you say so.

98
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,724
Probably freestyling with a blade while
you're still sucking on your daddies titty...

99
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,609
trying to learn how to eat with a spoon.

100
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,170
Yeah.

101
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,970
You know that little secret you were
keeping Mr. Vague?

102
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,008
Stay out of my brain.

103
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,570
I'm gonna tell you
I can't wait to get home.

104
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,324
Eat some good food...

105
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,641
Put on some fine threads...

106
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,608
Break up my 49' Pontiac...

107
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,405
Keep that baby until the engine blows up...

108
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,604
You didn't tell him did you?

109
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,011
Tell me what?

110
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,128
We're not going home.

111
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,726
We're stopping at a
dealer named Victor Menz...

112
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,449
and delivering a shipment
of thermobaric bombs.

113
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,443
Ow, come on man.

114
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,124
That shit is hellfire.

115
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,882
Hey, it's routine stuff.

116
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,088
You know why don't you just
pick me up on your way back.

117
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,043
We're a man short

118
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,086
Well, you know, I'd love
to party with you boys.

119
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,010
But, uh, I don't have my shit.

120
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,082
That's my shit!

121
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,002
It is your shit.

122
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,566
Doc, have you thanked the guys,
helping you out'?

123
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,570
Say something.

124
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,201
Uh, listen up...

125
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,648
It's been a long time since I had a reason to say thank
you...

126
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,086
So I just want.

127
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,891
Oh, you know I...

128
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,843
- He's getting his rhythm
- Just want to say

129
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,522
Thank you.

130
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,126
Sincerity is overwhelming.

131
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,401
I think I'm gonna weep.

132
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,083
You know what? Enough.

133
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,122
Do not be sarcastic.

134
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,166
That was great, Doc.

135
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,889
You haven't had to talk for a long time.

136
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,166
You got the gift-.

137
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,526
It's like riding a bike.

138
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,204
I liked Churchill's best.

139
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,929
I think I made my point.

140
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,242
- I've moved you too.
- Stunning.

141
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,368
Doc, great to have you back.

142
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,920
No better place to be, yeah.

143
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,204
About time you boys showed up.

144
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,167
Nice boat.

145
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,685
Thanks ladies, built it myself

146
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,763
Got three more just like it patrolling the harbour

147
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,922
Two man ground teams every 400m.

148
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,365
Good work.

149
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,328
Just cause you can ?y a plane
don't make you smarter than me.

150
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,129
Sure it does.

151
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,528
So you're the reason I've been
stuck down here in this shithole.

152
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,567
Shithole?

153
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,205
Brother you have no idea.

154
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,209
Oh yeah, hahahaha.

155
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,807
What the hell is that?

156
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,928
This bitch will solve all your problems.

157
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,649
Yeah, maybe for 10 seconds...

158
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,689
before he blows his wad -
So now you got that problem too?

159
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,605
You walked into that one

160
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,366
Come on, look alive, look alive.

161
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,402
Good luck.

162
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,283
It was all under control.

163
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,246
Yeah, that's what it looked like.

164
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,443
Where you've been?

165
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,010
I had a doctors' appointment.

166
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,810
Catch up with you boys later.

167
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,129
What's he got?

168
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,966
Watch your overhead.

169
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,565
Doc go.

170
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,324
Ooh sadly, the man attacked me with a knife.

171
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,769
He's good.

172
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,807
Maybe to you.

173
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,121
You might want to see this.

174
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,201
See what?

175
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,201
I'll show you.

176
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,329
Damn!

177
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,367
He's really good.

178
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,202
Say it again and I'll shoot you.

179
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,442
Get in.

180
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,721
Where's the bomb'?

181
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,966
It'll be here.

182
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,202
Barney, looks like the target is right on time.

183
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,410
There's Menz, let's take 'em out fast.

184
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,405
Barney, I'm gonna put you down.

185
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,521
It can't be.

186
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,647
What can't be?

187
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,085
We're gonna shoot these guys or what?

188
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,764
What's the hold up'?

189
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,080
He's dead.

190
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,287
Who's dead'?

191
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,207
Stonebanks.

192
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,810
Stonebanks.

193
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,050
Come on, get in.

194
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,168
Come on, move!
Go go go!

195
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,288
Come on!

196
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,525
Time to mow the lawn!

197
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,608
I told you

198
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,567
10 seconds

199
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,769
Hang on.

200
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,841
Found you a ride.

201
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,081
Time to go.

202
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,522
Come on, go go go!

203
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,920
- How much we're getting pay for this?
- Not enough

204
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,729
Go right.

205
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,326
You're not gonna fit.

206
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,242
Always negative.

207
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,526
I'm getting carsick.

208
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,361
Hang on, Doc.

209
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:25,849
Get out.

210
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,762
Come on.

211
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,242
Caesar.

212
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,571
We're coming your way, where are you'?

213
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,041
In this filthy river, behind you.

214
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,844
Try to stay as close as you can.

215
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,326
Make room for Caeser.

216
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,246
Move your ass in.

217
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,128
Who's that?

218
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,969
A huge black guy on a boat.

219
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,931
Hold it, hold it, you got it going.

220
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,685
- You alright?
- Yeah.

221
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,007
Pull over.

222
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,368
Incoming!

223
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,602
Move!

224
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,806
Move!

225
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,370
We got you man, come on!

226
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,485
Maybe this'll bring you luck.

227
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,807
Is he gonna make it?

228
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,251
I don't know.

229
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,048
Who did this?

230
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,441
Stonebanks.

231
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,042
I thought you killed him.

232
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,006
So did I.

233
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,010
He shot Caeser to get back at me.

234
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,569
Yeah, I'm getting out of this business.

235
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,449
And so should you.

236
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,570
Not yet.

237
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,967
<i>HEY-</i>

238
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,605
If you need any help with
Stonebanks

239
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,048
I'm supposed to meet a guy named Church

240
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,121
I know who you are.

241
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,770
So who are you?

242
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,888
Operations officer Drummer.

243
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,527
You don't have to worry about Church anymore

244
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,524
He's um, he's out of the picture

245
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,921
Jesus, Ross.

246
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,644
What a mess!

247
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,961
We gave you everything

248
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,050
Target, opportunity, all the intel you could ask for

249
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,841
And you got decimated.

250
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,411
And my target walked away

251
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,686
Am I wrong huh'?

252
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,241
Am I missing something?

253
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,643
Yeah, sure you said the target's name was Victor Menz.

254
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,687
- And'?
- It was wrong.

255
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,171
His real name was Conrad Stonebanks.

256
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,489
We knew him only as Victor Menz.

257
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,761
Arms dealer, made billions selling to every.

258
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,246
Psycho warlord in Africa and the Middle East.

259
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,131
His own mercenary army is personally responsible...

260
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,841
for the torturing and killing...

261
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,400
two of the best men I ever knew, friends.

262
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,482
I don't give a shit what his name is.

263
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,050
I don't like him.

264
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,844
I want him as bad as you do.

265
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,566
This happened on my watch.

266
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,487
You fucked up, and I'm wearing it

267
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,246
I'll find him.

268
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,287
Again.

269
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,601
You have one more shot.

270
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,724
Nice to finally meet you Barney.

271
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,562
Your men are shot to shit, what are
you gonna do for a team.

272
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,642
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle it.

273
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,490
Relax.

274
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,922
You're gonna give yourself a stroke.

275
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,007
What's with these guys!

276
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,331
Do you mind?

277
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,043
Do you think when the artist
painted this, he ever

278
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,804
thought it would go for
such a ridiculous price?

279
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,931
I mean what is this? Just some paint, brushes,
some cheap canvas, what's the big deal?

280
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,211
It's shit.

281
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,281
What do you want for it?

282
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,645
Three million.

283
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,483
Done.

284
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,368
You know...

285
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,125
It's very hard for me to say this...

286
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,851
but at one time, you guys were the best.

287
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,247
Maybe still are.

288
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,925
But nothing lasts forever.

289
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,287
Hard as it is to hear

290
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,324
We're not the future anymore

291
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,050
Unfortunately for us

292
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,804
We're pan of the past

293
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,323
You.. arr.. you going somehere with this?

294
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,927
As I see it

295
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,610
If we keep this life up...

296
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,121
The only way this thing ends...

297
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,088
for all of us

298
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,971
is in a hole in the ground and no-one givin' a shit.

299
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,609
Now, if that's the
way I'm suppossed

300
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,250
to go out, I can live with that.

301
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,562
For me.

302
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,889
But what I can't live with

303
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,685
And I won't live with...

304
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,283
is taking you with me

305
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,522
What are you saying?
That's our call.

306
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,727
I'm changing things now.

307
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,690
You.

308
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,444
Me.

309
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,450
All of us.

310
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,882
It's over.

311
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,929
We're done.

312
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,881
Done? You break me out...

313
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,121
Cut me loose?

314
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,929
You'll survive.

315
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,400
You all will.

316
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,243
You live your lives while you can.

317
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,201
Where are you going, Barney'?

318
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,367
Hey you think you just pulled the plug and that's it'?

319
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,010
- Just did.
- Yeah?

320
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,490
Well it doesn't work that way.

321
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,811
What'?

322
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,211
We've been through the mud...

323
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,770
the shit and the blood.

324
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,922
And I've saved your arse more times than I can count.

325
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,371
You owe me a shot at the sonafabitch
that took Caeser down.

326
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,010
We're not doing that.

327
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,328
When I joined,

328
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,006
I joined for the whole ride.

329
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,007
I know you did.

330
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,966
Rides over.

331
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,250
Bonaparte.

332
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,810
Sorry to hear about Caeser.

333
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,531
I hope he pulls through, he's a
good one, the good ones are rare.

334
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,282
Yeah.

335
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,203
Well, here we are again.

336
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,088
What do you need'?

337
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,326
New team.

338
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,368
Retired the old ones.

339
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,362
Welcome to the 21st century.

340
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,921
How many guys you looking for?

341
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,322
Young, hungry, willing to take a bullet.

342
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,448
I'm going after Stonebanks.

343
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,089
Stonebanks.

344
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,043
Let's see, you're not the
only one slipping a notch.

345
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,485
Stonebanks is dead my friend <il>monus dei<il>.

346
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,003
No, he's not.

347
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,444
That is not good.

348
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,368
If he was half of what he used to be,
four or five ain't gonna cut it.

349
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,850
You're gonna need fifty.

350
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,966
We gotta move fast, no time.

351
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,486
If I got to do it fast then I can't guarantee the best.

352
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,005
Just give me something that don't give a damn.

353
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,491
What'?

354
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,487
Is this a one way ticket?

355
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,289
Could be.

356
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,647
Fine.

357
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,768
I got a line on a few head cases.

358
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,528
Couple of these guys'll probably end up shooting
themselves.

359
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,369
Wait.

360
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,761
What about these guys?
They anything'?

361
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,682
These guys are pussies.

362
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,603
Goes by Thorn, expert hacker.

363
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,806
Ground pilot

364
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,451
Did 18 months for hacking in Seattle central operating
system.

365
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,489
Shut down the whole city for 3 days.

366
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,085
Why the hell would he do that?

367
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,241
Because he can.

368
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,289
What'?

369
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,449
I'm not looking for an office worker.

370
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,680
Oh! that's not him.

371
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,722
Another one with a death wish.
You two got a lot in common.

372
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,448
I could do that.

373
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,642
You know what?

374
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,846
I'm gonna come around and say it.

375
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,689
I belong on you.

376
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,968
- You can't do that.
- No.

377
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,962
I'd want a special rate on that one.

378
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,440
Yeah, yeah, that's the pecker.

379
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,767
Always on the damn road going
someplace you don't give a damn about.

380
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,126
Beats standing still.

381
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,406
Yeah, I got two ex-wives...

382
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,402
and three kids who've lost my number who'd disagree.

383
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,520
- Hey did you turn off the autopilot?
- I didn't touch the autopilot.

384
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,047
Gimme the booze.

385
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,563
Are we off course?

386
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,683
Where the hell are we?
Hang on a second.

387
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,603
Is that the Big Dipper?

388
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,966
Yeah, we gotta turn around.

389
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,246
Next candidate is an expert in field
craft and close quarters combat.

390
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,402
Luna.

391
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,401
Hi.

392
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,324
Young lady, meet a friend of mine. Barney Ross.
Barney <i>Ross,</i> Luna. Luna, Barney Ross.

393
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,527
Nice to meet you Mr. Ross.

394
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,887
Gentlemen if you'd follow me,
I have your table waiting.

395
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,684
Come on.
Live a little.

396
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,567
So Luna how are things?

397
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,404
The same old.

398
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,323
What do you do'?
You wanna go, bro?

399
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,849
Would you guys excuse me..

400
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,651
All right so what are we doing here?

401
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,687
Have a drink.

402
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,646
Where's your candidate'?

403
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,088
Right there in the red dress about to chop those guys in
half.

404
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,640
- <i>The hostess?</i>
- <i>Not the hostess</i>

405
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,681
She's the bouncer.

406
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,206
I could do that.

407
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,645
You want to slip on a dress and give it a shot.

408
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,602
Men.

409
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,686
She's good.

410
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,648
You oughta see her without heels.

411
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,290
When was your last checkup?

412
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,125
I don't know, a while back.

413
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,328
High cholesterol, plaque, all that stuff.

414
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,207
Yeah pretty much.

415
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,560
Except with me.

416
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,840
They found a lump on my lung.

417
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,250
Very dark, they said.

418
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,720
Why shouldn't I see that coming?

419
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,730
Well, what do you do?

420
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,690
I try to make as much money as I can,
fast as I can.

421
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,491
For those kids, you know.
The ones I don't talk to.

422
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,767
Make some kind of a good impression
on them, before I'm gone.

423
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,091
Sad, isn't it?

424
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,048
Yeah it is sad. I'm sorry.

425
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,008
Nah, that's all bullshit, I'm fine.

426
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,128
Just checking you're still human.

427
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,170
Had you going there now didn't I?

428
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,725
Yeah, you did goddammit.

429
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,087
That can never happen again.
I'll never trust you again.

430
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,248
Next kid's a bit of a dark horse.

431
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,245
Just came across my desk. I don't like throwing in a
wildcard.

432
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,766
But this guy's creds were too good to pass up.

433
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,685
Anybody seen Felipe?

434
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,241
Yo Felipe.

435
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,761
Looks good Bonaparte.

436
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,767
Yeah not bad.

437
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,802
Finally got it right.

438
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,401
Damn!

439
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,643
Felipe Silva!

440
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,051
Meet Barney Ross.

441
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,127
Galgo.

442
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,328
Galgo, you sent me another fake resume.

443
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,291
Mr. Ross I can do what you need, whatever you need.

444
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,647
I am healthier than I look, stronger than I look...

445
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,971
Faster than I look.

446
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,770
Actually, shit, you were born in 1984?

447
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,921
Of course not.

448
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,888
But I feel like that I was born in 1984.

449
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,803
Do not waste your time, Barney we're leaving.

450
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,404
<i>Mr. Ross' Mr. Ross' Mr. Ross.</i>

451
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,050
Please.

452
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,125
It's like uh, it's like I have discovered.. the fountain of
youth

453
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,283
I mean, not. 'The fountain of youth'.

454
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,408
Ponce de Leon discovered that one.

455
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,720
Um by the way..

456
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,122
Another great Spaniard, like myself.

457
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,282
<i>Mr. Ross.</i>

458
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,921
Age is just a state of mind.

459
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,006
You're only old, when you surrender...

460
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,209
When you give up, and I haven't, not yet.

461
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,804
- Galgo, this shit has got to stop
- I gotta go

462
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,370
This is the third time this month.

463
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,203
Seriously, move on.

464
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,929
What's this guy's story?

465
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,490
Actually I feel a little sorry for him.

466
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,800
His last team dropped him.

467
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,281
Back in the day, you couldn't catch him.

468
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,124
- Very fast, maybe even faster than you
- No way

469
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,042
Oh! maybe.

470
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,610
But, what am I gonna say.

471
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,045
It's a young man's game.

472
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,451
I need a job!

473
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,566
All I know what to do is killing people
And I do that very well

474
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,365
Damn! Dammit!

475
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,250
- What's the story on this guy?
- Found him at DARPA

476
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,168
- DARPA?
- Sounds like a town in North Africa

477
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,649
Where they send the brightest military
minds to develop next-gen weapons.

478
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,609
Google it.

479
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,609
I'm not looking for weapons nerd.

480
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,605
Ah, then you've come to the right place-.

481
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,128
Yo Marlito.

482
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,210
Mars I like you to meet Barney Ross.

483
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,680
As shooters go, Mars is as gifted as they get.

484
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,801
Whatever you say.

485
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,607
What do you say?

486
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,365
What I've got here is an X-25 assault ri?e.

487
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,284
Laser range, 25mm high explosive air burst rounds.

488
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,800
Can be programmed to detonate over or behind the
target.

489
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,763
He'll do.

490
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,650
Final candidate, John Smilee.
Guy's got the most teeth in the industry.

491
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,689
A lot of skills, Marines, special operator.

492
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,650
- But there is, an issue
- What issue?

493
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,643
Yeah classic authority problem.

494
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,168
There's a couple more swimming around in there too.

495
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,241
Sorry Barney for wasting your time like this.
He's not the guy I thought he was.

496
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,401
No.

497
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,447
I want to meet him.

498
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,808
John.

499
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,643
Meet Barney Ross.

500
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,722
Didn't do much to impress out there today did you?

501
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,801
You called me, I didn't call you.

502
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,689
Think you'd die for the money?

503
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,847
Maybe you like getting your ass kicked in front of
strangers.

504
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,371
What do you guys want from me'?

505
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,046
You running from something?

506
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,565
I don't know you.

507
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,721
But I know you.

508
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,687
- Oh yeah'?
- Yeah

509
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,488
How's that?

510
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,927
Maybe he thinks you got potential and
we're short on time. That about right?

511
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,251
That's about it.

512
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,765
What's your problem?

513
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,321
Your problem is you're rolling around
in the dirt for chump change.

514
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,126
I hear you lost a few friends in the desert.

515
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,361
They bought it, and you didn't.

516
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,441
And you wear the guilt.

517
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,851
I've been there.

518
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,444
He's been there.

519
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,249
We all lived it.

520
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,562
Well you don't know me.

521
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,164
I know the type.

522
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,485
Bonaparte, you're right.

523
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,641
You did waste my time.

524
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,282
Hey...

525
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,121
You didn't waste your time.

526
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,249
If you're going after Stonebanks,
we might want to talk about financials now.

527
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,561
Normally it's just 10%, but.

528
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:55,045
I figured with Stonebanks in the equation
I might want to get my fee... possibly now.

529
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,003
I mean, not that you're not good for it,
just, if you don't mind.

530
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,320
I don't mind.

531
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,281
It sounds like you don't have too much faith in me.

532
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,722
I don't.

533
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,164
How was your vacation?

534
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,571
Ready to go to work'?

535
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,045
You find him yet?

536
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,487
He's in Bucharest putting together
a deal with some Albanian mobster.

537
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,086
You got 36 hours, that's your window.

538
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,244
After that he's back off the grid.

539
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,208
Satellite map...

540
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,408
Coordinates for where he'll be.

541
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,531
Interesting guy.

542
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,284
Your friend Stonebanks.

543
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,406
You're not gonna like this but...

544
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,366
They want him alive.

545
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,324
Are you kidding me?

546
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,329
They want to try him at The Hague...

547
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,362
For war crimes.

548
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,883
You're gonna give this guy a chanoe in court?

549
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,688
It's not my decision.

550
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,369
- No, it never is.
- That's the way it's gotta be.

551
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,765
Great.

552
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,242
Agency's got a local safehouse.

553
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,725
You're gonna need it.

554
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,450
Don't trash the plaoe.

555
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,242
I heard you got a job.

556
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,287
That's right.

557
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,930
Who the hell are they'?

558
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,246
They're with me.

559
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,731
And we're not?

560
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,769
Gunner I had told you everything
I had to tell you back at the bar.

561
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,841
And stop drinking so much.

562
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,122
You want to get yourself killed...

563
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,770
with those youngsters

564
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,769
Do us all a favor and get the hell out of here.

565
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,281
Wheels up in 10.

566
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,850
If your guys wanted to fight,

567
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,444
why didn't they just get married?

568
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,004
You seriously smoking next to aviation fuel?

569
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,522
Amateur.

570
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,201
Amateur assholes.

571
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,085
Who you calling asshole, grandpa?

572
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,691
Grandpa's about to crush your windpipe.

573
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,084
What is this'? Is this your toy'?

574
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,685
Boy?

575
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,842
You want to dance big guy?

576
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,570
Hey! It's just a job-.

577
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,606
Come on, let's go.

578
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,768
Bunch of ass has been's still trying to be hard.

579
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,206
You're young and you're dumb.

580
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,804
Jingling jingling.

581
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,808
Keep it.

582
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,281
You're gonna need it.

583
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,564
Never thought you would call in that favor.

584
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,008
I'm also not happy about it.

585
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,801
Got a minute'?

586
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,246
What do you need'?

587
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,925
Tell me more about this guy we're going after.

588
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,651
It doesn't matter, you were hired to do a job.

589
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,610
How about answering why we're doing this job?

590
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,568
I owe you a salary that's it.

591
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,928
Why are we going after Stonebanks?

592
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,571
You have a hard time taking orders don't you'?

593
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,404
If I don't know what they are, yeah.

594
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,524
I know you don't give a damn about us.

595
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,926
I get that.

596
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,445
But just tell me why you want to take out this guy so
bad.

597
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,285
Thirty seconds to drop.

598
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,441
Copy that.

599
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,210
Let's go.

600
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,001
I can take care of myself.

601
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,889
Twenty seconds to drop.

602
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,605
Ten seconds...

603
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,571
We're on.

604
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,050
This guy's got more muscle than a cartel king.

605
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,326
Maybe he's up for a conference or something.

606
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,245
What you're drinking Barney?
Is that like vanilla latte or somehting?

607
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,204
Stay sharp.

608
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,403
Move.

609
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,205
You have to think about this again Mr. Menz.

610
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,521
I promise you this won't happen again.

611
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,840
- Move the car.
- I'm talking to you!

612
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,200
Nice driving Mars.

613
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,486
Good performance.

614
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,970
Yeah, too good.

615
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,690
Any closer and I'd beat his ass.

616
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,761
I believe her.

617
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,807
Got 'em.

618
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,722
Oh man, this guy's protected better than the president.

619
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,529
Yeah, and his crib's like a 5-star fortress.

620
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,328
Listen we're not taking him there.

621
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,322
I bet the hotel is full of guests.

622
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,283
So where do we hit them?

623
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,289
At the meet.

624
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,325
We'll hit him from all four sides.

625
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,246
Hit him hard.

626
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,487
OK, um, so...

627
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,247
Our plan is to what? Kick down the
door and start spraying bullets'?

628
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,367
It's a great plan...

629
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,646
If ifs 1985.

630
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,801
And what's that supposed to mean?

631
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,122
You heard me.

632
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,928
You got a better plan'?

633
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,807
Much better.

634
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,120
Let's hear it.

635
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,770
Thorn, you're up.

636
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,641
OK, I'm the plan.

637
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,287
This better be good.

638
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,249
First I hack the security grid main server, boom.

639
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,403
Bypass the motion detector lasers and biometric
sensors, pow.

640
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,371
Override the surveillance videos and CCTV systems,
ba-bam.

641
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,964
And we are in.

642
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,404
It's child play.

643
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,448
Just like that?

644
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,487
Just like that.

645
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,050
Just like that.

646
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,042
Exactly, like that.

647
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,845
You better be right.

648
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,322
Ba-bam.

649
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,647
Ba-bam.

650
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,528
Let's go.

651
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,366
So Why'd you let your team go?

652
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,370
If you stick around long enough
you're gonna buy it. It was time.

653
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,522
They didn't seem too happy about it.

654
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,966
If you're looking to go the family route,

655
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,325
it's the wrong job for you.

656
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,529
There are different kinds of family

657
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,965
And when my life is on the line.

658
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,490
That's my family fighting with me.

659
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,967
You know what I mean.

660
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,327
Yeah, I know what you mean.

661
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,685
Right on time.

662
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,127
Ladies first.

663
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,651
Go ahead then Thorn.

664
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,721
Will you shut up and get in the sewer.

665
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,762
And ladies and gentlemen, we
officially have eyes in the sky.

666
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,807
Copy that.

667
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,562
Let's do this.

668
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,361
Thought you'd never ask.

669
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,044
Good to go.

670
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,050
Good luck boys.

671
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:07,690
Woah! Shit!

672
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,002
What's the problem?

673
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,843
The buyer, they're early.

674
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,402
Threat just doubled.

675
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,802
You're early.

676
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,083
What do you think?

677
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,250
It's OK.

678
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,611
When Cain slew his brother

679
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,881
God banished him from civilization

680
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,326
But before that he placed a mark on him

681
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,650
It was a felon's brand, but...

682
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:56,931
To protect him from roving hunters.

683
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,161
To protect him from roving hunters.

684
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,727
Customs is not X-ray artwork.

685
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:04,684
Only oils.

686
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,203
Very good.

687
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,441
There you have it.

688
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,646
<i>Gab“.</i>

689
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,369
My pleasure.

690
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,088
As always.

691
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,209
Can you access nuclear weapons?

692
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,122
I might.

693
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,522
But generally I find people are a
little too emotional for ownership

694
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,280
And I'd hate you killing all my other customers by
accident.

695
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,121
Or on purpose.

696
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,681
In position.

697
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,081
In position.

698
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,727
Set.

699
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,085
I pay you what you want.

700
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,003
Let me think about it.

701
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,205
Let me think about it.

702
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,567
We're on.

703
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,051
Stonebanks is moving, watch it.

704
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,322
Like little mice...

705
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,967
<i>T“! again.</i>

706
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,363
Open sesame.

707
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,842
Go go go.

708
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,245
Move.

709
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,005
Go.

710
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,640
Barney Ross says hello.

711
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,807
Nice job.

712
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,245
Trench you copy?

713
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,363
I'm waiting.

714
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,724
Package is secured.

715
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,210
Hurry UP-

716
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,087
It's boring.

717
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,882
Why don't you just a bullet in
his head and be done with it.

718
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,201
Hey, you said we were taking him in.

719
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,442
Good morning.

720
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,529
Are these your students?

721
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,931
Hey kids, what'd you learn tonight huh'?

722
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,807
Hey kids, what'd you learn tonight huh'?

723
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,524
What happened to the old crew'?

724
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,443
Oh that's right.

725
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,411
They stuck their noses into other
people's worlds and got fatally injured.

726
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,361
Now they're The Deletables

727
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,482
Hey, you hear that kids?

728
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,403
Take note cause that's what
you're doing right now.

729
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,406
Let me shut his mouth.

730
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,088
You're talking pretty tough to a guy who's
incapacitated, which is good for you.

731
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:12,285
<i>Is it?</i>

732
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:16,365
Why don't you cut me loose and I'll open your
meat shin and show you your own heart.

733
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,885
Hey Barney.

734
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,086
Why don't the two of us just end this?
What do you say?

735
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:24,330
Mix it up, either you snapping
my spine or me snapping yours.

736
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,564
Mix it up, either you snapping
my spine or me snapping yours.

737
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,369
You know, make it snappy

738
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,844
He thinks I'm joking.
I'm not joking.

739
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,410
You should see me when I'm angry.

740
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,004
You'd be very impressed.

741
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,570
And very dead.

742
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,283
So, come on pal.

743
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:41,564
Anything you want to get off your chest.

744
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,040
Anything you want to get off your chest.

745
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,207
Come on, lay it out.

746
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,685
I'm a good listener.

747
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,722
You're gonna take me back to the has been crew?

748
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,450
Carve me up around a fire

749
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,044
Very tribal

750
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,530
When we stop, I wanna break every bone in your body.

751
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,440
And drop what's left at The Hague

752
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:13,326
The Hague. I finally made the big-time.

753
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,209
I'm a war criminal

754
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,008
Keep laughing

755
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,284
Keep laughing

756
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,244
Do you think,

757
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,483
that you can just deliver me like a package?

758
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,608
We were close once

759
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,602
See we started this whole Expendables thing together,
see?

760
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,010
See we started this whole Expendables thing together,
see?

761
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,570
Look I've got the marks

762
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,883
They're a bit faded but, we had a falling out.

763
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,006
You went dark.

764
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,209
It's a dark business Barney, don't pretend you're not in
it.

765
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,602
The baddest survive, those are
the rules, I didn't make them up.

766
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,846
You see Barney here was content
to work for the small end money.

767
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,729
You see Barney here was content
to work for the small end money.

768
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,165
As an employee.

769
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,210
Now being boss is more lucrative but that's
a concept that somehow eluded you.

770
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,329
Plus you got that pesky moral conscience.

771
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,209
God that stuff gets in the way.

772
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,645
He thinks he's the good guy.

773
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,527
Keep talking while you can.

774
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,048
Sure, you got a conscience that makes you weak.

775
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:08,529
Sure, you got a conscience that makes you weak.

776
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,762
Success, real success...

777
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,850
is being willing to do the things
that other people are not

778
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,808
Not everyone's as sick as you.

779
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,848
Oh, but you are.

780
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,161
Did you kill anyone today Barne?

781
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,288
Blow any shit up?

782
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,521
How bout you kids? Kill anyone?

783
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,249
Before you all start grabbing bricks
to stone me at The Hague.

784
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,926
Before you all start grabbing bricks
to stone me at The Hague.

785
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,368
You might want to check your own hands for blood.

786
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,609
But I digress. Where was I?

787
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,762
Yes, business is booming right?

788
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,366
A chopper here, a missile there, guns

789
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,486
Whatever, when suddenly

790
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,527
Whatever, when suddenly

791
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,521
a competitor.

792
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,648
If you can call Uncle Sam a competitor.

793
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,690
Hires my own team. Barney and
the whole gang to whack me.

794
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,207
Things got ugly real fast and a lot of poeple got dead.

795
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,009
Three former brothers in arms.

796
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,128
- Shut your mouth.
- Three Expendables.

797
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,690
Our brothers, men we ate with,
fought with, bled with, dead!

798
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,567
Our brothers, men we ate with,
fought with, bled with, dead!

799
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,481
He puts three slugs into my chest.
Thank God...

800
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,642
for body armor, even I thought I was dead

801
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,291
And then he boogies out with the casualties, all dead!

802
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,641
Because you couldn't
stay out of my business!

803
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,802
Shut your mouth!

804
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,365
Go on, do it!

805
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,487
- Go on!
- It's what he wants.

806
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,720
It's hard to fathom.

807
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,528
I can't believe you forgot.

808
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,282
I can't believe you forgot.

809
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,441
What'?

810
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:40,001
That it's hard to beat an enemy when
he's living inside your own head.

811
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,049
You see you tie me up.

812
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,565
Like an animal.

813
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,404
Leave me to the slaughter.
You humiliate me. Disgrace me.

814
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,767
Now when the time comes to kill you.

815
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,763
And it will. I will not use a weapon.
I will use my hands.

816
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,330
And it will. I will not use a weapon.
I will use my hands.

817
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,244
Because I want you to feel the
way that I feel right now...

818
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,683
cause we were brothers

819
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,323
What's that?

820
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,970
It's a GPS tracker.

821
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,291
It's a GPS tracker.

822
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,441
How about that?

823
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,447
Hold it.

824
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:35,451
We may need them.

825
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:35,929
We may need them.

826
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,566
I need a body, find him.

827
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,924
What happened?

828
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,331
We found a shitstorm.

829
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,327
It's gonna getting worse.

830
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,490
This came in for you, 10 minutes ago.

831
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,809
Hey Barney.

832
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,768
My search party's dead so
I'm taking it you're still with us.

833
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:19,727
My search party's dead so
I'm taking it you're still with us.

834
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,962
Now you should've killed
me when you had the chance

835
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,849
cause that's your last
window, and it's gone

836
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,968
Now, I got something to show you here.

837
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:30,921
<i>Uda, Harps, Groucho, Gummo, and China.</i>

838
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,841
Yeah yeah yeah.

839
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,368
Hey, give her a little squeeze, there.

840
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,848
Personally, I'd chalk it up to collateral
damage, but I don't give a fuck.

841
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,248
But, I know you.

842
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,402
- 48 hours and they're gone for good.
- You want them?

843
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,640
Come get them

844
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,842
What are you gonna do'?

845
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,201
Wow, looking a little strung out there kids.

846
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,040
This is what you get for being pawns
in Barney's moral chess game.

847
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,371
This is what you get for being pawns
in Barney's moral chess game.

848
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,006
That one looks a little slack.

849
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,204
You know I feel most bad for you.

850
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,441
I don't give a shit how you feel.

851
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,488
I do, I have a daughter.

852
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,242
I have feelings, anyway.

853
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,526
I have feelings, anyway.

854
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,922
You know, when the CIA, I, er
presume that's who you're working for.

855
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,769
Am I right?

856
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,690
I bet you don't even know who you're working for.

857
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,921
But for Barney?

858
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,162
Do you know who's he working for?

859
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:02,445
Does he know who's he working for?

860
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,487
Does he know who's he working for?

861
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,527
It gets very confusing.

862
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,527
Anyway, when the CIA wanted
guys doing the dangerous work.-.

863
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,170
In the dangerous places,

864
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,083
they called us. When they didn't
want to get their hands dirty,

865
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,566
they called us.

866
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,082
Yup, we cleared every hotspot they had.

867
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,088
We bumped the bad guys so that the
good guys could roll in looking like heroes.

868
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,321
We bumped the bad guys so that the
good guys could roll in looking like heroes.

869
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,682
We killed a lot.

870
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,889
But we saved more lives...

871
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:36,522
than you can possibly imagine.

872
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,282
Then the boys on the hill
wanting no loose ends.

873
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,250
Then the boys on the hill
wanting no loose ends.

874
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,246
Tried to bury me.

875
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,091
I was an American.

876
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,764
Working for America.

877
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,609
Was.

878
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,210
They'd eat their own children.

879
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:54,524
The lesson here is...

880
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,407
The lesson here is...

881
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,769
Never do business with the government.

882
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,525
I'm gonna save you that heartache.

883
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:05,530
You never will.

884
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,920
So you're getting your old team?

885
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,081
Nah, I've burned that bridge.

886
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,447
You know your pride is gonna get you killed.

887
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,441
Better me than them.

888
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,444
- So you're really gonna go back?
- Yeah

889
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:28,963
- Alone?
- Yeah

890
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,847
- Alone?
- Yeah

891
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,081
You're an idiot.

892
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,051
Thanks for showing up.

893
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,050
I guess our favors are done.

894
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,804
But you're still an idiot.

895
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,081
How the hell did you find me?

896
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,051
People talk.

897
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:15,882
I hear things.

898
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,769
You got a mission...

899
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,285
I can help.

900
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,931
My name is Galgo.

901
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,524
Let me fill you in.

902
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,927
I am good, very good.

903
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,286
At warfare.

904
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,487
You know good memory, afraid of nothing.

905
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,245
I want to be your friend.

906
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,890
I don't need a friend.

907
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,291
Yes, you do

908
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,169
Everybody does.

909
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:42,802
I don't have any friends
That's why I know

910
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,406
Besides my friendship issues,

911
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,971
what I really need now is somehting to do.

912
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,566
Well, not just anything but...

913
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,290
what I was born to do.

914
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,203
Best bet, this is a one way trip.

915
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,009
Excuse me sir, but...

916
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,162
one way trip...

917
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,605
is better than no way...

918
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,683
which is the way I live now.

919
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,242
Help me with the crate.

920
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,251
I'm sorry.

921
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,204
On the plane, Gogo.

922
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,522
On the plane, yes. But Gogo no Gogo, Galgo.

923
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,444
- Galgo.
- Gogo sounds like a Parisian hooker.

924
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,888
I am the bridegroom of death.

925
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,570
The lyrics of a Spanish legion old songs.

926
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,608
That we used to sing when
we're on a mission in Croatia.

927
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,087
That's where I met Mingo.

928
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,203
The best point man ever.

929
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,648
Some kind of savant you know, ambush.

930
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,722
This guy could sniff, under fire.

931
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,370
The coolest cat ever.

932
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,725
Just pure eyes in his veins.

933
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,687
We were pinned down once like two bullets left.

934
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,647
I looked over...

935
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,763
Not one bead of sweat.

936
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,320
Yeah.

937
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,049
Can I help you up there?

938
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,565
You're a mechanic now?

939
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,530
Of course I am a mechanic.
I am whatever you need me to be sir.

940
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,369
OK then just be quiet.

941
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,010
Yes, sir.

942
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,967
Tiger,

943
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,485
This sniper I knew.

944
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,209
I mean, this guy got it all figured out.

945
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,362
Wind speed, temperature...

946
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,171
Barometric pressure.

947
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,640
But you know what he says the most important'?

948
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,562
No.

949
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,721
Patience.

950
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,211
Really?

951
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,441
Yes, he said that.

952
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:45,162
This thing smells good, what is that?
Kerosene? Gasoline?

953
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,527
Aviation fuel.

954
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,490
It's good.

955
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:56,291
The best team member ever, his name was Torres.

956
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,566
Holy shit!

957
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,887
You wouldn't believe what this guy was capable to do.

958
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,370
Un...bel...ievable.

959
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,001
I'm telling you, man.

960
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,444
- Galgo?
- Yes, sir.

961
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,803
I think I know why your team let you go.

962
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,088
You do?

963
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,844
Really?

964
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,449
Yes.

965
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,800
Last chance.

966
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,405
You sure you want to do this?

967
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,400
I like travelling.

968
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,287
Good.

969
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,891
Uh, who are those guys?

970
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,325
My old team.

971
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,440
What the hell are you doing here?

972
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,531
You were stupid enough to
get yourself into this mess.

973
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,487
We're the only ones crazy
enough to get you out of it.

974
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,648
Come on.

975
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,005
We're late for a war.

976
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,090
Galgo you might want to get out
of that seat, Christmas is coming.

977
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:26,881
But it's June.

978
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,729
Galgo, get the hell out.

979
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,529
Yes sir.

980
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,804
My hat.

981
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,529
I'm curious.

982
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,043
What'?

983
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,122
Since when did suicide become your hobby?

984
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,610
I got a will.

985
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,570
You know I'm probably the
only friend you've got.

986
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,880
I got a lot of friends.

987
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,928
You walk into a room,
people jump on the tables.

988
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,885
I missed you, Christmas.

989
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,048
I miss you too you demented bastard.

990
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,530
You could've left it demented.

991
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,488
Solid structure.

992
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,567
That is taking us from one place to another.

993
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,527
Through unbelievable speeds.

994
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,001
Think about it.

995
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,925
If God... if God... if he would've liked us you know flying

996
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,288
He would've give us feathers.

997
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,805
Do you have feathers?

998
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:19,887
Do you have feathers?

999
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,009
- I don't have feathers
- It's gonna be a long ass flight fellas

1000
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,320
It's going to be.

1001
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,766
It's going to be a long flight but don't worry...

1002
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,083
I'm here, because I can't sleep on planes...

1003
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,129
Yeah.

1004
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,600
Thought you should know Barney,
you're walking into a shitstorm.

1005
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,571
NSA ran a signals and frequencies
check on your team's phones.

1006
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,927
This bastard's not even trying to hide them.

1007
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,802
Where has he taken them?

1008
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,165
They're in Azmanastan.

1009
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,969
Another honeymoon hotspot.

1010
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,202
Who is that?

1011
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,611
Lee Christmas.

1012
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,523
Not far off, Christmas.

1013
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,444
Stonebanks's compound is where he trains his goons.

1014
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,602
It's very heavily fortified.

1015
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,130
What's up with the local army?

1016
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,282
I don't understand a word this guy is saying.

1017
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,566
Local army status.

1018
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,605
Small, corrupt.

1019
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,603
Stonebanks got all the brass in his pocket.

1020
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,047
Been running his operations through
this shithole of a country for years.

1021
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,406
Want some advice?

1022
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,688
- What's the advice?
- What goddamn language is that?

1023
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,681
They don't teach you
that on the stage either.

1024
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,761
Look who's talking.

1025
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,090
What's the advice Drummer?

1026
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,650
Forget about what you're thinking.

1027
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,005
Remember our deal.

1028
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,206
We need him alive.

1029
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,289
So he can sit in a courtroom
and beat this on a technicality'?

1030
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,647
Those are orders Barney.

1031
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,410
- You broke the phone.
- I got another one.

1032
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,085
Think we'll make it back from this one?

1033
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,809
You didn't have to come along, Christmas.

1034
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,643
Sure I did.

1035
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,245
Morons need friends.

1036
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,727
Gentlemen.

1037
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,961
Change of plans.

1038
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,008
This is it'?

1039
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,490
This is your evac team'?

1040
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,721
Short notice.

1041
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,881
Yeah.

1042
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,921
Very short.

1043
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,843
Where is your team?

1044
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,444
Major Drummer?

1045
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,488
No team, this one's off the books.

1046
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,966
I'm not even here.

1047
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,522
Nobody's here.

1048
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,965
I thought Church was asshole.

1049
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,887
Hysterical is strength. Weird.
Weird concept.

1050
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,490
I mean, if you're hysterically strong...

1051
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,965
You don't even have to go to the gym...

1052
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,964
You are just strong. You just got it.

1053
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,760
Hysterical was a concept that
actually was applied to women..

1054
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,889
In the 19th century.

1055
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,724
You know what I mean

1056
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,371
Well, this is an interesting place...

1057
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,202
He gave me a migraine.

1058
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,401
I hear that.

1059
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,449
Don't you think'?

1060
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:07,848
Look on the bright side.

1061
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,286
You run out of bullets,
you can talk him to death.

1062
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,560
Roger that.

1063
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,006
Tall one doesn't like me.

1064
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,126
He doesn't like anybody.

1065
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,406
- What you say'?
- He likes you.

1066
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:28,927
What the hell is that?

1067
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,761
What'?

1068
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,410
That computer strapped to your wrist.

1069
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,970
Nothing.

1070
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,486
The same thing you were
busting that kid's balls about.

1071
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,970
Nah, I had it for a while now.

1072
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,045
Why'd your team let you go?

1073
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,207
Why is it matter now'?

1074
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,690
I want to know who I'm working with.

1075
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,480
They are not around anymore.

1076
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:08,529
So...

1077
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,121
This um,

1078
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,042
So Why'd they let you go?

1079
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,923
They didn't.

1080
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,243
Benghazi.

1081
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:34,166
I was not in the army anymore. We were...

1082
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,611
retreaving a hostage something like uh...

1083
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,968
like what we are doing here.

1084
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:46,284
It was a beautiful day.

1085
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,727
No problems.

1086
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:52,564
And then it all went bad.

1087
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,084
We got hit, cut off...

1088
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,481
Waited for support, no one came.

1089
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,642
Everybody died.

1090
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,566
Except me.

1091
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:14,962
Galgo...

1092
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,843
Torres and figer were right.

1093
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,884
You were listening.

1094
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,008
Yeah, I was listening.

1095
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,886
Thank you.

1096
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,200
So what do you think'?

1097
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,967
I think we should get this over with.

1098
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,125
Four signals.

1099
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,371
Eight stories up.

1100
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,885
This is way too wrong.

1101
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,121
Sally don't like it.

1102
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,122
You know he's got eyes on us now.

1103
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,647
- May I suggest something?
- No. No, later.

1104
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,051
That's what I thought.

1105
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,405
That's fine.

1106
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:05,770
Go.

1107
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:38,609
Break it.

1108
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,082
What the hell!

1109
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,088
Hello, Barney.

1110
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,961
I knew you couldn't stay away.

1111
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,888
But I'm relieved that someone
could pick up the kids.

1112
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,929
You got them in there,
now try gettting them out.

1113
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,361
But unfortuantely for you...

1114
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,009
The entire complex has been wired with C-4.

1115
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:15,041
It'd take a regular Joe about 90 seconds to
get out of there. You got, how about 45?

1116
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,844
He's turned this whole place into a bomb.

1117
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,841
Maybe not.

1118
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,647
Hey!

1119
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,203
9% battery power'? You didn't charge it'?

1120
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,641
Excuse me but what are you doing?

1121
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,211
Try to run some code, should be able to jam the signal.

1122
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,087
Why didn't you think of that?

1123
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,571
Well I use it to check the weather.

1124
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,290
Will you just shut up and let him do his thing?

1125
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,406
You sure you're gonna do this Thorn?

1126
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,686
I can do it, I can do it.

1127
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,482
Come on, man.

1128
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:02,721
Come on, man.

1129
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,926
Come on, come on.

1130
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,247
Come on, Thorn.

1131
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,571
Come on.

1132
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,485
You're good, come on Thorn.

1133
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:14,966
<i>Focus, focus.</i>

1134
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,168
Got it.

1135
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,686
Good job, my DOV-

1136
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,967
We lost override. The signal is jammed.

1137
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,644
Send them in.

1138
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,364
Barney the battery's at 8%.
When this thing dies, we lose override.

1139
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,362
That gives us about 25 minutes tops

1140
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,041
Don't pop the bottles yet, we still got trouble.

1141
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,009
- What?
- Big trouble

1142
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,081
Lucky again bro.

1143
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,482
Try to enjoy the view because shortly the
building that you're currently standing in

1144
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,520
will be surrounded by the Azmanastan army.

1145
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,126
- How did you shitheads manage to get
captured anyway? - Shut the fuck up!

1146
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,486
Step back

1147
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,802
This is not an accident.
And we're trapped in here.

1148
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:27,009
This is exactly what he knew would happen.

1149
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,651
Us, tearing at each other.

1150
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,250
This stops now.

1151
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,569
We can do this.

1152
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,485
But only if we do this together.

1153
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,051
If we work as a team.

1154
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,763
We just may get out of this alive.

1155
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,562
Now do you, want to make it work.

1156
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:52,967
That simple.

1157
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,803
You got any weapons?

1158
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,923
Here's the plan. We're gonna break up into small
groups.

1159
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,524
And go out through the ground ?oor.

1160
01:32:59,520 --> 01:32:59,566
Get ready.

1161
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,282
Come on.

1162
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,366
- Thorn, you stay with me.
- You take Galgo.

1163
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:28,369
Yeah I don't want to.

1164
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,328
What, what? Shhh...

1165
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,166
Don't stop!

1166
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,605
One there, one there.

1167
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:04,721
There's too many!

1168
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:06,643
They're on our ?ank. Bring it to 'em.

1169
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,130
That's enough, light them up.

1170
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:33,922
Incoming.

1171
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,241
Up the shaft Thorn.
You gotta protect that signal jammer.

1172
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,161
I thought you could fight.

1173
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,563
Jesus God, you're OK'?

1174
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:58,846
Do not worry. I love this.

1175
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,490
Good keep moving.

1176
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,645
Relax.

1177
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,041
I told you you'd give yourself a stroke.

1178
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,050
You got a tank problem pal.

1179
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,485
Do something about it.

1180
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,322
I'm on it.

1181
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:01,530
Trench, on your right.

1182
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:08,609
That's gotta hurt.

1183
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,964
Drummer's in the house.

1184
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,409
Let's go.

1185
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,288
Time to pick up the tempo boys.

1186
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,446
Look out for the chopper.

1187
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,760
Not good.

1188
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,489
Hold on.

1189
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,010
This is not happening.

1190
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,081
You want to do something?

1191
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,209
Put me down! Put me down!

1192
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,327
Oh shit!

1193
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:06,682
Hi there.

1194
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,130
Closer.

1195
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:18,441
Closer.

1196
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,451
Yang, hit something.

1197
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,687
Next.

1198
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,760
Your name is Luna right'?

1199
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:41,241
Luna means moon.

1200
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,966
Hypnotic, mysterious, magical, like yourself.

1201
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,847
Would you like to hold my gun?

1202
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,766
Goodbye, sweet.

1203
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:01,965
There he is!

1204
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,081
Come on, drive this thing.

1205
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,490
This one's for Caesar, assholes.

1206
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,043
Yeah!

1207
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,565
Damn that's cool.

1208
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,329
It was all under control.

1209
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,401
That's what it looked like.

1210
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:03,847
Come on!

1211
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:15,042
This the happiest moment of my life.

1212
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:34,080
Jingling jingling.

1213
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,689
You finished here'?

1214
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,648
Men!

1215
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:09,963
- You're not gonna believe this
- Oh, god.

1216
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,764
I've been thinking of you the whole time.

1217
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,251
- During the whole fight!
- Can we just go?

1218
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:18,607
Come on.

1219
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,525
Hold up.

1220
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,886
Where did you learn how to ?y?

1221
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,610
In Tehran.

1222
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,884
Warning, we got reinforcements.

1223
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:53,568
Shit.

1224
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,251
Drummer, there's another wave coming.

1225
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,249
The only way out is up.

1226
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:06,289
On my Way-

1227
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,286
Evac in 5.

1228
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,200
Got it.

1229
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,770
Everybody get to the roof now.

1230
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,569
Got it.

1231
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,321
Trench, Yang, come on, clear the roof.

1232
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,731
Let's go.

1233
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:41,931
Damn.

1234
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,489
- Always this easy'?
- Pretty much.

1235
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:21,767
How hard can it be to kill 10 men'?

1236
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,569
D'you think you could even just wound a couple?

1237
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:25,403
Watch closely.

1238
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,481
And again.

1239
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,167
Anybody else?

1240
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,242
Useless bunch...

1241
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,402
You want something done right...

1242
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,849
You got valet parking here?

1243
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,411
Yeah, there's some right here.

1244
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,561
Go go go.

1245
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,042
Don't stop.

1246
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:08,451
Come on guys, move it.

1247
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,684
Drummer, we're pinned down.

1248
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:34,091
Stop mumbling.

1249
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:39,121
Good morning.

1250
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,804
Let's get to the chopper.

1251
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,120
Let's go.

1252
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,610
Go go go go move go.

1253
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,205
Go gotta go.

1254
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:52,766
- Yang?
- You're welcome

1255
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:55,001
You're working for Trench?

1256
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,240
Yeah, he pay me more money.

1257
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,762
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the guy that just saved your ass

1258
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,250
(Spanish profanity...)

1259
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,487
Batteries at 2%

1260
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,010
Hey Barney, leaving so soon?

1261
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,411
Come on, ley's finish this.

1262
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,242
How you feeling?

1263
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,530
Come on, stand up, you'll feel better.

1264
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,202
Barney where are you?

1265
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,966
Lose the armor, I want you to feel this.

1266
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,008
Barney we gotta go.

1267
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,483
And don't even think about going
for that piece of garbage in the bag.

1268
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,086
Come on.

1269
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:59,531
That's it.

1270
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:10,129
We don't need these, do we?

1271
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,801
Come on.

1272
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,929
Barney we gotta go.

1273
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,043
Batteries at 1%

1274
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,320
Come on Barney.

1275
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,131
What about The Hague huh?

1276
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,009
I am The Hague.

1277
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,241
Batteries gone.

1278
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,605
Gotta go, gotta go.

1279
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,523
No don't, wait, wait.

1280
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,807
I can't wait.

1281
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:47,727
Go!

1282
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,928
Come on, Barney! Go!

1283
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,445
What the hell!

1284
01:49:58,760 --> 01:49:59,602
You owe me Barney.

1285
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,808
Barney!

1286
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:46,123
Pull me up.

1287
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,806
You're gonna fire us again, Barney'?

1288
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,882
Come on!

1289
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,120
Can't hear you, pal!

1290
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,043
I'm gonna kill you!

1291
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,169
Alright, I'm sorry!

1292
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:01,163
- Pull me up you idiots.
- Don't pull him up.

1293
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,646
<i>To Caesar.</i>

1294
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:26,527
<i>Caesar.</i>

1295
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,803
Yo Barney.

1296
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:34,483
Yeah.

1297
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,843
I don't think I'll be needing this anymore.

1298
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,129
You want your luck back?

1299
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,081
I hope I didn't stretch it.

1300
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,491
I think you did stretch it.

1301
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,404
- Good to have you back man.
- Good to be back.

1302
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,125
Don't scare us like that anymore, OK.

1303
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:55,041
Hail Caeser.

1304
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:03,406
You never got him to The Hague.

1305
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,441
You know Drummer...

1306
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,082
Working with you ain't been so bad.

1307
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:14,328
I haven't had so much fun in years.

1308
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,325
Fun's important.

1309
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,211
These guys are nuts.

1310
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:25,046
Our powers combined..-...

1311
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,202
Yes, you are.

1312
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:30,801
Come on, there must be a plan

1313
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,770
- Woah, Major Old-School
- Major Badass

1314
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,126
I'll drink to that.

1315
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,802
I am sure I have done enough.

1316
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:42,804
That I am worth my weight, in gold you know...

1317
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:47,169
Am I close? And since I am as crazy as you...

1318
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,648
I am sure I feel game...

1319
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,846
- Galgo?
- Yes sh'?

1320
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:58,967
Welcome aboard.

1321
01:52:59,040 --> 01:52:59,962
Thank God!

1322
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:03,161
Because I already spent a fortune on this.

1323
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:04,127
You know what I mean.

1324
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:05,963

Hey Yang, looks like you had a growth spun.

1337
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,844
Tall people don't live long.

1338
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,245
So you're working for Trench now.

1339

You guys want to get a room?

So jealous.

Cheers.

1347

You know for a guy that
doesn't take orders very well.

1348
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:38,011
You did pretty good.

1349
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,331
Yeah?

1350

You did good kid.

1355
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:32,883
You look like a proud, demented father.

1356
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,726
You could've skipped the demented pan.

1357
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,566
It was a compliment.
