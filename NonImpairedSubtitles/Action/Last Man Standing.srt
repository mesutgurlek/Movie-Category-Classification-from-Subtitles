1
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,545
It's a funny thing.

2
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:55,172
No matter how low you sink...

3
00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:57,213
there's still
a right and a wrong...

4
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:59,712
and you always end up choosing.

5
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:04,769
You go one way so you can try
to live with yourself.

6
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:09,468
You can go the other
and still be walking around...
but you're dead and you don't know it.

7
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:35,168
I was coming through Texas
on my way to Mexico.

8
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,035
I needed some time to hide out.

9
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,503
I had spent most of my life
on the dodge.

10
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:44,935
Drunk or sober,
I got no complaints...

11
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:49,093
even if I did
get my hands dirty on the way.

12
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:26,361
Jericho was a jerkwater town
maybe 50 miles from the border.

13
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:30,491
Dirt streets, ramshackle buildings.
One thing for sure...
you couldn't find it

14
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:33,257
anywhere on the map.

15
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,306
For the most part,
I was a big-city guy.

16
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,235
I like pavement
under my feet...

17
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,566
and bright lights
after the sun goes down.

18
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:38,137
I figured this burg
was just the kind of place...

19
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,260
you gassed up the car,
got something to eat...
and if you got stuck, maybe spent a night.

20
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:48,030
Then I got a look at her...

21
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,291
and that's
when all the fun started.

22
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:34,846
It's not a good idea
to be looking...

23
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,969
at Mr. Doyle's girl that way.

24
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,670
I remember a guy once told me
this is a free country.

25
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:44,405
Jocko, this guy thinks
it's a free country.

26
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:46,901
Now you're free to go.

27
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,565
Sheriff's office is over there
in case you want to complain.

28
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,602
Your light's out.

29
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:54,079
I seen it, right outside the window.
You know what I'm going
to do about it?

30
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,677
Not a goddamn thing.

31
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,338
But I know what you ought to do.

32
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:06,141
You ought to get your spare,
put it on your car...

33
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:10,268
and drive out of town.
Ain't that right, Bob?

34
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,237
You got to forgive old Bob.
He ain't much for talk.

35
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,063
Hold it.
Let me tell you something.

36
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:27,627
If you're sticking around,
don't be coming to me for help.

37
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:30,964
You're on your own here.

38
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,967
We already got a fella
in the window of the undertaker.

39
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:38,192
Do yourself a favor--
first thing, get a firearm.

40
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,791
First customer I seen all week.

41
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:56,384
Want a whiskey or a beer?
Don't have much else to offer.

42
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,718
Whiskey.

43
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,257
You under prohibition?

44
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,654
We don't pay much attention
to it here.

45
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,517
You got a phone in this place?

46
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:09,552
Who you want to call?

47
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:12,642
My mama.

48
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:20,780
We got phones,
but they ain't working...

49
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:23,905
since you need a switchboard
operator to run them.

50
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:25,913
You got electricity?

51
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:28,571
Got that.

52
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:31,475
Runs on gas generators.
Hope they stay working.
Nobody left to fix them if they go bust.

53
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:37,272
Tell the truth...

54
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,501
most of what they call
decent folks have been run off.

55
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:45,198
Really ain't much left here
but a ghost town.

56
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:48,000
making a profit
staying in the middle...

57
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:49,517
Some damn sheriff...

58
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:50,866
grafting off both sides.

59
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:53,902
I think Mr. Doyle
bought him off first...

60
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:56,230
or maybe it was Strozzi.

61
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:59,029
Who's Strozzi?

62
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:02,134
That's the other gang here.

63
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,131
Strozzi and the Italian fellas.

64
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:06,493
Both gangs took over this town,
run off all the regular folks.

65
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:11,263
Come from the same big city...

66
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:14,159
but they don't
like each other much.

67
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:15,819
Bootleggers.

68
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:19,518
You got Strozzi at the Sweetwater...
and Doyle's bunch
down at the Alamo.

69
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:25,225
They leave me be
because I stay to myself.

70
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,654
They think I'm crazy.

71
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,981
What the hell are you doing?

72
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:39,919
I'm going to go see the fellas
that wrecked my car...

73
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,576
have a little talk with them.

74
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,479
I hadn't gotten a real warm reception...
but I started thinking
maybe this was my lucky day.

75
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:55,708
A crook for a sheriff...

76
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:57,607
and two bootlegger outfits
that hated each other.

77
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:01,177
If I played it right...
I could make some easy money
and move on.

78
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,862
I thought I made it clear...

79
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:36,294
who you can and can't be
looking at around here.

80
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:39,860
That's Mr. Doyle's property.

81
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:42,893
I came here to see you.

82
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:47,322
Did you get that car of yours
fixed yet?

83
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,354
I'm running a little low
on cash.

84
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,482
I was wondering if you could
help pay the damages.

85
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:02,144
I guess you'll have to kill me.

86
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,352
It'll hurt if I do.

87
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,468
Tell Mr. Doyle if he'd have hired smarter guys...
none of this would have happened.

88
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:47,493
It's all about booze.

89
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,160
Gets smuggled through here
from Mexico.

90
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,062
We're part of a family operation
in Chicago.

91
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:54,723
So what we got here is close
to a civil war...

92
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:55,958
except now we got a truce.

93
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,190
This truce ain't gonna last...

94
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:00,763
especially after Hickey
gets back.

95
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:01,626
That's why you're here.

96
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,559
Who's Hickey?

97
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,923
Hickey
is Doyle's right-hand man.

98
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,325
He's a sweetheart.
Looks like somebody
carved him up for Sunday dinner.

99
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,348
Talks like this.

100
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,152
Forget it.

101
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,281
What about you?
You got a name?

102
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,380
Smith.

103
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,750
Smith what?
You got a first name?

104
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:28,965
John.

105
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,415
That's a good one.
You on the run?

106
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,316
Where are you from?

107
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:35,884
Back east.

108
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,881
John Smith from back east.

109
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:41,914
I heard you wanted to see me.

110
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:43,208
That's right.

111
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:45,904
What's the matter?

112
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:47,773
Did I interrupt something
important?

113
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,809
She was doing her nails.

114
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:53,569
This is Lucy.

115
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:55,471
She a real nice girl.

116
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,837
She got a big mouth, but
she's going to keep it shut...

117
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:00,465
and act very friendly now,
right?

118
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:05,061
Lucy, would you please
take Mr. Smith to his room?

119
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:11,859
I guess Strozzi hired himself
another bum.

120
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,863
Got it all figured out, do you?

121
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:15,865
Yeah. I'm a fortune-teller.

122
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:17,330
Working for Strozzi
has its advantages.

123
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,661
You're going to love your room.

124
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:25,123
The skirt was from just outside of Cicero.
Strozzi said he had her sent
here to keep up his morale...

125
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:31,724
but that's the first time
I ever heard it called that.

126
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:33,386
You try and keep it
down up here, OK?

127
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,255
My room's right underneath.

128
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,257
I'll try not to make too much noise...
when I'm jumping
up and down on the bed.

129
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:41,384
Sunday dinner was a real event.

130
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:44,286
Strozzi might have been
a small-time hood...

131
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:45,947
but he tried to run things...

132
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,851
like he was somebody important
back in Chicago.

133
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,318
He had an army of 20 shooters.
As far as I could see,
most of them were goofballs.

134
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,341
It was all
right out of some dime novel.

135
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:08,239
How's the food?
Good.

136
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:10,710
I brought these mamas in
from Chicago.

137
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:14,041
Food here was terrible.
It's good, huh?

138
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,409
Yeah. I like garlic.
All right.

139
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:33,102
What is this? Nobody waits?
You're late.

140
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:37,893
While you were doing
your important business...

141
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,469
things are happening.

142
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:42,261
We now have a new employee.

143
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:47,027
Mr. Smith, this is Giorgio Cormonte.
Killed Finn. That's Doyle's
best guy next to Hickey.

144
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:53,388
I know all about it.

145
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,622
And you hire him.

146
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,626
What do you think that
looks like in keeping a truce?

147
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,420
You want to tip Doyle off?
Plus, who the hell is he?

148
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:03,516
Doyle's guys are scared of him.

149
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:05,853
He was in town 20 minutes,
he killed one of them.

150
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:10,321
Doyle ain't gonna do a thing
with Hickey out of town.
The only thing that cockroach might try...

151
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:13,118
is to hire this guy for himself.

152
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,211
I don't like it.

153
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:16,481
I don't like changes
at the last minute...

154
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:18,486
and I don't like new faces--

155
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,542
You got a problem with me,
take it up with your boss.
I just work here.

156
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,109
So I decided to give up
my free room.

157
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,868
I had seen the real thing...

158
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:49,907
and these guys
were a long way from it.

159
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,334
I wasn't sure if he was getting
a wooden box ready for me...

160
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,665
or if he just wanted
to say thanks for the business.

161
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:10,298
Look who's here.

162
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,189
Last time I saw you...
you was gonna have a talk
with some fellas.

163
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:18,962
Next thing I hear, one of them's dead.
Conversation
sort of went downhill.

164
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:25,887
Ain't that right, Bob?

165
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,356
He don't talk much,
but his ears work good.

166
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:38,381
You got a room you can rent me?

167
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,818
I'm surprised you ain't staying
at the Sweetwater.

168
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,511
There's a room upstairs.
I can use the money.

169
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,051
You got a name? Mine's Joe.

170
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:53,272
OK, Joe.

171
00:17:55,017 --> 00:17:55,414
You let me know
when this runs out...

172
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:57,948
and I'll give you some more.

173
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:00,979
You got girls for hire
in this town?

174
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,670
Hell, yes.

175
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,972
You in west Texas.

176
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:08,475
Round the corner,
third door on the left.

177
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:13,040
You can certainly afford them.

178
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:24,260
You remind me of this guy
that used to come see me...

179
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:25,361
when I worked in New Orleans.

180
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,834
He looked a lot like you.
You ever been to New Orleans?

181
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,830
He was nice.
He wasn't as quiet as you,
though...

182
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:35,191
but you two almost
look like brothers.

183
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:38,527
Except he had tattoos.

184
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:41,791
I think that he was
in the navy.

185
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:48,357
And he used to come and see me
every Friday or Saturday night.

186
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,894
His name was Clarence.

187
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:54,016
I had a lot of fun
in New Orleans.

188
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:57,057
Sorry I ever came
to this lousy town.

189
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,590
There's nothing to do here.

190
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:03,384
...So I took every kind
of dance class imaginable...

191
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,285
because
I wanted to be a dancer...

192
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,979
and so I came here
because it's off-season--

193
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:34,836
Get out of here, girls!

194
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:36,934
Go!

195
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:57,130
I didn't have nothing
to do with it.

196
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:58,100
What?

197
00:19:58,735 --> 00:19:59,995
I didn't have nothing--

198
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,501
Who set me up?

199
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,032
They forced me!
They said they'd kill me.

200
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,687
Give me a name.

201
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:08,756
Give me a name, goddamn it!

202
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:10,162
It was a guy that worked
for Doyle.

203
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:12,252
It was Doyle's bunch.

204
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,919
Please don't tell them
I told you.

205
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:20,159
Please. I'm sorry.
Her name was Wanda.

206
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:24,753
Crossing me
was nothing personal.

207
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,755
She was just trying
to make a living...

208
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:28,515
in a world
where big fish eat little fish.

209
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:31,212
Come on.
By the time the law showed up,
I was long gone...

210
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:38,409
but the sheriff
didn't let me down.

211
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:40,984
He investigated
the whole thing...

212
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:42,345
then arrested the hooker.

213
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:49,275
I went down to the Red Bird
and asked that old geezer...
who runs the place where I could find you.

214
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,605
Where are we headed?

215
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:56,270
A juke joint outside of town.
Strozzi wants everybody there.

216
00:20:57,212 --> 00:21:00,177
He's going to make another speech?
He don't keep me
too well informed.

217
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:04,834
Giorgio's always acting
like he's in charge...

218
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:06,066
because he's the son
of somebody important--

219
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,765
Strozzi's boss in Chicago.

220
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,431
Strozzi and Giorgio
are really cousins.

221
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,800
Strozzi don't admit it, though.
Not a family man.

222
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,901
Where does that leave you
and him?

223
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:24,991
Celina's was a fast 20 minutes
out across the desert.

224
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:28,156
Two stories of wood
in the middle of nowhere.

225
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:29,285
It was the kind of place...

226
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,693
that looked like the special
was chicken-fried steak.

227
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:35,694
Strozzi told me that Giorgio
and the other guys...

228
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,817
got a hot head
about the money you're getting.

229
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:43,087
Giorgio don't like you too much,
in case you haven't noticed.

230
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:45,091
Why does a guy send
his girlfriend to come find me?

231
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,749
Strozzi figures
I wouldn't be dumb enough...

232
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,789
to do anything out of line,
so he sent me.

233
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:54,651
That must make you feel
real proud.

234
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,016
Quit being a shitheel, all right?
I get enough of that
from Strozzi, thank you.

235
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,448
You sure you're not dumb enough
to do anything out of line?

236
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:06,194
I'm just curious.
Your boyfriend got a first name?
Only in the bedroom.

237
00:22:17,448 --> 00:22:19,878
As usual,
she was trying to act tough...

238
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,445
but anybody could see
it was paper-thin.

239
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:25,340
Even with a second-rater
like Strozzi...

240
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,534
she was in way over her head.

241
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:43,494
For Christ's sweet sake.
It took you two long enough.

242
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:46,593
Kiss my ass.

243
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,391
Hard to drive in the rain.

244
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,056
Like he said,
what took you so long?

245
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,097
Maybe you don't hear too good--
it's raining.

246
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:02,324
You're getting to be more of
a wise-ass Polack every day...

247
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,327
and it ain't so cute no more.

248
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:07,224
You know what happens
to wise-ass Polack dames?

249
00:23:07,828 --> 00:23:11,883
They get their wise asses
kicked!

250
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,687
When I was in this whorehouse...

251
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:16,915
Doyle sent a couple guys
to visit me.

252
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:22,148
I had to kill them both.

253
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:25,244
You killed two more of Doyle's guys?
Is that bullshit,
or is that true?

254
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:29,517
I don't give a damn about Doyle.

255
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,085
If he lost two men tonight,
that's good news.

256
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:36,309
This Doyle, he's trying to
outbid me with my own suppliers.

257
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,313
I try to do business with him,
it's bullshit.

258
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:43,074
We got a shipment coming in
from Monterrey next week.

259
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,542
Mr. Doyle has got one coming in
tomorrow.

260
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:51,008
This is where you're going
to start to earn your pay.

261
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,604
That's five trucks.

262
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:07,596
We deliver at 200 bucks a case.

263
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:12,096
Plus, you know
what's really the frosting?

264
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:13,394
We get Doyle's trucks.

265
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:17,755
You know how hard it is
to buy a truck in Mexico?

266
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:27,327
We crossed the border
a couple hours before dawn.

267
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:33,121
Strozzi had a plan he thought
would make him look good...
to the big boss back in Chicago.

268
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:38,151
It involved hijacking, murder,
corruption of the military...

269
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,588
and sticking me
right out front.

270
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:48,949
Who in the hell are you
supposed to be?

271
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,451
This might be a good time
to give up.

272
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,973
What the hell's this?

273
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:04,939
I told you we couldn't trust
these Mexicans.
I'm going to send Smith back with Santo...

274
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:07,107
to keep an eye on Doyle.

275
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:12,236
You stay with the trucks
till they get to Matamoros.

276
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,766
It was a massacre.

277
00:25:32,372 --> 00:25:34,859
Couldn't say I was real sorry...
but it was a rough way
to check out.

278
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:43,032
I don't know how reliable...

279
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:46,690
she's ever going to hold up
as a witness.
She's some kind of a vagrant.

280
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,561
Might even be here
for immoral purposes.

281
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:53,060
How much to get her out?

282
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:56,060
100 will send her on her way
right away.

283
00:25:56,662 --> 00:25:57,252
I've been thinking about
how Doyle's men knew...

284
00:25:57,895 --> 00:26:00,621
I was at that whorehouse.

285
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,623
I figure your deputy heard me
last night at the Red Bird...

286
00:26:04,225 --> 00:26:05,622
came over here
and told you about it...

287
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:07,656
and you sold the information
to Doyle.
How am I doing so far, Sheriff?

288
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,884
You are one suspicious fella.
Ain't he, Bob?

289
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:17,647
Maybe I was a little
rough on you last night.
Maybe I shortchanged you.

290
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,017
If I was you,
I'd get out of here.

291
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:25,016
Doyle's men are going to think
you tipped me off.

292
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:29,049
You got a bus
comes through this town?

293
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:32,137
Yeah. At noon every day.

294
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:37,610
Make sure she gets on it.

295
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:40,643
I got some information you may
want to sell to Mr. Doyle.
He's going to find out soon enough...

296
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:43,739
but you might be the one
to give it to him.

297
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:46,502
A shipment of booze
he had coming up from Mexico...

298
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:47,631
got hijacked by some bandidos.

299
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:50,867
A tip like that ought to be
worth at least a grand.

300
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,769
You better be right...

301
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:57,531
because if Doyle should send
Hickey after me...

302
00:26:58,171 --> 00:26:59,761
he's coming directly for you.

303
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:00,893
I keep hearing about Hickey.

304
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,230
Sounds like a real scary guy.

305
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:06,596
Let me tell you just how scary.

306
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:09,927
It goes that when he was 10 years old...
gets a butcher knife
and cuts his father's throat...

307
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,587
from ear to ear.
Then they stick him
in an orphanage.

308
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:19,387
15 years old,
he burns it to the ground.

309
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:24,516
You just make sure you mark me
down for half of that thousand.

310
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:34,779
Think maybe
you and I should talk.

311
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:38,015
I don't think
these people appreciate you.

312
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:43,918
You going to be my hero?

313
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,610
I thought you were just a guy
who did things for money.

314
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:53,709
I'm just a guy
that does everything for money.

315
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:58,507
Anybody see you come up here?

316
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:06,640
Appreciate me?
You don't know the half of it.

317
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:09,868
I don't have to take it
from these bastards.

318
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,531
Going back to Chicago
on the first thing out of here.

319
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:16,902
What's so funny?

320
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:18,904
You're not going anywhere.

321
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,936
You're just blowing off
a little steam.

322
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:25,934
You hear the way Strozzi
talked to me?

323
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,593
That grease ball?
To hell with him.

324
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:32,398
Strozzi's out of town
for the day.

325
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,925
So?

326
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,964
Did Strozzi tell you
he's paying me a lot of money?

327
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,428
There may be a way
to get your hands on some of it.

328
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,984
You going to tell me why
you would do such a nice thing?
Because I'm a nice guy...

329
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:50,892
a sweet guy.

330
00:28:58,092 --> 00:28:59,954
Like I said...

331
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,953
I don't think they appreciate you.
I think
you're a very smart girl.

332
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,380
You hear things...inside word.

333
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:17,878
I'm the kind of guy
that likes to have...

334
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:22,539
all the information
he can get...

335
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:27,771
so if you give me the inside word...
I'll give you an extra hundred
or so a week...

336
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:33,341
just between me and you.

337
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:45,504
Strozzi and Giorgio were going
to be back the next day...

338
00:29:46,672 --> 00:29:50,501
was going to come from working
Doyle's side of the street.

339
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,068
They'd make the first move.

340
00:29:58,468 --> 00:30:01,899
Mr. Doyle wants you
to come work for us full-time.

341
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:05,555
I'm not sure he can afford it.
Try me.

342
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:11,655
A week or a day?

343
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:15,560
I'm surprised
you're not mad at me.

344
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,914
I thought you might
hold it against me...

345
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:22,917
me killing three of your guys.
It's the only cure I know
for being stupid.

346
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:29,849
Hey, dummy.
Bring us your best stuff.

347
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:34,313
Right away, sir.

348
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:40,973
I know you already got a job
working for Strozzi...

349
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:42,913
but I figure you
for the kind of guy...

350
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:46,243
who goes
to the highest bidder...

351
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:48,007
just like those Mexicans...

352
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:50,477
that were supposed
to guard my booze.

353
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:58,037
Strozzi was behind that,
wasn't he?

354
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,704
How would you like to kill
Strozzi...

355
00:31:03,343 --> 00:31:06,501
and that little punk Giorgio?
From what I hear,
a guy like yourself...

356
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:12,097
you only care about the money.

357
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:13,762
I mean it as a compliment.

358
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:17,995
That's why we're all here.
Where's Hickey?

359
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,199
You heard about Hickey, huh?

360
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:25,790
I heard he talks kind of funny.

361
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,797
That's the way you sound when
somebody slices your face...

362
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:33,363
jams an ice pick
in your voice box.

363
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:40,383
Hickey can get
awful messy, though.

364
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:42,755
This should be an inside job.

365
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,847
We need somebody
nice and neat, like you.

366
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:50,754
I'll think about it.

367
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:52,881
You're making a mistake!

368
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,777
Maybe you're just not
very smart.

369
00:31:57,388 --> 00:31:59,649
What the hell
are you holding back for?

370
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:04,343
You think the meek
are going to inherit the earth?

371
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:07,247
If they do,
you won't be there to enjoy it.

372
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:12,704
I might have been
a gun for hire...

373
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:16,405
but I wasn't exactly
an assassin.

374
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:17,741
Maybe Doyle figured
there wasn't much difference.

375
00:32:18,346 --> 00:32:20,641
Tell Hickey I said hello.

376
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:24,937
If I was going
to get into Doyle's wallet...
I needed something big to sell him.

377
00:32:33,374 --> 00:32:34,340
You don't quit me.

378
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,906
Nobody quits me.
What is it? Doyle?

379
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:37,903
Did he offer you more money?

380
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:39,095
Keep the 500 you owe me.

381
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:43,794
The rest is mine for the work
I did down in Mexico.

382
00:32:44,403 --> 00:32:44,664
You let him walk away?

383
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:46,700
He doesn't go. Nobody goes.

384
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:50,596
You get back here,
you yellow son of a bitch.

385
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,363
Put those down!

386
00:32:58,564 --> 00:33:00,995
Something you want to say to me?

387
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:10,883
Fucking kill you, bastard.

388
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:19,881
It's not your fault
Giorgio's a half-wit.

389
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,584
You really want to get killed
for a half-wit?

390
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:30,476
Let it go. Put it down.

391
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:55,335
Tell Mr. Doyle
I turned Strozzi down.

392
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:12,293
What the hell
you grinning about?

393
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:14,299
Goddamn, that was great.

394
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:17,832
I guess you don't work
for Strozzi no more.

395
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:23,197
You ever wash these?

396
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,257
Working for Strozzi
had about played itself out.

397
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,585
Until Hickey showed up,
I was out of moves.

398
00:34:41,191 --> 00:34:43,712
I decided to dry out a little.

399
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:45,050
Went two days without a drink.

400
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:47,518
For me, that's pretty good.

401
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:56,515
Sitting out here in the open
might not be a good idea...

402
00:34:57,151 --> 00:34:59,878
for a fella that's got
as many enemies as you got.

403
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:04,006
I thought everybody liked me.

404
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:05,773
I'm such a nice guy.

405
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,576
This is Mr. Doyle's girl.

406
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,439
I'm bringing her back
from church.

407
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:17,138
I guess going to church
makes her feel better...

408
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,265
about keeping company
with Mr. Doyle.

409
00:35:20,442 --> 00:35:23,838
That right, honey?

410
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,636
You don't want to miss out
on the big money.

411
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:34,169
This little war with Strozzi's
going to be over soon.

412
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:51,356
Hickey's back.

413
00:36:03,892 --> 00:36:04,516
We got problems.

414
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,521
Strozzi broke the truce,
hit our trucks in Mexico...

415
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:13,214
killed all our guys,
jacked the whole load.

416
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:24,545
How's my car?

417
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,581
I fixed that inner tube,
and I fixed that headlight.

418
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:30,579
She's good as new,
except for that windshield.

419
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:35,805
I ordered new glass,
but it's gonna take a while.

420
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:38,269
Will this cover it?

421
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:40,740
Twenty dollars?
That's way too much.
But I got some information I'll trade you...

422
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,632
for the change on it.

423
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:47,298
A fella come around here
asking me about your car...

424
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:50,839
wanted to look
at the registration...
and check your name.

425
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,968
What did you tell him?

426
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:54,866
I didn't tell him nothing.
He just went on ahead
and looked anyway.

427
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:59,228
But guess what.

428
00:36:59,837 --> 00:37:00,564
He didn't find
that registration, did he?

429
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,226
That's right.

430
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:05,232
You can keep that change.

431
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:06,595
This fella
say what his name was?

432
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:09,597
He didn't say,
but I know who it was.

433
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,256
One of them Italian boys
been hanging around town...
named Giorgio.

434
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:18,688
Thanks.

435
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,219
Jesus Christ!

436
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:39,583
Somebody answer
the goddamn phone!

437
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:43,119
Maybe Chicago
found a way to get through.

438
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:45,911
Looks like I struck pay dirt.

439
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,484
Who's this? Giorgio?

440
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:49,482
Yeah. Who's this?

441
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:54,174
You remember me,
the high-paid nobody.

442
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:55,509
I got a message for Strozzi.

443
00:37:56,115 --> 00:38:00,273
We don't need any messages
from jerks like you.

444
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:01,935
Don't be stupid.

445
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:03,978
Just because I don't work for you...
doesn't mean
I can't be a friend.

446
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,536
I don't want to see
your boss get hurt.

447
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:10,075
You tell him that Doyle knows...

448
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:13,538
that he's the one that hijacked
his shipment...
but maybe you got a bigger problem.

449
00:38:15,174 --> 00:38:19,332
There's a rumor Ramirez is
going back on Doyle's payroll.

450
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:21,460
Who knows?
Maybe it's all just bullshit.

451
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:23,468
You getting this?

452
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:26,365
Yeah, I'm getting it.
All bullshit.

453
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,957
Good boy. You tell
your cousin to watch his ass.

454
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:40,756
The Italians were winning
in New York and Chicago...

455
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:45,760
but they weren't doing too good
in Jericho.

456
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:47,955
A little past nine
that night...

457
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:50,526
I got a look at Giorgio
leaving town.

458
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,887
You could almost see
the price tag...

459
00:38:52,493 --> 00:38:54,685
hanging around his neck.

460
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:04,485
I just came by to tell you...

461
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:07,246
that me and Strozzi
made it up this morning.

462
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,580
I got an investment there...

463
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,150
so we can forget
about the other day, right?

464
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,511
It was just one time for fun.

465
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,546
Business is business.

466
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:25,442
I don't want to get myself
in the middle of anything.

467
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:29,443
Strozzi's
going to take care of me.

468
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:36,140
I saw that punk Giorgio
sneak out of town.

469
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:37,133
He went to EI Morado.

470
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:39,071
Where is he headed?

471
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:41,138
What's he doing down in Mexico?

472
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:43,229
What he always does...

473
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:47,031
drinks, messes around,
goes to whorehouses.

474
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:49,159
I'm surprised Strozzi didn't go.

475
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,826
He must be getting pretty used
to whores by now.
Goddamn you!

476
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:56,166
What?

477
00:39:58,034 --> 00:40:01,624
I think you're forgetting
about our deal.

478
00:40:04,032 --> 00:40:06,758
Why did Giorgio go to Mexico?

479
00:40:12,729 --> 00:40:16,659
He went to finish doing
some business with Ramirez...

480
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:22,020
Pay him off and the cop
they got for security.

481
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:26,022
I got to go.

482
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,848
We're quits now, right?

483
00:40:34,686 --> 00:40:34,947
We're quits.

484
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,444
That mouthy little cousin
of Strozzi's, Giorgio...

485
00:40:41,717 --> 00:40:41,922
That mouthy little cousin
of Strozzi's, Giorgio...

486
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:46,105
is on his way down
to Mexico right now...

487
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:47,442
to see a friend of yours,
a fella named Ramirez.

488
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:51,137
You know a guy named Ramirez?

489
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:56,135
How do you like the story
so far?

490
00:40:56,145 --> 00:40:56,955
Good. Keep talking.

491
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:58,475
He's going to see a cop
down there, too.

492
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,700
This cop's responsibility...

493
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:02,706
was security
on this side of the border...

494
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:04,739
so I guess
he's going to get paid, too.

495
00:41:05,341 --> 00:41:05,932
They're probably all planning
their next shipment...

496
00:41:06,574 --> 00:41:07,937
going to use your trucks.

497
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:12,628
I don't want to be pushy...

498
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,964
but this kind
of information's...

499
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,626
a little too valuable
to be giving away.
Giorgio's very important to Strozzi.

500
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:23,465
If something
were to happen to him...

501
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:29,123
it would be very bad
for Strozzi, don't you think?

502
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,696
Take as much as you want.
You work for me now.

503
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:39,460
I'll just take that 2,000
we agreed upon.

504
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:42,616
You work with us,
you work with the winners.

505
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:45,622
Anything else is stupid.

506
00:41:47,024 --> 00:41:49,615
I'll think about it.

507
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:55,453
What the hell
are you holding back for?
I don't play this style!

508
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:08,540
His name's Smith,
at least that's what he says.

509
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,040
This is Hickey.
I told you about him.

510
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,377
Told me all about you.

511
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:21,501
I been hearing about you
all over town, actually.

512
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:24,973
I especially liked
that orphanage story.

513
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,973
They tell you about them kids
burning up like candles?

514
00:42:30,574 --> 00:42:31,869
My favorite part.

515
00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:36,665
You shot some of our guys.

516
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,992
I guess I did,
the ones that deserved it.

517
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:46,125
You got Finn.
He's Doyle's best shooter.

518
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:50,024
I thought you were the best.

519
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,064
No. Just the best looking.

520
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,358
Enough of this bullshit!

521
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:56,826
This game is finished.

522
00:42:57,431 --> 00:43:01,384
We got to talk.

523
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:06,626
I guess you better go talk.

524
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,218
Don't believe everything
you hear.

525
00:43:28,985 --> 00:43:32,381
EI Morado was about 30 miles
across the Rio Grande.

526
00:43:32,983 --> 00:43:38,073
The whole town was celebrating
some saint's day...

527
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:42,612
which meant everybody was
either drunk or working on it.

528
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:46,735
Doyle took my bait...

529
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:48,344
and sent a car due south
the next morning.

530
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,068
You didn't have
to be real smart...

531
00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:53,765
to guess who the passenger was.

532
00:44:52,552 --> 00:44:53,518
No, thanks.

533
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:30,029
Looks to me you're a cop.

534
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,500
You're wearing a gun, right?

535
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:35,294
That's good.

536
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:39,061
Maybe you're the kind of guy...

537
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:43,427
to shoot an unarmed man
in the back.

538
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:49,654
Make your play.

539
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:06,388
We're taking you out of here.

540
00:46:06,457 --> 00:46:08,944
Just don't shoot me.

541
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:10,486
Come on.

542
00:46:31,514 --> 00:46:33,911
She looks like her mother.

543
00:46:34,513 --> 00:46:35,375
It's all right. He's asleep.

544
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:39,804
I parked a couple of miles
from here and walked in.

545
00:46:40,443 --> 00:46:43,704
Why do you come out here?

546
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:47,836
Doyle lets me be alone here.

547
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:53,504
It's the only place
they don't watch me.

548
00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:56,994
Why do you stay with him?

549
00:46:57,604 --> 00:46:58,331
People don't own other people.

550
00:46:58,937 --> 00:47:02,890
A year ago, my husband gambled
with Mr. Doyle.

551
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:07,262
After he lost me,
he went back across the border.

552
00:47:07,832 --> 00:47:09,764
He was ashamed.

553
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,791
When Doyle
took me from my daughter...

554
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:19,794
I went to sleep.

555
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,821
All I had left was to pray.

556
00:47:35,821 --> 00:47:38,752
My fear is my curse.

557
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:43,418
What's yours?

558
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:48,782
I was born without a conscience.

559
00:47:52,882 --> 00:47:53,414
There's a fella here
come to see you.

560
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:56,278
There's a fella here
come to see you.

561
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,276
John Smith,
meet Captain Tom Pickett.

562
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,741
He is the head ranger
here in my district.

563
00:48:03,344 --> 00:48:05,207
He generally
just comes down when...

564
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,866
Shut up, Galt.

565
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:08,737
Sit down, Mr. Smith.

566
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:17,897
Mr. Smith and I
are going to have a drink.

567
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:21,231
We got a lot
to talk about tonight.
I'm here about a murdered policeman...

568
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:23,534
got himself killed
the other side of the river...

569
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:28,458
in some crummy little
Mexican town.
A few locals killed, too...

570
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:35,131
and a double-dealing comandante
named Ramirez.

571
00:48:35,899 --> 00:48:38,830
But the man
I'm concerned about...

572
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,861
was an American
on the border patrol.

573
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:44,394
He had a family. Well liked
by his brother officers.
I guess he strayed a little bit in some departments...

574
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:49,184
but he was an officer of the law
just the same.

575
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,758
You know anything
about his death, son?

576
00:48:55,491 --> 00:48:56,888
No, I don't think so.

577
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,221
Don't hardly seem possible.

578
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,343
Mr. Galt here says
you're real well-informed...

579
00:49:02,954 --> 00:49:04,886
on what happens around here.

580
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:12,576
I asked if you knew anything
about it, not if you did it.

581
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:14,183
The crime has been solved, son.

582
00:49:14,783 --> 00:49:16,839
Mexican police picked up two
armed drifters from Florida...

583
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:19,414
just across the border,
handed them over to us.

584
00:49:20,015 --> 00:49:24,502
They ain't confessed yet,
but they will.
I just can't get past the idea that maybe...

585
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:32,639
one of these two bootleg gangs
had something to do with it.
I learned a long time ago to trust my instincts.

586
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:38,803
Listen real careful
because here is the point.

587
00:49:39,407 --> 00:49:42,133
Things in this town
are out of control.

588
00:49:42,739 --> 00:49:45,136
Two gangs is just one too many.

589
00:49:45,738 --> 00:49:48,328
I'm not an idealist.
I know a lot of things
that people do are awful low...

590
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:55,827
but that's between them and God.

591
00:49:56,434 --> 00:49:58,399
Do you believe in God?

592
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,855
I believe in God.

593
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:05,987
But what I'm concerned with
is keeping a lid on things...

594
00:50:06,597 --> 00:50:09,993
and what we got here in Jericho
is just way out of hand...

595
00:50:10,595 --> 00:50:13,220
and Sheriff Galt here
can't do much about it, right?
Matter of fact, it might be fair to say...

596
00:50:15,393 --> 00:50:16,120
that he's part of
the problem, right?

597
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:18,350
You been going back and forth
playing both sides...

598
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:21,890
according to Mr. Galt here...

599
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:25,455
making yourself a lot of money
out of all this.
It's over, son.

600
00:50:28,654 --> 00:50:31,380
I'm coming back here in 10 days.
I'm going to bring
about 20 rangers with me.

601
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,178
I will tolerate one gang because
that is the nature of things.

602
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,215
A certain amount of corruption
is inevitable...

603
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:43,872
but if I find two gangs here
when I get back...

604
00:50:44,482 --> 00:50:47,072
then in a couple of hours,
there will be no gangs here.

605
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:52,569
So it's simple.
One gang quits and goes home.

606
00:50:54,845 --> 00:50:57,106
You boys work it out.
I don't give a damn which one.

607
00:50:57,743 --> 00:51:02,696
Just as long as one side leaves
or maybe one side loses.

608
00:51:03,308 --> 00:51:04,830
That's fine, too.

609
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,928
Kill as many as you want...

610
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:08,799
just don't kill
no innocent people around here.

611
00:51:09,438 --> 00:51:11,699
I wouldn't like that.

612
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,059
It's been real nice
talking to you, Captain.

613
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:21,428
Likewise, son.
Only one more thing.

614
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:31,028
When I come back,
if I was you, I'd be gone.

615
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,380
You tell Strozzi
we got his boy Giorgio.

616
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,955
Tell him, he wants him back,
to bring us a hundred thou...

617
00:51:51,556 --> 00:51:53,952
out to the crossing
at the five-mile road.

618
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:55,281
