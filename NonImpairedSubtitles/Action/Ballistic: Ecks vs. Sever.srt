1
00:02:56,054 --> 00:03:00,423
-Good evening, Mrs. Gant.
-What does my husband want now?

2
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:04,958
His plans changed. He's available
to spend time with Michael.

3
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,428
Michael just came home.

4
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,163
He's expecting his son, ma'am.

5
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:19,836
Hello, it's Vinn.
I need to speak to Gant.

6
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:22,143
-Yeah?
-Robert, what are you doing?

7
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:25,249
He flew to Europe.
Five days later, you send him home?

8
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,817
Come on, Michael. Daddy's waiting.

9
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:29,613
-He'll be fine.
-Bye, Mommy.

10
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:33,722
Robert, you bastard.
This wasn't our agreement.

11
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:11,485
-Unit 1, do you copy?
-Let's go, Michael! Come on with me.

12
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:21,762
-Take the flank.
-Got you.

13
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,353
Okay, come on.
Hang on to me, Michael.

14
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:17,658
Stay here, all right?
Stay here and be brave.

15
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,397
Jeremiah Ecks?

16
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:33,297
No, sorry.

17
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,033
That's you, isn't it?

18
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,503
What happened to your head?

19
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,306
Bad haircut.

20
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:46,942
Look, we've been instructed
to bring you in.

21
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,880
I'm not the man you want.

22
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:55,386
Forget this. We'll do it the hard way.

23
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:59,153
-That's not a healthy attitude.
-Neither is yours.

24
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:03,358
-Relax, Addis.
-Yeah, relax. Listen to your partner.

25
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:05,930
This guy's nothing.

26
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:13,533
Who sent you?

27
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:17,705
FBI Assistant Director Julio Martin.

28
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:19,474
Julio.

29
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,162
Hello, Ecks.

30
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:41,729
We need to talk.

31
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:48,278
The answer is no.

32
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,622
I'll need a car here at 3:00.

33
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:05,786
No, make it 2:30. I don't want
to get stuck in this holiday traffic.

34
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,902
Vinn is alive.

35
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:17,031
You're lying.

36
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:20,039
Taken off a cellular sweep.

37
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:23,744
-I saw her die.
-You saw an explosion.

38
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:27,874
-I went to her funeral.
-You saw a closed casket.

39
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,553
-You waited seven years to tell me?
-I'd have told you if I'd known.

40
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:35,926
Where is she?

41
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:40,590
I don't know.

42
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:45,335
-Then why are you here?
-I need you to do a job for me.

43
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:54,341
Where is my wife?

44
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,210
I'm sorry.

45
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:01,784
-I need you to do it...
-Where is she?

46
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:06,181
When the job is done,
I'll give you what I got.

47
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,161
No, you don't want to do this.

48
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,789
I don't have a choice. I have
a situation and you're my only option.

49
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:19,164
I tell you what I know right now,
and you're gone.

50
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,765
I'm gone anyway.

51
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:33,278
Sit in the corner.
You'll provoke him when he returns.

52
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:28,636
You'll be joining an FBI
transnational special task force.

53
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:39,210
Make it 2:30. I don't want
to get stuck in this holiday traffic.

54
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:24,090
You were supposed to protect my son.

55
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:26,596
She took us by surprise.

56
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:30,223
How do I explain that to my wife?

57
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:38,333
In more noble times...

58
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:42,146
...when a knight failed his king...

59
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:44,713
...he fell on his sword.

60
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,713
Sir?

61
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:51,886
Do the honorable thing, Agent Curtis.

62
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,295
Take the gun.

63
00:12:13,978 --> 00:12:16,469
Put it against your head.

64
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:25,549
Pull the trigger.

65
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:31,394
Now.

66
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:46,403
How much time do we have?

67
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:49,774
Based on our tests,
we have 28 hours left.

68
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:52,443
Then my son dies.

69
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:58,285
Do whatever it takes, Ross.
Get me Michael.

70
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:02,857
You know who we're up against.
You know what she wants.

71
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:08,459
Well, I can't give it to her, now can I?

72
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:42,192
On the left is A.J. Ross. His team
arrived in Vancouver five hours ago.

73
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:47,031
-His nickname: Prince of Darkness.
-lf you know so much, just pick him up.

74
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:53,235
I don't want him. I want the man
he works for, Robert Gant.

75
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,742
Robert Gant?

76
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:58,813
Intel is purposely limited.
But a shadow government...

77
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:03,181
...in the name of national security
is still a shadow government.

78
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:09,416
This is Gant's latest acquisition.
Code name "SoftKill."

79
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,926
He's been trying
to build a perfect assassin.

80
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:16,260
But he's never been able to lick
the one thing that got in his way.

81
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:18,664
The human factor.

82
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:23,432
For Gant, emotions are a liability.
A machine would solve that problem.

83
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:29,137
He could give a head of state a heart attack
or an aneurysm. Totally undetectable.

84
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:34,012
-It's the future of his business.
-Looks like he licked the problem.

85
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,653
More like he stole it.

86
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:39,813
A prototype was developed
at a facility in Berlin.

87
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:44,860
Last week, the place was torched.
The media called it an accident.

88
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:48,393
Ross just happened to be there.

89
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,556
And the prototype?

90
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:54,569
We thermoscanned Ross and his men
before they boarded their plane.

91
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:57,105
All clean. No sign of the prototype.

92
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,972
-Thank you, Louise.
-It all checked out until last night.

93
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:06,515
-Ecks, this is Special Agent Harry Lee.
-We pulled that from a traffic cam.

94
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:10,780
This woman single-handedly took out
an armed DIA escort detail...

95
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,389
...and kidnapped a young boy.

96
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,326
Gant's son.

97
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:21,556
Based on Ross being here,
yes, we think so.

98
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:28,734
Obviously a professional.

99
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,432
-Is she ours or theirs?
-No idea.

100
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:36,235
My money pegs her as disaffected DIA.

101
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:41,577
-Profiles, photos, anything?
-Just that.

102
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,052
If she's DIA, she's orphan class,
out of China.

103
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:51,728
-Orphan class?
-Chinese have this rule:

104
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:53,591
One child per family.

105
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,499
All families want a boy.

106
00:15:57,001 --> 00:16:00,437
The DIA secretly adopts
some of these girls.

107
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:03,733
They're weaned on violence.
Trained to do nothing...

108
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:08,971
...but kill in a thousand ways.
No fear. No conscience. No morality.

109
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:11,941
Exactly what Gant wants
in an employee.

110
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:16,212
Whoever she is,
she's obviously pissed off at him.

111
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:20,657
That's why I need you to find her.

112
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:23,994
Of course you do.

113
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:32,088
Is that why they call you "X"?

114
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:35,024
I'm on a diet.

115
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,300
That's my wife and my daughter.

116
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,872
Her name's Mali.

117
00:17:57,855 --> 00:17:59,652
Do you love her?

118
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:01,983
Of course.

119
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:05,995
Then get out of this business.

120
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:26,215
Gun team, disable target
on my command.

121
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:29,251
Don't cancel.
We need her alive. Acknowledge.

122
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,581
-Roger that.
-Affirmative.

123
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,021
-Is the target aware?
-No, sir.

124
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:39,651
-Is her back to you?
-Affirmative. Positive visual.

125
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:41,626
We got her too.

126
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:50,973
Freeze.

127
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:56,608
-She's got a gun!
-Get down!

128
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:04,121
Close One is not responding.

129
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:06,882
I've lost her. Too much motion.
You have her?

130
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,525
Negative. Please advise.

131
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:12,424
Call in the local P.D.
We'll use them for cover.

132
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,740
-Target clear.
-Why is she standing there?

133
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,343
She knows you won't kill her.
Pin her down!

134
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:30,912
The local P.D. has been alerted.
They're coming in.

135
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,363
Move! Move!

136
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,407
-Gun team, do you see her?
-Negative.

137
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:05,307
Do not let her breach the perimeter.

138
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,468
Jesus!

139
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:39,742
Do not cancel target.
Keep her contained.

140
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,747
Where's my tactical team?

141
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:01,661
Run.

142
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:03,930
Don't shoot!

143
00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:10,943
Sniper One, what are you waiting for?
Disable target!

144
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:31,234
All units, shots fired.
Suspect is female. vancouver Library.

145
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:33,495
That's her.

146
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,662
-Julio?
-We heard. We're on it.

147
00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:38,006
Tracking target.

148
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:15,443
All right, let's move it!

149
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,075
Get her!

150
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:45,297
-We lost contact with our tactical unit.
-Who's manning the assault vehicle?

151
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:51,312
Shit!

152
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:54,775
Get out of here!

153
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:08,954
Get down!

154
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:17,399
Cover me! Cover me!

155
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,964
Stay back please, sir.

156
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:24,396
You shouldn't be here.

157
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:27,203
Somebody get too much foam
in their latte?

158
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:29,812
-I'm in no mood.
-That makes two of us.

159
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,610
I know about that job you pulled
in Berlin. You're getting sloppy.

160
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:39,117
Enjoy your stay in Vancouver.

161
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:00,243
Who's the woman?

162
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:04,339
Somebody your boss pushed too far?

163
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:07,981
Stay out of this.
This is an issue of national security.

164
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:09,779
You mean job security?

165
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:14,146
Wouldn't want to be you
when Gant sees this mess.

166
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,028
You're sweating.

167
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,100
It's been raining.

168
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:35,439
Be smart. Walk away.

169
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:41,375
Julio?

170
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:44,145
Yeah.

171
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:46,655
Take your people out of here.

172
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:51,621
-What is it?
-A feeling. Get them out. Now.

173
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:55,629
-What the hell are you talking about?
-She will retaliate.

174
00:25:56,867 --> 00:26:00,234
We're covered.
A curtain call here would be suicide.

175
00:26:00,404 --> 00:26:02,065
You're wrong.

176
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:05,603
-How can you be sure?
-Trust me.

177
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:08,603
She's not done yet.

178
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:21,223
Down! Get down!

179
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:23,449
Julio!

180
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:26,924
She knows.
She knows where your wife is.

181
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,025
Martin is down!

182
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:38,030
Paramedic! Paramedic!
Over here!

183
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:45,108
Come on, baby. Come on.

184
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:46,909
Yeah.

185
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:51,446
Hey, beautiful! What...

186
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,753
My nose!

187
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:04,527
-I think it's broken.
-Let me see.

188
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:07,295
-Where is she?
-I didn't touch her.

189
00:27:51,415 --> 00:27:54,213
Mobile Unit One on-site.
Situation out of hand.

190
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:57,080
Suggest the locals take this one.

191
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,296
Bitch.

192
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:23,072
Head for the highest vantage point.

193
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:26,614
They're on foot.
They can't be hard to spot.

194
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:05,279
Drop your weapon!

195
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:15,857
You kill me, you kill Gant's son.

196
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:18,524
I don't work for Gant.

197
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:20,930
I just want my wife.

198
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,499
Shit!

199
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,081
I'm okay.

200
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:38,447
The bullet hit my vest.

201
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:43,991
Ross, do you have my son yet?

202
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:47,722
We've sighted our target.
No word on the package.

203
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:50,025
We may have another problem.

204
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:01,974
Where is my wife?

205
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:05,506
Where is she?

206
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:23,963
What's your hurry?

207
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:51,517
Chase One,
we have your hot target locked.

208
00:30:51,695 --> 00:30:54,459
Our new player might do the job
for us. Advise.

209
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:56,656
Don't let them cancel each other.

210
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:08,104
Roger that.
Going green for a quarantine.

211
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,927
Target's on the move,
over north side of building.

212
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:14,776
It's not polite to stare.

213
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:20,782
I see you've met Mali.

214
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,884
Come here, sweetie.

215
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:26,510
How you doing? What's up?

216
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:34,759
Go find Mom.

217
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:45,896
So my daughter wanted to know
why you look so sad.

218
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:50,876
I told her it's because
you just got beat up by a girl.

219
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:03,757
You know, Ecks,
Martin didn't want to do it.

220
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:09,553
Use your wife as bait to get you back
in the game. But he had no choice.

221
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,796
How is he?

222
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:21,510
Not bad, considering. Bullet missed
his heart by about a centimeter.

223
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,104
She doesn't miss.

224
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,281
What are you saying?

225
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:30,307
Nothing.

226
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,351
Could you give me a laptop...

227
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:37,515
-...and Julio's notes on this case?
-I thought you might say that.

228
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,831
Let me see your hand.

229
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:02,530
Who's running the task force now?

230
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:06,663
Nobody. We're suspended
pending an inquiry.

231
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:10,840
Which means I probably
shouldn't watch you do this.

232
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,379
-You're not even here.
-Right.

233
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,327
Sever.

234
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,624
Freeze! Get your hands
above your head!

235
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,788
Oh, man.

236
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:42,903
You're under arrest for the shooting
of Agent Julio Martin.

237
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:55,512
We have her online, sir.

238
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:57,811
Put her through.

239
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:04,488
-Where's my son, Sever?
-Maybe the same place my son is.

240
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:09,423
Don't blame me. You broke profile.

241
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,362
Is that what you call having a child?

242
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:15,002
They weren't supposed
to be there.

243
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:34,956
Sever?

244
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:37,152
Sever?

245
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:42,863
-How's Michael?
-Fine.

246
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:46,058
He's a good boy.

247
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,498
But he misses his mother.

248
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:55,134
-I want him back.
-You mean you want what he's carrying.

249
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,608
He could die
if we don't get it out.

250
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:03,081
I didn't put it in him. You did.
Tell that to your wife.

251
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,647
What do you want?

252
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:09,890
Your life for Michael's.

253
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:16,059
-It didn't have to come to this, Sever.
-Well, now it has.

254
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:30,575
You pulled his file?

255
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:34,807
Yes, sir. Here's the printout.

256
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:41,922
Sever still has Gant's kid.

257
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,585
I don't know what
you're talking about.

258
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:53,697
You better pay attention because
she won't stop until she gets him.

259
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:56,197
I can find her...

260
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:58,566
...bring back the kid.

261
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,040
Sever is DIA.
She knows all your tricks.

262
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,440
She doesn't know mine.

263
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:09,243
We can handle this.

264
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,751
You're certainly doing a great job of it.

265
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:15,116
Why do you care?

266
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,726
That's my business.

267
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:32,032
-Yes.
-The local P.D. has our man.

268
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:37,304
-ID?
-Former FBI agent named Jeremiah Ecks.

269
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:40,941
Get rid of him.

270
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:48,287
Sorry, Ecks, you're a local matter.

271
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:51,255
-We're done here.
-You're making a mistake.

272
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,319
She's gonna kill you.

273
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:57,729
Captain, this isn't my jurisdiction...

274
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,529
...but I suggest you take him away
before I make it my jurisdiction.

275
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:08,074
Good luck.

276
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:40,832
-Is he alive?
-Yes, I'm sure of it.

277
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,773
-Why do they want Michael?
-I don't know.

278
00:09:43,945 --> 00:09:46,277
-You're lying.
-I swear.

279
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:49,906
-Do they want money?
-I don't know.

280
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:56,481
This should have never happened.
Michael should have been home with me.

281
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:59,884
I'm doing everything I can to find him.

282
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:04,864
-What are you doing exactly?
-You know I can't divulge details.

283
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,200
-Of course.
-I'm sorry.

284
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:11,071
You promised me
this wouldn't happen.

285
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:14,572
You think I haven't tried
to keep that promise?

286
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,802
Just find him.

287
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,959
Mobile Two has visual of target.

288
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:37,427
Shit!

289
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,558
You wanted your wife?

290
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:16,802
You'll find her with Gant.

291
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,559
We need to talk.

292
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,710
-We're running out of options.
-Ecks is mobile. Sever helped him escape.

293
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:13,817
What the hell does she want with him?

294
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:17,697
Can I ask why this man
is so dangerous?

295
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,291
No.

296
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:27,468
What did you find out?

297
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,102
They're still looking.

298
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:34,677
You needed to lock
yourself in the study for that?

299
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,646
You know how it works.

300
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,180
-I'll take care of it.
-Why is this person trying to hurt us?

301
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:45,758
-What did you do to him?
-Her.

302
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:49,829
-She used to work for me.
-Oh, God. God, no.

303
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:52,228
She won't hurt Michael.

304
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,528
-How can you be so sure?
-Trust me.

305
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:00,837
I need you to be strong.

306
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:03,034
Then leave.

307
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:08,377
-Where are you going?
-Out.

308
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:15,151
How much time do we have?

309
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:17,587
Less than 1 2 hours.

310
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:47,820
Thank you.

311
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:17,868
Hello, Vinn.

312
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:23,774
Jeremy?

313
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:39,663
What's going on, Jeremy?

314
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:44,901
I am taking a deep cover assignment.

315
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:53,409
Baby...

316
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:57,149
...please don't take this one.

317
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:01,647
I wish I didn't have to.

318
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,514
Then don't.

319
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:05,955
Quit.

320
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:13,628
This is my job.

321
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,826
This is what I do.

322
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:33,782
Why did this have to happen to us?

323
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:41,688
It's a means to an end.

324
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:48,827
Gant had an agenda.

325
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:55,842
Me, he had to get rid of, and you...
Well, you he wanted.

326
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:58,977
And so he took you.

327
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:05,610
I know, I know. I'm late.

328
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:08,351
I know he loved me...

329
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:11,218
...but I only became his wife...

330
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:13,292
...in name.

331
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:20,090
You're the one that I love.
I never stopped loving you.

332
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:22,668
You had a son with him.

333
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:27,339
No. Not with him.

334
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:35,974
Michael?

335
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:43,679
I knew that day in the restaurant.

336
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,448
I wanted to tell you.

337
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,324
I wanted you to stay, but I didn't
want you to worry about me...

338
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:52,733
...about us.

339
00:22:56,637 --> 00:23:01,301
He's our son. Yours and mine.

340
00:23:03,277 --> 00:23:07,543
He was the only piece of you
I had left.

341
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:27,330
Oh, God, no!

342
00:23:27,802 --> 00:23:30,635
Jeremy!

343
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,461
I thought that staying with Gant...

344
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,064
...was the only way to protect Michael.

345
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,463
But I was wrong.

346
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:03,603
Michael.

347
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:07,503
Hey, listen to me.

348
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:10,906
I found you.

349
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:14,243
We'll find him.

350
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:21,120
What do we do now?

351
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:27,756
Run.

352
00:24:55,856 --> 00:25:00,691
-Is that the bitch who stole our son?
-I see you found your wife.

353
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:06,424
-Where is Michael?
-Your son?

354
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,465
Yes, my son.

355
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:22,482
Get in.

356
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,978
And by the way...

357
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:28,883
...l'm the bitch protecting him.

358
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,503
Air One to Command,
we have target in sight.

359
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,150
How do you know about Michael?

360
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:14,863
Prison bus. I could have been killed.

361
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,495
But you weren't.

362
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:25,434
-You do know we have company.
-Of course.

363
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:29,939
Of course.

364
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,325
Air One to Command.

365
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:18,363
Target's destination is the south end
of victoria Park.

366
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:29,276
He's up there.

367
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:40,683
Michael?

368
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:43,322
Mommy!

369
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:46,983
Sweetie.

370
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:51,261
Where were you, Mom?

371
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:55,962
Are you okay?

372
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:57,626
Thank God.

373
00:27:57,805 --> 00:28:00,433
I was so worried about you.

374
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,603
I missed you so much.

375
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:08,942
I missed you too, Mommy.

376
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:12,116
I wasn't even scared.

377
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,252
You weren't?

378
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:18,222
Who's that man?

379
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,093
Come on.

380
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,362
Hello.

381
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,899
I am Jeremy.

382
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:34,267
You're Michael, right?

383
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:53,855
Go.

384
00:28:57,865 --> 00:29:01,028
You'll be safer up there until this is over.

385
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:33,124
Where do you get all this ordnance?

386
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:36,701
Some women buy shoes.

387
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:39,702
Sweet.

388
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:18,835
-All teams are in position.
-They move on my order.

389
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:22,908
-What about your wife and son?
-Ecks will protect them.

390
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:25,340
And Sever?

391
00:31:25,512 --> 00:31:30,313
She's been mourning her family
long enough. Let's reunite them.

392
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:38,990
Sir, with all due respect, that's
an unacceptable level of exposure.

393
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:43,886
Let's see. You lost my son.
You just lost my wife.

394
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:46,464
You think I've lost my mind too?

395
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:50,660
I didn't set this in play.
You did. I warned you of the risks.

396
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:56,299
Your job is to fix my messes.
It should never have gotten this far.

397
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:01,337
Let's get this over with.

398
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:03,506
Gant.

399
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:07,514
Sever.

400
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:11,320
This doesn't have to get messy.
I just want you.

401
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:15,826
I make you the same offer.
Send out what belongs to me.

402
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:18,464
Then we can discuss your reinsertion.

403
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:21,032
It's a little late for that.

404
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:25,168
-It's never too late.
-Tell that to Vinn.

405
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:34,206
I can upgrade your status.
Allow you the luxury of a family.

406
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:36,349
I had a family.

407
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:41,045
You know who we are, Sever.
Targets and objectives come first.

408
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,189
This is the way our world is.

409
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,916
They were innocent.

410
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:52,054
There are no innocent people.
You know that. Only killers and victims.

411
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:54,257
-Take her out.
-Yes, sir.

412
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,737
Go.

413
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:50,479
My turn.

414
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:30,156
Get down!

415
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:45,439
Go.

416
00:34:45,612 --> 00:34:48,604
Move out! Go!

417
00:34:51,818 --> 00:34:55,754
-Moving in!
-Go, go, go!

418
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,764
Give me that.

419
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:58,577
Let's finish this.

420
00:38:04,444 --> 00:38:06,036
Shit.

421
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:15,146
Hello, Jeremiah.

422
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,546
Agent Clark.

423
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,884
It's been a long time.

424
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,028
Why?

425
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,263
Come on. You should know by now.

426
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,798
We had to get rid of Agent Clark...

427
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,804
...so there could be a Robert Gant.

428
00:39:40,974 --> 00:39:45,138
So you rise from the ashes with
a license to do whatever you want.

429
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,139
Power and profit. It's what we do.

430
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:54,646
Where are my wife and son?

431
00:39:55,488 --> 00:39:59,356
Last time I checked,
they were not yours.

432
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:05,557
Come on, Jeremiah.

433
00:40:05,732 --> 00:40:10,192
I'd hate for either of them
to get hurt in the middle of this.

434
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,162
You're standing pretty close...

435
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:16,070
...Gant.

436
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:22,145
What if I decided to lift my foot right now?

437
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:29,412
I guarantee you won't walk away
from this one.

438
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,559
Run!

439
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,051
-Make sure he's dead.
-Yes, sir.

440
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:11,783
-Ross.
-Sever.

441
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:57,283
Just like old times.

442
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:11,297
One big happy family.
Right, Sever?

443
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:42,050
Hello, my love.

444
00:46:44,931 --> 00:46:46,558
-Robert.
-Are you okay?

445
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:50,032
-What do you want?
-I've come for my family.

446
00:46:50,203 --> 00:46:55,004
-Just stay away from us, okay?
-Why would I ever stay away from you?

447
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,035
Are you okay, Michael?

448
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,512
Have you been taking care of Mommy?

449
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:04,611
Yes.

450
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:06,708
Look at this.

451
00:47:09,422 --> 00:47:13,051
-Look what I got for you.
-What are you doing?

452
00:47:14,327 --> 00:47:18,024
-Give me your hand.
-Robert, no.

453
00:47:18,197 --> 00:47:20,165
Gant.

454
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:26,031
You're still here.

455
00:47:27,073 --> 00:47:29,667
He was about to do something
to Michael.

456
00:47:29,842 --> 00:47:33,107
No. It was never about Michael.

457
00:47:33,646 --> 00:47:37,548
-Of course it's about Michael.
-What are you talking about?

458
00:47:37,717 --> 00:47:43,121
A piece of hardware Gant wants.

459
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:46,080
He stole it in Berlin.

460
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:50,121
Used Michael to carry it
across the border.

461
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,631
You used my son?

462
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,735
You sick son of a bitch.

463
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:04,769
Come here, Michael.

464
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:07,775
It's okay.

465
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:14,116
Give me your hand.

466
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:18,949
That's a good boy.

467
00:48:28,468 --> 00:48:31,869
It's not here.

468
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,436
Come here, sweetie.

469
00:48:35,908 --> 00:48:37,341
Where is it?

470
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,603
Where is it?

471
00:48:42,982 --> 00:48:45,075
Ask her.

472
00:48:59,499 --> 00:49:02,024
She's gonna kill you.

473
00:49:04,203 --> 00:49:05,465
Good luck.

474
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:37,601
All that training.
Is that the best you can do?

475
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:40,205
No.

476
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:43,509
This is.

477
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:31,755
-Let's go, let's go. Move it.
-Get that fire knocked down!

478
00:51:00,286 --> 00:51:03,278
They weren't kidding about you.

479
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,423
I can't take credit for this.

480
00:51:06,592 --> 00:51:08,924
Where's our mysterious killer?

481
00:51:09,095 --> 00:51:12,326
-She's not a killer.
-Then what is she?

482
00:51:12,498 --> 00:51:14,693
A mother.

483
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,801
Okay, then where is she?

484
00:51:55,508 --> 00:51:57,408
Thank you.

485
00:51:59,879 --> 00:52:02,712
Take care of your family.

486
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:10,148
I will.

487
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,194
