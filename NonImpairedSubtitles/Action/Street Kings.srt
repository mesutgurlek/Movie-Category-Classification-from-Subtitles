314
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,677
It writes itself.

315
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,189
- I was just gonna break his jaw.
- That's a good answer.

316
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,556
I gave you a direct order,
stay away from him.

317
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,598
Give me your goddamn burner now.

318
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,397
Give me your goddamn burner!

319
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,433
We know you don't give a shit about
yourself, Lud. That's pretty obvious.

320
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,601
But you gotta think about the unit.

321
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,145
- You really fucked us on this one.
- Clady.

322
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,646
- Give me a minute, please.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,752
I can't afford to lose you.

324
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,150
Who'd do what you do?

325
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,258
You are the tip of the fucking spear.

326
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,029
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

327
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,773
Maybe

328
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,943
the clerk

329
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:34,006
forgot to put the disc
in the recorder today.

330
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:43,517
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom,
and you rendered aid to Washington.

331
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,100
I'll go outside.

332
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,698
Make some calls.

333
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,437
And maybe,

334
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,710
this won't be here

335
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,149
when I get back.

336
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,367
TOM: He was my partner back in the day.

337
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,465
We were black and white in a black
and white when it was still a big deal.

338
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:10,403
White cops wouldn't back us 'cause of him
and the black cops 'cause of me.

339
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,116
Fuck them.

340
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,017
We made it.

341
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,117
Sorry. You tried to save him.
You did your best.

342
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,656
My best?
I was curled up in a ball while he got shot.

343
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,795
We should have dumped those guys.

344
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:29,424
How can they just wave a pen
and change what happens just like that?

345
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,526
We're the police.
We can do whatever the hell we want.

346
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,364
Doesn't matter what happens.
It's how we write it up.

347
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,964
What about the truth?

348
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,274
What about it?

349
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,147
You have to honor him, your friend.

350
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,877
"Honor him"?

351
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,954
I was going to knock him out
and he thought I was going to kill him.

352
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,077
Prick.

353
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,986
Don't turn your back on him.

354
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,488
Good can come from bad.

355
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,593
In my world, the real world,

356
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,793
the bad breeds more bad, Grace.

357
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:17,579
See this? It's done. It's over.
It's taken care of. All right?

358
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,086
I won't give you another dose here,

359
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,750
but got a set of blues in your locker?

360
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,855
- No.
- Here's the thing.

361
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,428
- I gotta bury you.
- Not that.

362
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:36,523
In a nice, politically correct spot until this
Washington thing settles down a little bit.

363
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:37,692
No, Jack.

364
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:38,002
SUPERVISOR: Your job is to conduct
preliminary interviews of the complainant.

365
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,563
SUPERVISOR: Your job is to conduct
preliminary interviews of the complainant.

366
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,543
If there's a specific allegation
against an officer,

367
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,170
write it up, forward it to Internal Affairs.

368
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,377
Now, the temptation is to be
a good brother cop.

369
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,685
Don't be. None of this shit's
going anywhere anyway.

370
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,091
There's your desk.

371
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,696
Suppose I get a complaint against myself?

372
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,064
(CHUCKLES)

373
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,730
Write it up and forward it. Okay?

374
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,094
- Okay.
- Okay.

375
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,911
You have a complaint?

376
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,452
Motherfucker beat my ass like I was
Rodney King, man.

377
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,316
Except there wasn't no video.

378
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,116
Dude looked just like you.

379
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,646
But black.

380
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:38,593
This ass been working longer than all
y'all cops disrespecting me.

381
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,893
He pulled me out of my ride, homes,
disrespected me in front of my old lady.

382
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,298
Tried to get her number and shit.

383
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,370
You get his badge number
or see his nametag?

384
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,201
Not with his boot on my throat
and his partner kicking me.

385
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,296
No, it was a little bit difficult.

386
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,171
Everybody comes here,
they have a complaint.

387
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,211
They sit down.
I done waited for my fucking five hours

388
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,904
and you gonna ask me,
do I have a complaint?

389
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,914
Obviously, I have a complaint.

390
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,773
You know what? This is some bullshit.

391
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,317
That's why I hate
all these motherfucking cops.

392
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,886
Fuck all y'all!

393
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,532
Wander has got a sense of humor,
I'll give him that.

394
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,123
You have a complaint?

395
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,235
Where to begin?

396
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,272
The black band.

397
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,239
Man down. Hurts, right?

398
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,045
Losing a colleague. Brother in blue.

399
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,275
I'm sorry he's gone, sir.

400
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,912
You two worked Vice Special together.
Pushed a black and white in Southend.

401
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,750
Phonebook Tom,

402
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,517
the last of the ghetto gunfighters.

403
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,291
I heard you got your best confession
with a '91 directory.

404
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,160
You know Washington was holding
the asshole down.

405
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,958
Is this an interview?

406
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,502
Just a little back and forth.

407
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:57,404
Well, Captain, I'm not much of a dancer,
so if there's something you'd like to ask...

408
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,810
Want to go and get some lunch, Tom?

409
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,506
This is the interview.

410
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:07,642
Regarding yesterday's incident,
you were the first on scene, correct?

411
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,078
Yes, sir.

412
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,283
- Three shooters, right?
- Two. Read the report.

413
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,986
What would you say if I told you
the pathologist recovered

414
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,030
three different calibers
from Terrence Washington's body?

415
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,091
Sounds like three shooters to me.

416
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,036
What were you doing there, Tom?

417
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,110
Come on, man to man. Tape's off.

418
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,647
Damn it!

419
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,547
It doesn't bother you that
there are two cop killers out there?

420
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,983
Living, laughing, fucking?
It doesn't bother you, Tom?

421
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,520
Yes, it bothers me!

422
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,850
So, why'd you let them
get away, gunfighter?

423
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,360
Hey, let's get something straight, Captain,
nobody's getting away.

424
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,828
What happened to the video
from the store?

425
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,331
What video?

426
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,229
Listen to me. Every time you shit the bed,

427
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,671
Wander's there to change the sheets.
Well, not anymore, son.

428
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,709
I'm going to pour gas on you,

429
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,973
I'm going to pour gas on Wander
and everyone in Vice Special.

430
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,277
Then I'm lighting the match
and I'm gonna burn all of you.

431
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,576
I tried to save you, Detective Ludlow.

432
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,018
Your window's closed.

433
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:22,491
And that third shooter?
He's mine, so help me God.

434
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,628
WANDER: Get back in your office!

435
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,964
<i>- WOMAN: Captain, you there?</i>
- I'll call you back.

436
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,765
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

437
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,503
What the fuck are you doing
jamming my people at lunch?

438
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,375
If you got a problem with Ludlow,
you come to me.

439
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,608
You keep your dog on a leash.

440
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,283
Everybody knows
he can't make a move without you.

441
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,444
You go cry to Daddy?

442
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,919
Stop right there.

443
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:52,919
Stop.

444
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,257
Tom is a damn fine cop.

445
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,729
He bleeds blue.

446
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,367
You got an open case on him?

447
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,232
Vice Special?

448
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,594
You got one on me?

449
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,899
You formally investigating us?

450
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,810
This is a fishing expedition.

451
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,912
Because you know if you went to the Chief
and you asked him

452
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,280
to open a case on me
or anybody in my unit,

453
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,875
he would laugh you out of his office.

454
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,182
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

455
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,383
I have watched you intimidate,
bully and blackmail

456
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,688
your way up through the pay grades
for 20 plus years.

457
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,854
I know exactly what you are.

458
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,762
You've got no business being
a commander.

459
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,629
You like Tom, don't you?

460
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,767
I saw the way you watched him
when he came in.

461
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,335
That's why you follow him around,
you want him to give you a blow job.

462
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,146
Like that hooker I caught you with
when we were sergeants.

463
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,741
- You remember?
- Shut up, Jack.

464
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:59,289
Does your wife know that
you use prostitutes, Jimmy?

465
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,089
It was the best head I ever had.

466
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,457
And what about you, Jack?

467
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,862
You always found it hard to keep
your prick out of the ghetto.

468
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:12,993
It's a two-way street, buddy.
You can't ride the tiger forever.

469
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,529
Now get the hell out of my office.

470

whose weapon is already drawn,
empties his clip into him.

No, I did not know that.
