1
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:46,678
There is not one universe. There are many.

2
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,848
A Multiverse.

3
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,557
We have the technology
to travel between universes...

4
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,856
...but travel is highly restricted
and policed.

5
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:01,135
There is not one you. There are many.

6
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:05,866
Each of us exists in present time,
in parallel universes.

7
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:09,473
There was balance in the system...

8
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:13,810
...but now a force exists
who seeks to destroy the balance...

9
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:16,816
...so he can become The One.

10
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:18,510
President Gore addressed Congress today
where he outlined the White House plan....

11
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:29,089
Here they come, man.
They're going to take you on out.

12
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:32,715
You're dead, LawIess! You're dead!
Ain't payback a bitch?

13
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:35,491
Die, LawIess, you piece of shit!

14
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,591
Die Iike aII my boys you took out!

15
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,420
I know they're going to kiII you upstate...

16
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,661
...but no one's getting you on my watch,
so don't sweat, LawIess.

17
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,664
You want that thumb?

18
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,830
Let's move him out of here.

19
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:24,308
I want to hear you scream, LawIess.
Come on, scream for me.

20
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,113
Going to get you, asshoIe!

21
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:40,922
Yeah, waIk the waIk!

22
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:48,734
You piece of shit! You're a dead man!

23
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,790
Something's wrong.

24
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,669
Prisoner down!

25
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,866
Up there!

26
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:40,187
HoId your fire! Cease fire!

27
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:53,597
Woo, Scott, foIIow me!

28
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:10,114
Razor wire shouId have kept anyone out,
Iet aIone moving fast.

29
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:13,109
There's no bIood.

30
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:56,819
HoIy shit! He's doing 50!

31
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:36,730
Adam 13 in pursuit ofsuspect
headed west, Third and Olympic.

32
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:39,925
Request assistance
from 2 David air unit. Over.

33
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,264
Roger that.
Air 14 en route to Third and Olympic.

34
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,033
He's going to the hoIe.

35
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:50,536
We have to get there,
override him before he jumps.

36
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:52,936
Give me the go-ahead. He'II never make it.

37
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,237
Check fire. Stick to procedure, Funsch.

38
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:59,242
You were recruited to apprehend him,
not be his assassin, understand?

39
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,540
I can't hear you. Do you understand?

40
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,341
Loud and cIear.

41
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:07,277
YuIaw! MVA!

42
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:15,354
Loud and cIear, huh?

43
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:47,856
Roedecker! Less than a minute!

44
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,659
Shit!

45
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,370
Hands high!

46
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,437
Thirty seconds, Roedecker.

47
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:03,639
Who the heII is this now?

48
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:08,406
You must be the new guy.
Where is Roedecker?

49
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,215
This is your Iast warning.

50
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,916
Get your hands where I can see them.

51
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,552
Freeze!

52
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,057
You, drop that weapon!

53
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,796
I wiII kiII you.

54
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:28,992
No, you won't.

55
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:30,897
Where is Roedecker?

56
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,543
-Here I am.
-What the....

57
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:49,981
Funsch.

58
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,947
You stick to procedure...

59
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,919
...it aII works out.

60
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:05,230
Victim 117, Yu Fook Law,
Monoceros Universe.

61
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:10,302
Victim 118, Swen Law, Tucana Universe.

62
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:15,199
Victim 119, Ni Dilaw, Canopus Universe.

63
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:20,373
Victim 120, Kia Jilaw, Serpenz Universe.

64
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:25,351
Victim 121, Seth Law, Procyon Universe.

65
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:30,586
Victim 122, Frun Law, Shauwla Universe.

66
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:35,588
Victim 123, Lawless, Anubis Universe.

67
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:10,025
What's the next move?

68
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:12,965
It won't work for you anymore, YuIaw.

69
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:21,565
The shortest distance
between two points...

70
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,410
...wiII aIways be a straight Iine.

71
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:30,581
Your Iine has run out. You don't see that?

72
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,486
There's never been anything
Iike what I have become.

73
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:40,325
You know that.
You were there for my first one.

74
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:44,497
-I wish I'd never Iet there be a second.
-But there was a second.

75
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:46,288
And a third.

76
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,934
And a 123rd.

77
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,234
Why did you come, Harry?

78
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:54,631
You miss me?

79
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:58,609
I missed who you were.

80
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,080
You've been chasing me how many years?

81
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:04,477
Two years.

82
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,651
I just need to do it one more time.

83
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:13,025
There won't be a ''one more time'' for you.

84
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:23,757
Destination:
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.

85
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,204
GabrieI YuIaw.

86
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,983
The peopIes of the MuItiverse
have found you guiIty...

87
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,950
...of 123 counts of first-degree murder...

88
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:54,190
...and 123 counts of unauthorized traveI
to paraIIeI universes...

89
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:57,025
...by use of iIIegaI quantum tunneIing.

90
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,761
For these crimes,
you have been sentenced to Iife...

91
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,462
...without the possibiIity of return...

92
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:07,801
...on the Stygian PenaI CoIony,
in the Hades Universe.

93
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:10,232
May God be with you.

94
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,041
You may make a finaI statement.

95
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,887
The MuItiverse.

96
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:28,361
Every universe in it is irrationaI...

97
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,295
...sIoppy.

98
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:35,161
I just try to make it rationaI.
I just try to make it neat.

99
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:38,862
You caII it murder.

100
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:43,767
How couId I murder myseIf 123 times?

101
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,809
I just took those wasted energies...

102
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:51,983
...and put them into one container: me.

103
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:57,581
It made me faster, smarter, stronger.

104
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:02,459
What if that is our fate?

105
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,224
To unite with our other seIves.

106
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,763
To be unified forever.

107
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:11,764
To be one.

108
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,501
I wiII be The One.

109
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,741
GabrieI YuIaw...

110
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:27,847
...are you ready?

111
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:29,844
Are you?

112
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:08,525
Wormhole opens in five...

113
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:12,463
...four, three, two, one.

114
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:36,517
WormhoIe's shut.

115
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,717
It onIy had a 30-second window.
Now we have to wait.

116
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:42,288
Son of a bitch!

117
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,026
-Permission to speak, sir?
-Speak.

118
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,095
Is this part of the procedure?

119
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,068
We'II get him on the other side.

120
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:56,804
There's onIy one pIace he couId be going.

121
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,825
AIdrich, take these.

122
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,909
President Bush addressed ajointsession
of Congress today...

123
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:43,615
...where he outlined the White House plan
for universal health care.

124
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:52,461
Ronnie, you're dead! You rat!

125
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:55,194
Die, you piece of shit snitch!

126
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,357
You're going to be okay, Ronnie.
You're doing the right thing.

127
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:42,338
-Go, go!
-Dead! Dead!

128
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,076
You snitch! Dead!

129
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,771
Something's wrong.

130
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:11,809
Go, go, go! Get him out! Get him out!

131
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:14,074
Get him in the vehicIe.

132
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,745
Get out, now. Go, go, go.

133
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:21,176
Oh, shit!

134
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:34,990
Cease fire!

135
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,274
Is he soup yet?

136
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,410
-No way he got out of there.
-He's got to be.

137
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:09,632
No!

138
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,898
Get him down! PuII!

139
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,503
One Henry Robert! Code 3!

140
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:21,979
Demand immediate backup
in the deIivery area!

141
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:29,787
Go!

142
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,660
I need a hand over here!

143
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:12,832
Hey, on the bus!

144
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:19,528
He's going OJ!

145
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:21,497
-Get him!
-Let's go, Yates!

146
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,931
Gabe!

147
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,043
Gabe!

148
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,015
You see that?

149
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:12,118
The good news is you're not crazy.

150
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:15,422
The bad news....

151
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:38,978
/ lived here my whole life.

152
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:41,882
And everywhere / look for great memories.

153
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:46,618
Now all / see is Larry and those kids.

154
00:24:59,305 --> 00:25:00,397
Gabe.

155
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:02,200
Oh, my God!

156
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,706
I'm okay.

157
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:07,440
-I'm okay.
-AIdrich said you were in the hospitaI.

158
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:10,142
-Yeah, I was.
-Did they check you out?

159
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:13,845
I checked myseIf. Nothing to check. See?

160
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:19,117
I just need to get myseIf cIear. Hey, OIIie.

161
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:21,716
You were shot. You need to be examined.

162
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,953
You can do it.

163
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:26,055
NewsfIash. I'm a vet.
You don't have paws and a taiI.

164
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:30,095
With aII that's been happening to you,
you need to see someone.

165
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,794
I'm seeing the onIy person I need to see.

166
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:34,030
I'm serious.

167
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,440
We'II go to the hospitaI,
check on Woo, after I'm done.

168
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:48,878
You'II be aII right, man.

169
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,382
-You guys take care of him now.
-Yes, sir.

170
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,988
Gabe? Hey, T.K.

171
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:57,413
How is he?

172
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,824
ExternaI injuries mostIy.
EMT said he's seen a Iot worse.

173
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:04,154
You gave us a bigger scare
just Ieaving the hospitaI Iike that.

174
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:08,827
Your man went deep tonight, T.K.
Don't know how he made it up that waII.

175
00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:13,132
I wouIdn't be here if you guys
didn't make it up right behind me.

176
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:17,069
We never made it up that waII.

177
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:20,540
I didn't make it out
of the goddamn parking Iot.

178
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:24,046
Backup unit reported you down.
We continued pursuit, unsuccessfuI.

179
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:27,448
OnIy you got a good Iook at the suspect.
We need a description.

180
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:33,950
Think it's someone out of Ronnie's posse?
Payback for snitching?

181
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:35,560
It was dark.

182
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:37,755
You have anything? Anything to go on?

183
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:39,124
Sorry.

184
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:43,199
If you remember anything,
we'II be down the haII.

185
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:47,635
Hey, man, I'm gIad you're stiII with us.

186
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:49,204
Thanks.

187
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:54,109
Why did you Iie to them?

188
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:55,978
It was dark.

189
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:59,743
Gabe, it's not the guys. It's me.

190
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,220
It was me.

191
00:28:09,662 --> 00:28:10,856
What?

192
00:28:11,598 --> 00:28:15,090
He wasn't trying to hit Ronnie.
He was aiming at me!

193
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:20,166
Before I saw him, I feIt him.

194
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,465
I feIt me!

195
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,009
It was me.

196
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,972
Maybe the adrenaIine
caused some kind of haIIucination.

197
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:34,751
You were shot. Your memory
couId've been affected by the trauma.

198
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:39,416
Or maybe it's part
of what's been happening to you.

199
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,528
PeopIe get oIder. They don't get stronger.

200
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:45,854
They don't get faster aII of a sudden.

201
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:54,072
Whatever it is, we're here now, right?

202
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:00,841
And if they find something wrong with me?

203
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,208
I don't want to Iose my job.

204
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:08,181
I don't want to Iose you.

205
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:15,686
Mrs. Law,
before we go into the MRI room...

206
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:18,526
...I have some questions to ask you
about your husband.

207
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:21,066
-Does he have a cardiac pacemaker?
-No.

208
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:23,462
-IntracraniaI aneurysm cIip?
-No.

209
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:26,869
Dentures, hearing aid or peniIe impIant?

210
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,875
No, no, and not unIess he had one put in
since this morning.

211
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:06,577
Mr. Law. Right this way.
I have a few forms for you to fiII out.

212
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:10,446
This is a painIess procedure
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

213
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,184
Dressing room's here.
Remove aII your cIothing.

214
00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:14,844
You'II find a gown on a hook.

215
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:19,620
The paperwork's aIready started
so we'II get you in and out in no time.

216
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,193
PIease remove
aII personaI metaIIic objects.

217
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,422
That means no keys, no watches,
no credit cards...

218
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:28,023
...no body piercings, no ceII phones....

219
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:36,003
My gun.

220
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:39,010
-No guns, no jeweIry, no zippers.
-What?

221
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:40,636
The hospitaI has it.

222
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,974
You're going in for an MRI. Gabe?

223
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,913
Remember what I said?

224
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,710
I feeI it again.

225
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,024
When you're done,
we'II go get your things, aII right?

226
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,025
They're not giving her your gun.

227
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:56,591
The guys are downstairs.
They can get the gun.

228
00:30:56,662 --> 00:31:01,224
Even if you did, you're not bringing it here.
That's a powerfuI, precise magnet.

229
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:05,326
AII right.

230
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,068
If you start the MRI, I'II find the guys.

231
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:11,233
Lose the wedding ring.

232
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:16,608
Here. I got it.

233
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:44,439
For Christ's sake, you're getting an MRI,
not a heart transpIant.

234
00:31:56,656 --> 00:32:00,592
Mr. Law, I need you to remain stiII
for three to ten minutes.

235
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,427
You can taIk, but if you move,
we have to start aII over.

236
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:37,793
Hey. Where did you guys go?

237
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:39,826
I took him in for a....

238
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:42,332
Something wrong?
Can I get you something?

239
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,405
No, I have to taIk to the doctor.

240
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:06,089
Mike, I can't take my break
tiII I'm done with this guy.

241
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:08,418
Can you wait haIf an hour?

242
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:13,598
Mr. Law, what are you doing?

243
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,634
Now we have to start over.

244
00:33:16,002 --> 00:33:17,697
Why? What did I do?

245
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
Back away!

246
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:26,772
Thought you were gonna kiII me.

247
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:28,905
Just give me the chance, asshoIe.

248
00:33:31,817 --> 00:33:33,478
Get on your knees sIowIy.

249
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,542
You there?

250
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,155
On the fIoor, right now!

251
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,787
The fIoor?

252
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,552
This is a hospitaI.

253
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:46,226
The fIoor is fuII of germs.
You want me to get sick?

254
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,075
It's gunfire.

255
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:00,342
Let's get security.

256
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:01,638
Gabe.

257
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,652
Get back!

258
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,465
What have you got?

259
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:29,069
Nothing.

260
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:30,608
Not a thing.

261
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:46,087
No! No!

262
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:49,183
Be stiII.

263
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:05,270
Unit 15, weapon fire, south tower!

264
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,471
Fourth floor, /maging Radiology!

265
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:09,013
Gabe is there.

266
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:13,213
-Hands high! Hands high, YuIaw!
-Don't move! Don't move!

267
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,274
Don't move!

268
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:24,062
We aII know if you kiII me,
you have to kiII the other guy.

269
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,731
-Just Iet me take out one Ieg.
-Cuff him.

270
00:35:29,568 --> 00:35:30,660
I'II cover you.

271
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:33,165
Go.

272
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:36,500
Back, get back!

273
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:55,554
-It's Gabe.
-Go! ChanneI 7.

274
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:57,889
Swing the camera. FoIIow him.

275
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:01,165
He cut right at the end of the haII.

276
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:04,902
Don't move! Stay here!

277
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:06,729
Go back to the room.

278
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,457
T.K., you can't go up there!

279
00:36:44,977 --> 00:36:46,376
Which one is he?

280
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:52,946
-I'm okay. I'm aII right.
-Don't move, Gabe! We're here to heIp.

281
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:55,651
-I'm aII right.
-Do you know where you are?

282
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,357
-What's wrong with you?
-Where are you, Gabe?

283
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:03,326
There are three armed men.
They kiIIed a security officer.

284
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,260
-Who are we?
-They went down the haII.

285
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:08,300
-What's my name?
-I was unarmed. I couIdn't go after them.

286
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:10,128
What did you do with the gun?

287
00:37:11,303 --> 00:37:14,067
I don't have one. I asked T.K. to get it.

288
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,967
YuIaw wouIdn't have known that.

289
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,908
This one's safer in their custody.
Let them take him.

290
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:21,003
You need heIp before you hurt yourseIf.

291
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,205
Or anyone eIse.

292
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:25,575
Anyone eIse? Someone tried to kiII me!

293
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:29,178
PIease! I don't want to hurt you guys.

294
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:35,790
Let go of me!

295
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:37,485
I don't want to hurt you.

296
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:42,532
I don't want to hurt you guys.

297
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,120
SettIe back down!

298
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:13,164
He's cIose to YuIaw's strength.

299
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:15,933
Let go! Gabe!

300
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:20,027
It's what I toId you. It's me.

301
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,199
Get home.

302
00:38:27,246 --> 00:38:29,476
We have a probIem here.

303
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:33,082
Yeah, the reaI probIem is
procedure sucks...

304
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:35,044
...sir.

305
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,691
AII right, new procedure.

306
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:46,360
Gabe is yours. I wiII take YuIaw.

307
00:38:46,932 --> 00:38:48,559
How you going to do that?

308
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:50,834
I'II do whatever it takes.

309
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:54,363
Sync up your repeater.

310
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:57,431
Hey, wait a minute.

311
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,401
I've Iived through one of those.

312
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,469
Let me do it.

313
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:04,439
Sync your repeater, Funsch.

314
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:11,616
AII right.

315
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:17,053
When the green Iight turns red
and stays steady and YuIaw is dead....

316
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:18,318
And you.

317
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,096
You know what to do.

318
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,068
Not a probIem.

319
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:38,214
Us spIitting up, you going soIo,
is way out of procedure.

320
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:42,444
So Iisten to me. I know where you're from,
what you've been through...

321
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:44,318
...but this pIace is different.

322
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,954
Not everyone is a combatant.

323
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,727
There are innocent peopIe here, aIso.

324
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:53,620
So if you get into the shit,
you trust your heart...

325
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:55,628
...not your head.

326
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,028
Loud and cIear, sir.

327
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,801
How did that son of a bitch
get out of here?

328
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:12,880
Have you seen that new video,
Mr. Fanny's Been A-Pluggin'? It's hot!

329
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:14,886
Dude, I Iike Janine.

330
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:19,118
But she don't do guys.
That girI-girI stuff gets oId.

331
00:40:19,491 --> 00:40:22,927
Why don't you rent one of those big-ass,
she-maIe tapes, you freak?

332
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:25,494
Shut up!

333
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:35,872
I can't determine occipitaI Iobe sweIIing
without a compIete MRI.

334
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,376
-He was acting schizophrenic.
-Schizophrenia doesn't just kick in.

335
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:43,103
The triggering stressor of being shot
caused a psychotic break.

336
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,642
The Fifth Division is Iooking for him.

337
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,848
They understand he's not himseIf.
They know how to bring him in.

338
00:40:51,156 --> 00:40:52,384
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

339
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:55,120
-Need a doctor?
-No, I'm aII right.

340
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,797
I am not going to Iet
anything happen to him.

341
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,891
If it wasn't for Gabe,
I wouIdn't be in this uniform.

342
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,400
Thanks, Bobby.

343
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:06,204
-Maybe it's best if I go home.
-Good idea.

344
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:09,331
Nothing you can do here,
and he's IikeIy to contact you there.

345
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:12,900
If I hear from him, I'II Iet you know.
If you hear anything, I'II be home.

346
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:14,741
I know. I'm going to take you.

347
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,711
I appreciate it, but I'II be fine.

348
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:21,512
We'II make sure of it. There are four units
on the way to your house. Come on.

349
00:41:39,638 --> 00:41:42,334
-CircIe around. I'II meet you out front.
-AII right.

350
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,533
Just when I find something
I Iike in this universe.

351
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,541
Turn off the radio sIowIy.

352
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,813
Who are you?

353
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:36,811
You're cIose to his strength.
The Iast two years, you've gotten stronger.

354
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:39,722
Haven't jacked any more iron.
Haven't changed your diet.

355
00:43:39,925 --> 00:43:41,222
But you are stronger.

356
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,553
Your mind, too.
Answers come fast without thinking.

357
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,928
Who are you? What did you do to me?

358
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:54,135
Not me. You.
You've done this to yourseIf.

359
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:03,612
Just Iike oId times, eh, buddy?

360
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:05,683
Not exactIy...

361
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:07,511
...buddy.

362
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,411
Put your hands back on the wheeI, YuIaw.

363
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:17,754
Space is shaped Iike this.

364
00:44:17,963 --> 00:44:20,090
You beIieve this is the onIy universe.

365
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:24,167
There's not just one universe,
there's a MuItiverse.

366
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:27,497
Every time a massive star dies
and becomes a bIack hoIe...

367
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:30,071
...a new universe is created.

368
00:44:31,743 --> 00:44:35,941
They've Iearned to forecast
where and when a bIack hoIe wiII occur.

369
00:44:36,148 --> 00:44:38,844
A momentary bridge
between paraIIeI universes.

370
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:40,676
TraveI is restricted.

371
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:44,119
They created an agency
to poIice the MuItiverse.

372
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:46,157
I'm a MuItiverse agent.

373
00:44:46,825 --> 00:44:48,816
You're a nut.

374
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:51,525
You're the one who's been seeing yourseIf.

375
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,093
In this universe, you're you.
In another, you don't exist.

376
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:57,628
In another,
you're married to the same woman.

377
00:44:57,703 --> 00:45:01,070
In another, to a different woman.
In another, you're married to a man.

378
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:05,269
There's an energy, strain, wave,
connecting aII those Iives.

379
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:06,641
We aII have one.

380
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:09,510
The one between you and him
has gotten stronger.

381
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:13,311
You've been feeIing him, haven't you?

382
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:20,290
Harry, nobody's proved
that what I'm doing is a bad thing.

383
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:24,655
You've kiIIed 123 peopIe.
I'd say that was a very bad thing.

384
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:27,198
You don't know what'd happen
if you kiIIed this one.

385
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,860
It couId destroy the system,
but that doesn't matter.

386
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:35,305
I know. Everything must be baIanced.
The party Iine.

387
00:45:35,741 --> 00:45:37,538
What do you think wouId happen?

388
00:45:39,011 --> 00:45:42,344
Some peopIe think you'd expIode,
some peopIe think you'd impIode.

389
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:44,880
You're missing one.

390
00:45:46,885 --> 00:45:49,012
Some peopIe think you'd become a god.

391
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:51,351
That's the one.

392
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:56,617
The man you've been seeing,
the ''you,'' he was an MVA agent.

393
00:46:57,122 --> 00:47:01,923
Once he was forced to defend himseIf
against himseIf in another universe.

394
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:04,093
KiIIed him.

395
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,230
In doing so, part of the other Iife's energy
transferred to him.

396
00:47:09,801 --> 00:47:13,328
Made him stronger.
Made aII of you stronger.

397
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:17,898
Each time he kiIIs one of you,
the energy divides among the survivors.

398
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:20,339
So, I'm next?

399
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:23,574
You're the Iast.

400
00:47:24,082 --> 00:47:26,312
You and him are it.

401
00:48:04,956 --> 00:48:07,049
I don't want any part of this.

402
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:09,721
You don't have a choice.

403
00:48:18,804 --> 00:48:23,104
First choice, give up. Second choice, die.

404
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,837
Third choice.

405
00:48:36,855 --> 00:48:39,153
So, if everything you say is true...

406
00:48:42,327 --> 00:48:43,692
...what happens to me?

407
00:48:45,263 --> 00:48:46,855
Nobody's got aII the answers.

408
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,693
I don't beIieve you. Stay away.

409
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:48,048
I'm aIone now.

410
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:50,586
I'm here to heIp you.

411
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:04,539
Sir, I have to ask you to hoId it right there.

412
00:50:10,081 --> 00:50:11,708
I said freeze, asshoIe!

413
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,088
Don't you peopIe ever Iearn?

414
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:52,280
CIear.

415
00:51:58,456 --> 00:52:00,321
Let them have a Iook first.

416
00:52:00,825 --> 00:52:03,293
I have to do my girI stuff.

417
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,654
Thanks.

418
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,712
TV is on.

419
00:53:04,155 --> 00:53:05,952
Yeah, I Ieft it on.

420
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,260
When I got the caII about Gabe, I just ran.

421
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:12,789
Grabbed my jacket, rushed downstairs.

422
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:14,797
I'II turn it off.

423
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,087
Bobby?

424
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:45,453
I appreciate you being here with me
and I don't want to sound rude, but...

425
00:53:45,864 --> 00:53:47,695
...can I have a IittIe privacy?

426
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,492
Sorry, T.K.

427
00:53:56,174 --> 00:53:57,641
I'II be right outside.

428
00:53:58,009 --> 00:53:59,340
Thanks.

429
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,820
I toId you it's not wasted space.

430
00:54:50,094 --> 00:54:51,721
You aII right?

431
00:54:52,297 --> 00:54:55,391
-I'm afraid.
-Me, too.

432
00:54:57,635 --> 00:54:59,068
Is it safe to come down?

433
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:02,535
No, there are sheriffs aII over.

434
00:55:03,074 --> 00:55:04,268
I need my gun.

435
00:55:05,777 --> 00:55:07,574
I Ieft it at the hospitaI.

436
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,707
I need a weapon.

437
00:55:15,486 --> 00:55:17,113
Yeah, okay.

438
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,879
What's wrong?

439
00:55:54,092 --> 00:55:55,024
Nothing.

440
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,320
They can see inside.
I'm just gonna puII the shade.

441
00:56:22,453 --> 00:56:26,082
Jesus. Did you ever think
when we met that day at the bookstore...

442
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:28,182
...we'd be in this kind of mess?

443
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,863
Even if I knew, I stiII wouId have come in.

444
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:39,700
It wasn't a bookstore.

445
00:56:41,105 --> 00:56:44,165
Just so you know,
I'm going to take that gun...

446
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:47,541
...and kiII you
before you can puII the trigger.

447
00:56:47,712 --> 00:56:51,671
There's nothing you can do
except give it to me.

448
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:18,332
Gabe, drop it!

449
00:57:20,011 --> 00:57:21,205
Drop it now!

450
00:57:24,248 --> 00:57:25,340
Drop it!

451
00:58:01,285 --> 00:58:02,775
Get in!

452
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,664
Hey, knock it off!

453
00:58:22,774 --> 00:58:25,641
-You're acting Iike him.
-I am him!

454
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,868
Without her.

455
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:04,811
My grandfather taught me
the energy of Iife goes in a circIe...

456
00:59:05,016 --> 00:59:07,143
...in a perfect fIow, baIanced.

457
00:59:08,286 --> 00:59:10,777
He said, untiI I find my center...

458
00:59:11,522 --> 00:59:13,717
...my circIe wouId never be whoIe.

459
00:59:15,693 --> 00:59:18,560
That day, I first saw her in the cIinic...

460
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,657
...I came in with a dog
that was hit by a car.

461
00:59:24,735 --> 00:59:27,636
I knew right away she was my center.

462
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:29,800
She made me whoIe.

463
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,435
How do I kiII him?

464
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:50,622
In an hour, there's a forecasted
wormhoIe opening. Three-minute window.

465
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:56,692
He's attuned to your Iife wave.

466
00:59:57,335 --> 01:00:00,896
He'II try to find you, kiII you,
and get back to the hoIe.

467
01:00:01,072 --> 01:00:02,733
That's where we get him.

468
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:05,166
Get him? KiII him!

469
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:06,699
KiII him?

470
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:09,743
You're serious?

471
01:00:19,223 --> 01:00:20,315
My own design.

472
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:22,859
HighIy modified M-590,
hand-portabIe system.

473
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:25,157
Fires 25 smart rounds per second.

474
01:00:25,396 --> 01:00:28,194
MuItipIe tracking modes,
pIus the Iatest countermeasures.

475
01:00:28,299 --> 01:00:33,066
Each round carries an expIosive warhead
with seIectabIe fuse deIays.

476
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:38,074
Tracks, enters, pauses .1 microseconds,
then ''Boom!''

477
01:00:38,242 --> 01:00:40,267
Mixto rojo.

478
01:00:42,146 --> 01:00:44,137
And this is his IittIe brother.

479
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:46,614
Hasn't worked yet.

480
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:50,913
Don't bIame the tooIs.
I never had the go-ahead to terminate.

481
01:00:51,422 --> 01:00:53,356
Let me show you how.

482
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,860
That'II work, too.

483
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:06,299
We kiII him, then it's over.

484
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:09,329
Hey, you two!

485
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:11,636
Come on! Check that shit!

486
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,937
Let's go.

487
01:01:17,248 --> 01:01:18,476
What are you doing?

488
01:01:18,649 --> 01:01:20,116
What are you doing?

489
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:23,715
Permission to speak, sir.

490
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:27,152
I know what I have to do.

491
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,785
I'II never get the chance to thank you
for squaring me away.

492
01:01:33,097 --> 01:01:34,826
So, thank you, sir.

493
01:01:37,134 --> 01:01:38,999
I'm caIIing the cops.

494
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:48,872
Just making sure you know, if we kiII him--

495
01:01:48,946 --> 01:01:52,575
You have to kiII me. KiII me! I don't care.

496
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:56,113
As Iong as he's dead, I don't care.

497
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,083
If we kiII him...

498
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:02,289
...there's a chance, some say,
this whoIe universe couId go with him.

499
01:02:08,432 --> 01:02:10,992
The Chinese guy
was tearing the pIace apart.

WormhoIe ETA: ten minutes.

501
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,059
That vicinity.

502
01:03:02,386 --> 01:03:03,717
He's here.

503
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,966
Shit. Take cover!

504
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:58,031
It's a bomb! Don't breathe for 20 seconds
after the bIast!

505
01:06:21,785 --> 01:06:23,116
YuIaw!

506
01:06:24,588 --> 01:06:26,647
You came here for me.

507
01:06:27,892 --> 01:06:29,223
Now I'm here for you.

508
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:36,900
After this, there wiII be onIy one.

509
01:06:37,268 --> 01:06:40,362
I won't be The One, but neither wiII you.

510
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:30,997
Shit! Three minutes.

511
01:13:37,554 --> 01:13:39,215
Thirty seconds!

512
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:47,988
Shit.

513
01:14:00,077 --> 01:14:02,272
Gabe, get out! Get out!

514
01:14:02,412 --> 01:14:03,970
Get out!

515
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:36,035
That's him.

516
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,615
Scanning, RHV 579. Confirm.

517
01:14:47,557 --> 01:14:49,388
Send him where he beIongs.

518
01:15:02,939 --> 01:15:07,603
Destination:
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.

01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:11,709
Wormhole opens in one minute.

520
01:15:30,867 --> 01:15:32,232
No, stop!

521
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:35,000
That's him, that's YuIaw.

522
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:38,841
Wormhole opens in 30 seconds.

523
01:15:40,143 --> 01:15:41,235

Wormhole opened.

530
01:16:24,855 --> 01:16:26,789
That man doesn't Ieave this room.

531
01:16:30,427 --> 01:16:32,486
Sir, he assisted in YuIaw's capture.

532
01:16:32,863 --> 01:16:36,094
He's from an uninitiated universe
with no traveI passport.

533
01:16:36,366 --> 01:16:37,390
He goes back.

534
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:40,668
He can't go back.
They'II Iock him up for Iife.

535
01:16:40,737 --> 01:16:43,365
He wiII be cared for, watched over.

01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,908
That order is buIIshit!

539
01:16:55,352 --> 01:16:56,876
It doesn't matter.

540
01:16:57,554 --> 01:16:58,543
Take him!

541
01:17:22,612 --> 01:17:24,102
I know where he has to go.

542
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,784

01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:35,052
It's procedure.

Look out!

550
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,917
Hey, you aII right?

551
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,558
OIIie?

552
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,188
Excuse me, I have a....

-Fresh fish.
-Got a pretty mouth.

557
01:19:20,697 --> 01:19:23,928
I am YuIaw! I'm nobody's bitch.

You are mine.

559
01:19:30,206 --> 01:19:32,003
I don't need to know you.

560
01:19:32,676 --> 01:19:36,009
You onIy need to know me.

561
01:19:37,347 --> 01:19:39,110
I wiII be The One!
