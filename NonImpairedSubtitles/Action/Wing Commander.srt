JOHN F. KENNEDY:
Many years ago...

2
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,000
the great British explorer
George Mallory...

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,240
who was to die
on Mount Everest...

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,520
was asked
why did he want to climb it.

5
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,240
He said, "Because it is there."

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,400
Well, space is there,
and we're going to climb it.

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,920
And the moon
and the planets are there.

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,800
And new hopes for knowledge
and peace are there.

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,280
And, therefore,
as we set sail...

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,080
we ask God's blessing...

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,600
on the most hazardous
and dangerous...

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,920
and greatest adventure
on which man has ever embarked.

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,200
Thank you.

MAN: I hereby declare
this new world...

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,160
a colony
of the Terran Confederation.

17
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,160
REPORTER: With the charting of
the fourth pulsar this year...

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,400
the Pilgrim explorers are
becoming a discussion point.

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,640
MAN: We are gathered here
to celebrate Dr. Peter Anthony.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,600
His invention of the Navcom A.I.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,120
is possibly the most important
development in space travel...

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,880
of the last century.

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,200
Finally, we can navigate
almost any jump...

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,040
in known space with confidence.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,640
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Dr. Peter Anthony.

Coming up on the far side...

I've ever seen before.

[Radio static]

32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
REPORTER: With escalating
tension in the Vega sector...

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,120
the whole Confederation
is on a knife edge.

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,640
Will these unprovoked attacks
continue?

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,920
Will the diplomatic probes
be successful?

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We can only hope...

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,640
AMBASSADOR:
I regret to report...

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
that all diplomatic avenues
with the Kilrathi...

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
have been exhausted.

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,960
It is now clear
they have no interest...

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,880
in coexisting with us
or any other race.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,560
It is my sad duty
to inform you...

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,160
that as of Six A.M.
this morning...

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
we are formally at war
with the Kilrathi.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,400

coming to bear, Admiral.

They're powering weapons.

62

They're headed towards

This is Admiral Wilson...

Pegasus station
commanding officer.

75
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,160
Forty Kilrathi capital ships
are closing.

Station has been breached.
They want the Navcom.

The station has been breached.

TOLWYN:
What's the fleet's position?

84
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
RICHARD: We're spread out
all over the sector.

85
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,080
The earliest our advanced
elements can reach Sol...

86
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,600
is forty-two hours...

87
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,880
and that is taking risks
with the jumps, sir.

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,040
TOLWYN: Give me
the Vega and Sol sectors.

fleet's position.

Estimated time to Earth space,
forty-two hours.

93
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,200
A mere two hours could decide
the outcome of this war.

Signal all ships
to mark our course...

I need to know what
the Kilrathi are up to, Richard.

97
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,520
Do we have any more ships
left in Vega?

98
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,880
Just one, sir.
The Tiger Claw.

99
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,560
But she's beyond the range
of our communications...

100
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,080
and a drone will take
two days to reach her.

Why not send it by drone
to the Pegasus, sir?

What's your problem?

172
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,840
-What?
-Did you change course?

173
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,960
MARSHALL:
No, I didn't change course.

174
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,520
I just boosted the power.
Why dog it?

175
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,400
We can be at the beacon
in, like, under an hour.

176
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,120
That beacon
is marking a gravity well.

177
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,360
One cubic inch of it...

178

than the sun.

too fast...

181

we'll be sucked in
out of control.

182
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,880
If I don't realign
our entry vector...

183
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,560
we are not going
to make the jump.

184
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,360
-What happens if we miss?
-We die.

185
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,320
BLAIR: Have we reached
the entry vector's PNR yet?

186
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
No, no. Not yet.

187
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
She's reaching out for us.

188
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
Listen to that.

What's a Scylla?

194
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,120
Ulysses sailed between
the whirlpool Charybdis...

195
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,000
and the island monster, Scylla.

MARSHALL:
Whoa. What is this thing?

198
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,840
This thing is a distortion
in space-time.

199
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,480
The Pilgrims
were the first to chart it.

200
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,280
If it's charted,
why is it off-limits?

201
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
Because it's unstable.

202
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,120
It's unstable?

203
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,920
Whoa. It's unstable,
and we're gonna jump it?!

You take the helm!

I never made a jump before.

I don't like this guy.

like this guy at all, man.

-Yes?

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,160
-Ten seconds to jump, sir.
-So?

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,040
So? So if you don't get that
computer back on-line, sir...

You just plotted a jump

in under ten seconds...

228

At ease, Lieutenant.

259
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,640
Commander Gerald tells me
that you have something for me.

260
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,080
Yes, sir.

261
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,480
An encrypted communiqué
from Admiral Tolwyn.

262
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,880
Why didn't the admiral
send a drone via the Pegasus?

263
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,560
The Pegasus was destroyed
by a Kilrathi battle group...

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,040
seventeen hours ago.

267
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,040
I want this disk decrypted ASAP.

GERALD: Oh, Lieutenant?

270
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,880
You wouldn't be related
to Arnold Blair, would you?

271
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
He was my father, sir.

272
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,400
He married a Pilgrim woman,
didn't he?

273
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,960
Yes, sir.

274
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
Pilgrims don't think like us.

275
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,200
You won't have to worry, sir.

276
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,560
They're both dead.

277
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,560
I'm sure
the lieutenant's heredity...

278
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,840
will have no bearing
on his performance, Mr. Gerald.

279
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,520
No, sir. I'm sure it won't.

280
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,640
I suggest you stow your gear...

281
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,560
and familiarize yourself
with the ship.

282
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,280
That's all, Lieutenant.

Yo, B. Look at these rapiers.

295
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,640
Clock's ticking. What do you do?

296
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,240
Simple.
I go vertical and inverted...

297
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,080
do a 180 at full throttle...

298
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,520
apply brakes...

299
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,800
and drop in behind 'em.

300
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,920
Bang, you're dead.
Not fast enough.

301
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,040
Dralthis are too quick,
particularly in a climb.

302
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,520
You've just taken a missile
up your tailpipe.

303
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,120
OK, let's reverse the situation.

304
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,880
You're locked on a Dralthi.

305
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,200
It goes evasive,
enters an asteroid belt.

306
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,520
If I'm locked on...

307
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,040
there's no such thing
as evasive action.

308
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,400
And you're dead again.

309
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,000
You see, it's an ambush.

310
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,840
Five or six fighters
hide behind rocks...

311
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
the size of your swollen head
and pounce.

312
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,880
A Kilrathi gang-bang.

313
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,880
What's the matter?

314
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,680
Did I bruise your ego?

315
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,640
No. I'm just, uh, not used
to getting combat tips...

316
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,560
from a grease monkey,
that's all.

317
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,160
Lieutenant Commander Deveraux...

318
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,480
your wing commander.

319
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,520
You have a name?

320
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,400
Uh, Lieutenant Blair, ma'am.

321
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,160
Well, Lieutenant Blair...

322
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,480
if you want to play
at being a fighter pilot...

323
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,840
I suggest you find
a virtual fun zone.

324
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
Meanwhile,
step down from the rapier.

325
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,400
I apologize, ma'am.

326
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,440
The mission sheet said
the rapier was unassigned.

327
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,040
I didn't realize it belonged
to Lieutenant Commander Chen.

328
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,240
What are you doing
on the flight deck?

329
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,880
MARSHALL: Getting acquainted
with our new surroundings.

330
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,600
MARSHALL: Good job, B.

331
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,120
We're on the ship
five minutes...

332
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,240
and you're already hitting
on our wing commander?

333
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,400
BLAIR: How was I to know?

334
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,040
MARSHALL: She's just another
tight-ass C.O.

335
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,040
Who cares? Let it go.

336
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,160
Now I'm gonna show you
how to make friends.

337
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,920
MARSHALL: How you doing?
Allow me to introduce myself.

338
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Lieutenant Todd Marshall,
and my close personal friend...

339
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,120
Lieutenant Christopher Blair.

340
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,120
Ladies and gentlemen, take note.

341
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,720
This man happens to be...

342
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,160
the second-best pilot
on this hunk of junk.

343
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,200
HUNTER: Just who are you
calling the best?

344
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,840
-Now, that's a secret.
-Shh. Watch this.

345
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,840
There's two ways to find
that out, mister, uh...

346
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,600
uh, Lieutenant Hunter.

347
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,280
First way involves you trying
to kick the shit out of me.

348
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,480
HUNTER: And the other way?

349
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,760
Forbes?

350
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,640
We're on stand-down.

351
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,280
One won't hurt.

352
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,800
MARSHALL:
Well, it may even help, huh?

353
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,120
Here you go, mate.

354
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,440
Allow me.

355
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,800
You got balls.

356
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,880
-You should see 'em.
-Mine are bigger.

357
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,360
I've been told
size doesn't matter.

358
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,320
She lied.

359
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,800
Do you know what, Hunter?

360
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,640
I would have taken
the third option.

361
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,040
MARSHALL: Really.

362
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,720
I would have kicked his ass
first, then drank his scotch.

363
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,400
Oh! Touché.

364
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,800
COMPUTER: Message on-line.

365
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,000
Playback in progress.

366
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,560
TOLWYN: Jay,
I'm gonna have to be brief.

367
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,400
The Kilrathi took Pegasus.

368
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,560
They may have her Navcom A.I.

369
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,080
By the time this communication
reaches you...

370
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,720
they will be
twenty-three hours...

371
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,960
from the Charybdis jump point
and Earth.

372
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,080
Confed capital ships
are headed home now.

373
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,440
The Concordia battle group...

374
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,440
will only be able to make it
in twenty-five hours.

375
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm ordering the Tiger Claw
to the Charybdis quasar.

376
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,080
You are to use
any means necessary...

377
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,240
to gather information as
to the Kilrathi whereabouts...

378
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,240
capacity, and plan of attack.

379
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,480
I need intelligence, old friend.

380
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,120
Use Taggart.

381
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,600
He knows this space
better than any man alive.

382
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,560
He can get you
to Charybdis quickly.

383
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,320
I don't like it.

384
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
What don't you like, Paul?

385
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,360
The disk came to us
on the Diligent...

386
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,480
entrusted to a Pilgrim
half-breed.

387
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,080
Send for this Taggart.

388
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
MARSHALL: Why don't you take
his castle...

389
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,440
with your little horsey?

390
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,560
Check...

391
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,760
Mate.

392
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,560
FORBES: So, there's a brain
behind that mouth.

393
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,720
Your friend
always this talkative?

394
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,080
MARSHALL: No, he just made
the fatal error...

395
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,720
of mistaking
our wing commander...

396
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,960
for your average grease monkey.

397
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,840
Listen, all I did was sit
in Commander Chen's fighter.

398
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,600
BLAIR:
Lieutenant Commander Chen?

399
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,480
Bossman?

400
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
HUNTER: You're talking about
a bloke that never existed.

401
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,320
I'm pretty sure he did.

402
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,240
He...never...existed.

403
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,520
Now change the subject
quickly, pal...

404
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,760
before I change it for you.

405
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,880
MARSHALL: You got a problem
with my friend, Mr. Hunter?

406
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,040
HUNTER: Yes, I do.

407
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,560
MARSHALL: That means
you got a problem with me.

408
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,760
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

409
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,160
HUNTER:
Well, you're gonna love this.

410
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,960
He's a Pilgrim!

411
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,440
DEVEREAUX: Stand down, or
you'll have a problem with me.

412
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,320
I want an explanation.

413
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,880
Hunter?

414
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,040
-Ma'am?
-Ma'am?

415
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,040
Lieutenant Hunter was
just helping Marshall and l...

416
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,400
feel at home.

417
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,240
DEVEREAUX: Lieutenant?

418
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,200
HUNTER:
Yeah. That's right, ma'am.

419
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,320
BLAIR: Yeah. You see?

420
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,440
I guess this conversation
never existed.

421
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,200
Lieutenant?

422
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,000
Lieutenant!

423
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,320
Who in the hell
do you think you are?

424
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,480
Let me give you a reality check.

425
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,560
In all likelihood,
you're going to die out here.

426
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,440
We're all going
to die out here...

427
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,800
but none of us need to be
reminded of that fact...

428
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,000
so you die, you never existed.

429
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,400
Understand?

430
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,840
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,000
GERALD: Taggart, sir.

432
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,240
Ah. I know of you,
Mr. Taggart...

433
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,880
but I'm afraid I don't know you.

434
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,320
And yet you come to me
with classified orders...

435
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,880
from Admiral Tolwyn.

436
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,040
Oh, I see. The captain
doesn't trust me...

437
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,720
Blair, or the disk.

438
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,320
Would you?

439
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,040
Well, uh...

440
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,400
no.

441
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,040
No.

442
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,800
This tactical schematic outlines
a nightmare, Mr. Taggart.

443
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,240
It tells me that the Kilrathi
may have a Navcom...

444
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,600
and with it the capacity
to jump into Earth space.

445
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,360
And based on that nightmare...

446
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,640
it orders me to take
radical action...

447
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,520
which, if it and you
are a lie...

448
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,200
could compromise this ship
and its crew.

449
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,200
So I'm bound to ask you,
Mr. Taggart...

450
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,040
what proof do you have
that this is authentic?

451
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,720
Where did you get this?

452
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,920
Tolwyn...

453
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,280
thought it might be useful...

454
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,080
if I ever had
to convince a captain...

455
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,640
to follow his orders.

456
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,360
Mr. Obutu.

457
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,920
Plot a course
for the Charybdis quasar.

458
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,440
Full speed, if you please.

459
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,080
[Keystrokes]

460
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,240
OBUTU: Sir, the nearest
jump point to the Charybdis...

461
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,320
is four days hard travel
from our current location.

462
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,000
TAGGART: There's a class-two
pulsar eleven hours from here.

463
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,800
We can jump there.

464
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,760
OBUTU:
It's not on the chart, sir.

465
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,640
Navcom does not have
those coordinates.

466
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,000
I have them.

467
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,000
No one's jumped a pulsar
for forty years...

468
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,800
and even then,
they were Pilgrims.

469
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,400
I don't believe we have
a choice, Mr. Gerald.

470
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,200
If the battle is to be decided
in the Charybdis quasar...

471
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,320
then that's where we have to be.

472
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
Plot your course, Mr. Taggart.

473
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,720
Sure.

474
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,840
Sir, that ring means nothing.

475
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,040
This ring has been in Tolwyn's
family for sixteen generations.

476
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,520
And any man who carries it...

477
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,040
has the admiral's
full confidence!

478
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
Prepare for the jump.

479
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,200
BLAIR: Hey.

480
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,200
We goin' out?

481
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,520
No. Just me.

482
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,240
I pulled security
with Lieutenant Forbes.

483
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,240
Why'd you wake me up?

484
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,680

What about it, Mr. Taggart?

649
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,560
The readings are wrong.

650
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,240
The sensors are not calibrated
to the pulsar.

651
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,680
They've already been warped
by the gravitational fields.

652
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,200
COMPUTER: Captain, I must insist
we change course immediately.

653
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,080
TAGGART: No!

654
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,360
Manual override!

655
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,480
Forget you,
artificial intelligence...

656
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,880
or we're all dead.

657
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,160
Captain,
I think you should reconsider.

658
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,600
Steady as she goes, helm.

659
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,560
Aye, aye, sir.

660
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,000
COMPUTER:
Warning. Warning.

661
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,720
Jump coordinates incorrect.

662
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,200
This is the captain.

663
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,880
Fifteen seconds to jump point.

664
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,520
MARSHALL:
Watch. Oh, this is great.

665
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,040
MAN: Aft shields overloading.

666
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,920
MARSHALL:
Just you and me. Hold on.

667
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,080
Ohh!

668
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,680
DEVEREAUX: Uhh!

669
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,560
-Ohh!
-Uhh!

670
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,920
MARSHALL: Ha ha ha ha! Yeah!

671
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,920
BLAIR: You OK? You all right?

672
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,760
Where are we?

673
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,200
TAGGART: Ladies and gentlemen...

674
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,560
welcome to the Ulysses corridor.

675
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,960
We're through the jump point.

676
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,840
We made it.

677
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,800
Mr. Obutu.

678
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,920
Stealth mode, if you please.

679
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,640
Going to stealth.

680
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,120
Seven percent
electronic emission...

681
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,560
zero communication.

682
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,000
Radar status.

683
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,440
Scanners picking up a strong
electromagnetic signature...

684
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,040
at one-eleven mark forty-three.

685
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,120
An asteroid field.

686
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,120
-Lieutenant Commander.
-Yes, sir.

687
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,280
Prepare a reconnoiter.
I want to know what's out there.

688
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,480
And, Deveraux...

689
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,960
I don't want them to know
that we're here.

690
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,280
Not yet.

691
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,800
Very good, sir.

692
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,720
MERLIN:
Scanning quadrant.

693
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,240
Lieutenant, I'm picking up
metal fragments ahead.

694
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Alloy structure indicates
from a Confederation vessel.

695
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,560
Angel, you catch that?

696
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,040
That's from Pegasus.

697
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,360
Ten thousand men and women...

698
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,520
gone...

699
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,840
just like that.

700
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,000
The concussion must've blown
pieces of the station...

701
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,520
all over the sector.

702
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,320
COMPUTER:
Warning. ENM emissions.

703
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,520
-Pipe down.
-Two-one-six.

704
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,520
-Getting something.
-Analyzing.

705
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,320
COMPUTER:
Possible I.D. Kilrathi...

706
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,360
DEVEREAUX: Radio silence now.
Get into the asteroids.

707
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,560
Low power.

708
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,080
They know we're here?

709
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,320
MERLIN: Possibly.

710
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,520
From the sophistication
of the equipment onboard...

711
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,360
I'd say the vessel is a command
and communications module.

712
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,000
What's it commanding?

713
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,640
MERLIN: At least six other ships
down near the Brown Dwarf...

714
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,160
are communicating with it.

715
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,560
It seems to be transmitting
jump coordinates.

716
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,560
Angel, they've spotted
your heat corona!

717
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,840
I've got two more bogeys
comin' in hot, six o'clock!

718
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,120
Can't spot them, Blair. Call it.

719
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,640
BLAIR: Jack in the box
on three. One...

720
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,480
two...three!

721
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,760
Missile away!

722
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,960
The big one's shielded!

723
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,840
I got two more bogeys
comin' up from the Brown Dwarf!

724
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,000
Engaging!

725
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,160
DEVEREAUX: Negative. I count
fourteen unfriendlies inbound.

726
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,960
Looks like two destroyers.

727
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,760
We're out of here.

728
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,000
GERALD:
You knew what the orders were--

729
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,640
no contact with the enemy.

730
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,320
Now you've compromised
the mission...

731
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,320
and the very existence
of this ship.

732
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,840
BLAIR: I had no choice, sir.

733
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
They'd spotted...

734
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,480
Lieutenant Commander
Deveraux's heat signature.

735
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,680
GERALD: Really?
Angel, how sure are you...

736
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,480
that the Kilrathi
had you targeted?

737
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,840
Given the Lieutenant's
background...

738
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,640
are you really that certain?

739
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,000
Excuse me?

740
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,160
It's well documented
that Pilgrim saboteurs...

741
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,520
have been responsible...

742
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,040
for much of the Confed's
problems in this war.

743
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,720
Did they have me targeted,
Lieutenant?

744
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,880
WILSON: Now, come on.
This is sterile conjecture.

745
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,440
The Kilrathi are well aware...

746
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,360
that rapiers
don't just fly around...

747
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,080
in deep space
without a carrier close by.

748
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,840
Thank you, Lieutenant.
That is all.

749
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,120
-Sir--
-Dismissed, Lieutenant.

750
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,240
WILSON:
Your assessment, Mr. Gerald?

751
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,240
GERALD: That concom
is running point...

752
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,560
for the battle group.

753
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,880
Their fleet won't be far behind.

754
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,560
So I say we send them a message.

755
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,760
I can have my fighters up
in thirty minutes.

756
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,520
No, no. That's a mistake.

757
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
Without her fighters...

758
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,960
the Tiger Claw's vulnerable.

759
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,800
GERALD: You are
a civilian scout, Mr. Taggart...

760
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,320
not a naval officer.

761
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,840
Tactical operations
are our concern.

762
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,520
We are the Earth's only hope.

763
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,040
We need to buy our fleet
two hours.

764
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,120
And you're willing
to risk all that...

765
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,960
chasing after
a communications ship?

766
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,720
WILSON: I'm sorry, Mr. Taggart.

767
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,200
Destroying the concom
with its escorts...

768
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,720
will slow the Kilrathi.

769
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,040
Deveraux will lead
a strike force.

770
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,880
And as you have charted
the area before...

771
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,520
you will accompany her.

772
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,040
If you say so, Captain.

773
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,920
I do say so, Mr. Taggart.

774
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,480
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.

775
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,120
WILSON: Mr. Obutu.
Plot a course...

776
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,480
for the rings
of planet four-fifteen.

777
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,880
Four-fifteen. Aye, aye, sir.

778
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,160
BLAIR: I need to talk to you.

779
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,000
-You don't just barge in here.
-Here.

780
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,640
BLAIR: I wear it for luck.

781
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,760
Is your luck at odds
with our mission?

782
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,760
You think he's right?

783
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,600
Gerald?

784
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,000
In his mind, I started
selling out the Tiger Claw...

785
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,600
the moment I stepped onboard!

786
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,080
I don't see
how you can be a Pilgrim...

787
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,480
and fight on our side.

788
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,120
I'm not a Pilgrim!

789
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,600
My mother was.

790
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,600
My father
fought for the Confederation.

791
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,600
And they both died
before I was five.

792
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,520
He was killed
trying to save her...

793
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,040
in the Peron massacre.

794
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,440
That cross is all I have.

795
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,040
Sit down, Lieutenant.

796
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,640
Why do you think
they call me Angel?

797
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,200
I grew up in an orphanage.

798
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Yeah, my parents died
in the same war as yours.

799
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,560
My sisters told me they
were angels gone to heaven...

800
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,960
so I prayed for them.
They weren't angels.

801
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,640
They were dead, gone.
They never existed.

802
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,280
Like Bossman?

803
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Emotion gets in the way.

804
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,960
Commander, emotion
is what separates us...

805
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,720
from the Pilgrims
and from the Kilrathi.

806
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,160
Lieutenant Commander
Chen was--was...

807
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,160
Bossman and I got close.

808
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,440
In fact, we got too close.

809
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,320
Then he got himself killed.

810
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,480

Without those coordinates,
Tolwyn doesn't have a chance.

1240

01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,480
Radar.

1293
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,560
No sign
of the skipper missile, sir.

1294
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,080
One of the rapiers
must have shot it down.

1295
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,400
Where are they now?

1296
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,200
Are you all right?

1297
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,200
Well, I might not be dancing
for a while.

1298
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,960
All right, hang on.

1299
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,320
I'm gonna tractor you
back to the ship.

1300
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,200
No, no, you're not.
You're going on.

1301
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,280
We can't both disobey orders.

1302
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,920
You'll be out of air in an hour.

1303
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,160
You're going back to the ship.

1304
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,880
You disobey my order...

1305
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,440
and I'll have you
court-martialed.

1306
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,880
Like I care.

1307
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,960
Then care about
the billions who will die...

1308
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,560
if the fleet doesn't get
the jump coordinates.

1309
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,960
You've got to go on.

1310
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,320
You know that.

1311
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,040
You're all right, Angel.

1312
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,400
You too, Chris.

1313
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,480
OBUTU:
The Kilrathi ships are closing.

1314
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,040
So what now?

1315
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,520
Now we make them sorry
they were ever born.

1316
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,400
Battle stations.

1317
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,560
Battle stations!
Battle stations!

1318
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,840
Merlin, check my coordinates.

1319
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,600
[Beeping]

1320
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,360
MERLIN: Jump coordinates
verified, Lieutenant.

1321
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,600
BLAIR: Firing jump drive.

1322
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,600
FALK: Kilrathi cruiser and
destroyer are in missile range.

1323
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,320
TAGGART: Open fire, Mr. Gerald.

1324
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,480
GERALD: Aye, aye, sir.

1325
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,480
All batteries,
fire as she bears.

1326
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,560
FALK: A Kilrathi cruiser
is bearing right for us, sir.

1327
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,120
What tack, sir?

1328
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,920
Steady on.

1329
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,000
Let them be the first to blink.

1330
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,280
MERLIN:
Jump trajectory is drifting.

1331
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,720
Please recompute coordinates.

1332
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,920
BLAIR: Coordinates eight-seven-
five-nine-three mark...

eight-five-four-nine-three,
vector one-oh-five-niner.

1334
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,520
Prepare to lower our shield.

1335
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,720
OFFICER:
She's changing course, sir.

Portside missile battery
prepare to fire.

1337

MAN:
Fuel block locked and loaded.

1338
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,440
SECOND MAN: Ready to go, sir.

1339
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:15,560
Sir, the missile guidance system
won't activate at this range.

1340
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,440
She won't need to.
Lower our shields.

1341
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,400
Shields lowered.

1342
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,200
MAN: Brace for impact!

1343
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,040
Give them a broadside,
Mr. Gerald!

1344
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,200
Open fire!

1345
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,520

01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,480
MERLIN: I cannot verify
the new coordinates. Recompute.

1348
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,760
PNR in five seconds.
Entry vector doesn't compute.

1349
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,120
BLAIR: I made it!

1350
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,800
She held together!
I love this baby!

1351
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:06,960
This is Lieutenant
Christopher Blair...

1352
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,480
to any Confed ship.

1353
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,280
A Kilrathi battle group has
the Charybdis jump coordinates.

1354
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,320
They will breach
at one-six-seven...

1355
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,120
mark eight-eight nine,
Sol system.

1356
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,960
Repeat, one-six-seven mark
eight-eight-nine, Sol system.

1357
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,280
Confed fleet, do you read?

1358
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,600
[Buzz buzz buzz]

1359
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,000
Merlin, check your scanners for
any sign of the Confed fleet.

1360
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,120
[Beep beep]

1361
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,400
MERLIN: I'm picking up
a Kilrathi signal behind us.

1362
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,160
Snakeir class capital ship.

1363
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,400
It followed us
through the jump point.

1364
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,440
BLAIR: Shit! I'm too late.

1365
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,400
RICHARD: Com room
reports a faint message...

1366
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,080
in clear from Lieutenant Blair.

1367
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,840
He's broadcasting
the Kilrathi jump coordinates.

1368
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,240
TOLWYN: Blair.

1369
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,400
RICHARD: Should we respond, sir?

1370
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,960
RADAR MAN:
Identifying Confed rapier...

1371
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,520
heading towards Earth
at LSM point nine.

1372
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,040
He's being followed by
something massive, Admiral.

1373
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,680
Looks like a Snakeir.

1374
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,240
RICHARD:
Permission to intercept it?

1375
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,720
TOLWYN: No, we wait.

1376
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,000
The Snakeir
will overtake Blair's fighter.

1377
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,080
Sir, if we don't intercept...

1378
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,640
the Snakeir will reach
Earth orbit before us.

1379
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,680
The casualties
could be significant.

1380
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,520
I'm bloody well aware
of that, Richard!

1381
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,680
All ships are to target
those jump coordinates.

1382
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,560
Blair to Confed fleet,
a Kilrathi capital ship...

1383
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,600
has penetrated
the quasar's jump point...

1384
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,840
and is in Earth space. Copy?

1385
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,080
They aren't in radio range.

1386
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,160
Earth will never see 'em coming.

1387
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,320
MERLIN: I'm detecting...

1388
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,920
a Confederation signal,
Lieutenant.

1389
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,720
[Beep beep beep beep]

1390
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,200
Confederation transponder...

1391
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,680
identified as beacon
one-four-seven.

1392
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:14,680
Oh, shit--Scylla.

1393
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,760
MERLIN: Mass of Snakeir--

1394
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,400
two hundred thousand,
four hundred sixty-one tons

1395
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,920
OBUTU: Sir, we've hove to
for damage inspection.

1396
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,080
TAGGART: And the locator beacon
from the rapier pod?

1397
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:48,080
Nothing, sir.
Lost contact during the battle.

1398
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,880
Have the Diligent
prepared for launch.

1399
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,400
If I'm not back
in two hours...

1400
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,960
make the jump to Earth.
I'll join you later.

1401
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,120
Aye, aye, sir.

1402
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,320
I'm going to look for that pod.

1403
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,600
MERLIN: The Snakeir will have
a firing solution on us...

1404
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,360
in five seconds.

1405
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,000
Kilrathi radar is locked on.

1406
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,960
Ten seconds
to the point of no return...

1407
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,600
and we're almost out of fuel.

1408
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,680
BLAIR: Give me a count.

1409
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,320
MERLIN: Five...four...

1410
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,400
three...two...

1411
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,760
BLAIR: Holy shit!

1412
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,520
We made it!

1413
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,200
The Kilrathi's too big.

1414
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,720
Scylla's got her.

1415
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,560
MERLIN:
You're out of fuel, Lieutenant.

1416
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,320
Switching off auxiliary systems.

1417
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,320
RICHARD: Admiral,
the Kilrathi fleet...

1418
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,600
is coming through
the jump point...

1419
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,760
one ship at a time.

1420
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,720
They've no chance
to defend themselves...

1421
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,200
or warn the ships behind.

1422
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,720
And the Snakeir?

1423
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,120
She's disappeared
from our scanners.

1424
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:37,920
Launch two rapier wings
and a squadron of broadswords.

1425
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:40,120
Aye, aye, sir.

1426
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,040
PILOT: This is Concordia
rescue and recovery.

1427
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,640
Stand by for tractor.

1428
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,320
Welcome to Sol sector,
Lieutenant.

1429
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,800
Your parents
would have been proud.

1430
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,280
Have they located
Commander Deveraux?

1431
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,800
Paladin went to search for her.

1432
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,240
We haven't heard from him...

1433
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,560
since the Tiger Claw
arrived in Earth space.

1434
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,040
RICHARD: Admiral,
I have the Diligent reporting.

1435
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,720
Commodore Taggart
requesting permission...

1436
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,520
to land on the Tiger Claw, sir.

1437
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,680
Is she with him?

1438
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,560
RICHARD: Lieutenant Commander
Deveraux is on board.

1439
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,920
Taggart is requesting
an emergency medical team...

1440
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,160
to meet him on the flight deck.

1441
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,600
I think you're
on the wrong ship, Lieutenant.

1442
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,920
BLAIR: Baker Two,
requesting permission to land.

1443
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,680
CONTROL: Welcome back,
Lieutenant Blair.

1444
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,360
You're clear to land.

1445
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,960
MORRIS: Yeah!

1446
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,720
Baby, you made it!

1447
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:32,320
Not bad for the second best
pilot in the academy.

1448
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,720
BLAIR: Where's Angel?

1449
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,640
She just came in.

1450
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,480
TAGGART: Get the medical team
on the double!

1451
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,480
It's pure luck I found her.

1452
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,640
She turned off her beacon...

1453
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,840
not to tip off the Kilrathi.

1454
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,440
She's brave.

1455
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,480
I'll go and get the medic.

1456
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,840
Come on, girl.
Angel, come on, wake up, girl.

1457
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,040
Wake up.

1458
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,760
Hey, don't you die on me.

1459
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,320
MARSHALL: Come on.

1460
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,280
[Coughs]

1461
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,960
MARSHALL:
They're coming, they're coming.

1462
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,160
BLAIR: Hang on.

1463
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,560
What did you say?

1464
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,280
I said don't you die on me.

1465
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,920
Yeah?

1466
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,680
Suggestion or an order?

1467
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,840
That's definitely an order.

1468
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,160
MEDIC:
We should get her to sick bay.
