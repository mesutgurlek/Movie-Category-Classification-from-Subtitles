So far we've found five discrete
detonation points in the tank...

833
01:02:27,598 --> 01:02:30,590
and we believe that there may be a sixth.

834
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:35,116
l've suspected due to the size
of the residual scoring...

835

and the burn points...

836

that we are dealing with a G-4 type explosive.

837
01:02:40,678 --> 01:02:43,875
So l've requested a spot check
of all inventory...

838
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:47,633
from the master-at-arms

839
01:02:47,718 --> 01:02:51,347
that there are six detonators missing
from a small-arms locker...

in the port flight pod.

841
01:02:54,038 --> 01:02:57,075
So one detonator may still be
unaccounted for.

842
01:02:57,438 --> 01:03:01,989
Have the master-at-arms post guards
at all small-arms lockers immediately.

844
01:03:06,238 --> 01:03:09,150
into who may have had access to that locker.

845
01:03:09,478 --> 01:03:13,437
However, due to spotty record-keeping...

846

and lax internal security procedures
since the attack...

847
01:03:16,718 --> 01:03:20,870
she believes that we may never know
who took the detonators.

02:25:47,092 --> 02:25:49,845
lt's been set to go off if there was an attack.

1998
02:25:50,372 --> 02:25:55,366
Some poor slob goes to all the trouble
of building a fallout shelter, stocks it...

1999
02:25:55,852 --> 02:25:58,412
has a beacon, the whole planet....

2000
02:26:00,252 --> 02:26:02,527
Then what? What happens to him?

2001
02:26:06,172 --> 02:26:08,925
Let's just call ourselves lucky
and leave it at that.

2002
02:26:20,452 --> 02:26:24,889
[Eerie instrumental music]

2003
02:26:48,452 --> 02:26:52,047
-Madame President.
-Would you close that curtain, please?

2004
02:26:57,252 --> 02:26:58,287
ROSLlN: Thank you.

2005
02:26:58,372 --> 02:27:02,729
You are obviously an intelligent,
well-educated young woman.

2006
02:27:03,052 --> 02:27:06,044
Would you mind explaining to me why
you waited five years...

2007
02:27:06,132 --> 02:27:07,724
in between breast exams?

2008
02:27:07,812 --> 02:27:10,929
Yes, l would mind.
lt's none of your business.

2009
02:27:12,132 --> 02:27:13,485
l was busy.

2010
02:27:14,932 --> 02:27:17,969
-And now, here you are.
-Yes. Here we are.

2011
02:27:18,732 --> 02:27:21,929
-Would you mind?
-l do, actually.

2012
02:27:22,972 --> 02:27:25,406
Your doctor back on Caprica was right.

2013
02:27:25,492 --> 02:27:28,450
lt's too damn late to operate,
the cancer is too far advanced.

2014
02:27:28,532 --> 02:27:31,888
DOC COTTLE: We can try to shrink
the tumour with gamma treatments...

2015
02:27:31,972 --> 02:27:34,202
and follow that up with lV cis-Doloxan.

2016
02:27:34,292 --> 02:27:38,001
Did he explain to you the side-effects
of Doloxan?

2017
02:27:38,252 --> 02:27:40,243
Hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration.

2018
02:27:40,332 --> 02:27:43,847
l watched my mother endure two years
of Doloxan before she died.

2019
02:27:44,932 --> 02:27:47,844
l would like to explore alternate treatment.

2020
02:27:48,692 --> 02:27:50,410
DOC COTTLE: Prayer?
ROSLlN: Witty.

2021
02:27:51,412 --> 02:27:54,165
Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract?

2022
02:27:54,692 --> 02:27:58,321
DOC COTTLE: Gods. You're one of those.
ROSLlN: What if it works?

2023
02:28:01,452 --> 02:28:04,091
All the evidence on Chamalla is anecdotal.

2024
02:28:04,172 --> 02:28:07,323
DOC COTTLE: lt's nothing but a bunch
of loose talk and false hope.

2025
02:28:07,412 --> 02:28:09,209
ROSLlN: l'll take that as a yes.

2026
02:28:12,332 --> 02:28:13,651
All right.

2027
02:28:13,972 --> 02:28:17,123
l'll put out a med request
to the civilian fleet.

2028
02:28:17,652 --> 02:28:20,962
Maybe there's some other wide-eyed dreamer
out there...

2029
02:28:21,052 --> 02:28:24,442
with a secret horde of Chamalla extract
in their luggage.

2030
02:28:25,452 --> 02:28:28,285
DOC COTTLE: Put your clothes back on now.
ROSLlN: Thank you.

2031
02:28:32,372 --> 02:28:34,408
DOC COTTLE: And for what it's worth...

2032
02:28:35,372 --> 02:28:39,729
l would seriously consider prayer.

2033
02:28:46,772 --> 02:28:49,127
Boonie jumpers. Shuttle jockies.

2034
02:28:49,772 --> 02:28:53,526
And a Fleet Academy wash-out. This is
the best that you could come up with?

2035
02:28:53,612 --> 02:28:56,046
-Diamonds in the rough.
-Yeah, right.

2036
02:28:56,132 --> 02:28:58,646
APOLLO: They're the most qualified pilots
in the fleet.

2037
02:28:58,732 --> 02:28:59,847
STARBUCK: Great!

2038
02:29:02,172 --> 02:29:03,844
STARBUCK: Attention on deck.

2039
02:29:06,972 --> 02:29:10,123
That means get on your feet, nuggets!

2040
02:29:14,092 --> 02:29:18,688
You are joining the Colonial Fleet,
boys and girls, not some after-school club.

2041
02:29:18,772 --> 02:29:19,921
Seats.

2042
02:29:25,452 --> 02:29:28,683
STARBUCK: Pilots call me Starbuck,
but you may refer to me as God.

2043
02:29:28,772 --> 02:29:32,128
You've all flown before, but you're about
to enter a whole new world...

2044
02:29:32,212 --> 02:29:33,645
so pay attention.

2045
02:29:33,732 --> 02:29:35,962
We don't have any flight simulators
on board...

2046
02:29:36,052 --> 02:29:39,044
so we're putting you into the cockpit, today.

2047
02:29:42,892 --> 02:29:44,689
This is the Viper Mark II.

2048
02:29:44,772 --> 02:29:48,003
lt's as manoeuvrable as a jack-rabbit,
and can flip end for end...

2049
02:29:48,092 --> 02:29:50,287
in 0.35 seconds.

2050
02:29:50,612 --> 02:29:54,127
You've never flown anything remotely like it,
so don't think that you have.

2051
02:29:54,212 --> 02:29:57,761
STARBUCK: Today we'll do basic launch,
approach, and landing manoeuvres...

2052
02:29:57,852 --> 02:30:00,650
and anyone not paying attention
is liable to end up...

2053
02:30:00,732 --> 02:30:05,567
as a puddle or something to be hosed
out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck.

2054
02:30:07,412 --> 02:30:09,687
She's laying it on a little thick.

2055
02:30:10,292 --> 02:30:14,046
STARBUCK: Costanza, right?
COSTANZA: Yes, God, sir.

2056
02:30:14,132 --> 02:30:17,329
Not anymore.
From now on, your name is ''Hot Dog.''

2057
02:30:17,412 --> 02:30:20,165
And when God speaks, Hot Dog, you listen.

2058
02:30:20,252 --> 02:30:24,131
Maybe if you had learned that at
the Academy, you wouldn't have washed out.

2059
02:30:28,932 --> 02:30:30,206
Sit up!

2060
02:30:36,372 --> 02:30:40,331
LSO: Viper 791 Galactica,
you are cleared for approach.

2061
02:30:41,852 --> 02:30:45,128
LSO: Speed 175 port bay,
hands on approach...

2062
02:30:45,212 --> 02:30:47,442
checkers green. Call the ball.

2063
02:30:50,492 --> 02:30:52,164
l have the ball.

2064
02:30:52,372 --> 02:30:54,090
STARBUCK: Easy on the throttle, Kat.

2065
02:30:55,532 --> 02:30:59,002
STARBUCK: Are you listening to me?
Don't chase the lights, okay?

2066
02:30:59,612 --> 02:31:02,649
KAT: Roger, Starbuck.
STARBUCK: Kat, don't chase the lights!

2067
02:31:02,732 --> 02:31:05,451
Set it by the numbers
and correct with thrusters.

2068
02:31:09,652 --> 02:31:11,529
LSO: Wave-off!

2069
02:31:13,652 --> 02:31:14,846
Punch it, Kat!

2070
02:31:22,452 --> 02:31:26,764
Worse than awful.
Wretched beyond belief, actually.

2071
02:31:27,772 --> 02:31:29,490
STARBUCK: You call yourselves pilots.

2072
02:31:29,652 --> 02:31:33,964
It'll take the knuckle draggers a week to
pound your divots out of the flight deck.

2073
02:31:34,052 --> 02:31:38,330
-With due respect, sir, that's unfair.
-Yes, sir. This was only our first day.

2074
02:31:40,732 --> 02:31:42,768
No. lt's your last.

2075
02:31:43,372 --> 02:31:46,205
lt would be criminal to let any of you
near a Viper again.

2076
02:31:46,572 --> 02:31:49,769
So pack your gear and
get the hell off my ship. You're done.

2077
02:32:07,532 --> 02:32:09,363
What are you doing here, Kara?

2078
02:32:09,452 --> 02:32:12,683
-You can't wash them out on their first day.
-l just did.

2079
02:32:14,452 --> 02:32:17,888
Look, l got 40 Vipers, and 21 pilots.
That's it.

2080
02:32:18,532 --> 02:32:20,841
We are sitting ducks
until we finish water-op's.

2081
02:32:20,932 --> 02:32:25,005
We can't even maintain a CAP.
And Gods forbid the Cylons show up.

2082
02:32:25,812 --> 02:32:29,407
Gods forbid.
Let's bring in the next group of candidates.

2083
02:32:29,612 --> 02:32:32,729
The next group has never even been
in a cockpit.

2084
02:32:33,492 --> 02:32:37,007
-They're starting basic flight.
-Then they start basic flight.

2085
02:32:37,092 --> 02:32:39,560
Because that group is done.
lt says so right there.

2086
02:32:39,652 --> 02:32:41,449
Maybe you should read it again.

2087
02:32:42,572 --> 02:32:46,565
APOLLO: Lt. Thrace, this is not a request.
STARBUCK: Well, Capt. Adama!

2088
02:32:46,812 --> 02:32:50,487
l am the flight instructor, sir.
My word is scripture, sir.

2089
02:32:50,772 --> 02:32:54,560
STARBUCK: l will not, repeat, not pass
another student who isn't ready.

2090
02:32:55,572 --> 02:32:57,369
So, that's what this is about.

2091
02:32:58,092 --> 02:33:01,164
lt's not them. lt's Zak.

2092
02:33:04,732 --> 02:33:06,211
Careful.

2093
02:33:07,652 --> 02:33:09,449
Step back.

2094
02:33:22,692 --> 02:33:25,729
[Pants and grunts]

2095
02:33:34,612 --> 02:33:35,601
[Grunts]

2096
02:33:41,692 --> 02:33:44,570
ADAMA: Starbuck says they can't cut it,
they can't cut it.

2097
02:33:44,652 --> 02:33:46,882
She's not giving them a chance. lt's Day 1 .

2098
02:33:46,972 --> 02:33:49,964
She's one of the finest pilots
l've ever seen in my life.

2099
02:33:50,092 --> 02:33:53,641
One day in the cockpit is all she needs
to know if they can hack it or not.

2100
02:33:53,732 --> 02:33:56,530
ADAMA: She got that.
APOLLO: l'm not arguing that, sir.

2101
02:33:56,932 --> 02:34:01,050
l'm just saying that l think she's letting her
personal feelings cloud her judgment.

2102
02:34:01,132 --> 02:34:03,123
Please sit down, Captain.

2103
02:34:05,812 --> 02:34:07,803
ADAMA: What are those feelings?

2104
02:34:11,092 --> 02:34:12,491
About Zak.

2105
02:34:14,092 --> 02:34:16,890
-We've talked about, Zak.
-You did?

2106
02:34:16,972 --> 02:34:19,088
ADAMA: We've talked about a lot of things.

2107
02:34:19,172 --> 02:34:22,926
We've been aboard this ship for over
two years. We know each other very well.

2108
02:34:23,852 --> 02:34:26,002
When l asked her to be the instructor...

2109
02:34:26,092 --> 02:34:29,528
l knew it was going to release
a lot of loose baggage.

2110
02:34:30,092 --> 02:34:34,404
She acknowledged it.
She's a professional. She'll do her job.

2111
02:34:38,292 --> 02:34:39,281
Okay.

2112
02:34:41,612 --> 02:34:45,161
l'm just saying that you should talk to her.

2113
02:34:45,252 --> 02:34:47,561
APOLLO: She's walking around
with a lot of emotion.

2114
02:34:47,652 --> 02:34:50,166
She almost decked me in the rec room.

2115
02:34:51,652 --> 02:34:55,008
Right. You wouldn't smile if you were there.

2116
02:34:55,892 --> 02:34:57,962
-l'll talk to her.
-Thank you.

2117
02:35:00,972 --> 02:35:02,451
Personally...

2118
02:35:02,892 --> 02:35:06,646
l think she's trying to work out her guilt
over what she did for Zak.

2119
02:35:06,732 --> 02:35:10,008
l think she's making up for it
by beating up on these guys.

2120
02:35:10,092 --> 02:35:12,686
Guilt? Over what?

2121
02:35:13,412 --> 02:35:15,289
What did she do for Zak?

2122
02:35:17,492 --> 02:35:20,404
-l thought you just said--
-What did she do?

2123
02:35:25,292 --> 02:35:29,205
lt's not my place to say and l've already said
more than l should have.

2124
02:35:30,012 --> 02:35:33,322
-You'll have to ask her. l'm sorry.
-Captain, just--

2125
02:35:33,412 --> 02:35:35,482
Dad, you'll have to ask her.

2126
02:35:38,012 --> 02:35:40,003
ZAK: I don't want any special treatment.

2127
02:35:40,092 --> 02:35:43,368
Not from my father,
and certainly not from you.

2128
02:35:55,692 --> 02:35:57,250
You passed.

2129
02:35:57,492 --> 02:36:00,131
By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.

2130
02:36:01,892 --> 02:36:04,645
DUALLA: Attention.
Pass the word to Lt. Thrace.

2131
02:36:04,732 --> 02:36:07,724
Lt. Thrace, please report
to the CO's quarters.

2132
02:36:19,852 --> 02:36:21,285
Yes. Come in.

2133
02:36:22,692 --> 02:36:25,445
ADAMA: Lee was just here before.
STARBUCK: l knew it.

2134
02:36:30,252 --> 02:36:32,720
He thinks you washed out...

2135
02:36:33,332 --> 02:36:35,721
the nuggets without giving them a chance.

2136
02:36:36,652 --> 02:36:38,882
They didn't cut it. That's it.

2137
02:36:42,932 --> 02:36:47,483
He thought you were letting
personal feelings cloud your judgment.

2138
02:36:50,452 --> 02:36:53,012
STARBUCK: Really?
ADAMA: Your feelings about Zak.

2139
02:36:54,452 --> 02:36:56,204
That's not the case.

2140
02:36:59,292 --> 02:37:00,281
Okay.

2141
02:37:02,652 --> 02:37:04,643
ADAMA: He said something else.

2142
02:37:06,372 --> 02:37:10,160
He said something that
l would like to ask you directly.

2143
02:37:15,012 --> 02:37:19,767
ADAMA: He said that you might be feeling
