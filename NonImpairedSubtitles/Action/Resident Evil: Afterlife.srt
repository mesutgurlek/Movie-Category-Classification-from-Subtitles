1
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,283
My name is Alice.

2
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:06,536
I worked for Umbrella Corporation
in a secret laboratory

3
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:09,456
developing experimental viral weaponry.

4
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:11,124
There was an incident.

5
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:12,584
A virus escaped.

6
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,753
Everybody died.

7
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,589
Trouble was...

8
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,925
...they didn't stay dead.

9
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,845
This was the start of an apocalypse
that would sweep the entire world.

10
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:27,349
The men responsible for this
disaster took refuge underground

11
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,852
and continued to experiment
with the deadly T-Virus.

12
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:34,356
They felt secure
in their high-tech fortress.

13
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,942
But they were wrong.

14
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,552
Biohazard terminated.

15
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,220
Central Shibuya.

16
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,180
Confirm?

17
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,809
I confirm.

18
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,147
Nice shooting.

19
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,691
And I lead three to one.

20
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,443
The night is young.

21
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,278
Plenty more fish in the--

22
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,657
Toshi, are you okay?

23
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,785
Toshi, where are you?

24
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,637
Sentry three respond.

25
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,517
We lost contact with another one.

26
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,104
- Chairman Wesker.
- Report.

27
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,524
Sir, a half-hour ago,
we began to lose contact

28
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:42,859
with some of our perimeter sentries.

29
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:45,904
How many have we lost?
All of them.

30
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:48,490
And you waited 30 minutes to tell me?

31
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,536
We thought it was a communications
problem. I didn't want to disturb you.

32
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,788
Give me the surface gate.

33
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,628
This is Chairman Wesker.
: Sir.

34
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:03,046
Report your situation.

35
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,631
Everything is quiet here.

36
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:06,258
No sign of intruders?

37
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:11,388
Hotaka.
- We have movement.

38
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,224
Multiple targets.

39
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,143
Surface gate, identify targets.

40
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:18,061
Repeat, identify targets.

41
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:20,439
Sir, Elevator 2 is moving.

42
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,482
I want security at that entrance.

43
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,350
Hey, boys.

44
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,229
Is that any way to treat a Lady?

45
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:25,290
Tell security to flood the
main entrance with nerve gas.

46
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,419
Sir, our men are still up there.

47
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,842
Any more questions?

48
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,014
Intruders in Sectors 1 through 5,
7 and 8.

49
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:43,308
Reports of gunfire
in Sectors 10 and 11.

50
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,647
Stay at your stations.

51
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,274
All security protocols
are now in full effect.

52
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,068
Lock down all elevators.

53
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:56,446
Seal all internal blast doors.

54
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,407
And I want damage reports.

55
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,079
Come on, move.

56
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,166
- Go, go. Everybody--
- Get out.

57
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,012
Turbulence. Turbulence. Turbulence.

58
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,059
Turbulence. Turbulence.

59
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,576
Turbulence. Turb--

60
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,761
Any last words?

61
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,151
How nice to finally meet the real you.

62
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,072
Hurts, doesn't it?

63
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,241
Well, that's just the start
of the bad news.

64
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:54,369
All those powers of yours:

65
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:58,456
Speed, strength, accelerated healing.

66
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,877
Well, you can kiss all those goodbye.
What have you done?

67
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:07,507
The serum I have injected you with is
neutralizing the T cells within your body.

68
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,634
Put simply...

69
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,680
the Umbrella Corporation
is taking back its property.

70
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,308
You just didn't work out,
so you're being recalled.

71
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,867
I am what you used to be.

72
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,161
Only better.

73
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,746
Please wait.

74
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,456
Last words?

75
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,084
Thank you.

76
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:44,919
For killing you?

77
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,880
For making me human again.

78
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:52,301
Pull up. Terrain. Terrain.

79
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,345
Pull up. Terrain. Terrain.

80
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,371
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

81
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:03,706
There is no infection.

82
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:06,542
We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.

83
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,340
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

84
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,716
There is no infection.

85
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:17,553
While I took revenge on Umbrella,

86
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:21,140
the last handful of survivors
took a chopper to safety.

87
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,519
They were headed for a town
in Alaska called Arcadia.

88
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,021
We'd received radio transmissions from there.

89
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,316
They offered food and shelter,
safety and security.

90
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:34,153
A haven, free of infection.

91
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,044
May 3rd, 1600 hours.

92
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:53,047
A hundred and seventy-seven days
without signs of life.

93
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,010
I am at 58.37 degrees north,

94
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,389
134.58 degrees west.

95
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:07,145
Closing in on the coordinates for
Arcadia, but no signs of it on any map.

96
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,232
I hope Claire and the others made it.

97
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,966
You're not coming?

98
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,634
Take care of the others.

99
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,053
Good luck, K-Mart.

100
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,598
Claire.

101
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,677
May 3rd.

102
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:28,679
1930 hours.

103
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,806
Arcadia.

104
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,684
No such place exists.

105
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:36,312
Just an empty field.

106
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,855
And a beach.

107
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,319
But we all heard the transmissions.

108
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,613
Someone must have sent them.

109
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:50,242
Someone must have brought
all these people here.

110
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,662
But why?

111
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,791
And where did they go?

112
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,298
Day 177. Signing off.

113
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,971
I don't know
if I can do this much longer.

114
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,058
What if I am the last one?

115
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:16,477
What if there is no one else?

116
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,231
No one to watch these tapes.

117
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,568
Is this my punishment

118
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,779
for letting all this happen?

119
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,827
Hey. Wait.

120
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,375
Wait, please. Stop.

121
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,089
Hello.

122
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,634
Hello?

123
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,471
Answer me.

124
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,247
Hey, hey.

125
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,457
It's okay.

126
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,336
Sorry about that.

127
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,798
But I had to get this thing off of you.

128
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:52,049
What is this?

129
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,551
Who did this to you?

130
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,932
Do you even know who I am?

131
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,355
My name is Alice.

132
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,109
We met in the Nevada desert 18 months ago.

133
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:12,069
Any of this sound familiar?

134
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,115
Mikey, Carlos, L.J.?

135
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:17,992
K-Mart?

136
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,869
You left in a helicopter

137
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:23,914
with a group of survivors
headed for Alaska.

138
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,834
Arcadia, remember?

139
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,968
Arcadia, remember?

140
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,055
Arcadia, remember?

141
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,206
May 4th, 0800 hours.

142
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:09,543
Potting a course for Prince Rupert
in British Columbia.

143
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:12,880
I will pass Vancouver,
drop down to Seattle.

144
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,636
After that, it's San Francisco and
the rest of the Western seaboard.

145
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,518
My passenger is still as talkative as ever.

146
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,605
Whatever that thing was,

147
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:32,232
it was injecting her
with some sort of drug.

148
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:35,235
Something that causes memory loss.

149
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,073
I just hope the effects aren't permanent.

150
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,298
Your name...

151
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,510
is Alice, right?

152
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,845
She speaks.

153
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,307
Look, I am sorry about back there.

154
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,977
I don't know what happened.

155
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,440
I don't remember anything.

156
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,695
I don't even know my name.

157
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,072
It's Claire.

158
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,992
Claire Redfield.

159
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,912
Claire?

160
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:28,706
Sound familiar?

161
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,292
Not really.

162
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,462
You will get used to it.

163
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,592
Perhaps you can cut me loose now.

164
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:43,929
We should get to know each other
a little better first.

165
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,964
City of Angels.

166
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:28,640
May 6th, 1800 hours, Los Angeles.

167
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,059
No signs of life.

168
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,978
Not even the undead.

169
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,150
Some must have burnt with the city.

170
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,861
But what about the rest?

171
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,212
Oh, my God.

172
00:29:58,212 --> 00:29:59,671
What?

173
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:01,507
Look over there.

174
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,935
Damn.

175
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,283
It's a plane.

176
00:30:28,283 --> 00:30:30,536
It's a plane.

177
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,246
I knew it.

178
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,917
I told you they would come.
Hey, we're down here. Hello.

179
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,495
No way we're getting in there.

180
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,836
Where is he going?

181
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:22,254
Why is he flying away?

182
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:24,298
It's not flying away.

183
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:25,883
It's circling. Circling?

184
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,637
Damn, he's low.

185
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,098
Down.

186
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,935
What the hell is he doing?

187
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,317
He's going to land.

188
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:46,153
He's going to land.
Get the stuff out of the way.

189
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,571
Land?
Yeah.

190
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:48,780
Land.

191
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,618
That is one crazy son of a bitch.

192
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,079
This may get a little rough.

193
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,332
Then cut me loose.

194
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,425
Thanks.

195
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:10,844
Just don't do anything crazy, all right?

196
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,015
Nothing as crazy
as what you have in mind.

197
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,901
Come on, Kim, move it.
I am trying.

198
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:27,152
Well, try.

199
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,704
All right, hold on.

200
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,168
Hurry, he's coming.

201
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,757
Come on.

202
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,349
Come on, pull it. Come on.
Come on, pull.

203
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,021
Good. Good.

204
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,689
Good work.

205
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,858
That's it.

206
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:49,693
Good job.

207
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,246
Nice landing.
I think technically it's called crashing.

208
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,502
Luther West.

209
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,047
Alice. That's Claire.

210
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,634
Luther West. A pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

211
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,851
Hi, my name's Crystal.
- No, no.

212
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:26,146
Enough with the introductions.
So you're here to help us, right?

213
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:28,273
Can you get us out?
You from Arcadia?

214
00:34:28,273 --> 00:34:30,567
What did you say?
Are you from Arcadia?

215
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,653
What do you know about Arcadia?
- They said they'd help.

216
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:36,156
There are survivors.
Civilization and safety.

217
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:37,741
Infection free.

218
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:39,242
So they sent you, right?

219
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,036
No.

220
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:44,039
But there are others out there like you?

221
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,500
It's just us.

222
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,376
There's to be no rescue?

223
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,587
I am sorry.

224
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,969
Sorry.
Look, don't take it so bad.

225
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,888
They had their hopes up and...

226
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:02,599
Thought you could take them
to the promised land.

227
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,351
Angel Ortiz.

228
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,436
That was some fine flying.

229
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,105
Thanks.

230
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,116
What's the prognosis?
She will live.

231
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,784
Yeah.

232
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,911
You know,

233
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:24,579
I have the strangest feeling

234
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:26,081
I know you.

235
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,961
Yeah, I get that a lot.

236
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:32,504
You're a sports fan, huh?

237
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:34,881
Do you like basketball?

238
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:36,091
Not really.

239
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,468
No? Oh.

240
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:41,221
Well, maybe just a fan

241
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:43,014
of fine timepieces.

242
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,812
Yeah.

243
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:52,315
Luther here is our resident superstar.

244
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,026
So tell me about Arcadia.

245
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:56,695
What exactly do you know?

246
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:58,780
Just from their transmissions.

247
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,324
We have been receiving
their broadcast all week.

248
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:04,911
Food and shelter, safety
and security, no infection.

249
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:06,955
We thought they sent you.

250
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:10,250
We have been launching flares
for days to get their attention.

251
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,627
Flares?
- Yeah.

252
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,089
Who's going to see flares from Alaska?

253
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,300
Alaska?
Alaska?

254
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,343
Arcadia. I have been there.

255
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:23,471
It's in Alaska.
It's a town, or so we thought.

256
00:36:23,471 --> 00:36:25,265
A town?

257
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,683
I don't think so.

258
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,312
Take a look.

259
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:32,230
At what?

260
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,695
You see?

261
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,032
It's not a town.

262
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,535
It's a ship.

263
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,122
I recorded this from the shortwave.

264
00:36:49,122 --> 00:36:51,625
This is
Arcadia, on the emergency frequency.

265
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,418
There is no infection.

266
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:56,046
We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.

267
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:57,505
It's the same message we heard.

268
00:36:57,505 --> 00:37:00,383
They must have salled down the
coast, picking up survivors.

269
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:03,970
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

270
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:07,682
What is that?

271
00:37:07,682 --> 00:37:09,351
I don't know.

272
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:11,895
That was the last we heard from them.

273
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:14,314
Then it just stopped.

274
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,275
That was two days ago.

275
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,945
We have been sending up flares
on the hour.

276
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:23,323
So when you arrived, of course,
we thought they sent you.

277
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,250
Claire.

278
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,044
That ship over there.

279
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:37,879
That's Arcadia.

280
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,339
I know.

281
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,300
You remember?
I remember the beach.

282
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,101
People were coming to help us.

283
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,312
What happened?
Why didn't you go with the others?

284
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
I don't know.

285
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,526
I can't remember.

286
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,740
We have to get to that ship.

287
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,660
We have to get to that ship.

288
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:33,328
Welcome to your new home,
cell block B.

289
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,378
Crystal's our cook.

290
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:42,837
The menu's not extensive,

291
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:45,507
but she is a master of what she does.

292
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:47,675
Sorry I didn't bring better news.

293
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:49,344
Get used to disappointment, right?

294
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:51,554
That's what my agent used to say.

295
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:53,264
Were you an actress?

296
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,434
I came to Hollywood,
ended up waiting tables.

297
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:59,479
Why are we waiting? Excuse
me. I am hungry. Thank you.

298
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:01,731
Get out of here, man.
- Thank you.

299
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,196
I met plenty of creeps
like him in my time.

300
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,532
What's his story?

301
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:13,743
Back in the world, he was some
kind of big movie producer.

302
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:15,912
The boy's got a stick up his ass.

303
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:23,002
Kim Yong used to intern for him. Still
hasn't figured the world has changed.

304
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,726
That plane,
do you think it could still fly?

305
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,730
It can fly, but it only seats two.

306
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,566
So take us to Arcadia one at a time.

307
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:47,610
Look, I think she was lucky
to land here once.

308
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,697
Five or six times would be suicide.

309
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,449
No offence.

310
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,535
None taken.

311
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,249
There has to be another way out.

312
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:02,959
We have to get to that ship.

313
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,170
Well, there is the--

314
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,966
What?

315
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:11,759
Nothing.

316
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,638
Look, it would be a waste of your time.

317
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,392
I have time to waste.

318
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,982
When the shit hit the
fan, we took refuge in the prison.

319
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:29,652
It seemed like it had
the biggest, strongest walls.

320
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:32,572
The best chance
of keeping those things out.

321
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:37,619
By the time we got here, the guards
and the inmates were already long gone.

322
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:41,998
I guess when people
started eating one another,

323
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,376
there wasn't much point
in keeping anybody locked up.

324
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,505
We thought the place was abandoned,

325
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,007
until we made a discovery.

326
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,555
Wendell,

327
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,516
time to take a break.

328
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:02,560
It's about god-damn time.
I hate being down here.

329
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,147
I am hearing movement in the walls.

330
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:08,441
So let's check it out.

331
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,486
I will be back in a minute.

332
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,198
Come on.

333
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,404
Name's Chris.

334
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,410
You were the one flying that plane.

335
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,663
How do you know that?

336
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,375
Wendell isn't the only one that hears things.

337
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,169
I am glad you made it.

338
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,423
Maybe you can talk some sense
into these people.

339
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,384
What do you mean?

340
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,263
Isn't it obvious?

341
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:21,431
I am not a prisoner.

342
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,935
I shouldn't be in here.

343
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,358
I was working with a military unit.

344
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:35,737
We were using this place as a staging post.

345
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:41,951
Things were already bad when the order
came through to release all the inmates.

346
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:47,332
We needed as many people on the streets
as possible to fight those things.

347
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,126
And it was chaos.

348
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:54,213
We were pulling out and a gang
of the prisoners jumped me.

349
00:43:54,213 --> 00:43:56,841
I guess they thought I was a guard.

350
00:43:56,841 --> 00:44:00,553
I woke up, my unit was gone.

351
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,014
I was in here.

352
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:04,307
Their idea of a joke.

353
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,770
You don't believe me.

354
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,483
Do the others?

355
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:16,444
You need to get me out of here.

356
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:18,863
We're all trapped here.
That's true.

357
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,616
But I can help you.

358
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,618
Seen enough?

359
00:44:23,618 --> 00:44:25,620
You find anything?
No.

360
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,456
I know a way out of this place.

361
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,340
If you get me out of here,
I will do the same for you.

362
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,510
You're going to need me.

363
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,429
Have you checked
what he's talking about?

364
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:45,264
His way out?

365
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:49,310
He's not telling us shit till we let
him out. And I am not letting him out.

366
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,561
The man is a killer.

367
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:52,522
Really?
I can see it in his eyes.

368
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:54,065
How can you be so sure?

369
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:55,650
I know people.

370
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,403
Interesting.
So tell me.

371
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,572
What do you see
when you look into my eyes?

372
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,370
Whoa.

373
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,333
Holy shit.

374
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,253
Girl's got to be prepared.

375
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,174
What would you possibly want with those?

376
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,884
It's a hobby.

377
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,262
A hobby?

378
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,305
All right.

379
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,516
Well, I will see you in the morning.

380
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,195
No sign of anyone on deck.

381
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,408
Your friends are out there?

382
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,120
I think so.

383
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,664
You don't remember?

384
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,041
It's coming back.

385
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,085
Slowly.

386
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,924
Nothing that makes any sense.

387
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,280
We still have running water.

388
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,073
That's very civilized.

389
00:47:49,073 --> 00:47:50,533
We do our best.

390
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,329
It's cold.

391
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,790
Our best only goes so far.

392
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,251
These are for you.
Thank you.

393
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,714
I guess I should leave you to it.

394
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,007
I guess you should.

395
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,508
I will be right outside.

396
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:09,302
Thank you.

397
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,115
Luther?

398
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,292
Take it easy, honey. Move it.

399
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,587
Okay, I am just going to
be on my way now.

400
00:49:26,587 --> 00:49:29,340
Okay, take it easy.
Take it easy.

401
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,967
Get out of my sight.

402
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,582
What is that smell?

403
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:05,710
Must have burrowed up from the sewers.

404
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,337
Wendell said he heard things moving.

405
00:50:08,337 --> 00:50:11,173
What? So these things
can just burst out anywhere?

406
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,426
We got to get out of this place.

407
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:15,261
Arcadia will send help.

408
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:17,805
No one's coming to get us.
Okay? No one.

409
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,418
We have to help ourselves.

410
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,254
This plane that you have.
Won't hold everybody.

411
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:25,048
Well, we can draw straws.
- No.

412
00:50:25,048 --> 00:50:28,134
We all get out of here
and no one gets left behind.

413
00:50:28,134 --> 00:50:29,510
Great.

414
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,346
How are we going to do that?

415
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:33,890
Walk out of here,
just single file?

416
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,768
Are you crazy?

417
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:39,604
They didn't want him getting out.
- He's dangerous.

418
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:42,607
Angel, what do you think?

419
00:50:43,525 --> 00:50:45,568
I think we don't have much of a choice.

420
00:50:45,568 --> 00:50:47,237
This is insane.

421
00:50:47,237 --> 00:50:49,906
Crystal, Crystal, look
at me. What do you think?

422
00:50:49,906 --> 00:50:55,495
I mean, not even you're that dumb.
I guess I am. I agree with Angel.

423
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,998
If this guy thinks he knows
a way out, I want to hear it.

424
00:50:58,998 --> 00:51:00,708
All right.

425
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,669
Seriously?

426
00:51:03,379 --> 00:51:06,256
This is a mistake.

427
00:51:06,256 --> 00:51:09,550
This is a big mistake.
You better keep your eyes on him.

428
00:51:22,356 --> 00:51:25,024
I was wondering
how long it would take.

429
00:51:37,997 --> 00:51:39,163
Boo.
I--

430
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:41,874
all right,
let's get the hell out of here.

431
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:46,087
Claire?

432
00:51:46,087 --> 00:51:47,630
What?

433
00:51:50,968 --> 00:51:52,218
Claire, it's me.

434
00:51:57,391 --> 00:51:59,475
It's Chris.

435
00:52:02,479 --> 00:52:03,980
I don't know you.

436
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,648
Claire.

437
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:07,400
I am your brother, remember?

438
00:52:08,986 --> 00:52:11,654
What the hell's happened to you?

439
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,240
It's okay.

440
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,658
Let him go.

441
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:22,790
Look, she suffered
some sort of memory loss.

442
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,001
If you really are her brother,

443
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:27,211
it will come back.

444
00:52:28,213 --> 00:52:30,506
All right, this is very touching.
I mean the family reunion.

445
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:36,179
If we could just get a move on, please,
before we're all eaten the fuck alive.

446
00:52:45,481 --> 00:52:50,151
Behind those doors is a
UPV, urban pacification vehicle.

447
00:52:50,151 --> 00:52:52,904
The prison kept it
in case of a serious riot.

448
00:52:52,904 --> 00:52:57,533
Sixteen-wheeler, steel plate,
water cannon. It seats 20.

449
00:52:57,533 --> 00:52:59,660
Ten tons of fun.

450
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,830
We roll on out in style,
drive right over them.

451
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:06,167
The lock's jammed.
But we can cut through it.

452
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:09,379
When we hit the coast,
we have to transfer to a boat.

453
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:12,382
We're going to need more fire-power.
- I got you covered.

454
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:16,219
When I was stationed here,
we used the basement as an armoury.

455
00:53:16,219 --> 00:53:18,596
It's got every weapon you can dream of.

456
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:22,016
How do you know your unit
didn't take them with them?

457
00:53:22,016 --> 00:53:23,810
Because by the end

458
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,188
there were more guns than
there were people to use them.

459
00:53:31,193 --> 00:53:33,403
You go get the guns. Luther.

460
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:38,783
Oh, my God.

461
00:53:45,374 --> 00:53:47,125
What is this?

462
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:49,961
They had pumps to keep the
water out of the foundations.

463
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:51,629
When the electricity failed,

464
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:54,757
some of the lower levels
started filling up.

465
00:53:54,757 --> 00:53:57,343
There's another two floors down there.

466
00:53:57,343 --> 00:53:59,679
And how far down is the armoury?

467
00:54:00,097 --> 00:54:01,889
All the way.

468
00:54:04,184 --> 00:54:05,977
Luther, come on.

469
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:07,937
Get back. Get back.

470
00:54:14,987 --> 00:54:16,821
Where do you think you're going?

471
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:19,407
I was a swim champ back in high school.

472
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:22,785
Is that right?
Here.

473
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,959
You're going to trust me with a gun?

474
00:54:30,419 --> 00:54:33,004
Yeah. Why not?

475
00:54:35,591 --> 00:54:37,592
Luther, just shoot that mother-fucker.

476
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:46,142
What the fuck is that thing?

477
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,288
All right.

478
00:57:12,664 --> 00:57:13,831
Let's go.

479
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:34,602
Let's go.

480
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:01,921
Nice.

481
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:18,229
Damn.

482
00:58:35,997 --> 00:58:38,791
There must be
hundreds of them out there.

483
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:41,669
We can't go back that way.

484
00:58:46,925 --> 00:58:49,301
Oh, shit.
What do you mean, "oh, shit"?

485
00:58:49,301 --> 00:58:51,554
What--?
What is this?

486
00:58:52,013 --> 00:58:53,264
What do you think it is?

487
00:58:53,264 --> 00:58:55,850
Don't tell me that thing
fits inside of there.

488
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,893
Can you put this back together?

489
00:58:57,893 --> 00:59:00,187
Maybe, but it could take a week.

490
00:59:01,064 --> 00:59:02,398
What do we do now?

491
00:59:03,108 --> 00:59:04,650
I know.

492
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:11,949
Bennett,

493
00:59:13,452 --> 00:59:15,327
what have you done?

494
00:59:21,835 --> 00:59:24,378
Luther,
we got to get out of here. Come on.

495
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:53,282
Did you hear that?

496
00:59:58,997 --> 01:00:00,414
Come on, baby. Come on.

497
01:00:00,414 --> 01:00:02,291
What are we doing?
Getting out.

498
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:04,335
But the others.
Fuck the others.

499
01:00:04,335 --> 01:00:06,086
Now, get on-board.

500
01:00:06,086 --> 01:00:08,297
Bennett, what are you doing?

501
01:00:08,632 --> 01:00:11,258
Hey.
Kim Yong. Don't do this.

502
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:12,676
Open this door.

503
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:16,222
Bennett, please.

504
01:00:21,228 --> 01:00:22,978
Bennett.

505
01:00:29,611 --> 01:00:30,986
Oh, shit.

506
01:00:32,614 --> 01:00:35,282
That's right, bitch. Fuck you.

507
01:00:39,996 --> 01:00:42,790
Yes. Yes.

508
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,416
Son of a bitch.

509
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:46,752
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

510
01:00:47,128 --> 01:00:49,630
He's headed for the Arcadia.

511
01:01:01,852 --> 01:01:03,060
Alice.

512
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:25,749
Come on.

513
01:01:41,016 --> 01:01:42,391
Head for the shower block.

514
01:01:44,978 --> 01:01:47,062
Move.
I will meet you there.

515
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,567
This thing has no power.

516
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:54,194
We won't need power.

517
01:01:58,533 --> 01:01:59,950
Oh, shit.

518
01:02:13,423 --> 01:02:15,257
Hold on.

519
01:02:23,934 --> 01:02:25,935
Hey, head to
the shower block. Go.

520
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:28,706
Over here.

521
01:04:18,548 --> 01:04:21,508
Are you all right?
I am fine. Thanks.

522
01:04:24,471 --> 01:04:27,222
This is some kind of joke, right?

523
01:04:27,222 --> 01:04:30,976
The tunnels lead to the sewers,
the sewers lead to the storm drain.

524
01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:33,437
This storm drain leads to the sea.

525
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:36,440
It's our only chance.
I will take point.

526
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,691
I got your back.

527
01:04:41,446 --> 01:04:42,696
Ladies.

528
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:49,745
All right, you're next.

529
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:53,624
I can't do it.
You can.

530
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56,001
Let's go.

531
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,792
Aah.
Shh.

532
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:07,169
Those things are close.

533
01:09:09,797 --> 01:09:13,717
We found a way out just down there.
The tunnels drop into a storm drain.

534
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:16,219
Go. Be careful.

535
01:09:24,145 --> 01:09:25,354
Where's Kim Yong?

536
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,484
Go. Go.

537
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:47,584
I knew you'd make it.

538
01:09:57,011 --> 01:09:58,804
Luther.

539
01:09:59,597 --> 01:10:00,764
Help.

540
01:10:05,103 --> 01:10:07,145
Luther.

541
01:10:11,776 --> 01:10:13,527
You can't help him now.

542
01:10:15,696 --> 01:10:17,364
We have to move on.

543
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,748
No welcome party,
huh?

544
01:12:08,809 --> 01:12:10,977
It looks like Bennett made it.

545
01:12:13,105 --> 01:12:15,190
Let's check inside.

546
01:12:33,251 --> 01:12:35,877
Did you find anyone?
Nothing.

547
01:12:35,877 --> 01:12:39,464
I checked the crew
quarters. They're all gone.

548
01:12:39,464 --> 01:12:42,050
Looks like they left in a hurry.

549
01:12:43,386 --> 01:12:46,805
This is Arcadia,
broadcasting on the emergency frequency.

550
01:12:46,805 --> 01:12:51,101
There is no infection. We offer
safety and security, food and shelter.

551
01:12:52,812 --> 01:12:55,564
Fuel, power,
everything's running normally.

552
01:12:55,564 --> 01:12:56,815
Look at this.

553
01:12:56,815 --> 01:12:58,775
It's the ship's log.

554
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:01,444
The crew launched
the lifeboats three days ago.

555
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:04,489
Exactly when the transmissions stopped.

556
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:07,450
But it says there are
still 2000 survivors on-board.

557
01:13:15,209 --> 01:13:18,336
We have to search
every inch of this ship.

558
01:13:34,604 --> 01:13:36,354
Umbrella.

559
01:13:36,354 --> 01:13:38,273
Of course.

560
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:41,151
I remember them coming for us.

561
01:13:58,377 --> 01:14:03,673
This whole thing, Arcadia, was a lie.

562
01:14:04,008 --> 01:14:05,175
No, it's worse than that.

563
01:14:06,761 --> 01:14:07,969
It's a trap.

564
01:14:43,381 --> 01:14:45,423
Where is everybody?

565
01:14:49,095 --> 01:14:50,595
I don't understand.

566
01:14:58,854 --> 01:15:00,605
I think I do.

567
01:15:01,941 --> 01:15:03,692
They're underneath our feet.

568
01:15:10,783 --> 01:15:13,576
They're holding
survivors to experiment on them.

569
01:15:15,746 --> 01:15:17,122
Look.

570
01:15:17,998 --> 01:15:20,208
It's K-Mart. She's here.

571
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,459
Bring them up.

572
01:15:22,712 --> 01:15:24,421
All of them.

573
01:15:43,691 --> 01:15:45,567
Here she is.

574
01:15:45,776 --> 01:15:46,776
K-Mart.

575
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:47,986
Get her out.

576
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,702
K-Mart, it's okay.
It's okay.

577
01:15:55,702 --> 01:15:57,495
K-Mart, it's all right.

578
01:15:57,495 --> 01:15:59,748
I will get this off her.
Let everyone out.

579
01:16:00,374 --> 01:16:03,168
We're your friends.
Right now, we need your help.

580
01:16:03,502 --> 01:16:05,462
Let me get this off you.

581
01:18:46,624 --> 01:18:49,292
Why am I not surprised?

582
01:18:49,543 --> 01:18:51,711
You weren't too hard to find.

583
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:54,797
Our satellite system is still operational.

584
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:58,176
And there aren't too many people
flying nowadays.

585
01:18:58,176 --> 01:19:03,181
And besides, I always knew
you'd be drawn to your friends.

586
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:05,433
Loyalty,

587
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,019
highly overrated.

588
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:13,316
Stop.

589
01:19:14,652 --> 01:19:16,402
Down.

590
01:19:17,696 --> 01:19:20,698
Wouldn't want you harming my pets.

591
01:19:23,285 --> 01:19:24,661
Drop your guns.

592
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:33,544
Thank you.
Kick them to me.

593
01:19:36,256 --> 01:19:37,882
Good.

594
01:19:40,886 --> 01:19:43,012
You don't look so good, Bennett.

595
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:46,391
Yeah, I am looking forward
to playing with your pretty face.

596
01:19:46,391 --> 01:19:48,309
What do you want from me?

597
01:19:48,309 --> 01:19:51,729
The T-Virus brought me back.

598
01:19:56,276 --> 01:19:58,820
But it's so strong.

599
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,156
It fights me for control.

600
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:06,035
I thought if I ingested fresh human DNA,

601
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:08,204
I could redress the balance.

602
01:20:08,789 --> 01:20:11,541
No wonder your crew abandoned ship.

603
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:13,042
No matter.

604
01:20:13,419 --> 01:20:15,336
Now I have a new subordinate.

605
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:18,006
And a new plan.

606
01:20:18,006 --> 01:20:22,260
You were the only one who
successfully bonded with the T-Virus.

607
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:25,555
Your DNA is stronger than the others.

608
01:20:25,555 --> 01:20:27,890
I ingest you,

609
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:30,226
I gain control.

610
01:20:32,855 --> 01:20:34,939
That's pretty smart thinking.

611
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:38,067
There's only one problem with that plan.

612
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,403
Stop right there.

613
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,739
And what is that?

614
01:20:43,073 --> 01:20:45,324
I am not on the menu.

615
01:21:24,406 --> 01:21:28,284
Well, isn't this
one big family reunion?

616
01:21:28,577 --> 01:21:31,537
Chris and Claire Redfield.

617
01:21:31,537 --> 01:21:35,875
You have really become quite
an inconvenience for me.

618
01:21:37,169 --> 01:21:40,004
I told you
I'd be bringing a few friends.

619
01:21:44,384 --> 01:21:47,178
You should have brought more.

620
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:05,214
Claire. Claire.

621
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:12,191
Chris.

622
01:23:58,268 --> 01:24:01,479
Don't even think about it.

623
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,488
Who the fuck are you?

624
01:25:01,915 --> 01:25:03,040
I don't think so.

625
01:25:25,272 --> 01:25:28,024
Don't-- Don't you shut them.
I am a producer.

626
01:25:30,277 --> 01:25:32,361
Open those doors.

627
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:35,239
You are going to deal with
some serious consequences.

628
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:37,199
You mother-fuckers.

629
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,368
Open the--

630
01:25:43,123 --> 01:25:44,874
You're going to live to regret this,

631
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:46,250
all of you.

632
01:25:53,383 --> 01:25:55,176
Oh, God.

633
01:25:56,178 --> 01:25:58,304
I just want to go home.

634
01:26:06,772 --> 01:26:07,938
Hey,

635
01:26:07,938 --> 01:26:10,024
it's going to be okay.

636
01:26:12,402 --> 01:26:13,611
No.

637
01:26:13,611 --> 01:26:15,404
Chris. Alice.

638
01:26:35,175 --> 01:26:36,675
Come on.

639
01:27:20,053 --> 01:27:22,263
I didn't want you to miss that.
Oh, heh, heh.

640
01:27:41,783 --> 01:27:43,617
That's right.

641
01:27:44,703 --> 01:27:46,996
Star power, bitches.

642
01:27:58,049 --> 01:28:00,009
It's a miracle.

643
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:05,389
I never dreamed there would
be this many of us left alive.

644
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,603
So, what's next?

645
01:28:15,358 --> 01:28:17,818
This is Arcadia,
broadcasting on the emergency frequency--

646
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,615
I say...

647
01:28:23,408 --> 01:28:25,367
we live up to the promise.

648
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:30,414
This is Arcadia, broadcasting
on the emergency frequency.

649
01:28:30,414 --> 01:28:36,045
Location 118.30 degrees west,
34.05 degrees north.

650
01:28:36,045 --> 01:28:37,796
There is no infection.

651
01:28:37,796 --> 01:28:40,841
Repeat, there is no infection.

652
01:28:40,841 --> 01:28:45,596
We offer safety and security,
food and shelter.

653
01:28:45,596 --> 01:28:49,391
If you are out there,
we will help you.

654
01:28:49,643 --> 01:28:51,602
There is hope.

655
01:29:16,294 --> 01:29:19,004
What is that?
Trouble.

656
01:30:32,954 --> 01:30:35,581
Deployment in T-minus 57 seconds.

657
01:30:35,581 --> 01:30:38,542
When you hit the deck,
you watch your formation.

658
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:40,836
Take no prisoners and shoot to kill.

659
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:43,088
Total enemy numbers are unknown

660
01:30:43,088 --> 01:30:46,592
but will include Umbrella fugitives
and prime targets.

661
01:30:46,592 --> 01:30:50,971
Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield
and Project Alice.

662
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:53,223
So, people,

663
01:30:53,223 --> 01:30:58,187
whatever's waiting for you out there,
just know one thing:

664
01:30:58,772 --> 01:31:02,608
You are going to be in for the fight

665
01:31:02,608 --> 01:31:05,069
of your lives.

666
01:36:44,909 --> 01:36:46,201
Hey, boys.

667
01:36:46,201 --> 01:36:49,371
Is that any way to treat a lady?
