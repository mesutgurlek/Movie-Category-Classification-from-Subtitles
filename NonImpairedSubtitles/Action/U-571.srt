1
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,019
<i>There he is. Hey, Andy! Where you been?
It's an all-hands function.</i>

2
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,519
Come here. I want you to meet Joanie.
Joanie, this is Andy Tyler.

3
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,988
- Hello.
- My best friend. We went to Annapolis together.

4
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,083
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, I got you one of Larson's stogies.

5
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,287
- To our navy's next sub skipper.
- Thank you.

6
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,595
Lieutenant! Gonna hoist up a few beers
with the enlisted boys later?

7
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,602
- You got it, Griggs.
- All right.

8
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,208
- <i>Mr. Tyler! Mr. Tyler!</i>
- Hmm?

9
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,278
My mom is here visiting.
Can I bring her over to meet you?

10
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,644
- Sure thing, Trigger.
- That's the lieutenant I was talking about.

11
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,356
Lieutenant Tyler!

12
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,121
Hello there, Prudence, Louise.
Mrs. Dahlgren, Captain.

13
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,197
Where's your date, Andy?
It's not like you to arrive stag.

14
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,893
I'm afraid I couldn't get one
on such short notice, ma'am.

15
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,902
Captain, could I have a word with you?

16
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,167
- Certainly. Darling, will you excuse us?
- Okay.

17
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,207
Be right back.

18
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,181
I didn't get my boat.

19
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,224
I know.

20
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,386
With all due respect, sir,
there's only one way that could've happened,

21
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,522
and that's if you withheld
your recommendation.

22
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,329
That's right.
I just don't think you're ready.

23
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,928
What do you mean,
I'm not ready?

24
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,739
Sir, I have worked my tail off on the S-33.
I'm qualified in every area and then some.

25
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,506
- No executive officer has higher marks than I do.
- Andy!

26
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,741
You're just not ready to take
on a command of your own.

27
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:34,258
Now I've made my decision.
It's done.

28
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,463
<i>Mr. Tyler.
How you doing, sir?</i>

29
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,898
- Having a good time?
- Hell, yeah, Chief.

30
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:50,305
- <i>How about you?</i>
- I'm looking forward to getting underway.

31
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,809
I'm a sea dog.
Need some salt, sir.

32
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,577
He torpedoed me, Chief.

33
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,950
Nine months aboard the S-33,

34
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,252
doing the best job I know how.

35
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,553
Doing everything once
and then doing it again,

36
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,791
just to make sure
I didn't miss anything the first time.

37
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,197
You'll get your chance, sir.
There's other commands in the navy.

38
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:25,240
You knew?

39
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,437
Didn't warn me.

40
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,344
Ain't my place, sir.

41
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,511
<i>Club's secured!
Time to go!</i>

42
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,324
- Let's go. Get out.
- Everyone out.

43
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,918
Come on, let's go.

44
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,190
What's the meaning of this, Sergeant?

45
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,426
- You the senior man?
- That's right. I'm the X.O. of the S-33.

46
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,163
These men have a 48-hour liberty pass.

47
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,671
No, sir, not no more.

48
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,985
What the hell are those yardbirds
doing to my boat?

49
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,988
<i>Looks like a goddamn Nazi submarine.</i>

50
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,083
Hey, Andy.
This is a fine navy day.

51
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:57,531
They wouldn't give me five minutes
to consummate my marriage. Five minutes!

52
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,799
- What's going on here?
- Hell if I know. Put your cover on.

53
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,238
Yes, sir.

54
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,936
- Mr. Tyler, call the crew to quarters.
- <i>Aye, Captain.</i>

55
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:11,506
Quarters! Everybody fall in!
Let's get in formation now!

56
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,347
Let's go! Now!
Formation!

57
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,219
<i>Prepare crew three.
Muster with First Lieutenant.</i>

58
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,225
<i>Prepare crew three.
Muster with First Lieutenant.</i>

59
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,125
Captain Dahlgren, all crew members
present and accounted for, sir!

60
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,255
Very well. At ease.

61
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,737
I'm sorry your liberty's been cut short,
but our schedule's changed.

62
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:37,298
We have two hours to get stowed for sea
and set the maneuvering watch.

63
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,209
Mr. Larson, have your torpedo men
load the tubes with their four best fish.

64
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,942
<i>Mr. Emmett, warm up the diesels
and line up a battery charge.</i>

65
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,146
<i>Mr. Tyler, we have dry stores, ordnance
and perishables to get belowdecks.</i>

66
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:55,590
Gentlemen, it's our turn.
That's all.

67
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:59,152
Attention!

68
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,165
Aye, Captain.

69
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,596
- Crew dismissed!
- You heard the man! Stores load!

70
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,971
You got six seconds to get on your
boondockers and dungarees and turn to!

71
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,976
Mr. Tyler, is this for real,
or is it a drill?

72
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,978
"It's our turn"--
what does that mean?

73
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,844
<i>I thought we had a two-day liberty pass.
What's going on?</i>

74
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,183
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Get your jobs done now.

75
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,224
<i>All off-going duty officers,
report to the dock.</i>

76
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,761
Captain Dahlgren, could you fill me in
on what's going on, sir?

77
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,023
We're obviously not going
to the Caribbean Station.

78
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,032
No, we're not.
We're going on a special op.

79
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,695
You'll be briefed with Mr. Emmett
and Mr. Larson once we get underway.

80
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,637
- Aye, sir.
- Andy, listen.

81
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,731
I'm gonna need the very best
from you on this run,

82
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,777
regardless of any differences
you may have with me.

83
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,245
Are we clear on that?

84
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,873
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

85
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:56,944
Now go find Radioman Wentz and quietly
escort him to the materiel office.

86
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,464
Mr. Tyler.
How are you, son?

87
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,433
I'm fine, Admiral Duke.
What brings you up here?

88
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,697
He does.
That's Lieutenant Hirsch.

89
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,864
<i>He's gonna be riding your boat.</i>

90
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:19,604
<i>You're not working for Sublant on this run.
Mr. Hirsch has operational control.</i>

91
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,647
He's the boss.
Anything he wants, he gets.

92
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,286
Fine.

93
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,723
Is this him?

94
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,711
Yes, sir.

95
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,145
- <i>He'll do.</i>
- Thank you, Wentz. That's all for now.

96
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:39,714
- <i>Lieutenant, prepare the boat to get underway.</i>
- Aye, sir. Admiral.

97
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,564
Mr. Tyler, please,

98
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,864
don't tell the other guys
I'm half German.

99
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,870
They'll hate me.

100
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,734
Yeah, sure thing, Wentz.

101
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,715
<i>Prepare crew three.
Muster with First Lieutenant.</i>

102
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,217
<i>Prepare crew three.
Muster with First Lieutenant.</i>

103
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,089
<i>Duty Officer Lane
to the paint shop.</i>

104
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,097
<i>Duty Officer to the paint shop.</i>

105
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,831
You all right, Mr. Tyler?

106
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,740
Tiptop, Eddie.
Tiptop.

107
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,180
Wanna thank you for that liberty pass.

108
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,285
My girl thanks you too.

109
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,953
You're a good man, Mr. Tyler.

110
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,459
<i>Heart's in the right place.</i>

111
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,961
<i>Just need to give it some time.</i>

112
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,368
Yeah, I heard about
what happened to you.

113
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:04,802
That's one of the advantages of bein' seen
and... not bein' seen.

114
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,942
You'd be surprised some of the shit
we mess-doers hear.

115
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,506
<i>Boy, don't go droppin' my eggs.</i>

116
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,553
Damn.
Excuse me, Mr. Tyler.

117
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,488
Look, all you gotta do is pick 'em up
with both hands, boy, both hands!

118
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,253
Tyler!

119
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,332
When the hell were you gonna tell me?
I hear this from the chief.

120
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,595
What do you want me to say?
He shit-canned me.

121
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,602
Now you're gonna transfer
to another boat.

122
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,867
Excuse me. Can either one of you two tell me
where I can find the exec of this thing?

123
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,273
Yeah, that's me, mac. Move your truck.
We'll unload shortly.

124
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,506
You'll unload it now.
Here's the manifest.

125
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,844
- Get those crates belowdecks.
- <i>Who the hell are you?</i>

126
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,182
Marine Major Coonan, Office of Naval Intelligence.
I'm goin' to sea with you boys.

127
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:53,691
That's my luggage.
You got a problem, talk to Mr. Hirsch.

128
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,970
- <i>Clear!</i>
- Cast off all lines forward!

129
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,309
- <i>Cast off forward!</i>
- <i>Take in all lines aft.</i>

130
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,315
<i>Cast off aft!</i>

131
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,545
Rudder amidships,
all ahead one-third.

132
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,146
<i>All ahead one-third!</i>

133
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,635
Bridge hatch shut.

134
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,874
<i>Engine room, secure the diesels.
Shift propulsion to the battery.</i>

135
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,507
Engine room, secure diesels,
shift propulsion to the battery.

136
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,518
- Main induction indicates shut.
- <i>Aye.</i>

137
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,178
- Green board, Skipper.
- Very well.

138
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,190
Passing the 100-fathom curve.
On course, on time, sir.

139
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,193
Engine room reports secured diesels,
propulsion switched to battery.

140
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,992
- Very well. All ahead two-thirds.
- All ahead two-thirds, aye.

141
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:44,432
Mr. Emmett, take her down. Make her depth
1-5-0 feet, ten degree down bubble.

142
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,266
One-five-zero feet, ten degree down bubble.
Aye, sir.

143
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,603
Chief of the watch, sound the dive alarm.
Pass the word to 1MC.

144
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,177
- Open the main ballast tank vents.
- Aye, sir, passing the word.

145
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,681
Dive, dive, dive.

146
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,616
<i>Sir, main ballast tank vents
indicate open.</i>

147
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,622
- Aye. Both planes dive, 15 degrees.
- <i>Both planes dive, 15 degrees.</i>

148
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,857
<i>All clear!</i>

149
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,419
- <i>Decks awash.</i>
- <i>Decks awash. Aye, sir.</i>

150
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,820
First time on a submarine?

151
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,829
That's right.

152
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,066
Six-zero feet.

153
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,731
<i>Lower the scope.</i>

154
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:01,445
Captain, engine room reports minor flooding
from shaft seals and brine pump.

155
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,107
- <i>Bilge is at 18 inches and rising.</i>
- <i>Very well.</i>

156
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,476
<i>How deep does this thing go?</i>

157
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,522
She'll go all the way to the bottom
if we don't stop her.

158
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,353
Normally we try not to get
below 150 feet.

159
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,450
Any deeper, the leaks overwhelm the pumps.

160
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,223
<i>These S-boats are antiques,</i>

161
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,231
<i>older than most of the crew.</i>

162
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,596
- <i>One-zero-zero feet.</i>
- <i>Aye.</i>

163
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,077
Excuse me, Mr. Emmett.

164
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,148
Put a pipe patch on it,
lash it with marline.

165
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,584
- <i>The yard can fix it when we get back to port.</i>
- Aye, sir.

166
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:48,319
Relax, gentlemen.
She's old, but she'll hold.

167
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,020
<i>Last night, at 0300 hours,</i>

168
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,999
<i>a British destroyer reported depth charging
and sinking a German U-boat.</i>

169
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,502
However, some time thereafter,

170
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:04,041
Allied direction finding stations
triangulated a coded enemy radio signal...

171
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,339
to this position here,
near the chop line.

172
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,244
We believe the U-boat was disabled,
not sunk,

173
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,146
and is drifting eastward
on a four-knot current.

174
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,311
<i>Now, French resistance
reported a resupply submarine...</i>

175
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,720
sailed from the Lorient U-boat pens
yesterday afternoon,

176
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,725
with engine parts and mechanics.

177
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:25,319
We believe it's gonna rendezvous
with the disabled U-boat.

178
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,996
On board that U-boat is this.

179
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,133
- A typewriter?
- An Enigma code machine.

180
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,973
It allows the German navy to communicate
with its submarines in secret,

181
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,175
and our inability to decipher their messages
is costing us this war.

182
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:50,152
- Mr. Coonan?
- All right, this is basically a Trojan Horse operation.

183
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:55,022
The S-33 will rendezvous with the U-boat,
posing as the German resupply sub.

184
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:59,028
I will lead a boarding party dressed in
Kriegsmarine uniforms to the enemy submarine.

185
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,099
<i>We will take it by force
and secure the Enigma.</i>

186
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,068
Any German survivors will be transferred
to the S-33, and the U-boat will be scuttled.

187
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,833
The German resupply submarine
will arrive at the rendezvous...

188
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,137
and will assume that the U-boat
succumbed to its wounds and sank.

189
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,542
The Germans must never suspect
we have the Enigma.

190
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,444
- <i>That is vital.</i>
- So it's a race?

191
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,211
- <i>Yes, effectively.</i>
- Who's the boarding party?

192
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,582
Well, since you're the X.O., you, sir.

193
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,747
Mr. Emmett, Mr. Larson, Mr. Hirsch
and nine of your ship's company.

194
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,883
<i>The captain, of course,
will remain onboard the S-33.</i>

195
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:34,762
Mr. Coonan, our boys are submarine sailors,
not combat Marines.

196
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,834
The boys onboard that U-boat
are sailors too.

197
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,871
Your men'll be ready, Lieutenant.
I'll train them myself.

198
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,907
You've come to the right boat.

199
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,621
<i>Ahoy! Friends!</i>

200
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,223
<i>Stop! We have many wounded!</i>

201
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,326
Take us prisoner, please!
We'll be no trouble.

202
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,639
<i>Give us a hand!</i>

203
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,147
We need water... and food!

204
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,529
<i>We just want to get home!</i>

205
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:56,005
Give us a hand!

206
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,337
<i>We have no--</i>

207
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,536
<i>I'm telling you, she was hotter
than Dorothy Lamour.</i>

208
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,770
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I could tell she was interested,</i>

209
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,243
but she was classy, you know?

210
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,406
The type of girl that wants you
to take her to a country club dance.

211
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,679
- <i>Yeah? Like you've ever seen the inside of a country club?</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

212
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,755
<i>Like I'd even want to, all right?</i>

213
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,257
<i>Anyway, I can see I'm not
getting anywhere with her,</i>

214
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,227
<i>so what I do is,
I use my secret weapon.</i>

215
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,527
<i>I tell her about the S-26.
Does the trick right away.</i>

216
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,898
Don't be talking about that
while we're underway.

217
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,403
- Why? What happened with the S-26?
- Yeah, what happened?

218
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,306
- You guys don't know?
- <i>No.</i>

219
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,737
She was running a test dive
down off Norfolk.

220
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,317
Shaft seal failed.

221
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,785
<i>She sunk to 400 feet.</i>

222
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,823
Know how much water pressure
there is that deep?

223
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,937
Mazzola, you will be the first one
eating powdered eggs on this cruise.

224
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,443
<i>Keep it up, you hear?</i>

225
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,685
Come in.

226
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:58,019
This is our position, Captain.
We're still bucking some pretty heavy seas.

227
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,621
I estimate us to be
about three hours behind schedule.

228
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,133
I told Mr. Emmett to run at flank speed
and hold off a trim dive...

229
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:08,137
- until we make up the lost time.
- That's fine, Lieutenant.

230
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:13,174
You're a first-rate X.O., Andy.

231
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,178
A damn good submariner.

232
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,845
I know the men like you.

233
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,920
I'd give my life
for any one of them, sir.

234
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:27,253
I know you would.
I'm not questioning your bravery.

235
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,758
The question is:
What about their lives?

236
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,098
You and Mr. Emmett are good friends.

237
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,294
You went to the Academy together.

238
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,395
Would you be willing
to sacrifice his life?

239
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,498
<i>Or what about some
of the younger enlisted men?</i>

240
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,942
You know, a lot of those guys
look up to you like a big brother.

241
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,105
You willing to lay their lives
on the line?

242
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,185
You see? You hesitate.

243
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,620
But as a captain, you can't.

244
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,783
You have to act.

245
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,885
If you don't,
you put the entire crew at risk.

246
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:09,524
<i>Now that's the job.
It's not a science.</i>

247
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:14,401
<i>You have to be able to make hard decisions,
based on imperfect information.</i>

248
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:18,271
<i>Asking men to carry out orders
that may result in their deaths.</i>

249
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:23,871
<i>And if you're wrong,
you suffer the consequences.</i>

250
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,474
If you're not prepared
to make those decisions...

251
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:32,648
without pause, without reflection,

252
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:35,817
then you've got no business
being a submarine captain.

253
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,000
<i>Tell Mr. Hirsch I'd like
a word with him, would you?</i>

254
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,972
Aye, sir.

255
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,896
- <i>More soup, Captain?</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

256
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:00,102
I wish I was going with you, gentlemen.

257
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,271
I feel the same way you do, Carson.

258
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,111
Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast.

259
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,344
To the officers and crew of the S-33...

260
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:12,048
<i>and our distinguished guests,
Mr. Hirsch and Mr. Coonan.</i>

261
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,751
- Success, gentlemen!
- Success.

262
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,993
- Captain Dahlgren, sir?
- What is it, Wentz?

263
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,501
<i>Chief says we've picked up
a radar contact at 0-7-0.</i>

264
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,504
Very well. Mr. Larson?

265
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,951
Signal lamp off the starboard bow!

266
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,061
<i>I see it.</i>

267
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:58,332
Pass the word along:
Submarine sighted off the starboard bow.

268
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,461
- Stand by to man battle stations.
- Aye, sir.

269
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,471
All right, here we go.
One last time.

270
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:10,445
<i>Lieutenant Tyler's raft gets from the conning
tower aft. My raft gets the gun crew.</i>

271
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,880
And no one-- no one--
shoots till I shoot first.

272
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,145
- <i>You read me?</i>
- Yes, sir.

273
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:19,087
Outstanding. Lock and load.

274
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,099
It'll be all right, son.

275
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,736
<i>Captain, I estimate the German resupply sub
has a 14-knot speed of advance.</i>

276
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,040
- My latest plot puts them at 12 hours away, sir.
- Very well, Mr. Larson.

277
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:46,242
<i>Captain, the boarding party's ready, sir.
Await your go-ahead.</i>

278
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,911
<i>Put her low in the water. I wanna give
that U-boat as little silhouette as we can.</i>

279
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,518
- <i>Sir?</i>
- Prepare to disembark the boarding party.

280
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,525
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

281
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,062
If this thing goes south,

282
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,430
I will blow that Nazi boat
right out of the water.

283
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,935
- Understood, sir.
- Very well.

284
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,761
All set, Captain.

285
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,770
Now you listen to me.

286
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,363
You get them their damn trophy
and get the hell outta there.

287
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,501
- Aye, sir.
- The boys are gonna be fine.

288
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,339
I know they will, sir.

289
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,084
Good luck, Andy.

290
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,255
Godspeed, Skipper.

291
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:38,779
<i>Easy, Mr. Hirsch.
We're almost there.</i>

292
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,016
We'll bushwhack 'em real good.

293
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:49,663
All right, we got 12 men topside,
three on the bridge,

294
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,531
<i>four on the foredeck,
five aft.</i>

295
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:56,004
<i>Now remember:
Both rafts need to be tied up...</i>

296
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,201
<i>before we move.</i>

297
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,680
Jesus H. Christ.
They got machine guns.

298
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,148
<i>Steady, gentlemen.</i>

299
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,151
Wait for the signal.

300
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,734
Mr. Hirsch.

301
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,681
Mr. Hirsch.

302
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,179
- Hello the boat, you asshole.
- Shut up.

303
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,993
Goddamn you, Hirsch, say something.

304
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,118
<i>Let's go! Board this thing!
Get out of the rafts!</i>

305
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,826
Conning tower!
Move, move!

306
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,291
Clear the conning tower now!

307
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,302
<i>Another one there!</i>

308
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:45,004
- <i>Griggs is hit!</i>
- <i>Get him off!</i>

309
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,540
Move, move!
Trigger, on the back!

310
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,510
Griggs! Griggs!

311
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,816
- <i>We gotta get inside!</i>
- Griggs!

312
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,392
<i>Chief, Tank, come down now!</i>

313
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,028
Ready?

314
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,529
Quick, open it!
Fire!

315
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,572
Tyler, let's go!
Inside!

316
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,301
<i>Cover your men!
Go, go!</i>

317
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,047
<i>Don't let 'em close it.
Don't let 'em close it!</i>

318
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:51,436
Two, three, four, five.
Shut it.

319
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,375
Let's go. Go!
Get down! Go!

320
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,605
<i>Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!</i>

321
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:11,617
Get off him, get off him!
Don't move, don't move! Get back, get back!

322
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,289
<i>Just drop it! Drop it!</i>

323
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,132
<i>Get 'em outta here!
Get 'em outta here!</i>

324
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,802
- Did they hit you?
- I'm okay, sir.

325
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,750
Stern team, go!
Bow team, go!

326
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,725
I'm outta clips, sir.
You go ahead.

327
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,626
- Rabbit!
- All right, get 'em outta here.

328
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,599
Get 'em outta here! Let's go!
Get down! Down, down, down, down! Get down!

329
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,796
All right, who's the captain?
Huh? Who's the captain?

330
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,966
<i>Kapitan?</i> How about you, ugly?
You the captain, huh?

331
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,068
Trigger, if anybody moves, you shoot 'em
right here in the forehead, understand?

332
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,806
-Yes, sir!
- All right.

333
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,595
<i>Hirsch, we got it.</i>

334
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,695
Get down, down!

335
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:36,000
- Down there!
- Down, down!

336
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:39,132
Rabbit, check the bilge for a scuttling charge.
Give me your weapon!

337
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,837
- <i>Move, sailor, move!</i>
- Aye, sir!

338
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,212
<i>Goddamn it, stay there.</i>

339
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,922
- Hirsch, I think we got the code books!
- That ink's running. Dry it.

340
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,390
It's water soluble.
Yeah, use the blankets, use the blankets.

341
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,859
Nothing but pipes and valves, Mr. Emmett.

342
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,231
Bow compartment secure.

343
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,754
Bunch of Marys.

344
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:38,559
<i>How you doing? You're number ten.
There you go.</i>

345
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,268
You having a good night?
Uh-huh.

346
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,739
Ain't gonna be none too happy
you lost his boat.

347
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,334
Lucky number eleven, let's go!

348
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:53,109
It's your first time looking
at a black man, ain't it?

349
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,151
Get used to it.

350
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,948
Let's go!
Get over here!

351
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:34,356
<i>All right, hurry it up.
It's gonna be sunup in an hour.</i>

352
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:18,332
- Fuse is burning, sir.
- All right, she's burning! Let's get this raft loaded!

353
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:21,233
Let's move!

354
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,671
<i>Sir, we got all the prisoners
transferred to the S-33.</i>

355
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,675
Very well.

356
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,777
Hey, Andy.

357
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,719
<i>Make sure you got everything!
Get it in the raft!</i>

358
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,222
<i>Get everything belowdecks.
Let's go!</i>

359
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,493
Everybody, belowdecks!
Get down!

360
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,934
- Chief, take her down!
- Aye, sir!

361
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,972
- Let's go, Hirsch!
- The Enigma!

362
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,639
Trigger! Grab hold!

363
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,953
<i>Trigger! Attaboy!</i>

364
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:55,323
- Got it!
- Help me! Help me! Oh, no! No!

365
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,699
-We gotta get outta here!
- There's still men in the water.

366
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,176
- Let's go!
- Chief, there's still men in the water.

367
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,771
Go!

368
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:21,180
<i>Andy! Andy!</i>

369
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,728
Go! Dive!

370
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,655
<i>Dive!</i>

371
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:34,032
Take her down!
Take her down!

372
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,339
<i>Dive!</i>

373
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,082
<i>Tyler, let's go!</i>

374
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,565
- Chief, you find those vents?
- Everything's in German!

375
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:46,404
Rabbit, get to the torpedo room. Where's the
goddamn 1MC? Trigger, get on the helm!

376
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,705
- <i>Mazzola, take the planes!</i>
- Aye, sir.

377
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,780
- <i>Wentz, what about these?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

378
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,783
There's no label! Okay, those are
the aft ballast tanks vents!

379
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,877
These are the midship vents,
and these are the main induction valves.

380
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:01,048
- <i>Make sure they're shut.</i>
- Tank, I need speed!

381
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,149
<i>Get the screws turning.</i>

382
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,559
- <i>The lights are on, so there's got to be some power left.</i>
- I can't read this!

383
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:10,394
Rabbit, find out how many fish we've got in the tubes!
Figure out how to launch 'em!

384
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,331
- <i>Go!</i>
- I can't read this!

385
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:17,840
- Go help Tank, Hirsch. Go, Hirsch!
- Find the Christmas tree.

386
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,341
<i>We've gotta make sure
we don't have any holes in the boat!</i>

387
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,072
<i>"Klar, klar, klar."
Wentz, what the hell is "klar"?</i>

388
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,116
"Klar" means "clear."
All compartments secure.

389
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:31,449
- White for green? No holes in the ship! Dive the boat!
- White for green.

390
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,854
- <i>Opening ballast vents!</i>
- Opening midship valves!

391
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,858
Opening midship vents!

392
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:50,164
This is forward trim, aft trim.
These are auxiliaries.

393
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,436
Main motor.
Auxiliary, auxiliary.

394
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,622
<i>This is in meters.
Everything's in meters.</i>

395
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,024
Passing 15 meters.

396
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,063
Recommend shutting main vents!

397
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:17,998
- Make it so! Wentz, get in the sound room!
- Yes, sir!

398
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,865
- Make depth 20 meters.
- Depth 20 meters, aye.

399
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,236
- <i>Chief, take the dive!</i>
- I have the dive.

400
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:28,801
<i>At 20 meters. Bow planes at zero.
Control your depth with the stern planes.</i>

401
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,380
Bow planes at zero.
Controlling down with the stern planes.

402
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,609
Oh, shit.
All ahead full, sir!

403
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,243
Batteries are flat and draining fast!

404
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,812
<i>Mr. Tyler, I hear
the S-33 breaking up. Wait.</i>

405
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:44,360
I hold a submerged U-boat, 0-1-0.

406
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,656
<i>Real close.
Less than 1,000 yards.</i>

407
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:50,130
- Goddamn resupply sub. What's our heading?
- Two-eight-zero, sir!

408
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:53,066
All right, right full rudder!
Steady on 0-1-0!

409
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,196
<i>Aye, sir! Right full rudder.
Steady on course 0-1-0.</i>

410
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:59,070
Tank, starboard back full.
Rabbit, get back to me.

411
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,235
Starboard back full.
Aye, sir.

412
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,877
- Watch your depth. She'll squat.
- Rabbit!

413
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,784
We got four fish. Tubes are flooded,
but I can't open the doors until I'm equalized.

414
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:17,792
- <i>I can't find the valve!</i>
- Wentz, help Rabbit!

415
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:21,557
Enemy submarine close aboard.
Torpedo in the water. Torpedo in the water!

416
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,758
All right, belay that.
Wentz, stay where you are!

417
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,960
Hirsch, hotfoot it to the torpedo room!

418
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,433
- Helm, mark your head every ten degrees.
- Aye, sir.

419
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,272
- Now passing 3-2-0.
- Turn, baby, turn. Turn!

420
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,976
Equalizing valves. Holy shit! What's what?
This is crazy. I can't equalize the tubes!

421
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,076
What do you need?

422
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,712
- Equalizing valves! Equalizing valves!
- Valve?

423
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:50,589
- Gyro?
- No, drainage. Drainage. No.

424
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,288
Now passing 0-0-0.

425
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,832
Swing, you bastard, swing.

426
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,663
<i>Chief, stand by in case
we have to flood forward trim.</i>

427
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:07,808
- Impulse? Differential-- Pressure differential?
- No.

428
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,811
- Turn 'em! Yes, turn 'em!
- Which way?

429
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,746
Counterclockwise.

430
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,450
Torpedo missed.
It's in our baffles.

431
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,321
Two more torpedoes in the water!

432
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,696
<i>Best bearing to the U-boat: 0-1-0.</i>

433
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,826
Aye, Rabbit, get ready
to fire a spread.

434
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,464
<i>Tubes one and two.
Zero gyro. Fire!</i>

435
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,769
Rabbit, fire!

436
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,838
What's going on?

437
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,405
- What is that?
- Wrong one! The fish is stuck!

438
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:51,453
- <i>We missed an interlock.</i>
- Rabbit, get those fish out before they blow!

439
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,545
Look for "impulse air" or "firing air."

440
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,524
That was "impulse" there and there!

441
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:03,997
One, two, away.
Lining up tubes three and four.

442
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,534
Three and four, fire!

443
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,539
All fish running hot,
straight and normal.

444
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,441
I think they all missed, sir.

445
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,049
Shit.

446
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,293
<i>U-boat's breaking up!</i>

447
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,198
I hear bulkheads collapsing.

448
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,706
The 33 boat, Mr. Tyler.

449
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,516
Let's take her up
and look for survivors, Chief.

450
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,882
- <i>Give me some rise on the planes!</i>
- <i>Rise on the planes, aye.</i>

451
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,887
<i>Deploy main ballast!</i>

452
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,740
Gotcha.

453
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,467
Oh, crap.

454
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:29,640
<i>Help!</i>

455
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,976
Help!

456
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,743
<i>Please! Help!</i>

457
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,785
Help! Help!

458
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,890
Do you speak English?

459
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,825
<i>English. Do you speak English?</i>

460
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:23,126
What's your rank?
What do you do?

461
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,532
<i>What's your job? Your job.</i>

462
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:30,128
"Job."

463
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:41,008
You're an electrician. Good. You can us help
squeeze more juice out of them batteries.

464
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,486
Sir, I see the skipper.

465
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,916
Battery's dead.

466
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:04,531
Whatever juice was left
we used up when we maneuvered.

467
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,541
What about the diesels?

468
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,874
<i>Starboard's a wreck.
We need the dry dock to fix it.</i>

469
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,880
Port side diesel's the good news.
Whoever the Krauts had on it...

470
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,348
didn't know a piston head
from his sister's titty.

471
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,351
I think I can fix it.

472
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:21,082
Okay, Tank.
Do what you can.

473
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,090
Yes, sir.

474
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,621
<i>All right. Listen up.</i>

475
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,789
We've decided on a course.

476
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,799
We're headin' for England, Land's End.

477
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:36,099
<i>It's the closest,
besides occupied France.</i>

478
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,105
<i>Rabbit, how many torpedoes do we have?</i>

479
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:42,906
Just one. It's in the stern tube,
which is busted, bleedin' air from somewhere.

480
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:46,607
- Sir?
- Yeah, what is it, Trigger?

481
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,048
Can't we just use the radio--

482
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,313
fire off a Mayday
and wait for a rescue?

483
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,321
<i>That's impossible.</i>

484
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,415
If we transmit, the Germans will
direction-find our position to a grid...

485
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,824
with their missing two U-boats.

486
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,625
If they even suspect we have the Enigma,
they will change their entire coding system.

487
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,099
<i>And that would completely negate
the purpose of our mission.</i>

488
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,136
Mr. Tyler,

489
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,137
if we head for England,

490
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,264
we're gonna go straight
through the western approaches.

491
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:18,245
- <i>He's right. I mean, that's Jerry's backyard.</i>
- <i>Listen, guys.</i>

492
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,283
- It's full of U-boats.
- And we've got nothing to defend ourselves with.

493
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,649
Do you think I got all the answers here?

494
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:28,781
Think I know how we're gonna get out of this?
I don't. I don't know how.

495
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:32,622
- I say we use the radio.
- Nobody asked you.

496
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,630
- We use the radio and take our chances.
- I said can it.

497
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:38,030
- It's what the captain would have done--
- Captain's dead.

498
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:01,108
<i>This is crazy.</i>

499
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,242
<i>This whole thing is crazy--</i>

500
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,684
<i>riskin' our lives
over a typewriter.</i>

501
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:09,690
- <i>It's not a typewriter.</i>
- The hell it ain't. It's got buttons like a typewriter.

502
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:14,729
- <i>Yeah, well, it's not.</i>
- <i>Whatever it is, it's crazy we get killed over it.</i>

503
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,026
<i>The navy says it's important,
it's important.</i>

504
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:21,069
The navy says it's more important
than you, him, me, fine.

505
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,139
We're gonna die trying.

506
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,368
And that ain't crazy.
That's our job.

507
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:32,879
What I don't understand, Chief,
is how come you're not in charge?

508
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,509
Scuttlebutt is Dahlgren was kicking Tyler
out of the navy anyway, and--

509
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,784
<i>You stow that shit right now, sailor.</i>

510
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,953
<i>Lieutenant Tyler is your commanding officer,
and you will respect that man as such.</i>

511
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:48,997
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Chief.

512
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,675
Look at them sons of bitches.

513
01:03:41,248 --> 01:03:43,375
<i>You know my pop was a fisherman?</i>

514
01:03:43,484 --> 01:03:48,217
<i>He had this old 60-footer
he'd run all over the gulf.</i>

515
01:03:48,322 --> 01:03:51,587
Noisy two-stroke diesel.

516
01:03:51,692 --> 01:03:53,785
Rotten to the gunnels, that thing.

517
01:03:53,894 --> 01:03:58,729
<i>I could scrub that deck three times a day,
and it still stunk like fish.</i>

518
01:03:58,832 --> 01:04:03,326
And I swore I'd never skipper
a boat like that, Chief.

519
01:04:05,105 --> 01:04:08,040
<i>Hmm, I saw myself...</i>

520
01:04:08,142 --> 01:04:10,633
<i>standin' on the bridge
of a battleship.</i>

521
01:04:12,846 --> 01:04:15,144
A real sea captain.

522
01:04:15,249 --> 01:04:17,877
Mr. Tyler, permission to speak freely?

523
01:04:19,186 --> 01:04:21,245
Of course, Chief.

524
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:24,051
This is the navy,

525
01:04:24,158 --> 01:04:27,821
where a commanding officer
is a mighty and terrible thing--

526
01:04:27,928 --> 01:04:29,828
a man to be feared and respected.

527
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:33,661
<i>All knowing, all powerful.</i>

528
01:04:33,767 --> 01:04:37,430
Don't you dare say what you said to the boys
back there again-- "I don't know."

529
01:04:37,538 --> 01:04:42,373
Those three words will kill a crew,
dead as a depth charge.

530
01:04:42,476 --> 01:04:44,535
You're the skipper now,

531
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:48,513
and the skipper always knows what to do,
whether he does or not.

532
01:04:52,386 --> 01:04:55,583
- <i>Aircraft off the port bow!</i>
- Shit!

533
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:09,068
<i>Real sorry, sir.
It dropped right out of the clouds.</i>

534
01:05:09,169 --> 01:05:11,535
<i>Rabbit, Trigger,
stand by the flak gun.</i>

535
01:05:11,638 --> 01:05:13,799
- Sir.
- Sir.

536
01:05:13,907 --> 01:05:17,570
It's German.
Looks like long-range reconnaissance.

537
01:05:17,678 --> 01:05:21,239
<i>What the hell's it doing
way out here?</i>

538
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,184
- Jesus, here it comes.
- All right. Sit tight.

539
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:33,055
As far as he knows, we're all playing
on the same team. Everybody wave.

540
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,651
Wave?

541
01:05:35,763 --> 01:05:38,823
Sir, we're sittin' ducks. If we shoot first,
we can blow 'em out of the sky.

542
01:05:38,932 --> 01:05:43,733
<i>We miss, he's gonna radio us in.
That plane's gonna be the least of our problems.</i>

543
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:45,805
This is crazy.
You're gonna get us killed.

544
01:05:55,215 --> 01:05:59,174
He's comin' around.
He's comin' around!

545
01:06:03,957 --> 01:06:05,948
He's attacking!
Rabbit, do something!

546
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:08,493
- Mazzola, shut up. Rabbit, ignore him.
- Do something!

547
01:06:08,595 --> 01:06:11,655
<i>He's coming straight for us!
He's coming right at us! Do something!</i>

548
01:06:11,765 --> 01:06:14,063
- Acknowledge me, Seaman Parker.
- What are you waiting for?

549
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:16,659
- Yeah, Rabbit! Shoot him!
- Seamen Parker, I'm ordering you!

550
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:19,432
Do not fire that weapon!
Get your finger off that trigger!

551
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,940
Pull the trigger!
Pull the trigger!

552
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:24,101
We're gonna die!
Do it! Do it!

553
01:06:24,211 --> 01:06:27,305
Come on!
Goddamn it, can't you see him?

554
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:36,280
What the hell are you doin', huh?

555
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,984
This is not a goddamn democracy!

556
01:06:41,328 --> 01:06:44,229
Mr. Tyler, I see a mast on the horizon!

557
01:06:48,468 --> 01:06:51,494
<i>Shit! That's a Nazi destroyer.</i>

558
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:55,541
That plane must have been runnin'
a recon screen for it.

559
01:06:55,642 --> 01:06:59,442
Clear the bridge!
Chief, secure the diesel and dive the ship!

560
01:06:59,546 --> 01:07:01,946
Dive the ship!
Aye, sir!

561
01:07:58,372 --> 01:08:02,536
We don't have a green board.
The engine room's not ready.

562
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:04,543
Vents won't open.
We lost hydraulics.

563
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:08,513
<i>Tank, secure the diesel
and rig the engine room for dive!</i>

564
01:08:08,615 --> 01:08:11,812
Tank, acknowledge!

565
01:08:11,919 --> 01:08:15,320
Goddamn it! Mazzola, go see
what the hell's going on back there.

566
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:27,454
Drop it, you Nazi son of a bitch!
Drop it!

567
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:40,336
Goddamn it.

568
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,567
I'm real sorry, Mr. Tyler.

569
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:45,543
Took me right off my feet.

570
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:48,170
Listen to me.
You've got to secure the diesel.

571
01:09:48,281 --> 01:09:51,011
And find out why the vent valves
won't open now!

572
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:53,552
- Yes, sir.
- Goddamn it!

573
01:09:53,653 --> 01:09:56,383
Eddie, get this son of a bitch out of here.
Chain him to the bunks.

574
01:09:56,490 --> 01:10:00,927
<i>Make sure his hands and feet are secure.
Put him into submission!</i>

575
01:10:01,028 --> 01:10:04,156
- <i>Lieutenant, we have a problem!</i>
- Take care of it, Eddie.

576
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:14,099
Oh, shit.

577
01:10:22,582 --> 01:10:25,710
Tell Tank to finish those repairs.
The destroyer is sending a launch.

578
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:28,151
He needs five minutes, Mr. Tyler!

579
01:10:28,255 --> 01:10:30,450
<i>We don't have five minutes, Chief.</i>

580
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:33,856
Lieutenant, the deck cannon--
If we fire a shell below the water line--

581
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,693
<i>It wouldn't do a goddamn thing.
No, that tub could take a hundred shells.</i>

582
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:41,734
What we need is a working torpedo,
which we do not have.

583
01:10:41,835 --> 01:10:45,532
Trigger, stand by on the flak gun. When I
give the word, turn that launch into driftwood.

584
01:10:45,639 --> 01:10:49,439
- Yes, sir.
- Gonna find out who we are in about 60 seconds.

585
01:10:54,514 --> 01:10:58,610
Trigger, ready on that weapon?
Chief, tell Tank he has one minute...

586
01:10:58,718 --> 01:11:01,084
and get Wentz and Rabbit up here
with the machine gun.

587
01:11:03,023 --> 01:11:05,821
<i>Hirsch, what happens when they find out
we're not German?</i>

588
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:09,225
<i>After they shoot us as spies,
they'll radio into headquarters.</i>

589
01:11:09,329 --> 01:11:12,127
They'll tell them
the Enigma's been compromised.

590
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:17,462
What if we take out their radio,
before they can notify anyone about us?

591
01:11:17,571 --> 01:11:20,938
- How?
- With that deck gun.

592
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:24,067
<i>It's gonna be one hell of a shot,
but we can do it.</i>

593
01:11:24,177 --> 01:11:27,476
Then we dive like hell,
and we get under them quick.

594
01:11:27,581 --> 01:11:31,915
We lure 'em a little bit closer to the continent,
in range of Allied air cover.

595
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:35,886
- Then we call in an air strike.
- Yeah, we call in an air strike.

596
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:40,216
Son of a bitch cut off
pressure to the hydraulics.

597
01:11:40,327 --> 01:11:42,727
We need to find the stop valve.

598
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:49,759
Damn!

599
01:11:52,706 --> 01:11:56,198
See that structure topside
with the big antenna sticking out of it?

600
01:11:56,309 --> 01:11:58,834
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- <i>That's the radio shack.</i>

601
01:11:58,945 --> 01:12:03,177
You and Wentz get on the deck. On my command,
put a shell right through the porthole.

602
01:12:05,318 --> 01:12:09,550
- Get to it, gentlemen. Get to it.
- Yes, sir!

603
01:12:27,774 --> 01:12:30,868
Tell them to go away, Mr. Hirsch.

604
01:12:41,821 --> 01:12:45,587
- Talk to me, Rabbit!
- Deck gun manned and ready in all respects, sir!

605
01:12:45,692 --> 01:12:47,751
Fire!

606
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:04,772
Clear the deck!

607
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:07,244
All right.

608
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,258
Come on!

609
01:13:31,238 --> 01:13:34,696
Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive!

610
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:51,579
- Come on. Why aren't we diving?
- Repairs aren't complete, sir.

611
01:13:51,691 --> 01:13:54,285
- Eddie, man the planes. Tank, all ahead full.
- <i>Aye, sir!</i>

612
01:13:54,394 --> 01:13:57,591
- Aye, sir! Manning planes!
- <i>All ahead full, aye!</i>

613
01:13:57,697 --> 01:14:01,633
<i>Nice shot, Rabbit.
That radio's history.</i>

614
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,774
Come on.

615
01:14:11,611 --> 01:14:14,409
- We're heading right towards them.
- That's right.

616
01:14:14,514 --> 01:14:17,347
Their deck guns can't get to us
if we're in close enough.

617
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:20,647
Let's hope we can dive
and clear her keel.

618
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:37,534
That's it.
Hydraulics restored!

619
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:40,367
Thank you, Tank.
That did it. We're going under.

620
01:14:50,483 --> 01:14:53,350
Passing five meters.

621
01:15:01,795 --> 01:15:04,320
Passing ten meters.

622
01:15:10,904 --> 01:15:13,304
Fifteen meters.

623
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:43,398
<i>Twenty meters.</i>

624
01:16:17,737 --> 01:16:20,467
<i>Trigger, left full rudder.</i>

625
01:16:24,644 --> 01:16:26,544
Tank, all ahead two-thirds.

626
01:16:35,855 --> 01:16:37,755
Contact maneuvering.

627
01:16:41,528 --> 01:16:43,655
<i>Heavy cavitation.</i>

628
01:16:45,565 --> 01:16:48,932
- Splashes.
- Shit.

629
01:18:01,241 --> 01:18:04,369
Step away from that bulkhead,
Mr. Hirsch.

630
01:18:05,979 --> 01:18:09,005
The shock wave from one of these explosions
can snap your spine.

631
01:18:15,355 --> 01:18:18,518
Chief, you ever been depth charged?

632
01:18:19,626 --> 01:18:23,221
Once, off Murmansk,

633
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:25,593
back in World War I.

634
01:18:25,698 --> 01:18:30,533
One charge came so close, it rattled
four teeth out of the skipper's head.

635
01:18:41,614 --> 01:18:43,514
Wasn't even close.

636
01:18:50,657 --> 01:18:53,592
Control, starboard E-motor's seized up.

637
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:56,161
<i>The German must have sabotaged it.</i>

638
01:18:56,262 --> 01:18:58,162
Goddamn it.

639
01:19:01,067 --> 01:19:05,663
There's no way we make it to Allied air cover
creepin' along on one shaft.

640
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:13,539
Get down!

641
01:21:01,587 --> 01:21:05,079
Eddie, help Chief.

642
01:21:06,192 --> 01:21:08,092
Ye-Yes, sir.

643
01:21:15,635 --> 01:21:18,331
Mr. Chief, I got that.

644
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,739
Tank... you alive back there?

645
01:21:25,011 --> 01:21:26,945
Yes, sir.

646
01:21:27,046 --> 01:21:31,676
Good. Port ahead two-thirds.

647
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,179
<i>Port ahead two-thirds.
Aye, sir.</i>

648
01:22:01,948 --> 01:22:05,782
Tank... can you fix the stern tube?

649
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,784
I don't know, Mr. Tyler.

650
01:22:09,889 --> 01:22:12,790
I don't want an "I don't know."

651
01:22:12,892 --> 01:22:17,625
Can you fix the torpedo tube?
Yes... or no?

652
01:22:19,465 --> 01:22:22,298
Yes, sir.
I think I can.

653
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:24,301
Thank you, Tank.

654
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:28,339
Chief, make depth 1-6-0 meters.

655
01:22:30,877 --> 01:22:33,971
That's more than 500 feet.

656
01:22:36,616 --> 01:22:38,516
<i>Take us down, Chief.</i>

657
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,481
Aye, sir.

658
01:22:43,589 --> 01:22:45,489
One-six-zero meters.

659
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:49,584
- Twenty degrees dive, both planes.
- Twenty degrees dive, aye, sir.

660
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:53,160
<i>Mr. Tyler, sir,</i>

661
01:22:53,266 --> 01:22:56,360
uh, do you plan on going up
against a destroyer...

662
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:59,632
with only one fish in the tube
and a busted motor?

663
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:02,333
Yes, I am, Eddie.

664
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:05,103
- How wise is that, Lieutenant?
- <i>Not very.</i>

665
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:08,942
But have a look. Chief.

666
01:23:09,048 --> 01:23:11,175
There is no way a two-knot submarine...

667
01:23:11,284 --> 01:23:16,017
can get in firing position against
a 30-knot destroyer unless we go deep.

668
01:23:16,122 --> 01:23:18,420
At 160 meters,

669
01:23:18,524 --> 01:23:21,459
we can shoot out a bunch of junk
from the forward tubes.

670
01:23:21,561 --> 01:23:24,621
It will resurface
and create a debris field.

671
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:26,925
Now the destroyer's gonna go
to the center of that debris field,

672
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:29,524
shut off its engines to make it
real nice and quiet...

673
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:32,263
and do an acoustic search
to make sure we're dead.

674
01:23:32,371 --> 01:23:35,397
But we're not.
See, we're here,

675
01:23:35,508 --> 01:23:38,306
on our way up to periscope depth.

676
01:23:38,411 --> 01:23:41,380
<i>All right, principle of ascent velocity.</i>

677
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,574
Our positive buoyancy pulls us up
and away from the destroyer.

678
01:23:44,684 --> 01:23:47,812
And when we surface,
we'll be showing it our ass at 700 yards.

679
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,254
<i>That is a perfect setup for a
stern shot on a stationary target.</i>

680
01:23:52,358 --> 01:23:54,354
Boom.

681
01:23:54,389 --> 01:23:56,351
<i>It don't get much prettier than that.</i>

682
01:23:58,297 --> 01:24:00,197
All right, Mr. Tyler.

683
01:24:00,299 --> 01:24:03,757
All right.
Passing 1-3-0 meters.

684
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:06,668
Very well. Rabbit,

685
01:24:06,772 --> 01:24:09,673
I need you to load Mazzola's body
into tube three...

686
01:24:09,775 --> 01:24:13,370
and put an escape jacket onto him
to make sure he floats.

687
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:15,674
Wanna shoot him out like garbage?

688
01:24:23,456 --> 01:24:26,892
His body is gonna save our lives.

689
01:24:26,993 --> 01:24:29,791
I'll say a few words for him.

690
01:24:29,896 --> 01:24:33,525
Hirsch, go with Rabbit.
Eddie, can you man both planes?

691
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:34,753
Yes, sir.

692
01:24:34,801 --> 01:24:36,796
- Mr. Tyler.
- Yeah.

693
01:24:36,903 --> 01:24:39,531
If you can't take out that destroyer,

694
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:42,369
the danger is not
that some of us may die.

695
01:24:42,475 --> 01:24:44,636
It's that some of us may live.

696
01:24:47,046 --> 01:24:50,607
These men have seen and heard things...

697
01:24:50,716 --> 01:24:52,650
that must not be revealed
to the enemy--

698
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,315
<i>our secrets,</i>

699
01:24:56,422 --> 01:24:58,652
such as our radar capabilities...

700
01:24:58,758 --> 01:25:01,249
and our understanding
of German encryption.

701
01:25:02,962 --> 01:25:07,092
If we fall into German hands alive,
we will be tortured without mercy.

702
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:10,532
Either you succeed
in sinking that ship...

703
01:25:10,636 --> 01:25:13,969
or you must see to it
that none of us survive...

704
01:25:14,073 --> 01:25:15,973
<i>to be captured.</i>

705
01:25:48,574 --> 01:25:51,839
We commend his soul to God...

706
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:54,310
and commit his body to the deep.

707
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:05,157
<i>Mr. Tyler, contact is zigging.</i>

708
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:09,456
Splashes.

709
01:26:11,797 --> 01:26:14,129
<i>Contact getting closer.</i>

710
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:17,293
More splashes.

711
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:32,649
Tank, line up to pump
engine room bilge to sea.

712
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:34,652
Yes, sir.

713
01:26:48,634 --> 01:26:50,534
Rabbit,

714
01:26:52,038 --> 01:26:53,938
fire the tubes.

715
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:57,775
Bye, Mazzola.

716
01:28:13,052 --> 01:28:15,543
They're setting them charges too shallow.

717
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:38,234
Secure that air valve!

718
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:56,013
<i>Chief, what's our depth?</i>

719
01:29:56,121 --> 01:29:59,488
One-six-zero meters.

720
01:30:00,759 --> 01:30:03,592
- Zero the planes.
- Zero the planes.

721
01:30:03,696 --> 01:30:08,030
Splashes!

722
01:30:08,133 --> 01:30:10,101
They're too close together!

723
01:30:10,202 --> 01:30:12,466
<i>I can't count them.</i>

724
01:30:21,847 --> 01:30:23,747
Chief,

725
01:30:25,417 --> 01:30:27,317
take us to 200 meters.

726
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:33,321
<i>We're gonna get under
these damn things.</i>

727
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,760
Chief,

728
01:30:37,863 --> 01:30:40,263
take us to 200 meters.

729
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:48,405
Aye, sir.

730
01:30:54,747 --> 01:30:57,238
Making my depth 200 meters.

731
01:30:57,349 --> 01:30:59,977
Ten degrees dive, both planes.

732
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:01,985
- Ten degrees dive.
- Aye.

733
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:27,607
One-seven-zero meters.

734
01:31:40,059 --> 01:31:41,959
Tank,

735
01:31:42,061 --> 01:31:44,996
what's the status
on the stern torpedo tube?

736
01:31:45,097 --> 01:31:49,090
There's a couple things wrong.
I can operate the muzzle door,

737
01:31:49,201 --> 01:31:51,533
but I'm still working
on the impulse air.

738
01:31:51,637 --> 01:31:54,105
One-eight-zero meters.

739
01:31:56,141 --> 01:32:00,009
Mr. Tyler, depth gauge back here
says 180 meters.

740
01:32:00,112 --> 01:32:03,309
<i>Thanks, Tank. I know.</i>

741
01:32:04,917 --> 01:32:07,249
Keep working.

742
01:32:18,997 --> 01:32:21,397
One-nine-zero meters.

743
01:32:41,754 --> 01:32:46,088
Two-hundred meters.
Zero the planes.

744
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:48,091
- Zero the planes, aye.
- Zero the planes.

745
01:33:51,457 --> 01:33:54,483
Mary, mother of God.

746
01:33:58,764 --> 01:34:01,494
Those Krauts sure know
how to build a boat.

747
01:34:10,275 --> 01:34:11,708
Chief, take us up!

748
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:16,838
- Blowing negative! Planes full rise!
- Clockwise, Hirsch!

749
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:21,883
- Rabbit, help me out!
- Go! Go!

750
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,881
Chief, are you seeing this?

751
01:34:33,732 --> 01:34:38,169
Needle's off the scale!
We have to blow main ballast tanks!

752
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:39,965
Do it, Chief!

753
01:34:58,023 --> 01:35:01,550
- She's still going down!
- Ballast tanks are bone dry!

754
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:04,151
<i>I'm gonna try the trim tanks!</i>

755
01:35:09,868 --> 01:35:12,564
Come on, come on, come on!

756
01:35:23,215 --> 01:35:25,513
She's going up!
She's going up!

757
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:45,527
Mr. Tyler, we're coming up.

758
01:35:45,637 --> 01:35:48,037
But I've lost control
of the ballast tanks.

759
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:50,700
I can't stop our ascent.

760
01:35:50,809 --> 01:35:52,970
Where are we with the stern torpedo?

761
01:35:53,078 --> 01:35:54,978
Piping's damaged.

762
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,572
There's a break in the air line,
so there's no pressure to launch a torpedo.

763
01:35:58,684 --> 01:36:01,915
I tried to bypass the leak,
but it's way back in the bilge underwater.

764
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:05,080
There's no way to reach it.
I can't fit.

765
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:08,125
- Can somebody else get to it?
- I don't know.

766
01:36:08,226 --> 01:36:11,855
Maybe somebody smaller.

767
01:36:11,964 --> 01:36:13,898
That's Rabbit or Trigger.

768
01:36:13,999 --> 01:36:16,866
<i>Comin' up on 200 meters.</i>

769
01:36:16,969 --> 01:36:18,869
You gotta pick one.

770
01:36:26,612 --> 01:36:29,080
- Trigger.
- Trigger,

771
01:36:30,215 --> 01:36:32,308
<i>lay aft with Tank.</i>

772
01:36:33,652 --> 01:36:37,452
Move it, son.
You got a job to do.

773
01:36:46,031 --> 01:36:49,091
See, we got no air pressure
to fire the torpedo.

774
01:36:49,201 --> 01:36:51,829
One of these pipes is busted
and leaking air.

775
01:36:51,937 --> 01:36:55,429
- How am I gonna find it?
- You'll see bubbles coming out. A lot of 'em.

776
01:36:55,540 --> 01:37:00,000
Find the isolation valve
<i>aft of the leak</i> and crank it down.

777
01:37:00,112 --> 01:37:02,672
- Got it?
- Yeah.

778
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,942
I rigged this hose
so you can breathe through it.

779
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:09,578
Now listen to me.
As soon as you finish, you get out of there.

780
01:37:09,688 --> 01:37:11,918
- Okay?
- Yeah.

781
01:37:31,677 --> 01:37:34,544
I can hear her.

782
01:37:36,148 --> 01:37:38,878
Making slow turns.

783
01:37:43,288 --> 01:37:45,222
She just stopped her screws.

784
01:37:48,493 --> 01:37:50,552
I think they see the debris.

785
01:37:53,465 --> 01:37:55,365
I think they're buying it.

786
01:37:55,467 --> 01:37:57,833
One-eight-zero meters.

787
01:37:59,171 --> 01:38:02,072
Chief, can you slow our ascent?
We are not ready.

788
01:38:03,175 --> 01:38:05,541
Can't, sir.

789
01:38:05,644 --> 01:38:08,044
We got a one-way ticket topside.

790
01:38:10,248 --> 01:38:14,708
If we surface without a torpedo to fire,
we're dead.

791
01:38:50,655 --> 01:38:53,886
There's two air leaks.

792
01:38:53,992 --> 01:38:56,153
I got one, but the other one's
way in the back.

793
01:38:56,261 --> 01:38:58,786
- <i>I need some more slack on the hose to get to it.</i>
- That's all there is.

794
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:00,797
Shit.

795
01:39:21,853 --> 01:39:24,447
One-five-zero meters.

796
01:39:27,926 --> 01:39:29,826
I hear Morse code.

797
01:39:31,396 --> 01:39:34,627
What the hell is it?
Are they signaling us?

798
01:39:42,073 --> 01:39:43,836
What's it saying, Wentz?

799
01:39:43,942 --> 01:39:47,207
"I am U-571. Destroy me."

800
01:39:58,757 --> 01:40:01,225
<i>Coming up on 9-0 meters.</i>

801
01:40:17,475 --> 01:40:21,377
<i>Sir, she's started her engines again.</i>

802
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:28,511
<i>No go, Mr. Tyler.
He can't reach.</i>

803
01:40:36,027 --> 01:40:39,827
Trigger, in one minute we're gonna hit
the surface. Do you understand me?

804
01:40:39,931 --> 01:40:42,957
Now you've got to go back
in there and try.

805
01:40:43,068 --> 01:40:45,298
I wouldn't ask you if our lives
didn't depend on it.

806
01:40:45,403 --> 01:40:47,963
- Sorry, sir. I can't reach it.
- No, no, Trigger.

807
01:40:48,073 --> 01:40:49,973
Now listen to me.

808
01:40:51,076 --> 01:40:54,068
You <i>can</i> reach it,
and you will.

809
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:57,273
Now you are gonna close that valve.

810
01:40:57,382 --> 01:40:59,942
- Sir, I can't!
- You're the only chance we've got.

811
01:41:04,756 --> 01:41:07,748
Now you're gonna go back down
in that bilge,

812
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:10,953
and you're gonna do your job, sailor.

813
01:41:23,108 --> 01:41:25,941
- Report to me the instant that torpedo's ready to fire.
- Yes, sir.

814
01:41:29,581 --> 01:41:31,776
Thirty meters.

815
01:41:31,883 --> 01:41:33,908
- Talk to me, Wentz.
- <i>Destroyer is under way.</i>

816
01:41:34,019 --> 01:41:37,216
<i>Steady bearing.
They're closing our position.</i>

817
01:41:37,322 --> 01:41:40,780
Shit!
Come on, Trigger!

818
01:41:40,892 --> 01:41:42,655
<i>Twenty meters.</i>

819
01:41:42,761 --> 01:41:44,888
Hold on.
We're gonna surface.

820
01:41:44,996 --> 01:41:46,896
Raising scope.

821
01:41:56,007 --> 01:41:57,838
Got her.

822
01:41:57,943 --> 01:42:00,969
<i>She's heading right for us.</i>

823
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:04,173
- Helm, come right ten degrees.
- Aye, sir!

824
01:42:04,282 --> 01:42:06,842
- Watch your bow planes.
- Aye, sir. Watching my bow planes.

825
01:42:06,952 --> 01:42:09,284
Tank, start the diesel.
All ahead full!

826
01:42:17,062 --> 01:42:19,963
Port diesel ahead full!

827
01:42:41,553 --> 01:42:43,453
Shit, they've got us bracketed.

828
01:42:45,123 --> 01:42:47,057
Incoming!

829
01:42:53,898 --> 01:42:55,559
We're hit! We're hit!

830
01:42:55,667 --> 01:43:00,400
- <i>Wentz, get in here!</i>
- Eddie, secure that hatch!

831
01:43:17,689 --> 01:43:19,520
Tube still not ready!

832
01:43:27,332 --> 01:43:29,823
- Request permission to abandon ship!
- Not yet, Chief.

833
01:43:51,456 --> 01:43:54,983
Control, aft torpedo ready
in all respects!

834
01:43:55,093 --> 01:43:59,223
- Hold us right there, Rabbit. Hold us steady right here.
- Steady on bearing 8-0 degrees!

835
01:44:00,999 --> 01:44:02,899
Fire!

836
01:44:04,202 --> 01:44:06,796
Tank, fire right now or we die!

837
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,774
Come on, come on.

838
01:44:17,482 --> 01:44:20,144
Torpedo!

839
01:45:14,472 --> 01:45:16,497
Well, that blew 'em right in half.

840
01:45:28,153 --> 01:45:32,112
Hell, Mr. Tyler,
if you ever need a chief,

841
01:45:32,223 --> 01:45:34,350
I'd go to sea with you anytime.

842
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,860
Thank you, Chief.

843
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:49,539
Tank, you okay?

844
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:54,410
Trigger drowned.

845
01:46:04,489 --> 01:46:07,151
That kid didn't give up, did he?

846
01:46:10,195 --> 01:46:12,823
Neither did you, Mr. Tyler.

847
01:46:24,642 --> 01:46:26,837
We can't keep her afloat
much longer, sir.

848
01:46:36,387 --> 01:46:38,287
Let's abandon ship.

849
01:48:13,151 --> 01:48:15,051
Mr. Tyler. Mr. Tyler.
