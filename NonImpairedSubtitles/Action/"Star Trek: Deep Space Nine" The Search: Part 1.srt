1
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:05,044
Last time on "Star Trek -
Deep Space Nine"...

2
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:08,842
If you could do any science project
you wanted to, anything at all...

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,764
Visit the Gamma Quadrant?

4
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,163
We've never heard of the Jem'Hadar.

5
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:26,403
Then you've been fortunate.

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,519
Negotiations with the Dominion
can be dangerous.

7
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:35,283
The Dominion will no longer
allow ships from your side

8
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:37,398
to violate our territory.

9
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,518
Starfleet's orders are simple.

10
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:41,478
No traffic through the wormhole

11
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:44,201
until we can investigate
the Jem'Hadar's threat.

12
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:47,080
- What about Benjamin and the others?
- Don't worry.

13
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,198
Commander Sisko's return
is a top priority.

14
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:51,795
If you're going to rescue them,
we're coming.

15
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,162
Here they come.

16
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:13,921
A Jem'Hadar ship is making
a direct run at the Odyssey.

17
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:23,401
The Jem'Hadar wanted us to escape?

18
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:26,166
You have no idea what's begun here.

19
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:31,243
She'll be back. The question is
who she'll bring with her.

20
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,359
If the Dominion enters the wormhole,

21
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:37,001
the first battle will be fought here,

22
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:40,358
and l intend to be ready for them.

23
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:42,682
And now the continuation.

24
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,039
We're in trouble.

25
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:58,204
We've run seven simulations,
and they all come up the same:

26
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:02,002
the Jem'Hadar
board the station within two hours.

27
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:05,358
That doesn't give us time
to get reinforcements from Bajor.

28
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:08,285
We must have overlooked something.

29
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,443
I'm the last to say it's hopeless,

30
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:13,684
but given DS9's structural limitations,
our power supply,

31
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:16,162
and the difficulty of defending
a stationary target

32
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:19,677
against a mobile force,
two hours is optimistic.

33
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,560
The casualties would be appalling.

34
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:26,919
If we let them board, that doesn't mean
we have to surrender.

35
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,322
What are you suggesting?

36
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:32,803
We can hide in the conduits,

37
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:35,361
set up booby-traps, prepare ambushes,

38
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:38,126
hold out until we get reinforcements.

39
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:42,365
We can try, but there won't be much
of a station left when they get here.

40
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:44,478
That leaves us with two options:

41
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:47,644
abandon the station
and make a stand on Bajor,

42
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,045
or collapse the entrance
to the wormhole.

43
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,965
I want a third alternative.
I cannot believe that we can't...

44
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,440
(Electronic bleeping)

45
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:03,126
A large subspace surge
has just activated our security sensors.

46
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:06,444
- Where is it?
- Bearing 1 48, mark 21 5.

47
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:10,082
- Distance 300 metres.
- 300 metres?

48
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,801
That's almost
inside our shield perimeter.

49
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:16,124
From the intensity,
it could be a cloaked ship,

50
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:19,444
but l've never seen
an energy dispersal pattern like this.

51
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,718
It's too close for comfort, whatever it is.
Red Alert. Raise shields.

52
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:25,361
Energise phaser banks,
stand-by to lock...

53
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,479
The energy signature's fluctuating.
It's decloaking.

54
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:38,155
It's a Federation starship,
but l've never seen that design before.

55
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,562
A Federation ship
with a cloaking device?

56
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,121
- It's hailing us.
- On screen.

57
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,362
Hello, Major. Sorry to startle you.

58
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,876
I wanted to test
the Defiant's cloaking device.

59
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:52,886
- The Defiant?
- I have a surprise for the Dominion.

60
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,679
Officially it's classified
as an escort vessel.

61
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:59,719
Unofficially the Defiant's a warship.

62
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:01,917
Nothing more, nothing less.

63
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:04,720
I thought Starfleet didn't believe
in warships.

64
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:08,317
Desperate times breed
desperate measures.

65
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:11,280
Starfleet explored the possibility

66
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,796
of building a new class of starship.

67
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:16,600
This ship would have no families,
no science labs,

68
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,558
no luxuries of any kind.

69
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,803
It was designed for one purpose only -

70
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,122
to fight and defeat the Borg.

71
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,363
The Defiant was the first ship

72
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,796
in what would've been
a new Federation battle fleet.

73
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:29,155
What happened?

74
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:32,199
The Borg threat became less urgent.

75
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:35,717
Also, some design flaws cropped up.

76
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,678
Starfleet abandoned the project.

77
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,559
What sort of design flaws?

78
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:42,360
You'll get the ship evaluation reports,

79
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,682
but to put it simply, it's overgunned

80
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:46,798
and overpowered for a ship its size.

81
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:48,519
During battle drills,

82
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:51,639
it nearly tore itself apart at full capacity.

83
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,758
This is the ship Starfleet sends us

84
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:55,957
to fight off an attack by the Dominion?

85
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,647
We're not going to fight the Dominion.

86
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,076
At least, not yet.

87
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,640
We must go into the Gamma Quadrant

88
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:07,884
and find the leaders of the Dominion,
the Founders.

89
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:12,125
We must convince them that
the Federation represents no threat.

90
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:16,035
- What if they don't believe us?
- That's why l asked for the Defiant.

91
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:19,443
She may have flaws, but she has teeth.

92
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:24,482
I want the Dominion to know
that we can and will defend ourselves.

93
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,079
I've posted two security officers

94
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,799
at the Defiant's docking port.

95
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:34,124
No one will get near the cloaking device
without us knowing about it.

96
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:37,364
I wasn't informed about
any special security arrangements.

97
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,001
The security arrangements
were by my request

98
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,357
to protect the cloaking device.

99
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:44,284
A few introductions are in order.

100
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:46,921
This is Subcommander T'Rul.

101
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:51,677
She will operate the cloaking device
which her government loaned us.

102
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,719
Romulan interests
will be served through cooperation.

103
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:58,965
I keep "unauthorized personnel"
away from the cloaking device.

104
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:02,079
May l present my officers?
This is Major Kira...

105
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:06,962
I know their names
and l'm not here to make friends.

106
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,356
Charming.

107
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:13,684
Well, l am here to make friends.

108
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:18,437
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security.

109
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,762
Major Kira Nerys.

110
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,963
Odo. Head of station security.

111
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:31,284
May l ask what your function is here,
Commander?

112
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:34,444
There will be
a mission briefing at 1 800 hours,

113
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,320
but be prepared
to depart at 0700 tomorrow.

114
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:39,483
Dismissed.

115
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:48,400
Don't brace yourself
to give me unpleasant news,

116
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:53,123
I'll save you the trouble.
I've been relieved as Chief of Security.

117
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,763
Wait. You have not been relieved.

118
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:01,799
You're in charge
of all non-Starfleet security matters.

119
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,963
What about matters that are Starfleet?

120
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:06,681
You'll coordinate your efforts
with Commander Eddington.

121
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:10,482
"Coordinate" is another way of saying,
"l'll report to him."

122
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:14,407
I'm sorry, Odo. This wasn't my idea.

123
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,360
I'm sure it wasn't.
You were just following orders.

124
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:21,719
An order l strongly disagreed with.
I did everything l could to fight this.

125
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:24,759
I even took it
to the Chief of Starfleet Security.

126
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:28,323
- But their decision was final.
- May l ask why?

127
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:31,883
There were concerns
about several recent security breaches.

128
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:35,117
If l was given the authority l asked for,

129
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:37,761
instead of being tied
to Starfleet regulations,

130
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:40,720
there wouldn't have been
any security breaches.

131
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:44,283
Your resistance to Starfleet regulations
is part of the problem.

132
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:47,604
There might be a simpler explanation,
Commander.

133
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:51,163
Starfleet decided
to bring in someone they could trust,

134
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:54,836
someone besides the shape-shifter.

135
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,959
This is not a racial issue, Odo.

136
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:00,396
I understand how you must feel, and l...

137
00:10:00,527 --> 00:10:04,361
Commander,
l don't require your understanding.

138
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:08,275
My resignation
will be logged within the hour.

139
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,365
- Hey, l thought you were unpacking.
- I am.

140
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:26,126
I was, but l kept looking
at the replicator and...

141
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:28,886
You had to have
some l'danian spice pudding.

142
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:31,680
I couldn't get a decent bowl on Earth.

143
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,277
That didn't stop you from ordering it
at every replicator you saw.

144
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,967
So, is it good to be home?

145
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,726
I can't wait
to sleep in my own bed again.

146
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:47,244
- I wonder when that happened.
- What?

147
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:53,636
When did l start thinking of
this Cardassian monstrosity as home?

148
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:59,956
I think it happened last Thursday,
around 1 700 hours.

149
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:03,238
When you took this stuff
out of storage back on Earth.

150
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,561
Careful.

151
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,683
That's a 2,000-year-old Yoruba mask,

152
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:10,446
and that "stuff" is
one of the finest collections

153
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,842
of ancient African art you'll ever see.

154
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:15,435
I know.
And l know how much it means to you.

155
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:20,721
But to me this will always be
the "stuff" in your library at home.

156
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,317
When you took it out of storage
so you could bring it here,

157
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:27,837
it meant that Earth
wasn't home anymore, this was.

158
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:36,196
So, what do you think?

159
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:38,601
Perfect.

160
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,162
Odo, there you are.

161
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,482
I've talked
to the Provisional Government.

162
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:57,599
They want you to go with us
to the Gamma Quadrant

163
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:59,922
as an official Bajoran representative.

164
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:03,483
- I'm no diplomat.
- That's why they want you to go.

165
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,599
If we locate the Founders,
we'll need more than diplomacy.

166
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:10,800
We'll need to see what kind of threat
they pose to Bajor, analyse...

167
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:14,397
You're the military expert,
Major, not me.

168
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:18,645
And l doubt that the Provisional
Government contacted you

169
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:22,476
and asked
for my presence on this mission.

170
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:27,158
If l'm not mistaken, this is a misguided
attempt to make me feel better.

171
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,004
Maybe it is.

172
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:33,118
Maybe l'm your friend.

173
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:37,283
Maybe l want you to see
that you are still needed here,

174
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:42,037
no matter what some
idiot Starfleet admiral might think.

175
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,560
The Defiant leaves at 700 hours.

176
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:14,844
I'm a little confused, Commander.

177
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:18,721
You want me to go with you
to the Gamma Quadrant

178
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,919
to help you locate the Founders?

179
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,925
See? lt's not so confusing after all.

180
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:28,117
You're joking, aren't you?

181
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,317
- I'm serious.
- You can't be.

182
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,325
I'm not a diplomat, or an explorer,

183
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:36,883
or a tactical officer,
or whatever you might need on this trip.

184
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,157
Now, if you need a caterer,

185
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:42,245
I'll loan you a new replicator
that l just got from...

186
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,756
Eight months ago,
you helped the Nagus

187
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:48,004
establish a trade agreement
with the Karemma -

188
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,083
tulaberry wine, l believe.

189
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,516
The Karemma are
part of the Dominion.

190
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:54,797
A minor part, a very minor part.

191
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:57,964
They might still be able to help us
contact the Founders.

192
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,362
You're experienced
in dealing with the Karemma.

193
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,603
You're the logical person...

194
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:05,958
My brother Rom
would be better suited for this mission.

195
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:09,204
- Not Rom, you.
- But why?

196
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:12,797
Rom only has a son to think about,
l have a business.

197
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:14,756
You.

198
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:21,438
I'm sorry, Commander,
but l must refuse.

199
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:25,480
My last experience
with the Jem'Hadar was not pleasant,

200
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:28,405
and l have no intention of repeating it.

201
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:33,555
Now, there's no way
you can legally force me to do this.

202
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,560
(Tapping)

203
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:40,757
The sceptre of the Grand Nagus.

204
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:44,004
I discussed this mission with him
on my way back from Earth.

205
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:45,765
He agreed with me -

206
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,845
unless peaceful contact
can be established with the Founders,

207
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:52,084
business opportunities
in the Gamma Quadrant might dry up.

208
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:56,644
He also agreed that you
are the perfect man to help me.

209
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,282
- I don't believe it.
- Which is why he sent this along.

210
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:03,001
He thought
it might convince you of the high value

211
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:05,960
he holds
for the success of this mission.

212
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:13,517
Now, are you going to defy the wishes
of the Grand Nagus himself?

213
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:18,163
No, no, of course not. I'm happy
to serve the Nagus any way l can.

214
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:21,643
Thanks, Quark.
I knew l could count on you.

215
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:27,156
Quark, aren't you forgetting something?

216
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:01,243
I thought you'd like to know,
the Defiant will be ready at 0700 hours.

217
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:04,040
- Did it pass the Chief's inspection?
- Does anything?

218
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,283
He has a long maintenance list,

219
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,637
but he said it'll take us
where we're going.

220
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,362
- And back, l hope.
- He said that was up to you.

221
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:18,363
I'd never have volunteered
unless l thought we could come back.

222
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:21,524
How often did Curzon tell you,
"Never volunteer for anything"?

223
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,923
Curzon broke that rule
a few times himself.

224
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:28,676
- And regretted it every time.
- This is different.

225
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:33,119
I'd be regretting it even more
if we just waited around for an invasion.

226
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:45,719
Starfleet must have run at least 200
probability studies on this mission.

227
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:48,156
What are the odds we succeed?

228
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,039
Slim.

229
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:56,882
But better odds than fighting off
a Jem'Hadar assault on this station.

230
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,601
If the station falls,
then Bajor falls,

231
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,400
and l will not let that happen.

232
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:07,083
You know, after Jennifer died

233
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:11,883
I never thought l'd see you
so passionate about something again.

234
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:15,204
Two months ago,
l would've agreed with you.

235
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,477
Then l went back to Earth,

236
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:22,203
and l spent all those weeks
debriefing at Starfleet Headquarters.

237
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:28,721
And l... I used to get a thrill
just walking into that building.

238
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:33,284
I'd look at the Admirals and think,
"One day that's going to be me.

239
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:37,639
"One day l'm the one that's
going to be making the big decisions."

240
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,516
Curzon always thought that was funny.

241
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:42,762
Did he?

242
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:47,517
What l mean is, he could never see
a set of Admiral's stars on your collar.

243
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:52,277
He thought that just making
the decisions would never satisfy you.

244
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:55,558
You had to implement them,
see the results,

245
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,996
face the consequences.

246
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:01,199
Curzon always thought
you were the kind of man

247
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:03,602
who had to be in the thick of things,

248
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:06,639
not behind some desk at Headquarters.

249
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:14,086
He was a smart old man, wasn't he?

250
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,357
He liked to think so.

251
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:23,362
You'd better get a good night's sleep.

252
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:26,445
I was just about to say the same to you.

253
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,240
I'll see you in the morning, Benjamin.

254
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:42,396
The medical database
is practically nonexistent.

255
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:45,121
I've downloaded
many of my files from the station,

256
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:48,080
but this ship wasn't designed
to handle many casualties.

257
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:51,404
Let's hope your new database
won't be put to the test.

258
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:54,166
- Yes, sir.
- Quark is settling into his quarters.

259
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:58,280
He asked me to relay his
disappointment in the accommodations,

260
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:01,160
and to inform you
that he'll get you in touch

261
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:05,121
with several reputable
interior decorators for a modest fee.

262
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,602
I'll take his offer under advisement.

263
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:11,117
- Stand by to get underway.
- Tactical and Communications ready.

264
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:14,717
- Navigation and Operations ready.
- Weapons ready.

265
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:17,566
Impulse engines on line,
warp power available.

266
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:19,803
Very well.

267
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,680
Seal the airlock,
release docking clamps...

268
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:26,277
Just a moment, sir.
There's someone in the airlock.

269
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:28,762
It's Odo.

270
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:33,440
Sisko to Odo.
Is there a problem, Constable?

271
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:37,242
'No, Commander. I would like
permission to come aboard.

272
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:41,360
'l'm here at the request
of the Bajoran government.'

273
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:44,320
- Permission granted.
- 'Thank you, sir.'

274
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:47,007
Dax, we must arrange
some quarters for the Constable.

275
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:52,121
I'll do it. I need to go down
to what is laughingly called the sickbay.

276
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,522
Odo's aboard, sir. The airlock's clear.

277
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:57,923
Release docking clamps,
aft thrusters at one quarter,

278
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:01,596
port and starboard at station keeping.

279
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:19,239
- We've cleared the station.
- Lay in a course to the wormhole.

280
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:23,758
I want to cloak when we reach
the Gamma Quadrant.

281
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:25,639
Course laid in, sir.

282
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,485
Engage.

283
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:55,160
The cloaking device
is operating within normal parameters.

284
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,404
Set course for the Karemma system,
warp seven.

285
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:01,121
- Aye, sir.
- Engage.

286
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:04,796
(Quark) Odo!

287
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:12,485
- Is this the best you can do?
- I'm afraid so.

288
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:15,485
Most of the crew quarters
don't have life supports yet.

289
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,919
Besides, we'd all feel better with
someone here to watch over Quark.

290
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:24,438
- I take that as a personal insult, Doctor.
- You should.

291
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:29,083
Now, l think l'll let you two "bunkmates"
get more comfortable.

292
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:33,077
Am l glad to see you.

293
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:37,439
I've been stuck in this miserable hole
ever since l came aboard.

294
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,922
Bunk beds, no view,

295
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:44,723
and l can't tell you what came out of the
replicator when l asked for synthehol.

296
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:50,165
So, what's your role
on this little adventure?

297
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:52,801
Providing security, no doubt?

298
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:57,762
Well, of course you are.
I mean, why else would you be here?

299
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:02,722
I feel much safer now, just knowing
you're along, because l know...

300
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:07,238
I have been holding
this shape for 1 6 hours.

301
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,564
I have to revert
back to my liquid state,

302
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:15,158
but l don't want you
to watch and gawk at me.

303
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:18,245
I understand, completely.

304
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:22,326
This is a very private moment,
and l won't interfere.

305
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:29,235
This won't be so bad, sharing...

306
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:30,766
(Growls)

307
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:33,685
I have no interest in speaking to you,

308
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:36,605
or in listening to your witless prattle.

309
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:39,036
So stay out of my way,

310
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:43,365
or you'll regret the day
you ever met me.

311
00:22:57,247 --> 00:22:59,966
Commander,
long-range sensors have picked up

312
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,726
two Jem'Hadar warships directly ahead.

313
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:06,920
- They're heading this way at warp five.
- How close will they pass us?

314
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,366
1 00,000 kilometres.

315
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,126
That's within range of their weapons.

316
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:13,966
- Should l alter course?
- No.

317
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:18,160
We need to know if they can
see through the cloaking device.

318
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:22,041
- Maintain course and speed. Red Alert.
- Aye, sir.

319
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:26,279
Here they come.
They'll pass us in five seconds.

320
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:27,522
On screen.

321
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,439
Track them.

322
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,797
They're continuing
along their original heading.

323
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:35,361
No indication that they saw us.

324
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:39,162
Wait. They're changing course,
heading this way.

325
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:42,245
- They must've seen us.
- They're powering their weapons.

326
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,278
Prepare to decloak. Lock phasers...

327
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:47,245
- No. We may not have been detected.
- Explain.

328
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:50,996
A cloaked ship radiates
a subspace variance at warp speeds.

329
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,355
I've never heard of that.

330
00:23:52,487 --> 00:23:55,240
It's not something
we've been eager to reveal.

331
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,598
I suggest dropping out of warp.
That will eliminate the variance.

332
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:02,481
When they reach our position,
they'll find nothing.

333
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:07,124
- Do it.
- All stop.

334
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:17,323
They're sweeping the area
with an anti-proton scan.

335
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:19,517
They're being very thorough about it.

336
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:22,207
Will an anti-proton scan
penetrate the cloak?

337
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,764
- That's a good question.
- I'm not sure.

338
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,681
They're getting closer.

339
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:34,959
The Defiant's power signature
is unusually high for a ship this size.

340
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:38,557
The cloaking device
may not be masking everything.

341
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:41,923
Cut main power.

342
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,199
The other one has broken off
its search. It's headed this way.

343
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,125
Stand by weapons and shields.

344
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:18,241
They've gone into warp
and resumed their original course.

345
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:23,283
The first thing to go right
in the Gamma Quadrant in a long time.

346
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:25,716
Let's hope it's not the last.

347
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,677
(Sisko) 'Ship's log, stardate 4821 2.4.

348
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:43,561
'We have arrived and are talking
to one of Quark's business partners

349
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:46,724
'in an effort to contact
the Founders of the Dominion.'

350
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:51,720
The Grand Nagus himself has sent me
as an emissary on his behalf.

351
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:54,680
If you aid us in our mission,
l am authorised

352
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,156
to increase our purchases
of tulaberry wine

353
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,482
from the Karemma by 3% .

354
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:03,964
Looks like a poly-duranium alloy blend.

355
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:07,124
Interesting,
but the metal has no real value.

356
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:09,238
A 3% increase is negligible.

357
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:13,599
I have considerable leeway
to bargain in this circumstance.

358
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,924
- Name your terms.
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

359
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,163
The terms are not the issue.

360
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:21,323
I cannot help you locate the Founders

361
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:25,326
because l don't know who they are
or if they exist. Nothing.

362
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:28,007
Ah, here's something interesting.

363
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:31,722
It appears to be diamide-laced beritium.

364
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:34,156
- I'll give you 52 diraks for it.
- Done.

365
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:37,359
- Quark.
- One bargain at a time, Ornithar.

366
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:40,877
- We were talking about the Founders.
- There is nothing further to say.

367
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:43,805
If the Founders exist,
they do not wish to be contacted.

368
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:45,804
That is good enough for me.

369
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,316
Who's your contact in the Dominion,

370
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:51,564
regarding administration,
trade, defence?

371
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:54,281
Our only contact
has been through the Vorta.

372
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:56,477
I have no idea who they report to.

373
00:26:56,607 --> 00:27:00,122
All l know is that the Vorta say
to do something, and you do it.

374
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:01,236
Why?

375
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:04,165
If you do not,
they will send in the Jem'Hadar.

376
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:06,118
And then you die.

377
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:09,000
Will you put us
in contact with the Vorta?

378
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,163
We do as we're told, nothing more.

379
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:14,040
We have not been told to help you.

380
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,237
You haven't been told not to either.

381
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,403
No, but l prefer to be cautious.

382
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:22,156
In this case, being cautious
will cost you a substantial profit.

383
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:25,882
The Ferengi will cease
purchasing tulaberry wine immediately.

384
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:28,840
If you lost a contract
with the Alpha Quadrant,

385
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:31,197
it might displease the Vorta.

386
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:35,115
They may even send the Jem'Hadar
to find out what happened.

387
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:39,320
I will need to access
one of our computers on the surface.

388
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:46,923
This is the Callinon System.

389
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:51,040
The Dominion maintains an unmanned
subspace relay on the seventh planet.

390
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:54,204
The Vorta told us
to direct all communications there.

391
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:58,366
Where the messages
are sent after that is not our concern.

392
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:01,285
What is that?

393
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:04,243
It is the Omarion Nebula.

394
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:09,521
The Omarion Nebula.

395
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:15,560
If there is nothing else,
l would like to leave now.

396
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:18,281
- Of course.
- Commander...

397
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:22,161
I have fulfilled my role on this mission,
so if you don't mind...

398
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:25,597
- You want to stay behind.
- That was our agreement.

399
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:29,276
How can you be sure
he won't turn you over to the Dominion?

400
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,284
He may serve the Dominion,

401
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:33,841
but l'm lining his pockets with latinum.

402
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:38,279
I'll book passage on the next ship
going through the wormhole,

403
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:41,638
and l'll make a profit in the process.

404
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:44,076
All right, Quark. Good luck.

405
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:47,482
Same to you, Commander.

406
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:51,562
Lay in a course for the Callinon System.

407
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:53,200
(Kira) Aye, sir.

408
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,444
(Doorbell)

409
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:04,406
Come in.

410
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,438
- Did l wake you?
- Not quite.

411
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:14,837
- What can l do for you, Major?
- It's about Odo.

412
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:19,085
- You're worried about him.
- Is it that obvious?

413
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:21,721
No, l'm worried about him too.

414
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:25,524
But at the moment,
l don't know what to do about it.

415
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:29,087
Can l speak freely?

416
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:32,597
What is wrong with Starfleet?
How could they do this to him?

417
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:34,718
This has been a long time coming.

418
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:39,682
Starfleet have been pressing me
to replace him for two years.

419
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:41,877
Because he worked
for the Cardassians.

420
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:45,283
It goes deeper than that.
Odo is no team player.

421
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:48,524
Because sometimes he doesn't go
through the proper channels?

422
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:53,402
That's a start. Odo enjoys
thumbing his nose at authority.

423
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:55,757
He files reports when he feels like it.

424
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:58,162
His respect
for the chain of command is minimal.

425
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:02,200
- He gets the job done.
- Starfleet likes team players.

426
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:06,115
Starfleet likes the chain of command,
and so do l.

427
00:30:06,247 --> 00:30:09,045
- You agree with their decision?
- No, but l understand it.

428
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,806
After this mission,
you're going to let him go?

429
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:15,237
I want him to stay as much as you do,
but he has to want to stay.

430
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:19,485
'Bridge to Commander Sisko.
We've reached the Callinon System.'

431
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:20,960
On my way.

432
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:28,357
(Sisko) 'Ship's log, supplemental.

433
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:31,923
'The Defiant has cloaked
and assumed standard orbit.

434
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:36,518
'l'll send Dax and O'Brien to survey
the relay station on the surface.'

435
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:39,161
It looks like Ornithar was telling the truth

436
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:42,120
when he said
the relay station was unmanned.

437
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:44,966
Also, there are
few security measures in place.

438
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:47,681
Get in, find what we need, and get out.

439
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:50,446
- Understood.
- On your way.

440
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,525
The transporter will need
six seconds to beam them down.

441
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:56,207
I want to decloak
for exactly six seconds.

442
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:58,841
'Dax to Bridge.
We're ready, Benjamin.'

443
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:01,083
All right. Disengage cloak.

444
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:02,716
Energise.

445
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:09,959
- They're on the surface.
- Were we scanned during transport?

446
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:14,126
- I don't think so.
- 'Dax to Defiant.'

447
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,444
We're in what seems to be
the central computer room.

448
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:20,923
The user interface is unusual,
but l think we can access it.

449
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,117
'Keep us posted.'

450
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:27,958
- I'm into the main directory.
- That was fast.

451
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:31,363
Yes, it was. A bit too fast if you ask me.

452
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:34,797
Any sign that we've tripped
some kind of security protocol?

453
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,600
No, l still have access to everything.

454
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:40,605
Then let's get the information
and get out of here.

455
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:42,843
That's fine with me.

456
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,879
I should've taken Quark up
on his offer for a new replicator.

457
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:53,123
- Sir?
- Nothing.

458
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,762
Let's make good use of this time.
Begin a level three diagnostic...

459
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:59,003
'Dax to Defiant.
We have something.'

460
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:03,678
We've accessed a communications log
of outgoing transmissions.

461
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:08,562
It looks like 80% of the outgoing traffic
is sent to one location.

462
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:13,044
It's my guess it's either another
relay station or a command centre.

463
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:16,716
- Do you have the coordinates?
- I'm sending them to you now.

464
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:22,437
- We've lost contact with them.
- Get them out of there.

465
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,479
I can't. A shield has appeared
around the outpost.

466
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:27,643
I can't get through it.

467
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,397
Three Jem'Hadar ships
are heading this way.

468
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:35,963
Can we punch through the
security shield before they get here?

469
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,918
I'm not sure.

470
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:40,242
We will have to decloak.

471
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:42,437
That means we'll be seen
by the Jem'Hadar.

472
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:45,081
We must do something.

473
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:47,243
That's exactly what we should do -

474
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,801
Ieave them.
We came here to locate the Founders,

475
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:53,442
not to fight the Jem'Hadar
over two expendable crew members.

476
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:56,320
No one is expendable.

477
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:59,439
The Jem'Hadar
will be in orbit in 30 seconds.

478
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:10,242
- Prepare to leave orbit.
- Commander...

479
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:12,562
As you were, Doctor.

480
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:16,282
Lay in a course
to the coordinates Dax sent us.

481
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:22,284
- Course laid in.
- Warp seven. Engage.

482
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:41,802
What do you think
will happen to Dax and O'Brien?

483
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:43,918
They'll be held for interrogation.

484
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:48,165
Dax will use the opportunity
to try to contact the Founders.

485
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,243
I intend to do the same.

486
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:52,961
Sisko to Odo.
Report to the bridge, Constable.

487
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:55,601
I want to discuss
the security arrangements for...

488
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:59,686
'l'm presently indisposed.
Please find someone else for the job.'

489
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:02,844
- That doesn't sound like Odo.
- No, it doesn't.

490
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,039
- I'd better have a talk with him.
- Let me, sir.

491
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,283
I think he'll listen to me.

492
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,405
Three Jem'Hadar ships
have entered sensor range,

493
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:14,404
bearing 037, mark 21 5.

494
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:16,836
- Any sign they've detected us?
- Negative.

495
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:19,765
Bring us out of warp,
then cut main power.

496
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:22,003
We'll wait until they pass.

497
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:33,918
Odo, it's time we had a talk.

498
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:37,517
I'm not going to the bridge,
so you can save your breath.

499
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:41,196
And l would appreciate
being left alone right now.

500
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:44,319
You've been alone,
and it hasn't done any good.

501
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:48,076
Maybe it's time
to stop brooding and start talking.

502
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:55,164
- Are you the ship's counsellor now?
- No, l'm your friend.

503
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:59,519
You know, the one who comes to you
when she needs help.

504
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,718
I'm trying to return the favour.

505
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:09,319
You can return the favour by giving me
a shuttlecraft and letting me go.

506
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:13,963
Go? Go where?
We're in the heart of the Dominion.

507
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:17,762
Where do you think you're going to go?

508
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:19,605
The Omarion Nebula.

509
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:26,355
- Why?
- I'm not sure why.

510
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:29,206
I just know l have to, that's all.

511
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,718
You're going to
have to do a lot better than that.

512
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:40,197
Odo, talk to me.

513
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:42,602
Tell me what's going on.

514
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:50,801
Ever since we've come
into the Gamma Quadrant

515
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:55,603
I've had this feeling
of being drawn somewhere,

516
00:35:56,407 --> 00:36:01,276
pulled by some instinct
to a specific place.

517
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:05,560
The Omarion Nebula.

518
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:09,761
- Why there?
- I don't know.

519
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,725
All right.

520
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:18,965
Once we've contacted the Founders,
l'm sure Commander Sisko...

521
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:22,477
No, not after
we've contacted the Founders, now.

522
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:26,077
- I have to leave now.
- Look, l understand.

523
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:29,165
This is important to you,
but we have a mission to...

524
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:34,205
Direct hit on the port nacelle.

525
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,522
How did they see
through the cloaking device?

526
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:39,605
They might have analysed
the information from their scan

527
00:36:39,727 --> 00:36:41,797
and found a way to penetrate the cloak.

528
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:43,963
Save the speculation for later.

529
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:47,363
Disengage cloak, raise shields
and fire on my command.

530
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:04,679
Communications
and long-range sensors are out.

531
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:08,686
- Status of the warp drive?
- The power coupling is destroyed.

532
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:11,002
I'm trying to reroute main power.

533
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:19,126
He's gone. I'll take the helm.

534
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:24,121
I'm locking onto the lead ship.
Ready? Fire.

535
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:33,206
The other two
are moving out of phaser range.

536
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:37,639
They're coming back for another pass
but they're moving slower now.

537
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:39,758
They'll be more cautious this time.

538
00:37:39,887 --> 00:37:42,037
Doctor, use evasive pattern delta-five.

539
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:46,285
We need to keep them off balance
until we get warp power back.

540
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:53,921
- Are you all right?
- Just a few bruises.

541
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:55,685
Kira to Bridge.

542
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,559
Kira to Bridge.

543
00:37:57,687 --> 00:37:59,643
We have to get up there.

544
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:03,157
T'Rul, where's my warp power?

545
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:06,836
I can't get the phase inducers
to align with the ODN matrices...

546
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:10,562
Three more Jem'Hadar warships
approaching!

547
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,917
Full impulse, get us out of here.

548
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:16,840
- We've lost main power.
- We have to get to a shuttle.

549
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,800
Our duty is to get to defend the ship.

550
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:23,203
If main power is out,
then the shields are out, Kira.

551
00:38:23,327 --> 00:38:25,443
The ship is defenceless.

552
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:40,124
Main power is off-line.
The shields have collapsed.

553
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:44,525
I've lost helm control.
Inertial dampers failing.

554
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:47,445
Ready escape pods,
stand by to abandon ship.

555
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:46,404
Where am l?

556
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:50,243
You're in a shuttlecraft.

557
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:54,201
You were wounded.
Try not to move around.

558
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:04,239
Odo, what happened?
We were under attack?

559
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:09,725
The ship was boarded.
You were wounded in the attack.

560
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:12,645
I managed to get us
to this shuttlecraft,

561
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:15,122
but l don't know much more than that.

562
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:18,282
The last time l saw the Defiant

563
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:22,878
she was dead in space
and surrounded by Jem'Hadar ships.

564
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:24,963
Sisko? Bashir?

565
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:28,480
I don't know.

566
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:44,918
- Where are we?
- Approaching the Omarion Nebula.

567
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:48,756
You should have taken us
back to the wormhole.

568
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:51,845
- You didn't object.
- I was unconscious.

569
00:40:57,487 --> 00:40:59,796
Have you found anything?

570
00:41:05,807 --> 00:41:10,278
There's a class-M planet,
no star system. A rogue planet?

571
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:11,556
Yes.

572
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:33,719
Welcome home.
