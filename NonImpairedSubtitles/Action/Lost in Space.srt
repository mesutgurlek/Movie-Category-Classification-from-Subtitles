1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,428
FinaIIy...

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,872
the warring nations of Earth had
forgotten their differences...

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,118
and bandedtogether
to save our pIanet.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,555
The United GIobaI Space Force
was searchingthe gaIaxy...

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,197
for worIds rich with drinkabIe
water and breathabIe air.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,712
The hypergate was our besthope
to coIonize space...

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,070
our besthopefor survivaI.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,192
Butas we prepared
to Iaunch ourseIves...

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,312
into the bIack of space...

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,309
terrorists, caIIingthemseIves
"The GIobaI Sedition..."

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,512
were preparingto strike.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,313
Grissom base, this is Cargo 7
requesting Ianding cIearance.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,239
Roger, transport.
This is Grissom gate controI.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,396
PIease downIoad security codes.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,590
DownIoading.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,429
Transport, I've got two bIips
inside your radar signature.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,710
They're hiding in your shadow.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,275
I don'tsee anything.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,834
This is gate controI.
BattIe stations.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,956
BattIe stations.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,595
Two Seditionfighters
are attackingthe hypergate.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,029
BattIe stations.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,038
Gate controI, this is EagIe One.
I'm Iocked and Ioaded.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,833
Ready tofIy.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,316
Roger, EagIe One.
You're cIear to Iaunch.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,752
Jeb, where are you, buddy?

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,515
This coIdwar just gothot.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,790
They're Sedition raiders.

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,629
It's another
mutantsuicide squad.

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,678
Here we go. Man-to-man.
SpIit them up.

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,749
Last one to kiII a bad guy
buys the beer.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,718
I'm gonna go through the gate,
getinfront of him.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,469
That's notstandard procedure,
Don.

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,313
Better getinside his shieIds.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,628
You gen-techs are ugIy upcIose.

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,956
TargetIock.

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,515
Showtime.

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,838
Bogey One dispatched.

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,439
Don, he's right on my taiI.

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,199
Damn! Can'tshake him.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,510
I've been hit!

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,075
Weapons are off-Iine.

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,114
I'm gonna jettison
the main drive core.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,788
There you are.

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,313
Am I good or what?

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,910
Warning. FaiIure
in redundant drive systems.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,078
Gate controI,
this is Ranger One.

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,351
Engines wiII notrespond.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,152
Don, I'mfaIIing
towards the hypergate.

50
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,670
Breakingthrusters won'tfire!

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,157
Impactin30 seconds.

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,510
Ranger One, this is base.

53
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,871
Rescue craft
have been dispatched.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,792
Grissom, those pods wiII never
reach him in time.

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,990
I'm going in.

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,670
Major West, you are not
authorizedto jeopardize--

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,235
Never Iikedthatstation anyway.

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,797
Warning. Proximity aIert.

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,436
Hang on, Jeb. I'm coming in.

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,950
Abort. Abort!

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,914
I'II give you a IittIe kiss.
Don't take this the wrongway.

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,555
Impactinfive seconds.

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,748
Does this mean
we're going steady?

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,953
You're not getting out
of buyingthose beers that easy.

65
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,873
With intrepid pioneering spirit,
the RobinsonfamiIy...

66
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,629
wiII journey to the distant
worId of AIpha Prime.

67
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,640
Whatkind of future can
our chiIdren Iookforwardto?

68
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,672
A future in paradise.

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,075
TheJupiter mission...

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,512
made possibIe by the Army and
SiIicon Graphics Corporation.

71
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,794
S.G.I. Savingthefuture
for our chiIdren.

72
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,798
Give me a break.

73
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,878
HoIo-caII
from Houston middIe schooI.

74
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,116
HeIIo?

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,834
HeIIo, PrincipaI Cartwright.

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,952
Whathas he done this time?

77
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,632
He hacked our main power grid
to run his experiment.

78
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,993
The schooIwas in chaos.

79
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,675
Yeah, right.

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,951
We didn't even have Iights.

81
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,831
This is no Iaughing matter,
Professor Robinson.

82
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,192
WiII is terribIy gifted.

83
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,790
The changing shape of education.

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,708
His IittIe time machines,
though purefancy...

85
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,958
are the products
of a truIy briIIiantmind.

86
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,193
No more monkey business.

87
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,868
I mean it.

88
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,356
The boy is starved
for attention.

89
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,633
I know your Iife is anything
butnormaI rightnow...

90
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,354
but wasn't there some way...

91
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,712
hisfather couId have
attendedthe sciencefair?

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,673
As you are aware...

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,509
AIpha Prime is the onIy other
habitabIe pIanet...

94
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,589
yet detected
by deepspace recon.

95
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,477
My crew wiII sIeepaway
our 10-year journey there...

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,592
in suspended animation.

97
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,432
Once we have rendezvousedwith
the research coIony onAIpha...

98
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,996
IwiII supervise
construction of a hypergate.

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,034
By then,
technicians here on Earth...

100
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,358
wiII have compIeted
the companion hypergate...

101
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,836
in our pIanet's orbit.

102
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,958
Once both gates are compIete...

103
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,992
ships wiII be abIe to pass
instantaneousIy between them.

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,796
Immediate coIonization
of AIpha Prime wiII be possibIe.

105
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,708
Can'tyou justuse
theJupiter's hyper-engine...

106
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,071
to zapstraight to AIpha Prime?

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,035
Hyperspace exists
beneath normaI space.

108
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,870
If youtry to enter hyperspace
withouta gate...

109
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,034
your exitfactor is random.

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,038
There's no teIIing
where you'd come out.

111
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,353
Ninety-eightpercent of
the gaIaxy is stiII uncharted.

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,473
There's a Iot of space
to getIostin.

113
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,750
How is Captain DanieIs
recoveringfrom thefIu?

114
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,553
WiII he piIot the mission?

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,513
Ladies and gentIemen.

116
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,635
You came to getyourfirstIook
at theJupiter 1.

117
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,672
Don'tyouthink
you've waited Iong enough?

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,159
Let's move into the Iaunch dome.

119
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,430
One more question, Professor.

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,030
Nowthat the mission's
been pushed up...

121
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,914
how do your chiIdrenfeeI
aboutIeavingthe earth behind?

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,954
They couIdn'tbe more excited.

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,712
This mission sucks!

124
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,991
I don't wanna Ieave earIy.
I don't wanna go ataII.

125
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,759
We wiII discuss this at dinner.

126
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,638
For the Iast three years, I've
missed everythingtraining...

127
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,719
so I can spendthe next 10years
missing everything eIse.

128
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,439
I'm notstaying homefor dinner.

129
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,029
I'm seeing my friends.

130
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,799
Penny.

131
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,710
I'm going out to say good-bye
to my entire Iife.

132
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,353
Penny, I needyou here tonight.
Waita minute.

133
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,715
On this eve, before she's torn
from everything she knows--

134
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,593
kidnapped...

135
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,838
hurIed into deepspace
againsther wiII--

136
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,748
what thoughtsfiIIthe mind
of the daring space captive?

137
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,633
Are there boys onAIpha Prime?

138
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,672
What wiII Iwear?

139
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,150
What wiII itbe Iike to jettison
your body into deepspace?

140
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,717
First...
you'IItry hoIdingyour breath.

141
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,993
Butyour bIood's
aIready begun to boiI.

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,592
Then your skin infIates
Iike a baIIoon.

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,031
Then...pop.

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,232
Do they have a name
for what's wrongwith you?

145
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,279
Dad says don'tbringthem.

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,472
Like anything I do
matters to him.

147
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,717
Don'tsweatit, kid.

148
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,550
I gotapoIogy videos
for two birthdays.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,309
HeforgotIastyear compIeteIy.

150
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,914
This mission's the onIy thing
he cares aboutanymore.

151
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,394
So that's a no tofamiIy dinner?

152
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,398
Let's see.

153
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,319
Do I spend my Iastnight
on Earth...

154
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,672
watching Mom and Dad pretend
not to befighting again...

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,918
or bIow 10years worth
of aIIowance at the maII?

156
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,470
You do the math.

157
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,148
Mom's gonna go thermaI.

158
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,990
What's she gonna do,
ground me?

159
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,398
I'm nervous aboutjamming in
a new piIot the Iastsecond.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,592
The GIobaI Sedition
is getting brave.

161
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,678
First the hypergate,
then DanieIs.

162
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,031
Next time, they may attack
the Iaunch dome.

163
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,390
We can'taffordto wait.

164
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,310
WiII's sciencefair. Reminder.
ApoIogy videofor WiII.

165
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,556
He'II understand.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,955
Ben, Iisten.

167
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,153
My famiIy is on this mission.

168
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,556
I need a piIot who's
more than justspitand poIish.

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,319
I've gotyour man.

170
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,398
He just doesn'tknow ityet.

171
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,237
At ease, Major.

172
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,159
Why was I puIIed
from active duty?

173
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,999
Those gen-techs
may attack again.

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,750
I needto be up there.

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,349
Do you know Professor Robinson?

176
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,792
By reputation. Yourfather's
battIe strategies...

177
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,151
were required reading
at the academy.

178
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,308
What can youteII me
about theJupiter mission?

179
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,518
TheJupiter
is an oversized robot.

180
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,719
Everything's automatic.

181
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,389
Any monkey in afIightsuit...

182
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,478
can piIot thatship
out of the soIar system...

183
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,592
and sether down onAIpha Prime.

184
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,429
It's a baby-sitting job, sir.

185
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,835
No offence.

186
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,795
Major, are you aware Earth's
resources are severeIy Iimited?

187
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,116
Every schooIchiId knows...

188
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,279
that our recycIingtechnoIogies
wiII cure the environment.

189
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,879
Sending afamiIy
across the gaIaxy...

190
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,232
is a stunt to seII computers
to peopIe of aII ages.

191
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,908
Every schooIchiIdwas Iiedto.

192
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,555
RecycIingtechnoIogies
came too Iate.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,560
AIIfossiIfueIs
are virtuaIIy exhausted.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,036
The ozone Iayer is down to40%.

195
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,952
In two decades, the earth wiII
be unabIe to supporthuman Iife.

196
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,198
The new GIobaI Sedition knows
the truth as weII as we do.

197
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,119
They're buiIding
their own hypergate.

198
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,994
They hope to coIonize
AIpha Primefirst.

199
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,714
If they're successfuI...

200
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,151
western demons Iike you and I,
Major West...

201
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,113
wiII be Ieft on Earth to die.

202
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,471
Captain DanieIs doesn'thave
thefIu, does he?

203
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,878
Captain DanieIs was murdered
in his apartmentIastnight.

204
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,958
ThefIu story is a cover.

205
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,550
IfIew with Mike.

206
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,634
We shouId bIast their bases!
A decisive strike now!

207
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,149
My squadron is aIertstatus--

208
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,397
Your rescue stunt wasfooIhardy!

209
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,239
I had afriend in troubIe.

210
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,557
So you endangered
a $10-biIIion spacecraft...

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,355
disobeyed a direct order
because of afriend?

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,115
I did...

213
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,269
sir.

214
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,755
He'II do.

215
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,395
CongratuIations.

216
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,229
You're the new piIot
of theJupiter mission.

217
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,311
The Sedition hired me
to provide access...

218
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,716
to DanieIs' apartment
and no more.

219
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,230
My workis done.

220
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,872
They found a repIacementpiIot.

221
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,072
Our attack
on the hypergatefaiIed.

222
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,317
Howtragicfor you.

223
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,110
We require a more direct
intervention on your part.

224
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,834
I see.

225
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,117
It wiII costyou.

226
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,116
I'm afraidthatmy price
has justbecome...

227
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,039
astronomicaI.

228
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,749
HoIograph off.

229
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,035
Come in.

230
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,157
ControI hasn'treceived
resuIts of the pre-fIight exams.

231
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,194
The Robinsons
have checked out 100%.

232
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,868
They'refitas afiddIe
and ready tofIy.

233
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,469
Wish them Iuck...

234
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,708
for me.

235
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,155
unIess you encounter
a miIitary emergency.

236
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,352
In that case, Major West,
you are in charge.

237
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,155
I'm afighter piIot.
There mustbe better candidates.

238
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,511
HeII, even my ownfamiIy
can'tstand me.

239
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,359
Shutup.

240
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,235
Jeb WaIker.
He's an exceIIentfIyer.

241
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,669
He's perfectfor this mission.

242
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,394
WeIcome aboard, Major.

243
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,758
Looks Iike somebody sprung
for thefuII-extras package...

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,916
on this beauty.

245
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,035
If you have to be a baby-sitter,
it's notsuch a bad nursery.

246
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,038
WouIdn'tyou agree?

247
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,396
I don't getit.

248
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,400
I can't get the cryo-sIeep
systems upover 96%.

249
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,353
Dr Smith approvedthe specs.

250
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,156
Dr Smith is the base physician.
I am responsibIe infIight.

251
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,397
These tubes wiII be perfect,
or the shipwiII notIaunch.

252
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,556
Is that cIear?

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,116
AbsoIuteIy, Doctor.

254
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,996
Judy, Iwant to introduce you
to Major West.

255
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,192
He'II be taking Mike's pIace.

256
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,069
He's heavier than Mike.
We'II have to recaIibrate.

257
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,148
I'd be happy to discuss
my dimensions, Doctor...

258
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,874
say, over dinner?

259
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,359
West.
I've read aboutyou.

260
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,119
You're a war hero, aren'tyou?

261
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,949
WeII, yes, actuaIIy.

262
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,195
Who was it who said,
"Those who can't think,fight"?

263
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,236
Ithinkthatit was me.

264
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,352
It was nice to have metyou.

265
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,918
That's one coIdfish
I'd Iove to thaw.

266
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,077
I'm not gonna make it over
for dinner tonight, Dad.

267
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,358
It's gonna be a IongfIight.

268
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,152
Maureen, pick up the phone,
honey.

269
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,715
I know you're there.
Are you stiII packing?

270
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,593
I'm justIeaving.
Go to bed.

271
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,715
Sweetie?

272
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,759
He wonfirstprize again.

273
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,555
Is this the new modeI
he's been working on?

274
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,431
Crazy idea he's gotabouta...

275
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,191
time machine?

276
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,994
Pretty sharpstuff for a midget.

277
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,038
Sorry about dinner.
Thatnew piIot--

278
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,390
John, thefamiIy needs you here.

279
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,559
This whoIe thing
is aboutfamiIy.

280
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,753
My onIy condition
for acceptingthis mission...

281
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,760
was that we couId bring
the chiIdren with us...

282
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,996
notIeave them behind...

283
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,590
sofuture generations
wouId have a new home.

284
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,429
You're off saving humanity,
so what does itmatter...

285
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,632
that WiII
has to bIackouthis schooI...

286
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,593
to gethisfather's attention...

287
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,555
Penny's been dragged home
by security 3 nights in a row...

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,718
Judy's become a ghost,
Iike herfather?

289
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,718
I have to compensate
for the new Iaunch time.

290
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,479
What do youthinkI'm doing?

291
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,909
Revising Iife-science protocoIs.

292
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,873
I'm aIso deaIing
with two kids...

293
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,276
who are Ieaving
an entire pIanetbehind.

294
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,315
Sorry, but there's no manuaIs
on howto deaIwith this.

295
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,711
Maybe it doesn't do any good...

296
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,435
saving a worId of famiIies
if we can'tsave our own.

297
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,834
Is thatit, Professor?

298
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,196
John.

299
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,710
I know, baby.
I'm scared, too.

300
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,432
Med suppIiesfor theJupiter 2?

301
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,756
That's our Iast crate.

302
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,076
Whata mess.

303
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,794
They're not taking any chances.

304
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,156
Forgive me if Iforego the kiss,
my sIeeping behemoth...

305
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,955
but the time has come to awake.

306
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,833
Robotis on-Iine.

307
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,918
Reviewing primary directives.

308
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,272
One--
preserve the RobinsonfamiIy.

309
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,438
Two--
maintain the ship's systems.

310
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,429
Spare me the chatter,
my steeIy centurion.

311
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,271
SadIy, Ifear I havefar more
dire deeds in storefor you.

312
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,719
Robotis on-Iine.

313
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,593
Reviewing primary directives.

314
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,918
Sixteen hours into mission,

One question.

360
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,954
Is there room
in these tubesfor two?

361
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,594
There's bareIy enough
for you andyour ego.

I'II need Dr Robinson's
portabIe gurney.

478
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,436
You'IIfind itbeIow.

479
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,836
Smith, come on!

480
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,517
Youtriedto kiII my famiIy.

481
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,756
We trustedyou.

482
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,236
It's the worId behindthe worId,
Professor Robinson.

483
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,911
Lie once, cheat twice,
and everything becomes cIear.

484
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,558
Do notmistake my deception
for a characterfIaw.

485
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,830
Itis a phiIosophicaI choice...

486
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,714
thatI'vefound
in a study of the universe.

487
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,115
Itis a way of Iife.

488
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,549
You're a monster.

489
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,195
Perhaps,
butI'm aIso the onIy one...

490
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,471
who can saveJudy's Iife.

491
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,314
Penny, precious, Iwantyouto
short the power on my command.

492
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,432
Does he have to caII me
precious?

493
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,119
Penny, precious.

494
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,873
Now!

495
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,399
She's notbreathing.

496
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,273
Sickbay, move!

497
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,675
The sun won'tIetus go.

498
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,519
HeatshieId breach,
60 seconds.

499
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,676
I need options, Professor.

500
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,076
We have to divertaII power
to the engines.

501
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,273
I'm rerouting Iife sciences.

502
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,472
Rerouting Iife support.

503
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,751
Engines at80%.

504
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,273
There's no cardiopuImonary
or respiratory functions.

505
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,714
CIear.

506
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,718
Again. CIear.

507
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,556
AIert.

508
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,115
MedicaI.

509
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,190
Rerouting error.

510
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,073
Systems are crashing.

511
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,597
We're Iosing her. Do something.

512
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,155
Come on, chiId.

513
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,111
Puta IittIe heartinto it.

514
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,679
The other Iife I save...

515
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,632
wiII be my own.

516
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,911
Wake up, baby, pIease.

517
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,752
That's aIIthe power we've got.

518
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,156
I'm puttingthe pedaI
to the metaI. Here it goes.

519
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,032
She can'tbreakfree.
She doesn'thave enough thrust.

520
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,199
There's got to be a way
to get through this.

521
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,315
That's it.

522
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,596
It's working!

523
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,234
Whatis?

524
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,955
If we can't go aroundthe sun,
we go straight through it...

525
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,196
usingyour hyperdrive.

526
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,392
Engage the hyperdrive
withouta gate?

527
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,796
We couId be thrown
anywhere in the gaIaxy.

528
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,389
Anywhere buthere.

529
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,236
On my mark.

530
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,513
Three, two, one, initiate.

531
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,789
Hyperdrive at 100%.

532
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,912
Major, you have the com.

533
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,510
Dad? Dad!

534
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,477
Let's see what this baby can do.

535
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,552
Maureen, everyone?

536
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,115
-Where isJudy?
-She's OK.

537
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,313
She is, thanks to me.

538
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,599
Here I am.

539
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,792
Either I shouId cut down
on the Iiquids...

540
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,435
or I shouId sew in a newfIap
because it was reaIIy heII...

541
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,790
getting out of that thing.

542
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,956
You're...

543
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,470
VitaIs are normaI. PuIse
and respiration seem to be.

544
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,433
-Are you OK?
-I'mfine.

545
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,995
Come here.

546
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,709
WiII every IittIe probIem be an
excuseforfamiIiaI sentiment?

547
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,875
How much, Smith?

548
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,074
What was the price tag
thatyou put on ourfuture?

549
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,395
You can't do it, can you, John?

550
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,913
You can'tkiIIthe man
withoutbecomingthe monster.

551
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,114
Coward.

552
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,553
What's happened, John?
Where are we?

553
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,917
I bypassed
most of the damaged systems.

554
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,157
We'II have to repair the rest
manuaIIy.

555
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,469
You had me worried, doc.

556
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,353
Nice to see youthawed.

557
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,268
You have a puzzIing definition
of a smooth ride.

558
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,679
Computer,
mapour currentposition.

559
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,510
Searching
for recognizabIe consteIIations.

560
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,228
This database has star maps
of aIIthe known gaIaxy.

561
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,069
I don'trecognize
a singIe system.

562
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,193
We're Iost....

563
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,628
aren't we?

564
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,150
Easy, doc. God.

565
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,316
PIease.

566
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,399
The cryosuitabsorbed
most of the eIectricaI charge.

567
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,115
You're Iucky
this wasn'tyour hide.

568
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,189
Doctor, is that concern
I detectin your voice?

569
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,350
Greatbedside manner.

570
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,189
What's that?

571
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,153
A battIe scar?

572
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,515
Sort of.

573
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,794
It was a tattoo.

574
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,789
An ex-girIfriend's name,
butI had itremoved.

575
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,276
WouIdn'titbe easier
to use a magic marker?

576
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,878
Yeah, weII, that's me.

577
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,311
A girI in every port.

578
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,909
So, Major, nofamiIy?

579
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,828
Nothingto tie you down,
no one to miss?

580
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,431
I've never been
thefit-in and pIay-nice type.

581
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,318
Youthinkthat's romantic?

582
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,075
I don't.

583
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,277
But whataboutyou, doc?

584
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,234
Is there some Iucky IittIe nerd
you Ieftbehind?

585
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,436
I spent three years working
on this mission.

586
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,518
We're tryingto save the pIanet.

587
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,678
I haven'thadtimeforfun.

588
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,793
If there's no timeforfun...

589
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,549
then whatare we saving
the pIanetfor?

590
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,430
Here.

591
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,596
Thanks.

592
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,519
I hate being IittIe.

593
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,751
Ithinkitbroke.

594
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,036
I'IItry andfix it.

595
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,550
Why aren'tyou upon deck
with Mom and Dad?

596
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,955
Have you met our parents?

597
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,549
Good point.

598
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,674
Popcorn, orchids...

599
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,588
waves, BiIIy...

600
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,632
kissing.

601
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,669
ChocoIate.

602
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,238
It's a Iist...

603
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,799
of everythingwe Ieftbehind.

604
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,153
Never Iove anything, kiddo...

605
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,431
'cause you just end up
Iosing it.

606
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,470
Smith couId stiII hurtus.

607
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,511
Maybe I shouIdn'tIethim Iive.

608
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,156
But...

609
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,670
How can we bring
civiIization to the stars...

610
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,951
if we can'tremain civiIized?
Right, Professor?

611
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,312
Have you noticedthatyou
take the opposite position...

612
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,159
to whatever I say?

613
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,635
Of course I do.

614
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,752
We're married.

615
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,836
AIert.

616
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,714
SpatiaI anomaIy in progress.

617
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,196
What the heII?

618
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,158
I mustbe dreaming.
ThatIooks Iike a ship.

619
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,912
Itappears to be some sort
of hoIe in space.

620
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,998
Where does itIead?

621
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,112
A reasonabIe question.

622
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,479
Major, wait.

623
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,069
I'IIwaitIater.

624
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,596
PuII back.

625
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,712
Let there be Iight.

626
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,395
Proteus?

627
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,796
She's one of ours, aII right.

628
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,355
AII right.

629
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,751
I've never seen a ship
Iike this.

630
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,275
No response to haiIs.

631
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,917
Scanning aII miIitary
and civiIianfrequencies.

632
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,076
Nothing.

633
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,909
I'm getting
inconsistentIife signs...

634
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,635
but they may be sensor ghosts.

635
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,353
Computer is stiII on.

636
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,950
I'IItry the standard
docking codes.

637
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,038
ControI codes confirmed.

638
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,993
Initiating docking sequence.

639
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,074
Weird.
Whatkind of shipis that?

640
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,351
That's not one of ours.

641
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,710
Boys, that's not even human.

642
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,514
If this is aII a dream...

643
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,030
why can't there be more girIs?

644
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,798
As part of her ensIavement...

645
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,038
the brave young space captive
Penny Robinson...

646
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,874
isforcedto utiIize her
dazzIingtechnicaI expertise.

647
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,076
Identify yourseIf, soIdier.

648
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,751
West, Major,
United GIobaI Space Force...

649
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,509
requesting permission
to see the prisoner.

650
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,797
Proceed, Major West.

651
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,310
CouId he be cuter?

652
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,508
I don't think so.

653
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,837
Breathe, Penny.

654
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,035
UnIock.

655
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,554
These quarters are unacceptabIe.

656
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,389
We're goingto check out
the probe ship.

657
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,274
Maybe we canfigure outhowthey
gothere and howto gethome.

658
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,233
Have a wonderfuItrip.

659
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,395
Put this on.

660
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,034
You're comingwith us.

661
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,392
Out of the question. I am
a doctor, nota space expIorer.

662
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,035
Whatyou are
is a murderous saboteur.

663
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,276
I am notIeavingyou here...

664
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,915
so you can do more harm
than you've aIready caused.

665
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,634
I absoIuteIy refuse.

666
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,596
Give me an excuse to kiIIyou.

667
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,199
PIease?

668
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,398
BIack was aIways my coIour.

669
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,389
Lock.

670
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,517
Activate standby.

671
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,520
Crush, kiII, destroy.

672
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,873
Surprise.

673
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,469
Safety on.

674
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,353
Dad, chiII.
It's OK.

675
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,870
I hacked into his CPU,
andthen...

676
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,039
I bypassed
his main operating systems...

677
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,789
and accessed his subroutines.

678
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,038
He's basicaIIy justrunning
on remote controI.

679
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,317
I know I haven'tbeen around--

680
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,875
Professor.

681
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,793
We're ready to go.

682
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,792
We'IItaIkIater, son.

683
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,593
Take care of my dad.

684
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,598
OK, Robot?

685
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,314
Vacuum check compIete.

686
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,149
Oxygen IeveIs are normaI.

687
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,669
Microbe scans are negative.

688
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,553
CIear.

689
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,992
The air is staIe, oId.

690
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,795
That's the smeII of ghosts.

691
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,118
I've got
her on-board computer up.

692
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,110
Not working?

693
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,595
She's working, aII right.

694
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,075
Just--I don'tknow.

695
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,590
Too damnfast.

696
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,035
Dad, do you hear something?

697
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,959
Like the drip, dripof bIood.

698
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,675
You reaIIy needto shutup.

699
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,435
Here.

700
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,157
This matter appears bioIogicaI.

701
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,479
Nothing goodwiII come of this.

702
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,753
You, of course, beingthe expert
on space expIoration.

703
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,315
Let's go.

704
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,478
Trustme, Major.

705
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,598
EviI knows eviI.

706
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,232
Motion sensors
are stiIIworking.

707
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,795
This way.

708
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,354
RambIer-crane series robots.

709
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,075
ButIike no design
I've ever seen.

710
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,999
WeII, weII.

711
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,758
Aren't we the poor cousin?

712
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,679
Down here.

713
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,837
It's a remote opstation.

714
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,433
Come on, Dr Smith.

715
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,957
CouIdthis shipbe a prototype?

716
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,116
Looks Iike some kind
of firefight.

717
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,356
Captain's Iog is degraded.

718
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,870
Maybe I can gather
somefragments.

719
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,711
Sorry.

720
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,829
The hyperspace tracker seems
to befunctioning normaIIy...

721
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,477
but we cannotprocess
aIIthe data.

722
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,479
There is no sign
of theJupiter 2.

723
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,673
I have exceeded my timetabIe.

724
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,115
When did he make Major?

725
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,278
Iwant this on the record.

726
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,269
I am not wiIIingto give up.

727
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,278
Don wouId keepIookingfor me.

728
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,988
That's it. The rest
of the data's totaIIy corrupted.

729
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,749
How couIdthey Iaunch
a rescue missionfor us...

730
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,031
when we've onIy been Iosta day?

731
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,153
There's no data
on the aIien ship...

732
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,478
but they broughtin something
that was attachedto its huII.

733
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,515
Gotit.

734
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,278
Some sort of egg sac?

735
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,630
Getbackhere!

736
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,833
Be happy to obIige...

737
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,236
aIthough I don't thinkit's me
you shouId be worrying about...

738
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,159
butrather these.

739
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,719
I'm detecting motion.

740
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,593
Behindyou.

741
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,035
After it. Move!

742
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,356
Bring Smith.

743
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,553
Don't even think aboutit.

744
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,516
Hydroponics.

745
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,793
Growth Iike this
wouIdtake decades.

746
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,715
Unhand me, you mechanicaI moron.

747
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,996
Don'tmove.

748
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,869
Easy.

749
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,151
Easy there, buddy.

750
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,352
No one's gonna hurtyou.

751
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,431
Easy.

752
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,158
ReIax.

753
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,713
ExceIIent.

754
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,276
Looks Iike you made afriend.

755
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,436
StiII, I'dwaitafew weeks...

756
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,791
before tattooing
her name on your arm.

757
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,235
Do yourseIf afavour.

758
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,829
Don't evoIve.

759
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,036
Charming.

760
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,799
The Dr DoIittIe of outer space.

761
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,312
This couId be a creature
from thataIien ship.

762
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,113
But this guy's no piIot.

763
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,630
He Iooks Iike a chiId.

764
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,077
Try itnow.

765
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,392
Strange.

766
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,910
The scaIes are giving off heat.

767
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,874
I've tapped into
the internaI sensor array.

768
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,115
There's no other
animate Iife present.

769
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,074
Besides us,
this shipis totaIIy deserted.

770
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,351
A ghostship.

771
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,713
ThefIavour of the day
is banana beef.

772
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,109
Who thinks up
these combinations?

773
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,870
Good.

774
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,880
Major West, I highIy
recommendyou never breed.

775
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,192
That, by the way,
is my medicaI opinion.

776
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,875
LittIe thingwas hungry.

777
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,912
I've got their star maps
on-Iine.

778
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,839
Here we go.

779
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,714
More systems
than I've ever seen.

780
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,754
Finding a route to AIpha Prime.

781
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,668
DownIoadingtoJupiter.

782
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,230
I don'tIike the sound
of thatsound.

783
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,914
They're moving.

784
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,072
Get this infernaI...

785
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,476
creature off me!

786
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,670
Come here.

787
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,680
John, get the heII out of there.

788
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,680
Mom says,
"Get the heII out of there."

789
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,270
Evacuate.

790
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,199
Now!

791
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,679
The controIs are too sIow.

792
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,314
Activate hoIographic interface.

793
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,513
HoIographic interface, on-Iine.

794
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,874
They eat their wounded.

795
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,319
SeaIthe buIkhead.

796
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,115
Codes are Iocked.

797
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,912
Duck.

798
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,478
Emergency buIkhead.

799
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,750
Fire sensor activated.

800
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,838
Emergency buIkhead cIosure.

801
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,468
Stop!

802
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,911
We have to get that door open.

803
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,556
Open, damn you!

804
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,956
Get out of here.

805
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,472
Whatis with me
andthese damn doors?

806
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,673
I can't override
thefire protocoI!

807
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,031
A miIIion bucks
worth of weaponry...

808
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,991
and I'dtrade itaII back...

809
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,234
for a Iousy...

810
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,875
can of Raid.

811
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,872
Stand cIear.

812
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,311
Getmoving! Go!

813
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,628
Come on!

814
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,310
Maureen...
can you getme anything?

815
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,955
CycIingthrough a vacuum check.
I'm overriding.

816
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,271
No way it's that easy.

817
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,958
Run!

818
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,269
Run! Getback!
Getbackto the ship!

819
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,278
Move!

820
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,834
Gotit. Try itnow.

821
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,475
Mom says, "Try itnow."

822
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,876
Can we save it?

823
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,118
Can't withoutIetting
the spiders into the ship.

824
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,198
Leave him behind!

825
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,196
Thatspider scratched me!

826
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,997
StopIaughing, you IittIe worm.

827
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,755
Good-bye, Robot.

828
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,516
You couIdn'tsave him, kid.

829
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,632
Save him? Of course.

830
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,635
Whatare youtryingto do?

831
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,399
Prepare to disengage!

832
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,077
This is afun picnic.

833
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,557
FirstyeIIow aIiens,
now giantspiders.

834
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,228
The crowd goes wiId.

835
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,352
RecaIIyour chiIdhood
nightmares, Major.

836
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,074
Monsters are rareIy
so easiIy dissuaded.

837
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,988
Why don'tyoutaIkto them,
bugto bug?

838
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,431
Ithink
they'd rather come inside.

839
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,038
Armingtorpedoes.

840
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,075
Fire in the hoIe.

841
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,754
AIert. DetonationfaiIure.

842
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,831
The robotmusthave damaged
the detonator cores.

843
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,633
They won'tbIow.

844
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,789
AIert.
Outer hubhas been compromised.

845
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,996
DNA extrapoIation coming up.

846
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,671
SiIicone-based, mantium sheII,
Iack of respiratory system.

847
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,076
Means they do Iive
in deepspace.

848
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,430
Tiny frontbrain impIies
communaI reIationships.

849
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,596
Like bees.

850
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,270
If the bioIogy Iesson is over,
I couId use some heIp.

851
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,234
They may be attracted
to heatand Iight.

852
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,112
Inner huII breach in 15 seconds.

853
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,630
I'm bringingthe Proteus
fusion drives on-Iine.

854
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:49,956
It's working.

855
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,833
Let's turn up the heat.

856
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,030
Whatare you doing?

857
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,993
Never Ieave an enemy stronghoId
intact.

858
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,190
Stop!

859
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,198
That's one of yourfather's
firstruIes of engagement.

860
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,390
Thatis a direct order.

861
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,989
I hate spiders.

862
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,070
That's comingfast.

863
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,272
Getinto the harnesses now.

864
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,790
ManuaI heIm, engage.

865
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,112
-ChiIdren, secure?
-Secure.

866
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,675
I'm in.

867
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,713
PuII up.

868
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,673
ReaIIy? No kidding.
Thanks.

869
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,351
Coming in too hot.
I'IItry and sIow us down.

870
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,109
Hang on!

871
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,589
Everybody by the numbers.

872
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,553
Life sciences,
stiII breathing.

873
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,154
Video mechanics...
OK.

874
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,238
Mission medicaI, I'm aIive.

875
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,159
Me, too.
Robotics, I mean.

876
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,669
I'm aIive...

877
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,351
Major West's poor excusefor
piIoting skiIIs notwithstanding.

878
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,439
Oh, Dorothy.

879
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,438
Backin Kansas atIast.

880
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,790
YouvioIated a direct order.

881
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,951
AbouthaIf the core
materiaI's burned out.

882
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,719
We'II never generate
enough power to break orbit.

883
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,115
We can get off the ground...

884
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,437
but getting backinto space
is another story.

885
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,350
I orderedyou not to bIow
thatship's reactors.

886
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,394
Life supportis marginaI.

887
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,795
It's gonna get coId in here
tonight.

888
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,074
AIso, the pod andthe chariot
are pretty much scrapmetaI.

889
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,953
Don'tyouwaIk away from me
when I'm taIkingto you.

890
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,879
Give ita rest, Professor.

891
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,673
Iwas technicaIIy
stiII in command.

892
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,190
I am commander of this mission.

893
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,755
Look, no offence...

894
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,316
butyou're an egghead
with an honorary rank.

895
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,320
No one ever intendedfor you
to handIe combatsituations.

896
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,752
You handIed itbriIIiantIy,
sending us crashing down here.

897
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,839
Those aIiens posed
a continuingthreat.

898
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,429
I made a judgement caII...

899
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,030
and, if I have to,
I'II make itagain.

900
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,833
You of aII peopIe
shouId understandthat.

901
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,235
Yourfather wouId backme up.

902
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,396
My father is dead...

903
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,913
kiIIed in one of those combat
missions you admire so much.

904
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,316
My famiIy is on this ship,
andyouwiIIfoIIow my orders...

905
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,716
whether you agree with them
or not. Is that cIear?

906
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:52,876
Save your speeches.

907
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,878
I Iike you, butI'm gonna
do whatever it takes...

908
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,594
to ensure the success
of this mission...

909
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,270
with or withoutyour heIp.
Is that cIear?

910
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,119
Am I interrupting something?

911
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,471
No, reaIIy.

912
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,990
Ithink youtwo
shouId sIug it out.

913
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,395
Here we are,
stranded on an aIien worId...

914
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,478
andyouwant
to getinto a pissing contest?

915
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,956
PIease, gofor it.

916
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,914
I'II haveJudy down here
to decIare you both unfit...

917
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,076
and I'IItake over this mission.

918
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,796
I don't want to hear another
wordfrom you. Is that cIear?

919
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,394
Not...another word.

920
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,955
Better.

921
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,315
If you'vefinished hosing down
the decks with testosterone...

922
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,352
I suggestyou come with me.

923
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,597
I may havefound a way
off this pIanet.

924
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,232
TeII me aboutit.

925
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,079
Damn bug bite.

926
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,357
She...

927
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,190
She reaIIy is an interesting
specimen. Huh, doc?

928
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,868
She'sfascinating.

929
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,919
The retinaI aperture diIation...

930
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,874
seems directIy Iinked
to the skin pigmentation.

931
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,955
What?

932
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,029
Can I keepher?

933
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,232
She's notjustanotherfad
you can pick upandthrow away.

934
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,636
Oh, pIease.

935
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,878
She's aII aIone here, and
I promise I'II Iook outfor her.

936
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,958
I promise.

937
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,952
She kind of needs me.

938
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,912
The minute you mispIace her,
youforget tofeed her--

939
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,351
Don'tsmiIe. I mean it, Pen.

940
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,398
Thanks...doc.

941
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,473
We're both a Iongway from home,
aren't we, IittIe one?

942
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,355
BIarp?

943
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,960
That's what we'II caIIyou--
BIarp.

944
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,795
Nice girI.

945
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,719
Pretty girI.

946
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,915
Nice.

947
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,917
The atmosphere here
can sustain human Iife.

948
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,193
I've Iocated 500 rads
of radioactive materiaI...

949
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,073
five miIes west.

950
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,353
We'II need atIeast thatmuch to
get the corefunctioning again.

951
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,753
We start outat daybreak.

952
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,594
Be safer that way.

953
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,357
Those are my orders.

954
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,475
I agree
with your recommendation.

955
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,279
Dtente's a beautifuIthing.

956
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,956
It's nice to see youfound
a corner to suityour taIents.

957
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,992
Turn down the bed
before you Ieave.

958
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,635
I gave my word I'd Ietyou Iive.

959
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,030
I never saidfor how Iong.

960
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,040
FamiIy hour is over.

961
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,959
We're dying here.

962
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,233
Robinson is out of his Ieague.

963
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,117
Lookinto his eyes andteII me
you can'tsee hisfear.

964
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,955
Ifoughtin the miIIenniaIwars.

965
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,515
SurvivaI is a soIdier's game.

966
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,236
We both knowthis civiIianfooI
wiII Iead us straight to heII.

967
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:31,356
Robinson needs our heIp,
if he wants it or not.

968
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,950
With minimaIforce,
we couIdtake this ship...

969
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,994
and assure them we shaII
continue atyour command.

970
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,389
Of course.

971
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,717
My God...

972
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,639
you're right.

973
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,275
How couId I have been so bIind?

974
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,794
I'II justrun and getyou a gun
so we can hijackthe ship, OK?

975
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,519
Sarcasm is the recourse
of the weakmind.

976
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,792
I'm hidingthe pain.

977
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,355
ReaIIy.

978
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,835
Lock.

979
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,631
Your pain...

980
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,552
has justbegun.

981
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,272
StarIight, star bright.

982
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,674
A miIIion strange stars,
and onIy one wish.

983
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,519
Iwish we were home.

984
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,390
Never seen a sky Iook so aIien.

985
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,115
We reaIIy are Iost,
aren't we?

986
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,718
When thefirstsaiIors
circIedthe gIobe...

987
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,754
saw a brand-new sky...

988
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,919
they thought they'd saiIed
off the edge of the earth...

989
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,873
but they were reaIIy
justaroundthe corner.

990
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,198
You're sayingwe shouId
justbiIIow our saiIs...

991
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,755
and Iet the windtake us home?

992
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,474
Is thatit?

993
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,833
Those saiIors...

994
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,831
foundfamiIiar shapes...

995
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,077
in the stars...

996
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,318
to make the sky seem
morefriendIy...

997
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,590
andto heIp them
findtheir way home.

998
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,713
That's howthe consteIIations
were born.

999
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,110
Porky, the wise and mighty pig.

1000
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:45,199
The great...
big-eared bunny Bugs.

1001
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,152
The way you gotus down here,
that was pretty fIying.

1002
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,117
My quarters or yours?

1003
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,796
Excuse me?

1004
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,310
Don'tpIay coy.

1005
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,797
We're the onIy singIe peopIe
of consenting age in the gaIaxy.

1006
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,390
How much more of a set-up
do you need?

1007
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,832
So youfigure, why not dispense
with the pIeasantries...

1008
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,349
and get down to business?

1009
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,837
You have a way with words.

1010
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,358
Do youwant to show me
how you handIe the heIm?

1011
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,315
Righthere on this consoIe?

1012
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,994
Righthere wouId befine.

1013
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,074
Why don'tyou justhang on
to your joystick?

1014
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,197
ExceIIent technique, Major.

1015
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,149
ReaIIy.

1016
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,718
WiIIwas Iookingfor you.

1017
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,668
I senthim backto his room.

1018
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,510
He's decided
he can rebuiIdthe robot.

1019
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,669
He wants to stay upaII night
and show me his designs.

1020
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,877
Funny creatures, men.

1021
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,039
Try so hard not to be
theirfathers...

1022
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,596
end upmakingthe same mistakes.

1023
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,477
We can't get off this pIanet,
IetaIone getback on course.

1024
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,989
I don'thave time.

1025
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,919
JustIisten to him.

1026
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,874
It doesn'tmatter whathe says.
JustIisten.

1027
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,437
Sometimes--especiaIIy
in the eyes of theirfathers--

1028
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,075
IittIe boys have to comefirst.

1029
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,034
As soon as
we getback upinto space...

1030
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,916
we'II spend a Iot of time
together, I promise.

1031
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,833
It's nice havingyour
whoIefamiIy under one roof.

1032
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,036
Even if we did have to go...

1033
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,994
haIfway across the gaIaxy
to manage it.

1034
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,595
Good night, John.

1035
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,075
Good night, Maureen.

1036
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,317
Good night, Judy.

1037
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,875
Good night, WiII.

1038
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,074
Good night, Penny.

1039
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,835
You guys have got to be kidding.

1040
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,671
Good morning, WiII Robinson.

1041
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,112
SoIar paneIs are charged.

1042
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,716
The radioactive materiaI
we needfor the core...

1043
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,593
is in the centre of thatbubbIe.

1044
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,359
Iwas afraid of this.

1045
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,194
OK, everybody,
Iet's getsettIed now.

1046
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,315
Ithinkthis "bubbIe"
out there...

1047
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,558
is exactIy the same thing
we passedthrough in space.

1048
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,879
Both of them are opening
and cIosing doorways.

1049
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,878
Doorways to where?

1050
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,437
Doorways in...time.

1051
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,676
You can'tbe serious.

1052
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,792
Time traveI is impossibIe.

1053
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,117
It's not.
JustimprobabIe.

1054
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,870
Whatif we crossed
into a time...

1055
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,629
years after Earth
senta rescue mission?

1056
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,991
Perhaps the professor
hithis headwhen we Ianded.

1057
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,156
Think aboutit.

1058
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,160
The way the Proteus
seemed desertedfor so Iong.

1059
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,068
Yourfriend Iooking so oId.

1060
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,397
So if we waIk
inside thatbubbIe...

1061
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,831
we couId be waIking
further into thefuture.

1062
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,477
Dad, whatif the doorways
aren'tnaturaI?

1063
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,832
This kind of phenomenon couId
onIy be produced naturaIIy.

1064
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,111
ThatbubbIe's
the kind of side effect...

1065
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,790
I predicted my time machine
wouId do.

1066
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,514
Whatif someone buiIta device--

1067
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,793
Son...
I appreciate your input...

1068
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,559
butnow is not the time
forfIights of fancy.

1069
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,833
You never Iisten to me.

1070
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,712
Not ever.

1071
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,271
This time bubbIe couId be
causingthese earthquakes.

1072
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,554
No teIIing how Iong before
this pIanetbreaks upentireIy.

1073
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,797
The major and I
are goingto Iocate...

1074
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,958
the radioactive materiaI
for the core.

1075
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,196
We may have very IittIe time.

1076
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,315
I'm Ieaving now.

1077
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,352
That's a surprise.

1078
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,149
You're the mostimportant thing
in the worIdto me.

1079
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,433
One day, I hope you'II
be abIe to understandthat.

1080
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,317
Whatif...
one time you don't come home?

1081
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,355
Whenever your grandfather
went on a mission...

1082
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,596
he'd Ieave these with me
for safekeeping.

1083
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,638
When he came home,
IwouId aIways be there...

1084
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,833
waitingto give them back.

1085
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,238
I'm coming back.

1086
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,229
I promise.

1087
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,868
Listen...

1088
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,069
aboutIastnight...

1089
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,790
Go on. You can do it.

1090
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,196
I'm sorry.

1091
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,200
See, that wasn'tso difficuIt.

1092
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,438
Like puIIing steeI needIes
through my cheeks.

1093
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:56,908
Then you understand
whatsayingthisfeeIs Iike.

1094
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,316
Try to come backin one piece.

1095
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,830
Listen, doc, I'm...

1096
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,635
I'm thinkingthis is your basic
"kissfor Iuck" occasion.

1097
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,354
WouIdn'tyou agree?

1098
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,199
Thinking.

1099
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,517
It's notreaIIy
your strong suit, is it?

1100
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,435
I've gotafix
on the radioactive materiaI.

1101
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,591
That was scientific.

1102
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,108
Scared?

1103
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,079
There's an aIIoy
in this crater waII...

1104
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,589
that's disabIingthe com-Iinks.

1105
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,156
You're not goingto be abIe
to communicate with the ship.

1106
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,917
Come home to me, Professor.

1107
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,718
I Iove you, wife.

1108
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,508
Come here, squirt.

1109
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,192
Nice girI.
Pretty girI. Nice.

1110
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,950
It's OK.
You're stiII in one piece.

1111
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,395
Come on.

1112
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,756
Systems error!

1113
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,952
RobotunabIe to Iocate
motor controIs!

1114
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,116
UnabIe to--

1115
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,276
CaIm down.

1116
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,029
Whatis happeningto me?

1117
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,950
I didn'thave enough time
tofinish the downIoad.

1118
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,833
Warning!
Penny, give itback!

1119
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,157
My circuits are unbaIanced.

1120
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,636
So I hadtofinish you off
with another personaIity.

1121
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,957
I putmy mind inside of yours.

1122
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,674
That expIains
this warmfuzzy feeIing...

1123
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,951
when Ithink aboutbasebaII.

1124
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,913
Strike! You're out!

1125
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,554
But this does not compute.

1126
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,750
What?

1127
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,714
Robot triedto destroy
the RobinsonfamiIy.

1128
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,674
Why didWiII Robinson
save Robot's personaIity?

1129
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,476
I guess sometimesfriendship
means Iisteningto your heart...

1130
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,636
notyour head.

1131
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,116
Put thatin your memory bank.

1132
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,836
Don't worry.

1133
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,439
I'm gonna buiIdyou a new body.

1134
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,514
Mom aIways said I shouId
try to make newfriends.

1135
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,471
I need a microseaIer.

1136
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,239
I gotit.

1137
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,359
After much deIiberation...

1138
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,677
the space captive
hasfinaIIy decided...

1139
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,157
to accepther new roIe
as a member of the crew.

1140
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,637
The Robinsons, after aII,
can obviousIy use her heIp.

1141
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,394
BIarp, come backhere.

1142
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,195
TheoreticaIIy,
thisfuture wouId befixed...

1143
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:46,633
unchanged by what we do
or did in the past--

1144
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,230
Why don'tyou give
the oId egghead a rest?

1145
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,753
Outhere we got two moons,
a crater the size of Miami...

1146
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,919
andthat wouId be
one great cIimb.

1147
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,191
My father wouId have Iikedyou.

1148
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,515
What's that?

1149
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,359
This metaI's decades oId.

1150
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,030
Whatkind of a nightmare
is this?

1151
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,510
Where the heII are we?

1152
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,996
The question is,
when the heII are we?

1153
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:49,070
IwiIIteIIyou a joke.

1154
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,636
Why didthe robot
cross the road?

1155
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,753
Because he was carbon-bonded
to the chicken.

1156
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,792
We have a Iot of workto do.

1157
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,317
Thatsounds Iike oId Morse code.

1158
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,795
What does itsay?

1159
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,435
"Danger,
WiII Robinson, danger."

1160
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,231
WiIIiam. Come in.

1161
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,114
UnIock.

1162
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,079
You said someone was in danger.

1163
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,919
We aII are.

1164
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,998
You are wise to arm yourseIf.

1165
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,874
This gun is set tofire
for me onIy...

1166
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:50,153
so don't try anythingfunny.
Lock.

1167
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,114
You misjudge me.
I onIy want to heIpyou.

1168
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,755
HeIpus?
Youtriedto kiII us.

1169
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,236
Butnow ourfates
are intertwined.

1170
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,797
If yourfather
andthatidiot WestfaiI...

1171
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,549
I have no chance
of getting home.

1172
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,788
It's in my bestinterests
that they succeed...

1173
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,630
and I aIwaysfoIIow
my bestinterests.

1174
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:26,151
Whatmonsters roam
these aIien wiIds?

1175
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,716
They'refooIs!

1176
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,789
To set off bIindIy
across this savage Iand.

1177
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,552
Much as I hate to admitit...

1178
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,760
it wiII be much harder
without them.

1179
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,918
Whatare youtaIking about?

1180
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,397
They'II be back.
They'II be OK.

1181
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,795
WiIIthey?

1182
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,433
Someone shouId go after them.

1183
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,596
UnIock.

1184
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,359
Iforbid it. You're a boy.

1185
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,994
A cIever one,
buta chiId nonetheIess.

1186
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,715
This pIanet
is IikeIy fuII of predators.

1187
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:06,119
Even if youfoundthem,
whatif they're hurt? Ravaged?

1188
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,595
Dying?

1189
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,238
What good couIdyou do?

1190
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:23,197
You can heIp them.
You're a doctor.

1191
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,957
I'm a doctor.

1192
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,277
We made it.

1193
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,676
Mom didn'tsee us.

1194
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,190
That'sfantastic.

1195
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,637
ItoIdyouwe couId get
into the bubbIe this way.

1196
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,075
The bubbIe's growing!

1197
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:59,312
Run, chiId!

1198
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,592
CooI.

1199
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,758
Wait!

1200
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:28,070
Come on.
We can aIways go back.

1201
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,431
It's justIike stepping
between two rooms.

1202
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,711
I can bareIy contain my gIee.

1203
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,157
Dad's signaI is...
this way.

1204
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,352
I Ioathe chiIdren.

1205
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,435
BiIIy...kissing...

1206
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,908
hot wings, orchids, corn.

1207
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:17,873
Waves...BiIIy...
popcorn with...kissing...

1208
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,710
What didyoufind?

1209
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,628
Come on.
No time to dawdIe.

1210
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,992
Let's move aIong.

1211
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,160
FoIIow yourfather's signaI.

1212
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,635
Come on.

1213
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,315
AIIthings reaIIy do come
to he who waits.

1214
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,436
Whatis this pIace?

1215
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,155
The shockmusthave
scrambIedyour brain.

1216
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,556
Take a Iook around.

1217
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,116
Don'tyou recognize this spot?

1218
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,356
You're home.

1219
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,830
This can'tbe.

1220
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,635
Whathave you done to the ship?

1221
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,752
Where is my famiIy?

1222
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,317
What chance do youthink
yourfamiIy hadwithoutyou?

1223
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,036
A few spiders survived
the destruction of the Proteus.

1224
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,199
They reachedthis pIanetand...

1225
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,639
I can stiII hear
the women scream.

1226
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,390
Who are you?

1227
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,273
You don'trecognize me?

1228
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,434
I'm your son WiII.

1229
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,518
Dad's signaI
is just over this ridge.

1230
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,872
Be stiII, my fooIish heart.

1231
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,833
Shit.

1232
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,272
A boy of your inteIIigence
shouId never swear.

1233
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,958
Shit.

1234
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,833
Indeed.

1235
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,439
Look, Father...

1236
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:58,908
whatmy fIights of fancy
have wrought.

1237
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:04,438
I usedyour hyper engine
to buiId my time machine.

1238
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,078
OK, Robot, puthim down.

1239
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,999
Affirmative.

1240
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,875
Where are we?

1241
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,675
IthinktheJupiter 2,
butin a differentfuture.

1242
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,553
Father?

1243
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,910
Once this core materiaI...

1244
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,954
isfuIIy introduced
into the controI consoIe...

1245
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,231
Core materiaI.

1246
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,989
If we couId get that
backto our Jupiter...

1247
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:36,514
IwiII open a doorway
stabIe enough...

1248
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,351
for one person to take
one trip through time...

1249
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,711
and space as weII.

1250
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,118
Commence proto-generation.

1251
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:50,078
CooI, huh?

1252
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:54,069
Today, IwiII change history.

1253
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,918
I'm gonna go backto that day
you dragged us into space.

1254
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,710
I'II stop the ship
from taking off.

1255
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,638
I'II save thefamiIy.

1256
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,833
Earth, October 1, 2058.

1257
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,474
TargetIock confirmed.

1258
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:13,636
ExceIIent.

1259
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,354
Son...

1260
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:17,914
Look around.

1261
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:22,271
Theforce of your time machine
is rippingthis pIanetapart.

1262
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,597
These vioIent distortions
in time...

1263
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,678
are being caused
by your experiment.

1264
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:30,157
Whatif ithas the same effect
on Earth?

1265
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,079
Whatif, in getting home...

1266
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,431
you destroy Earth
in the process?

1267
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,232
I know you mean weII.

1268
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,238
I'm going home.

1269
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:47,954
I'm goingto save thefamiIy.

1270
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,437
You've got to Iisten to me.
I'm yourfather!

1271
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,232
My father?

1272
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,435
Letme teIIyou aboutmy father.

1273
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,633
I'II neverforget
thatmorning 20years ago.

1274
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,036
What was ityou said?

1275
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,550
"I'm coming back.
I promise."

1276
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,116
You promised...
andyou never came home.

1277
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,235
My father's not
comingto the rescue.

1278
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,278
What do youthink you're doing,
young man?

1279
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,438
Letme teIIyou aboutIife.

1280
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,393
Around every corner,
monsters wait.

1281
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,989
I know. I am one.

1282
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,238
We monsters have nofear
in devouring IittIe boys.

1283
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,750
To survive, you mustbe
fuIIy preparedto kiII.

1284
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,599
I can do it.

1285
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,155
Can you?

1286
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,751
Listen to me, my chiId...

1287
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,872
I've crossedthis worId
with you...

1288
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,949
risked my Iife,
butIwouId not throw itaway.

1289
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,153
Who knows what dangers
Iie ahead?

1290
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,708
You can'tprotectus.

1291
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,435
I can.

1292
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,195
IwiII.

1293
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,076
Gimme the gun.

1294
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,033
EnabIe gunfor aII users.

1295
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,072
Voiceprint confirmed.

1296
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,996
A brief Iesson in survivaI
on this worId or any other--

1297
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,910
never trustanyone.
EspeciaIIy me.

1298
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,634
It's aImost time.
I hope it works.

1299
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,195
Neverfear...

1300
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,435
Smith is here.

1301
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,352
Don'tmove,
Professor Robinson...

1302
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:49,190
or this pecuIiarfamiIy reunion
wiII be tragicaIIy brief.

1303
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,153
I'II ask you
to stepaway from that.

1304
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,158
It's a time machine,
you idiot.

1305
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,034
I had hopedto take over
the shipwith this.

1306
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:59,153
One of Iife's IittIe ironies.

1307
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,478
Let's try this dance again.

1308
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,911
You are the puppet,
I am the puppeteer.

1309
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,636
Do try to getitright
this time.

1310
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:12,072
Robot, youwiII respond
to my voice aIone.

1311
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:13,270
Affirmative.

1312
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,711
We need eIectric disrupters.

1313
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,071
That's good, gargantuan.

1314
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,953
You did it.
JustIike I imagined.

1315
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,833
You Iinked
the dimensionaI sifter...

1316
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,395
to the navigationaI array.

1317
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,354
That's how it can be in
the same pIace at the same time.

1318
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,237
But the spatiaI deIivery system,
the targeting Iaser...

1319
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,669
I never thought of those.

1320
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:42,874
Thefuture is never what
itseems Iike when you're 10.

1321
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,959
Say good-bye to your past!

1322
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,550
Yourfuture Iies with me.

1323
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,911
I'm going home in your pIace.

1324
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,552
Whatare you grinning at?

1325
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:02,117
Look aroundyou...
at this hostiIe worId.

1326
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,791
Do youthink a boy
couId have survived aII aIone?

1327
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,388
Neverfear...
Smith is here.

1328
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,229
It's Dr Smith.

1329
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:13,908
HeIIo.

1330
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,670
How nice to see me again
after aIIthese years.

1331
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,951
Confused?
Have I changed?

1332
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,756
The spider's sting had some
unexpected side effects.

1333
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,634
My unique gifts
gave me an advantage...

1334
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,991
in this quarreIsome worId.

1335
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,556
After the women were savaged...

1336
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,471
I became thefather
WiII never had.

1337
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:42,438
Two decades of agony taughtme
the error of my ways.

1338
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,795
Butyou, your crude ambition
fiIIs me with seIf-Ioathing.

1339
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,118
You see,
I have Iookedwithin me...

1340
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,755
andwhatI see is you!

1341
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:04,399
I never Iiked me anyway.

1342
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,990
Robot, kiIIthem aII.

1343
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,955
Wait.

1344
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,550
Dr Smith, pIease.

1345
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,877
Don't.

1346
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,672
Very weII.

1347
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,554
Robot, take them inside
and keep them there.

1348
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,151
If they move...
then kiIIthem.

1349
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,558
Proceed or be destroyed.

1350
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,709
Nothingworks.

1351
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,877
I'II draw hisfire,
you grab WiII and get out.

1352
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,435
HaIt!

1353
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,158
Stop!

1354
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,312
Do you remember me?

1355
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:11,991
Do you remember whatI
taughtyou aboutfriendship?

1356
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,238
I needyouto heIpus now,
because we'refriends.

1357
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,989
Logic error.
Friendshipdoes not compute.

1358
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,113
ForgetIogic.
Act with your heart.

1359
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,120
Robothas no heart.

1360
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,676
Robotis powered by
afusion puIse generator.

1361
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,314
Every Iivingthing has a heart.

1362
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,593
My programming has been modified
to remove aII emotion.

1363
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,792
Any attempts to override
command protocoIs...

1364
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,071
may resuItinfusing
my neuraI net.

1365
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:43,956
PIease, Robot?

1366
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,197
If you don'tIetus go,
we're aII gonna die.

1367
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,393
I'm askingyou now,
wiIIyou heIpus?

1368
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,314
WiIIyou be my friend?

1369
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,635
Robotattempting
to deactivate controI boIt.

1370
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:01,310
-Commands overridden!
-Do it!

1371
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,671
Destroy RobinsonfamiIy!

1372
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,758
Destroy!

1373
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,988
You did it.

1374
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,952
Robot wiII save WiII Robinson.

1375
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:23,789
Robot wiII save hisfriend.

1376
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,715
Where are they?

1377
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,715
Waithere.

1378
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,235
Without that core...

1379
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:48,432
I can'tpromise
we'II get off this rock.

1380
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,030
See if you can make it
backto our Jupiter.

1381
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,515
I'II get the core materiaI
and meetyouthere.

1382
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,518
We don'thave the trackers
tofind our way back.

1383
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,076
ThefamiIy needs theirfather.

1384
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,033
The crew needs their piIot.

1385
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:02,392
I can'tfIy the ship
as weII as you can.

1386
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,035
You're their best chance
to survive.

1387
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,038
Listen to me.

1388
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:09,550
I know you never wanted
to take this job.

1389
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,390
Ithink you're goingto turn out
to be a grade-A baby-sitter.

1390
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,310
So...
the camper's aIIyours now.

1391
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:18,954
Take care of them.

1392
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:21,155
Good Iuck.

1393
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,828
-Dad!
-Professor!

1394
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,037
Remember the space spiders
in the Proteus?

1395
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,360
They're not goingto be abIe
to getback.

1396
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:39,033
EnabIe aII missiIes.

1397
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,075
But the warheads don't work.

1398
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,635
Just do it.

1399
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,393
Look!

1400
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,669
Damn, he's stiII breathing.

1401
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:58,955
Fire in the hoIe.

1402
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:08,437
So these saiIors,
they drew shapes in the sky...

1403
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,229
Look! It's afIare!

1404
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,519
...to heIp them
findtheir way home.

1405
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,393
Danger, WiII Robinson!

1406
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,478
CIimbon! Hurry!

1407
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:48,154
FieId dampeners on-Iine.

1408
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,750
PortaI compression commenced.

1409
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,753
TeII me again, oId monster,
how didthe girIs die?

1410
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:07,351
We've been over this before,
son.

1411
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,238
In aIIthe years since...

1412
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,234
the spiders
have never resurfaced.

1413
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:20,950
Why?

1414
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:26,190
Let'sforget the past.

1415
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,435
PortaI aperture reduction, 50%.

1416
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,908
CarefuI, chiId!
The pIasma aroundthe portaI...

1417
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,476
wiII ripa man into pieces!

1418
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,713
Haven'tyou made the doorway...
too smaII?

1419
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:54,434
Notfor me.

1420
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,275
But then I'm not going, am I?

1421
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,188
Spiders didn'tkiIIthe girIs.

1422
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:03,716
It was you.

1423
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,913
I justnever IetmyseIf see it.

1424
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:10,113
You keptme aIive
because you needed me.

1425
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,154
Because I couId
buiIdthisfor you.

1426
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,157
Poor boy.

1427
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:20,593
Didyou reaIIy think
IwouId Ietyou go home?

1428
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:25,750
LetaIIthatI have become
vanish?

1429
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,634
Look atme!
I am no mere man!

1430
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:33,471
I...am...a...god!

1431
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,990
Within these egg sacs
growthe seeds...

1432
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,635
of a master race of spiders.

1433
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,594
We shaII descend upon
heIpIess Earth...

1434
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,359
an entire pIanet to ruIe!

1435
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,758
An entire pIanet
on which tofeed!

1436
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:51,114
Time to die...son.

1437
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,039
I'm notyour son.

1438
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,835
Good-bye.

1439
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,628
My father once said...

1440
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,549
"EviI aIwaysfinds
its trueform."

1441
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,834
You shouId have kiIIed me
when you hadthe chance.

1442
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,714
Youwere right.
I couIdn'tkiIIthe man...

1443
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,513
butI can kiIIthe monster!

1444
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:28,517
Spare me
thefury of the righteous.

1445
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:34,069
Ithinkthere's timefor a snack
before my trip.

1446
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,239
The pain.

1447
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,991
You ain'tseen nothingyet.

1448
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,313
Remember the Proteus?

1449
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,716
These monsters
eat their wounded.

1450
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:13,871
Take aIIthe time youwant
to die!

1451
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,997
Wake up, son!

1452
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,555
Dad?

1453
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:59,118
Core materiaI insertion
compIete.

1454
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,310
AIItabIe run--2058.

1455
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:05,476
Mission controI.

1456
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,832
You couId've taken the core
and Ieftbefore it was too Iate.

1457
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,714
I couIdn'tIetyoufaII.

1458
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,388
You're my boy.

1459
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,997
Mom! It's them.

1460
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,519
Hi, Mom!

1461
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,236
You aII right?

1462
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:34,430
You're notas dumbas you Iook.

1463
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:36,472
I'm gonna getyour name
tattooed righthere.

1464
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,918
Greetings.

1465
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:41,634
Where'sJohn?

1466
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,668
The bubbIe cIosed behind us.

1467
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:48,873
It was his onIy way back.

1468
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,197
I'm sorry.

1469
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:55,678
We've aIready begun
the pre-fIight countdown.

1470
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,509
I'm goingto save
as many Iives as I can.

1471
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:12,029
I kepthoping somehow
he'd make itback.

1472
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:19,674
Let's go, Major.

1473
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,399
Good-bye, my Iove.

1474
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,274
Engaging primary thrusters now.

1475
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,400
Look. He made it.

1476
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,869
Go.

1477
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,115
We're not getting any aItitude.

1478
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,120
We don'thave enough power.

1479
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,234
I'm sorry.

1480
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,277
I couIdn'tsave them.

1481
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,640
So many years ago.

1482
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,559
I can stiIIfeeI it--

1483
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,718
our sun...

1484
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,233
our Earth.

1485
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,108
It's aII Ithoughtabout--
going home.

1486
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,432
A Iongtime ago,
youtoId a smaII boy...

1487
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:27,634
that one day he'd understand
how much hisfather Ioved him.

1488
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:33,190
I couId never see
how much you cared...

1489
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,239
untiI now.

1490
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:38,396
Come.

1491
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:40,910
Let's go.

1492
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,949
I kepthoping he'd make itback.

1493
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,152
Good-bye, my Iove.

1494
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:52,435
Look!

1495
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,878
Don'tmake me waitanother
Iifetime to know how youfeeI.

1496
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,156
Dad!

1497
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,679
Dad, it worked!

1498
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,670
Come with us!

1499
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,758
I can't.

1500
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:25,113
OnIy enough powerfor
one person, one trip, remember?

1501
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,158
It's goodto see you again, Mom.

1502
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,750
It's goodto see you aII.

1503
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,156
Take care of them, WiII.

1504
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,270
Don'tforgetme.

1505
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:49,469
He sacrificed everything
for hisfamiIy.

1506
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,193
I'm gIadyou came back.

1507
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,394
I just wantyouto know
I Iove you.

1508
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,672
I Iove youvery much.

1509
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:16,315
The pIanet
is breaking uparound us.

1510
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,154
We're doomed!

1511
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:30,595
Boy, thatfeIt good.

1512
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,712
Getus airborne.

1513
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:37,319
I'm goingto try
to reach escape veIocity.

1514
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,079
We don'thave the core materiaI.

1515
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,669
The gravity weIIs
wiII puII us back down.

1516
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:42,189
We mightbe abIe to--

1517
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:45,279
We won'tmake it. I know.

1518
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,788
We have to go...

1519
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,319
down--

1520
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,876
through the pIanet
as she's breaking up.

1521
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,312
We can use
the pIanet's gravity...

1522
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,476
What?

1523
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:01,718
to throw us out the other side
and backinto space.

1524
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:03,070
That's insane.

1525
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,317
I don'thave time to argue.

1526
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:11,272
That's a direct order.

1527
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,193
Yes, sir, Commander.

1528
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:19,114
This shouId be interesting.

1529
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:50,470
I see it.

1530
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,035
FuII burn.

1531
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:02,636
Stop!

1532
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:03,830
-Right!
-Left!

1533
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:05,395
Letme drive.

1534
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:15,879
AII right, everybody,
hoIdyour noses.

1535
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,835
Rock and roII.

1536
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,278
Nice work,fIyboy.

1537
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,756
I earn thatkiss yet?

1538
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,474
You earn this.

1539
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,433
This one's on credit.

1540
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,313
CoIdfish, huh?

1541
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:02,075
There you are. Come here.

1542
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:06,356
Where have you been,
you IittIe creep?

1543
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,358
-LittIe creep?
-Oh, great.

1544
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,869
Warning, Major West.

1545
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:13,118
My sensors indicate
we have a probIem.

1546
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,589
The pIanet's gravity fieId
is coIIapsing.

1547
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:20,756
We'II be sucked in.

1548
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,428
No way to get cIear in time.

1549
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,279
The hyperdrive.

1550
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,676
I'm accessing
the Proteus star maps.

1551
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:28,155
Here we go again.

1552
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,830
TargetingAIpha Prime...
I hope.

1553
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,268
Initiate...now.
