1
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,424
Wake up Willer

00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,807
Stop it by the...

3
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,252
Sir,was it straight?...

4
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,516
We found something,something like a boat

5
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,081
native fishing perhaps.

6
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,695
with a reeve marcus,Sir.

7
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,220
...cover will you please?

8
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,615
What was it...

9
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,466
..the broken shell

10
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,797
..the broken shell

11
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,808
What is it?

12
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:41,781
Erm..two points from the starting bar,
in the foot bank.

13
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,849
What was it?

14
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,147
So,l don't know what it was.

15
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,785
Should it be the quarters?

16
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,130
l don't be certain

17
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,893
You've search the watch.

18
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,291
You must make a decision.

19
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,233
We should be to Curtis.

20
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,577
Move!move!Move it on! move it on!

21
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,942
Jump it boy! Jump it!

22
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,012
Morning sir,...

23

...er,two points from the starting...
Sir.

24
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,489
on a mile distance.

25
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,438
You sure Mr.Hollem?

26
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,405
Yes, sir.

27
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,468
Not a war.

28
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,609
l don't know,sir.

29
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,682
lt was only for a moment.

30
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,240
l thought l saw a shape.

31
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,655
Did you see,Mr Calmay?

32
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,622
No sir.

33
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,557
Well.

34
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,095
You did the right thing Mr.Hollem.

35
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,255
Carry on your sessions.

36
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,759
So, that's yours...

37
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,401
Sir.

38
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,331
Clear way,...

39
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,025
Strike the bell!

40
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,088
Duck! All heads duck!

41
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,514
Mr.Hollem, that is your part.

42
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,481
Will you please?

43
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,226

47
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,689

48
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,375

Straight at them,...

53
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,693
Straight at them, sir.

54
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,833

00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,806
she's not at the range yet.

57
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,434
Stand far till it's close enough.

58
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,124
Hold your position!

59
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,024
Hold your position,coming now!

60
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,793

...get us the Captain!

64
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,581
Fire!!

65
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,262
Go!!

66
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,381
...Mr.Calmay.

67
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,143
Sir,to the ...

68
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,790
We're fishing a battle.

69
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,231
Why are there no fires?

70
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,471
Let me through.

71
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,423
Get your weapons.

72
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,599
Wait for the word.

73
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,534
You on this,Sir?

74
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,005
Go with them towards the deck

75
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,207
...and pull the boat over.

76
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,404
and pull the boat at it.

77
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,216
Who you get to it.

78
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,786
Row for the boat...

79
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,188
What about!what about!

80
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,969
Fire!

81
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,276
She's going to sink!

82
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,767
We need to get some more come around in.

83
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,781
She's getting on us!

84
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,158
Pull! Pull!

85
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,574
Go for that..

86
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,094
Quiet! No shouts,no calls.

87
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,998
False trot

88
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,888
lt's been six inches,sir.

89
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,598
Holding.

90
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,300
Good work.

91
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,263
Thank you.sir.

92
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,379
So,what's the...

93
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,245
Just some break ups,sir.

94
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,911
Well,indeed you're a good hands.

95
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,684
l'll do anything l can,
l know you're the kids father.

96
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,618
His father will understood that he's a lad.

97
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,064
His mother however..

98
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,827
Let me take a look at that...

99
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,637
Damn it was good,it came out of nowhere.

100
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,172
...cut through of our tail,to get our...

101
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,627
l have no idea what precisely
what you're talking about here.

102
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,200
but to come out of the wild.

103
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,671
suddenly sailing.

104
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,072
and it happens in darkness,
on our exact positions.

105
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,371
well,...

106
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:22,905
has do we?

107
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,749
lndeed.

108
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,118
He knew we are looking for it,...

109
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,522
What if it's looking for us?

110
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,590
...i tell you she is frigid tonight

111
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,057
it was unlike a fair match.

112
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,217
it was no...

113
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,920
she was more like a...

114
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,231
you have to wonder of the nature of howl.

115
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,732
i'll tell you how they penetrate.

116
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,402
...two hundred yard,and i've don't
have guns of...

117
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,803
you must have the whether gage and a
clear advantage and fire cart.

118
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,537
What is the whether gage?

119
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,476
l'll show you against the...

120
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,909
not on the cloth.

121
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,885
...control of the engagement.

122
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,055
and loaded with guns and...

123
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,148
the simple fact is,we're soundly being.

124
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,495
having treated like that in the Pacific

125
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,460
treated the bounce of the opponents favor.

126
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,369
that can pass us in surprises is
someone that aged man of war.

127
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,935
Am l not correct?

128
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,675
You call me an aged man of war,Doctor?

129
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,683
Sup rise are not whole.None cold whole.

130
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,819
She's a bluff bound, with lovely lines.

131
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,979
ls a fine sea bird

132
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,253
Whetherly, stiff and fast.

133
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,256
Very fast if she is well handled.

134
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,988
Oh,she's not all.

135
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,357
She's in her pride.

136
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,235
Well, we can fetch...

137
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,304
Afraid we..is abandon our spare.

138
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,407
This life is confident with the basic prepares,

139
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,541
We can get home as we are.

140
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,405
l'm not going home.

141
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,321
About to....

142
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,889

can be still come looking for us.

144
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,323
We can defeat the sea.

145
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,022
Here.above the Shoals.

146
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,864
As you said,..

147
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,832
she's taking the war, as well as the seas.

148
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,400
and we are suppose to stop.

149
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,061
But,sir.

150
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,206
We've respect she's the fast
and heaviest ship.

151
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,730
she's one of the class.

152
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,502
She'll be have way to keep home by
the way we've repaired it on the way.

153
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,542
Well then,there's not a moment to loose.

154
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,371
ls it true about how they put the lost...

155
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,736
What came in?

156
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:40,501
...told me when you die,they stitch
you up in your...

157
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,940
just to make sure, you was asleep.

158
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,478
Not true, who knows?

159
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,922
Will you tell them?

160
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,411
lt's alright.

161
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,882
it's just the loneman's speaking.

162
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,610
there.

163
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,448
l've never seen a braver patient.

164
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,028
oh,darling.Never mind.

165
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,461

166
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,121
Come on,l want that way for now.

167
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,462
You have two minutes to start the four...

168
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,829
Nice work!

169
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,849
Mr.Gullaby.

170
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,476
There's something might interest you here.

171
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,149
Look!

173
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:03,922
but he was ...

174
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,856
when he was in your age.

175
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,756
but he was known as ship man ...

176
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,661
he says enough of his blood in the wood work

177
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,652
for the ship to almost be relation.

178
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,533
i do understand your part,Mr Gullaby.

179
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,534
You know that this is beyond question.

180
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,535
However,a week spent calling for
the Brazilian land force...

181
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,371

182
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,305

183
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,329
...behalf of the..

184
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,140
...will do his best...

185
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,751
so it's his brains doctor.

186
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,819
no, that's just blood.

187
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,514
Those were his brains.

188
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,926
...and we have common surgeons.

189
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,263
Sir.

190
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,040

194
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,204
Back to work,you loafers.

195
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,383

00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,510
Well, good.

forty four gauge ship.

To wives and to sweethearts.

251
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,676
May them never meet.

252
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:48,946
Mr.Howard,...

253
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:58,085

256
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,360
How much old than you are now.

257
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,258
Mr. Pullins,Mr.Pullins is a ...

258
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,102
Do you miss him, Sir?

00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,296
Can you tell me what is like?

260
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,833
l have the honor of dining with him twice.

261
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,237
Spoke to me on both occasions.

262
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,013
Master tactician and man of singular vision.

263
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,406
And he always say on battle,...

264
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,951
never mind the..just go straight at them.

265
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,421
Sir,...

266
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,524

267
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,220
is England's only hope for bony
turns to invade....

268
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,822
So,might we press you for a...

269
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,801
The first time that he spoke to me,

270
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,469
l should never forget his words.

271
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,173
l remember it like i was yeastier.

272
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,238
we went across the table,and he look
me straight into the eye.

273
00:31:55,113 --> 00:32:00,176
and he said,Aubrey,
may i trouble you for the salt?

274
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,612
What was he trying to say exactly,
as he did...

275
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,530
The second time,the second time
he told me bout a story,

276
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,071
he said no,he didn't needed.

277
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,109
but he was quite warm.

278
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,206
he see of a king and a country of a
captain warm.

279
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:35,114
l know it sounds absurd but more
for another man.

280
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,621
will cry out for all beautiful stuff.

281
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:46,461
but with Nelson,leave out your heart go.

282
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,009
You didn't eat,Sir.

283
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,841
well and he will seems that he will be
exception to the role of the authority corrupts.

284
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:11,118
To Lord Nelson,To Lord Nelson...

285
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,216
Do you see those two ...,doctor?

286
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,660
l do.

287
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,886
Which would you choose?

288
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:26,563
Neither there scraps on difference of
between the same species of them.

289
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,208
lf you,have to choose.

290
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,440
lf you,were force to make a choice,will fill
us with no other responds.

291
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:42,417
lf you can push me,i would choose
the right hand wheat mallet has.

292
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,184
significant, advantage of life and death.

293
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,125
there i have you,welcome to ...

294
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,992
that in the service,one must always choose
the much lesser of two way...

295
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,579
Really..

296
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,715
the lesser of two weasels.

297
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,595
And the lord give Hawaii.

298
00:34:58,696 --> 00:34:59,663
You hear that?

299
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,298
He said something.

300
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,330
Doctor,he spoke,doctor.

301
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,882
What a wonderfully true voice of
Mr.Hollem possess.

302
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,195
lndeed.

303
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,142
On back there,...

304
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,579
The question is,how did he get there?

305
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,255
We have no alternative,
we must turn and fight.

306
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,357
But the weather gage,...

307
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,226
You must be watching it from somewhere...

308
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,193
Till it pass.

309
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,663
My God,what can we do?

310
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,324
lt has it's spike the head.

311
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,834
Run like smoking...

312
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,935
We must ban every sail...

313
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,473
We have to.

314
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,509
We must survive us there...

315
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,704
Let's get about there...Gentlemen.

316
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,510
This is the second time that his turn to me
and there won't be the third.

317
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,402
What have we here?

318
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,166
The devils in the wail...

319
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,874
We be out fast.

320
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,176
What is it with this man?

321
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,411
l kill a road if it isn't for battle...

322
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,015
it fought like you,Jack.

323
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,436
Bring the sun down to the horizon,

324
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,510
When it slowly touch the horizon,..

325
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:33,780
Look into your...

326
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,648
the earth is no longer rising,

327
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,880
then as we...

328
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:42,893
That would be new.

329
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,351
Sir,...would you make room Mr.Hollem?

330
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:47,286

331
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,830
Call noon and it's your class.

332
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,370
Sir,that's new.

333
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,540
Six hours?

334
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,042
Five the most.

335
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,040
Just give us out of the region...

336
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,966
Excuse me,sir.

337
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,933
But what are they building?

00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,607
Hello!

348
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,118

Well done, son.

00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,468
When she ran behind the...

353
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,801
Right behind this, make up first
and l follow.

354
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,646
Captain will not check with no reason.

355
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:04,143
... this is a private area. Jack love her.

356
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:12,156
ls she like a pirate? - No! They are not pirate.

357
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:17,161
lf they were, we could hang them
when we catch them.

358
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,598
Get a piece of paper from Francis.

359
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,129
ls all stated on the flag.

360
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,899
They can go rich when they like.

361
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:31,676
But l can share the price this morning,
she will be loaded with gold...

You gonna wait before me.

00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:19,286
They can close this gap and get the behind.
They will be us.

379
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,360

You need to follow the captain horn,

Come on!

412
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,746
ltjust a game. -Who said that?

413
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,912
Jeana. -What he does?

414
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,461
That is not a easy thing for this
kind of situation

415
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,766
For my own pal, who has die.

416
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:37,839
Subsequent , l need to persuade
myself to kill them.

417
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,193
...you have to choose.

418
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,493
The clue is, the cool Wally is popular

419
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,004
ls that express any feeling
that matter to you?

420
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,151
Check to the forum

421
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,944
Can l speak to my old friend?

422
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,248
lnto the ship captain.

423
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:27,364
Ship captain has said that, this is more
that the formal. - l'm not the lrish man

424
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,729
But, l'm the lrish man.

425
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,593
Were that is friend? -Has a friend.

426
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,161
l won't said, that l want.

427
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,745
Perhaps, we have to turn back.

428
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:51,850
The man, cause the fall of lucky Jack
anyway, with the confident to victory

429
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,483
That is life problem.

430
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,493
You are not the person to defeat.

431
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:04,464
And that said, you are larger, faster ship
with the long guns is beginning
to cause it price

432
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,363
This is not a question of life,
but question of duty. -Duty!

433
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,540
You can be what you like.

434
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:21,184
...this is a ship of war, i will do what they
require in order to do my duty.

435
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,151
Whatever the cost?

436
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,218
Whatever the cost.

437
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,283
Order is will not know about the cost.

438
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,892
Can we really claim is nothing but the duty.

439
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,398
That is the subject of deserve.

440
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:40,201
My order is to follow what they need
and proceed long time ago.

441
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,507
The wind is back, sir

442
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,983
Sir! We can't hold this any longer.

443
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,947
Can't sail through the damn wind,
we will sail around it.

444
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,382
Use south.

445
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,319
How far south, sir?

446
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,889
Follow the necessary, Mr. Bully

447
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,698
USe south, please. Mr. Brandon.
-Use south sir.

448
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:03,345
Really something terrible not believe...

449
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:07,520
We have make turn north and
we header back to the sum.

450
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,158
To the sum!

451
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:17,629
By antiquation, this mankind have a...

And the cargo will put the...

455
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,364
That what will gonna be.

456
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,843
So Mr. Spoon, you will start the meal.

457
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,912
A slide of meat

458
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:13,118
and you, do do rock.

459
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,618
You enjoy the island?

460
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:01,430
lt is full of strange and a wonderful beach.

461
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,730
We will stop there if we there.

462
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,164
l promise you will enjoy that time.

463
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:13,206
Several days at least, the people is kind...

l will like all this.

466
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,926
That is the whole point.

467
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,404
This is spider and this is the neck.

468
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,810
Here is the insect, it has a torn
to save herself from the bug.

469
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,125
Did god make them change?

470
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:04,616
Does god make them change, yeah.

471
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,027
They also change themselves.

472
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,199
That is the question, isn't it?

473
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,668
Sir, we saw the land

474
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,065

What is that thing?

477
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,081
Some types of bird.

478
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,646
That is the ugly devil. - Disgusting.

479
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,326
We can't see any women.

480
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,928
What! No women! That no true.

481
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,566
How extra-ordinary.

482
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,096
What is this, sir?

483
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,635
That is a species of birds.

484
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,871
You see that, they are in the develop.

485
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,107
l think that is out of the science

486
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,440
Giant stone got something.

487
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,348
...they are a types of iguana, l think.

488
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,722
They are vegetarian.

489
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,419
You can prepare one of them to the king.

490
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:51,592
The iguana swim. -The iguana don't swim.

491
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:52,860
This one did.

492
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:07,581
This was be damn, new species.

-Maybe point to south west for the rest.

503
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,934
Mr. Polink. -Yes, sir.

504
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,736

505
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:35,226
Mr. Alan set the cause.

506
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,641
Fix sail.

507
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,903
That is not the moment to lose.

508
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,499
Jack! Did you forgot your promise?

509
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,301
Subject to the requirement of service.

510
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:10,306
l can not concern delay and
take the advance...

511
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,739
No immediate application.

512
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,968
This is l think, it is a opportunity to...

513
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,608
lt's a long island.

514
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:27,589
l have not time to spend hours at here.

515
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:33,062
This is giving an important knowledge
and making variable of discovery...

516
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:35,997
it could help to advance our knowledge
and natural history.

517
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,330
There not, and l said no.

518
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,732
Oh, l see.

You see from my part,
l look upon my promises.

524
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,963
Would you end your damn hobby, sir?

525
01:06:56,245 --> 01:07:01,273

527
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:15,391

then we can't come across.

528
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,398
You can have it sir.

529
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:47,326

Timing -2 minutes and 1 second, sir

532
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,142
That not good enough.

533
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,619
We define 2 types to 1 .

534
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,390
You wanna see, we be defeat?
-No!

535
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,922
You wanna see your children be suffer?
-No!

536
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,531
1 minutes and 10 second.

537
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:52,686
Well done, Mr. Carlomi.
-Thank you sir.

01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:50,671
Save it, for the cold evil.

01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,237
What that come from?

544
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,651
This is from the bible story of China.

545
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:11,251
They found out the shit, and one of the men
defending their god is the cold of the bad luck.

546
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,398

Bring Halwell to my cabin.

555
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:40,849

01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:27,015
ln my opinion,
Holland is scare on this voyage.

577
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:31,517
Mr. Lam come here, please.

578

You should not comment in my command.

581
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:50,335
Well, should l leave you to the morning
for friend of mine?

582
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,848
What would you have me to do, Steven?

583
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,152
Stop the rock.

584
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:59,755
Negotiate is insult Holland,
do you know that?

585
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,882

01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:09,022
You see, l'm not understanding
the situation here...

01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:19,198
l know you are right in disagree with me,
but l only afford one level on this ship.

588
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:24,979

589
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:27,645

Do you see it?

592
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,592
Try to get these all together
is a hard work.

593
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:44,457
Men fail to solute. -That is the nature
hierarchy in the nation...

594
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:48,569
There are no distinct in nature,
there is no -Man must be grave ness

595
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,341
Often, l will grant you, there must
be a grave ness nevertheless

596
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,832
This give...entire in the history

597
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,013
This is not my concern.

598

Sir, sir!

669
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:46,685
Cutting really?

670
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:49,795
What kind of fumble?

671
01:32:50,798 --> 01:32:52,163
He gone the way.

672
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:55,368
So l made few notes for you.

673
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:16,747
lts maybe appear but you are making
the natural.

674
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:24,457
Was. Perhaps l could combine it to
a fighting natural like you, sir.

675
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,529
You combine too well.

676
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,633
Should you be able to getting up sir?

677
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:35,601
Apparently l also a doctor.

678
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:36,944
Nice.

679
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:38,045
Now you know.

680
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,842
Could you please.

681
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:49,917
All this captain intended to stay.

682
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:54,562
We perhaps.

683
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:55,930
Do we?

684
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,329
ls not bad.

685
01:33:58,833 --> 01:33:59,867
Must we make this?

686
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:01,892
This is the side.

687
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:06,833
And if was, we were on the
way by now.

688
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:11,868
Now we should head home before
its gone far a bit.

689
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:20,685
Jack you make a birth from the death
l cant afford you a pay.

690
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,123
Name a shop after me.

691
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:25,918
Something pretty and hardly to complain.

692
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:17,239
Pack up your things and
we should be going.

693
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:20,971
To the other side of the island.

694
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:23,317
But sir it must be at least ten miles.

695
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:25,114
More than the moment it look.

696
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:28,721
Thats why l saw Mr Blainey.

697
01:35:41,869 --> 01:35:43,336
Seven inches and eight.

698
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:47,338
Four inches wide.

699
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:50,177
Fifteen inches long neck.

700
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:04,087
Hop it down and use your hand.

701
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:05,325
They wont bite.

702
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:06,460
There's l got one.

703
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:10,126
Pick them up.

704
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:15,197
Sir l think we should getting out.

705
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,703
Discipline never out here.

706
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:26,336
And shouldn't we proof,
you can join me in the royal dinner.

707
01:37:51,665 --> 01:37:52,632
Mr Blakely.

708
01:38:08,282 --> 01:38:09,249
So we lost.

709
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,013
You must carry him.

710
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:23,361
Open the cages.

711
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:56,330
Lets see, two hours on the sea.

712
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:57,297
South.

713
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:02,629
lf we call up with her.

714
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:04,769
And takes her.

715
01:39:05,406 --> 01:39:07,397
We had to be bloody invisible.

716
01:39:21,188 --> 01:39:22,155
So, Steven.

717
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:23,816
Did you see a bird?

718
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:25,954
No but yes.

719
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:28,228
Couldn't catch one.

720
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,762
We make the discovery is you will find.

721
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:33,333
Neither l was.

722
01:39:34,435 --> 01:39:35,959
l am sorry l am late.

723
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:40,664
l did make one...

724
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:43,132
Very interesting find.

725
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:47,180
Let me guess.

726
01:39:55,756 --> 01:39:57,451
Tell him about it.

727
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,155
A farzamit?

728
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:02,395
An insect.

729
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:05,699
A predator.

730
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,751
No go too fast doctor.

731
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:03,746
At least too hungry.

732
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:10,697
Really?

733
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:11,664
Yes.

734
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:14,626
l had no idea of study of natural.

735
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:17,768
How was he?

736
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,769
He is being on track.

737
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:29,649
How going?

738
01:41:32,619 --> 01:41:33,586
Nice.

739
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:43,163
l can bring him for that.

740
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:57,211
Clean it up.

741
01:41:57,211 --> 01:41:59,008
Straight to the trough.

742
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:05,843
Thats all splint and the lock.

743
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:18,460
Unship you rear wheel.

744
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:25,837
Drop the gun.

745
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:31,310
Go get dress.

746
01:42:34,348 --> 01:42:35,838
Part had been complete sir.

747
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:36,716
Good.

748
01:42:37,251 --> 01:42:41,620
By now on, no sound no whistle.

749
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,223
Only thirty of them lock down somewhere.

750
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:53,262
After board, take small part of it.

751
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:55,935
You think they are ready, sir?

752
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:57,629
We ready?

753
01:42:58,071 --> 01:42:59,868
May retain the tide.

754
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:12,477
Just take the back.

755
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:13,687
Lets come, move out.

756
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:15,678
Make it shore and organize.

757
01:43:20,427 --> 01:43:21,394
Hurry up.

758
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:23,597
Leave that.

759
01:43:23,597 --> 01:43:24,928
Just come out here.

760
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:40,974
Congratulation.

01:43:53,093 --> 01:43:55,926
Come on abroad the breach.

01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:00,166
Excuse me sir.

768
01:44:01,201 --> 01:44:02,168
Available here.

769
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:03,767
l must speak to you sir.

770
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:05,804
He say we will be boarding.

771
01:44:06,573 --> 01:44:07,641
l know what you want to say.

772
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:09,268
My answer is no.

773
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:14,247
You leave your gun here,
when we abroad you off to the deck.

774
01:44:15,315 --> 01:44:16,373
Got myself clear?

775
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:17,617
Come off the ship?

776
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:19,782
Thank you sir.

777
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:40,405
Wait wait, captain.

778
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,044
All right, lads.

779
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:48,508
l know afraid is among you.

780
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,987
But we must bring a lots of us.

781
01:44:56,523 --> 01:44:57,888
l will test on earth.

782
01:44:58,792 --> 01:44:59,986
And discipline.

783
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,487
ls as count as courage.

784
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,757
You are on the top not to crack.

785
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,160
More than twice our gun,
more than twice our numbers.

786
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:10,762
And they will sell their life dearly.

787
01:45:13,373 --> 01:45:14,305
Top man.

788
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:17,002
Your handle the ship.

789
01:45:18,045 --> 01:45:19,103
To the single coast.

790
01:45:21,114 --> 01:45:22,911
So, bring us to complete stock.

791
01:45:25,052 --> 01:45:27,316
You must run out and double a
quick time.

792
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:30,015
From the real revolution.

793
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:33,154
Without recall, there will be
a chance to reload.

794
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:36,697
l give you one shot from the back.

795
01:45:36,697 --> 01:45:37,664
One shot only.

796
01:45:38,465 --> 01:45:39,864
Your far main less.

797
01:45:41,068 --> 01:45:42,831
My troop depends on your accuracy.

798
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:51,434
However, even cripple, she will still
be dangerous like a wounded beast.

799
01:45:53,246 --> 01:45:56,181
Captain Howl and the ring
will sweep their deck.

800
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:02,050
We will try the evil fro tress
before we board.

801
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:07,060
hey mean to take us as a price.

802
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:10,459
Then we are worth more than undamages.
They are greed.

803
01:46:11,732 --> 01:46:13,063
Will be their down fall.

804
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:18,066
England is under treat of invade.

805
01:46:18,872 --> 01:46:22,603
And when we at the far sight of the world ,
this ship will be our home.

806
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:27,711
This ship is England.

807
01:46:30,984 --> 01:46:34,579
So when we handle our gun,
shop the action.

808
01:46:35,655 --> 01:46:39,091
After all, surprise is on our side.

809
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:57,110
Thank you no.

810
01:46:57,477 --> 01:46:58,444
Give it please doctor.

811
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:04,877
Good luck.

812
01:48:08,215 --> 01:48:09,682
See you after wards.

813
01:48:12,686 --> 01:48:13,653
Steady now.

Be calm.

815
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:26,064
You have no facilities.

816
01:48:29,469 --> 01:48:32,563
Step now or we will destroy your ship.

817
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:36,342
This is your last warning.

818
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:37,902
Stop now.

819
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:40,105
Or we will destroy you.

820
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:42,212
Lets fight!

Take the part as best as you can.

826
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:33,648

827

Follow me!

For all and for the pride!

Here we go now!

830
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,482
Wipe out. Silent.

831
01:51:25,078 --> 01:51:26,807
Look like the job is done, sir.

832
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,122
Keep moving!

833
01:52:09,122 --> 01:52:10,419

Fast forward it.

836
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:26,256
Turn it off.

837
01:53:31,538 --> 01:53:32,698
Fire!

838
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:39,108

l believe that.

842
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:42,627
The captain inside?

843
01:56:08,661 --> 01:56:09,992
You cant be dead.

844
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:30,975
Doctor?

845
01:56:31,918 --> 01:56:33,010
Wait.

l know l could, for him.

847
01:56:59,445 --> 01:57:03,609
Before he die, he said he want
to give you this.

848
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:51,253
Can you help me?

849
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:19,379
Amen.

Our love.

852
01:59:29,162 --> 01:59:31,858
Give us to say rather than regret.

853
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:42,700
For the highness kingdom.

854
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:44,937
Back for the glory.

855
01:59:45,478 --> 01:59:46,877
Forever and ever.

856
01:59:47,547 --> 01:59:48,571
Amen.

857
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:54,444

Peter Marls. Lieutenant.

02:00:37,463 --> 02:00:39,693
We therefore commit their
body to the deep.

863
02:00:41,067 --> 02:00:42,534
Return the corruption.

864
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:46,334
Looking for the body when
the sea seek them.

865
02:00:49,942 --> 02:00:51,569
The the Lord Jesus Christ.

871
02:02:39,085 --> 02:02:42,145
Take more than few days for the
doctor to find the bird.

872
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:43,655
Very good sir.

Oh here we go again.

When you think its ready,
it would be ready.

888
02:04:10,643 --> 02:04:13,305
All that easy when we reach shore.

889
02:04:13,813 --> 02:04:15,075
So many wounded.

890
02:04:19,585 --> 02:04:21,314
Better than a doctor at all.

891
02:04:22,922 --> 02:04:24,583
l met the doctor.

892
02:04:25,257 --> 02:04:27,316

893
02:04:27,793 --> 02:04:28,657
Did they?

894
02:04:43,876 --> 02:04:46,045
Mr Mold to the cabin.

895
02:04:46,045 --> 02:04:48,479
That doctor gave me this sword.

896
02:04:49,615 --> 02:04:50,707
Sir?

897
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:54,344
Change the coast. South east by east.

898
02:04:57,623 --> 02:04:58,749
Yes, sir.

899
02:05:01,727 --> 02:05:02,659
And within..

900
02:05:02,962 --> 02:05:03,792
Sir?

901
02:05:04,597 --> 02:05:05,825
Make the quarters.

902
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:14,605
Subject to the requirements of the surface.

903
02:05:23,015 --> 02:05:24,380
Oh, Steven.

904
02:05:28,954 --> 02:05:30,080
We are not going anyway.
