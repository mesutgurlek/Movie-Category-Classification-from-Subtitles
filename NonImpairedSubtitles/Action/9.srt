01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:30,329
Quickly!
9: I now know the truth!

503
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,328
The Scientist!

504
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,832
It's the Scientist.
He's the source!

505
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,739
He gave us his soul.

506
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:42,210
We are him.

507
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,142
Load the cannon!

508
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,847
Stop! You'll destroy
the talisman!

509
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,520
It's too late!

510
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,730
Quick. Quick, get in.

511
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,429
We need to take the talisman from the Machine.

512
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,131
It can be used against it.

513
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:45,435
I'll lure it to me, and then you'll have a chance.

514
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:48,944
No. 9, don't do this.
What if you're wrong?

515
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:52,003
I'll show you how to use it. It'll be okay.

516
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,050
9: This is the sequence.

No!

522
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,790
Please, we can't
do this without you.

523
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,458
They all died
because of me.

524
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,633
I started this and
now I need to finish it.

525
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:53,400
1: They left us nothing.
Nothing.

526
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,374
Why do we have to
right their wrongs?

527
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:01,743
Sometimes,
one must be sacrificed.

528
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,980
No!

You did it!

533
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,221
No, I didn't.

534
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:25,430
Not yet.

535
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:22,271
They're free now.

536
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,271
7: What happens next?

537
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:58,002
9: I'm not sure, exactly.

538
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:01,042
But this world is ours now.

539
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,911
It's what we make of it.
