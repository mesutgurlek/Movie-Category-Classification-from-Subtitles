1
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:22,975
The Empire of Izmer
has long been a divided land.

2
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:27,532
Ruled by the Mages,
an elite group of magic users.

3
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:31,063
The lowly Commoners,
those without magic...

4
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:33,767
are little more than slaves.

5
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:36,568
Izmer's young Empress Savina...

6
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:40,698
wishes equality
and prosperity for all.

7
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,137
But the evil Mage Profion
has other intentions.

8
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:53,947
At last!

9
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,277
Come, Damodar.

10
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,241
Release him.

11
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:48,969
You are mine now.

12
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,768
Come to me!

13
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:06,867
Yes, I told you
it could be done.

14
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:10,631
You have the power
of the Immortals.

15
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:14,069
You can control Dragons.

16
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:16,263
With a Dragon army
at my command...

17
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:17,929
I can crush the Empress...

18
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,197
and control
what is rightfully mine!

19
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,535
You don't like that, do you?

20
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:24,830
Good!

21
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:27,800
I can use every ounce
of your rage!

22
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,529
Come on.

23
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:32,624
Follow me.

24
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:34,964
Follow me!

25
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:38,861
I said follow me!

26
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,459
What now, my lord Profion?

27
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:14,687
We shall have to modify
our plans.

28
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:18,318
Summon the High Council of Mages
immediately.

29
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,087
They're about to learn something
of our young Empress...

30
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:25,182
that may give them pause
for thought.

31
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,884
It will be done.

32
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:41,452
This must be some
twisted magic experiment...

33
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:44,011
gone seriously wrong.

34
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,680
Why is it every time
something bad happens...

35
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,347
you blame the Mages?

36
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,218
When was the last time
you saw a river catch on fire?

37
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:52,948
You think they care
if anyone got hurt?

38
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:56,885
I'd love to find a way to give
those Mages some payback.

39
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,447
"Ridley the Savior."

40
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,849
That'll be the day.

41
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,612
Look, Ridley,
things are the way they are.

42
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,617
There's nothing
you can do to change it.

43
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,310
You got your haves
and your have-nots.

44
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:13,214
We are your gotta-gets.

45
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,478
And right about now,
we gotta get paid.

46
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:20,414
The Magic School.

47
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,881
The what?!

48
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,279
The Magic School?

49
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:24,542
Are you crazy?

50
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:26,070
We'll break
into the Magic School.

51
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:27,375
Think of what we could get.

52
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:29,505
With the fire,
it won't be heavily guarded.

53
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:32,511
Think of the challenge, Snails.

54
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:35,842
Think of what
we could find in there.

55
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,742
If we pull this off...

56
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,870
we'll be the envy
of every Thief in Sumdall.

57
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,208
Trust me.

58
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:51,872
Why would the Empress
want to disband this Council?

59
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,671
It's a concept
I find difficult to believe.

60
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,938
Azmath, your loyalty
is commendable...

61
00:06:57,977 --> 00:07:00,408
but we have all watched
the Empress' growing up...

62
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:02,408
and we have all
heard her views...

63
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:05,704
on what she considers to be
the injustices of the land.

64
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,400
But she is just a young woman.

65
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:11,407
Young people speak
from the heart, not the mind.

66
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,270
In time, with our counsel...

67
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,965
she will come to understand
why things cannot be changed.

68
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,165
Maybe so.

69
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:21,933
But is that a risk
you are willing to take?

70
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,529
Her revolutionary ideas...

71
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:25,696
have already taken root
among the people.

72
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:29,033
In time,
her influence will grow.

73
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:31,003
As the months go by...

74
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:34,025
she will learn to master
the powers of her Scepter.

75
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,093
When she does,
I have no doubt...

76
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,590
she will use it
to enforce her changes upon us.

77
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:42,568
What do you propose, Profion?

78
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:48,761
I humbly ask that we vote
to remove the Scepter...

79
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,892
from the Empress' control...

80
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:55,626
so that government in Izmer
will remain secure.

81
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,257
Remove the Scepter
which lolls above our heads...

82
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:01,356
and destroy the threat
of revolution forever!

83
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,923
And if she does not agree?

84
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:08,487
Then...

85
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:13,990
her true intentions
will become clear.

86
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,757
And then we will be forced
to do whatever we must...

87
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:23,659
to protect the strength
and unity of Izmer.

88
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,654
What say you?

89
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:43,853
How could he get the Council
to turn against me?

90
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,982
He plays on the fears
of the others...

91
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:49,387
their fears of change.

92
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:50,720
I know, Vildan...

93
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:54,416
but the changes I propose
are for the good of the people.

94
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:57,081
All people deserve
to be free and equal...

95
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:59,554
whether Commoner or Mage.

96
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,714
I know this within the depths
of my soul...

97
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:04,687
and if necessary...

98
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:09,176
I would die to make that
the way Izmer is run.

99
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:11,743
What can I do to stop Profion?

100
00:09:11,787 --> 00:09:14,548
You must outsmart him.

101
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,780
Over the past years,
I have been searching...

102
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:21,649
for an ancient artifact
called the Rod of Savrille.

103
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,311
It holds the same powers
as your Scepter...

104
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:26,442
with one difference...

105
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:29,348
It controls Red Dragons.

106
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:31,145
If you could obtain it...

107
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,808
you could relinquish
your Scepter to the Council...

108
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:36,474
and still have protection
against Profion.

109
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:38,947
I must have
that Rod of Savrille!

110
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:41,607
With one wave of it,
I will topple her...

111
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:46,909
and bring down that useless
Council of idiots with her.

112
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:50,902
What is your wish, my lord?

113
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:59,575
Pay a visit to the Magic School
and see our friend Vildan.

114
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,771
Persuade him to give you
the scroll of which he speaks...

115
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:04,505
and bring it here to me.

116
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:09,575
And, Damodar...

117
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:12,873
make sure that he's
no longer around...

118
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,364
to give our young Empress
any more good advice.

119
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:21,438
Come, my friend.

120
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,439
Ridley,
why it got to be so high?

121
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:31,734
Snails, let go of me.

122
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:34,103
Can't we just rob
the first floor next time?

123
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,333
Hurry up.

124
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:38,065
Why don't we just rob God
while we're up here?

125
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,230
Come on, Snails.

126
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,965
I thought you said
this was going to be easy.

127
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:42,903
No, I said it wasn't impossible.

128
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,700
That's the same thing
you said...

129
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:46,260
when we robbed
that little Halfling's house.

130
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:47,793
Who'd he catch? Me.

131
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:49,826
Who'd he beat
from the waist down? Me.

132
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:52,166
- Are you going to jump?
- You going to catch me?

133
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:53,692
- I'm going to catch you.
- Promise?

134
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,429
I promise. Now jump.

135
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:56,628
All right.

136
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:01,661
Sorry.

137
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,523
I thought I heard something.

138
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:07,625
You did.
Me hitting the ground.

139
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:13,423
That is a big Dragon.

140
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:18,593
Now we're talking.

141
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:22,161
All right. Let's get to work.

142
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:33,457
I've already told you, Marina.

143
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:34,792
The Empress can't use...

144
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,795
her Scepter
of Gold-Dragon control...

145
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,794
or Profion will paint her
as a tyrant to the Council.

146
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:43,123
Profion must be made
to expose himself to them.

147
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,592
Damn it, I know it's here.
Where is it?

148
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:47,116
It should be right here.

149
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:49,126
Are you sure you put it away
in its proper place?

150
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,989
I'm sure.

151
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:52,323
You're sure, are you?

152
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,950
Then why is it filed here
with these volumes on alchemy?

153
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:58,185
It belongs in Dracology.

154
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,657
Where is it?

155
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:01,658
I know I've got it somewhere.

156
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,816
Ah, yes, this was it.

157
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:06,051
Really, Marina,
you must stop dawdling.

158
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:09,284
The Empress only has
three days until the Council...

159
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:11,846
forces her to relinquish
her Scepter to them.

160
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,651
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

161
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,484
You must understand
the seriousness of our task.

162
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,818
I just feel like I should be
doing something more...

163
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:20,048
than shelving books.

164
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,747
I understand, Marina...

165
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:25,220
but you must learn
to be patient to maintain focus.

166
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:27,879
That's the best help
you can provide just now.

167
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,409
I suppose you're right.

168
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:41,373
I never saw a scroll
so hard to decode!

169
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:43,680
It's protected
by very ancient magic.

170
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:46,706
Marina,
fetch me some Manticore wing.

171
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,381
- What is that?
- A Dragon tooth.

172
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:00,313
- Put it back!
- Just a Dragon tooth.

173
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:02,643
- Put it back.
- A Gold Dragon tooth?

174
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,306
- It's too big. Put it back.
- Come on, Ridley.

175
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:22,434
Here.

176
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:25,369
What'd you give me
the rodent for?

177
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:27,070
Pick it up! Come on.

178
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:30,307
You already got enough of these
at your house.

179
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,206
Look at this.

180
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:36,433
We're going to be rich.

181
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:41,966
You know how much
we could get for one of these?

182
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:43,235
Don't touch that!

183
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:49,300
One of the lab creatures
must have got loose again.

184
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,805
Marina, check on it.

185
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,033
Right.

186
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:58,298
Snails, relax.

187
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:02,596
It's an illusion.

188
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:05,729
I knew that.

189
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,396
Don't touch anything else!

190
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:08,595
All right.

191
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:15,159
What are you doing?

192
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:16,896
We're the...

193
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,561
The cleaning crew.

194
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:20,726
Right.

195
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,666
This is dirty.

196
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,859
Cleanup crew's more like it.

197
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:27,129
You're Thieves trying to rob us.

198
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:39,059
She must've put a holding spell
on us with that bracelet.

199
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:41,690
It must be the only way she can
get guys to come home with her.

200
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,697
I'd have to put a feeble-mind
spell on myself...

201
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:45,356
to want to take you home.

202
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:47,855
That was funny.

203
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:49,363
You're going
to the city dungeon.

204
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:50,555
That wasn't.

205
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:51,721
What a relief.

206
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,955
I'll be thanking you
when they cut my head off.

207
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,326
You should.
It'd be an improvement.

208
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,656
There's that superior
intelligence...

209
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,592
you Mages are so famous for.

210
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:04,060
Yes, well,
speaking of intelligence...

211
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:06,889
what kind of genius
would break into a Magic School?

212
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:09,290
He'd have to be
really stupid or...

213
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,587
Or what?

214
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:12,217
Well...

215
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:14,719
Master!

216
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:21,086
If you don't tell me
which scroll it is...

217
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,522
I'll have to kill you painfully.

218
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:25,183
Never!

219
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,445
Are you crazy?
You just zapped...

220
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,180
The Chief
of the Crimson Brigade!

221
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,377
To the streets of Sumdall!

222
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:52,584
Follow them, you fools!

223
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,881
Where are we going?

224
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:01,110
Hey, nice trick!

225
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,640
No, the other way!

226
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:05,548
Watch out!

227
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,547
Lady, please, stop and listen.

228
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:16,047
Escapes are
our bread and butter.

229
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,242
- What's that?
- I don't know!

230
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:25,247
Get this rope off
so I can deal with it!

231
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,234
Can't nobody get a moment
of peace around here?

232
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,507
I ought to...

233
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:41,941
Nice lid.

234
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:43,876
You shouldn't have done that.

235
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:45,103
Check that door.

236
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:48,167
It's locked! It's locked!

237
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:02,773
Follow me!

238
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,000
If you think I'm going
in that filthy mess...

239
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,199
That's disgusting!

240
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:21,333
Post Brigades at every
sewer entrance and exit.

241
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:24,598
I want them found...

242
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:26,561
now.

243
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:33,564
Marina of Pretensa,
student Mage...

244
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:37,432
is sought for the brutal murder
of Vildan Vildir.

245
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:38,593
A reward will be...

246
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:39,794
I can't believe this!

247
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,595
You better believe it.
They're framing us.

248
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,395
They're framing you.
You're nothing but a Thief.

249
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:46,298
They can't be framing me.
I'm an aristocrat. I'm a Mage.

250
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,697
A low-level Mage...
completely expendable.

251
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,699
Practically worthless.

252
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,426
This is ridiculous.

253
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:54,522
I'll go to the authorities.

254
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:56,690
I can't go to the authorities.

255
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,993
That's right.
They'll toss you in prison...

256
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:00,724
and torture you
till you confess.

257
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,457
You better tell us,
'cause like the man said...

258
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,020
we're your accomplices.

259
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:08,960
All right.

260
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,223
Come on!

261
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:30,022
You allow...

262
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,389
a slip of a girl
to escape you...

263
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:36,914
with the scroll...

264
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:40,913
and now Norda,
the Empress' finest tracker...

265
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,617
is in pursuit...

266
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:48,820
and you tell me
not to concern myself?

267
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:51,550
It was a mistake.

268
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,987
It will not happen again.

269
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:56,715
There you are right.

270
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,716
And here's why...

271
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,840
Just a friend I'm sending along
for the ride.

272
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,141
A gentle reminder
not to make any more mistakes.

273
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,540
The moment you deliver me
the Rod...

274
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:55,942
I'll ensure that he...

275
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,274
it...

276
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:58,868
vacate the premises.

277
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:03,042
Now...

278
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,440
may I suggest...

279
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:09,239
that once you two have become
fully acquainted...

280
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,867
you follow the Empress'
tracker Norda.

281
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:14,636
She happens to be good
at her job.

282
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,607
She will lead you
to our missing friends...

283
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:18,971
and the scroll...

284
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:22,098
and this time, Damodar...

285
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:24,800
don't fail me.

286
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:56,925
It's about time!

287
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:07,562
If we find the Rod, the Empress
heaps us with gold, huh?

288
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,564
Why don't you try and rise above
being a Dwarf?

289
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,224
This isn't about gold.
It's about saving our Empire.

290
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:18,560
Empire?
Who cares about the Empire?

291
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:21,586
You Mages are the only ones
who benefit from it.

292
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,858
Oh, really? That's
an interesting sentiment...

293
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:25,885
coming from a guy
who steals things for a living.

294
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,694
Have you ever heard
of honor amongst Thieves?

295
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:33,717
We might live outside the law,
but we respect each other.

296
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:37,421
Unlike a bunch
of back-stabbing Mages.

297
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,985
That is just the sort of
half-baked, illiterate drivel...

298
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:44,585
that proves Commoners
really are common.

299
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:48,054
That's it. We're out of here.
Come on, Snails.

300
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:50,525
We'll go into hiding.
She can find the Rod herself.

301
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,048
Fine.

302
00:21:58,658 --> 00:22:00,180
I thought you were leaving.

303
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:02,053
Mind if we eat first?

304
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:04,250
No. Be my guest.

305
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:14,746
Those red marks there
look like the locks...

306
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:17,084
my father used to put on plans
in his carriages.

307
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:19,019
Please.

308
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:23,349
This is an ancient scroll,
not a blueprint for a bucket.

309
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:25,353
You don't seem to know
what you're doing...

310
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,614
so you might as well let me
have a look.

311
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:29,619
Give that back!

312
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:32,278
Let's see. He used to put
his fingers like this...

313
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,080
and then he'd say
something like...

314
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,551
Alanor, salah...
What was that word?

315
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:38,709
Bidet.

316
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:41,444
Bidet? Bidara! Bidara.

317
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:44,916
Alanor, salah, bidara!

318
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:52,444
Can't blame me for trying.
At least l...

319
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,971
See that there?
I knew that boy had talent!

320
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:08,473
Alanor, salah, bidara!

321
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:37,069
Do not let them escape...

322
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:40,403
or you will suffer
a fate far worse...

323
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:44,736
than that which hath
been inflicted upon me.

324
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:50,034
So there I am, hogtied,
lying on my back.

325
00:23:51,073 --> 00:23:53,800
This Orc starts poking me
with the spear.

326
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:56,361
Kind of a no-win situation.

327
00:23:56,404 --> 00:23:59,598
So, I say to myself,
"What do I got to lose?"

328
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,069
So, I take that spear
and bite it.

329
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:03,865
And I start chewing.

330
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:11,834
Idol of idols.

331
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:18,433
With an Elf.

332
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:20,729
You got to be kidding.

333
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:24,392
The problem with Elves is
they got no meat on their bones.

334
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:28,058
You got to get yourself
a nice 250-pound Dwarf.

335
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:32,088
With hair on her chin
you can hang on to.

336
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:51,059
Excuse me, little man.

337
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,093
You looking for somebody
in particular?

338
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,423
Or are you just looking for...

339
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,824
somebody?

340
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,058
Actually...

341
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:09,490
I'm looking for someone
just like you.

342
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,117
What a coincidence...

343
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,522
'cause I was looking for someone
just like you.

344
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:17,819
We got to celebrate.

345
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:22,186
Bartender, give me a bottle
of your best wine.

346
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,119
Make that your cheapest.

347
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:57,976
Wait.

348
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:02,215
I need the girl.

349
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,881
Bar fight!

350
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,412
Get them!

351
00:26:18,514 --> 00:26:19,878
This ain't the time for romance!

352
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:22,209
- What are you doing?
- Come on! Come on!

353
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,675
Wait, I got to go back.
I think I'm in love!

354
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:30,008
With an Elf?
They think Humans are a joke!

355
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,875
All right, I lied.
I just want to hit it!

356
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,336
Let's get Ridley out of here.

357
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,739
Bidet, bidet, bidet.

358
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,871
That Wraith
must have been defective.

359
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,999
- He seemed reliable to me.
- He did not.

360
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,071
It's Damodar, man.
He's onto us.

361
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:03,004
With what we've walked into,
everyone's going to be onto us.

362
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,665
What do you mean,
everybody's onto us?

363
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:07,865
Go ahead.
Tell him what you got us into.

364
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:09,769
Me? But you...

365
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:13,795
Go ahead.
Tell me what you got us into.

366
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:15,928
According to the Wraith
inside the scroll...

367
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:18,698
the Rod we're looking for
caused the Great War.

368
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:22,099
Is that all?

369
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,668
Have you lost your damn mind?

370
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,226
What does this Rod do?

371
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:32,359
It's supposed to have the power
to control Red Dragons.

372
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,924
I don't know about you...

373
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,957
but this sound
like a pretty bad idea to me.

374
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,296
It gets better.

375
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:39,391
This map
leads to a Dragon temple.

376
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:42,093
To get in, we have to get
the Eye of the Dragon...

377
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:43,793
from the Guildmaster
of the Thieves Guild...

378
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,389
in Antius City.

379
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,558
Xilus?

380
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,724
No. Get...

381
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,959
No way!

382
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,294
I told her she's crazy...

383
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:53,059
but she keeps going on about
Profion and the Empress.

384
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:54,358
Profion?

385
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:56,364
They can
take care of themselves.

386
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:57,625
I suggest we lay low...

387
00:27:57,664 --> 00:28:00,959
let the whole thing blow over,
come back, rob everybody.

388
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:03,019
That's all. Let's go.

389
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:05,551
Snails,
there's one more small problem.

390
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,221
Problem?

391
00:28:11,262 --> 00:28:12,852
What's the problem, Ridley?

392
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,482
I kind of committed us
to find it.

393
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:22,686
Ridley, how could you
do something like that?

394
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,220
You...

395
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:34,154
I can't believe this.

396
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:36,554
I can't believe...

397
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,681
"This is our big chance, huh?

398
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:41,882
"Let's rob the magic school.
This is our big chance!"

399
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:43,411
That's what you said to me,
right?

400
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:44,581
This is...

401
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,679
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

402
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:47,983
Dumb!

403
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:50,954
I got a new name for dumb.
"Ridley."

404
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:53,545
This is the Ridley-est thing
I ever heard of.

405
00:28:56,154 --> 00:28:58,347
I'll understand
if you don't want to go.

406
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:01,880
What do you mean I can't go?

407
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:06,674
Look, all I'm saying is that...

408
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:10,810
don't you think this is just
a little bit out of our league?

409
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:12,113
Just a little bit?

410
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:13,742
Snails, listen to me, OK?

411
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,012
This Eye of the Dragon
we're supposed to get?

412
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:18,539
It's a ruby
the size of your fist.

413
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:20,573
I don't...

414
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:22,582
A ruby the size of a fist?

415
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:26,048
Yeah. We'll use her to help us
get it, and we'll take off.

416
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:27,843
We'll make a fortune.

417
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:31,508
Trust me.

418
00:29:33,714 --> 00:29:35,509
I hate when you say that!

419
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:45,876
Ridley, I know I'll regret this.

420
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:48,605
I knew you'd come
through for me!

421
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:50,668
Don't touch me.

422
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:52,143
OK, just a little bit.

423
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:53,837
We're in.

424
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:57,469
How about you?

425
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:03,332
I don't see what choice I have.

426
00:30:03,377 --> 00:30:07,308
Just tell me one thing...
If I help, who'll pay me?

427
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:15,435
We'll worry about that later.

428
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:24,070
That's a terrible way
to do business.

429
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:52,265
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it!

430
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:53,699
Get out of here!

431
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,660
Ridley, check it out.

432
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:24,390
Let's go.

433
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:51,022
Listen, we're looking for
esteemed Guildmaster Xilus.

434
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:52,455
We thought you'd know him.

435
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:54,582
The only thing I know is...

436
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,987
you ought to take your business
out of town...

437
00:31:57,024 --> 00:32:00,649
before you get the words
"outsiders not appreciated"...

438
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,314
branded right where
your nose used to be.

439
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,788
Get it?

440
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:12,181
Thanks for your time!

441
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,910
If I ain't drinking,
you sure ain't shopping!

442
00:32:16,954 --> 00:32:18,419
Come on!

443
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:23,819
There you are!
Where have you been?

444
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:25,909
Don't look at us, all right?

445
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:27,213
We're just shopping.

446
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:29,615
Is that three-eyed
hyphen bastard watching us?

447
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,316
If we follow him...

448
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:37,010
he'll probably lead us
into the Guild.

449
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,475
There he goes.

450
00:32:39,516 --> 00:32:41,482
Let's go.

451
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:06,338
Come on.

452
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,397
Elwood, we'll go in.
You keep a lookout.

453
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:39,004
Nice.

454
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:44,105
Isn't that Tollum?

455
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:46,331
The guy
that kidnapped the Duke of...

456
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:51,627
Let's keep 'em walking.

457
00:33:52,838 --> 00:33:54,235
Let's go find Xilus.

458
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:55,702
That won't be necessary.

459
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,601
Like I said,
"Outsiders not appreciated."

460
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,068
You was talking to us?

461
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:02,659
We was confused
'cause your third eye...

462
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:04,225
was looking at somebody
completely different.

463
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:05,667
Take 'em away!

464
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:09,264
Don't touch me!

465
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:11,426
Get off me! Get off of me!

466
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:17,662
Where do you think
they took Snails?

467
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,928
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
Just let me do the talking.

468
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,626
So this is it?

469
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,824
Everything a Thief strives for?

470
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:28,659
You must be Xilus.

471
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,324
Ridley Freeborn. Practitioner
of the larcenous crafts.

472
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:34,194
Member in good standing
of the Sumdall Guild.

473
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,321
It's a pleasure to meet you.

474
00:34:37,363 --> 00:34:39,295
A fellow Thief.

475
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,091
The pleasure's all mine.

476
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:43,492
See?

477
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:45,085
Sumdall, eh?

478
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:47,151
How is old Sumdall?

479
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:49,490
That's a pretty tough town,
isn't it?

480
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:51,118
All those Mages.

481
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:52,786
We get by.

482
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:55,293
Yes, well, I think you
must be very accomplished...

483
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,952
to have such a precious morsel
traveling with you.

484
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,091
What might I do for you?

485
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,750
The unity of our kingdom...

486
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:09,588
We understand you have something
called the Eye of the Dragon.

487
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,147
We desperately need it.

488
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:16,253
Yes, well, I'm always happy
to help a fellow Thief.

489
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,415
Have you ever heard
of the Antius Guild Maze?

490
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:24,586
Of course.
Every Thief has heard of it.

491
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,918
Wonderful.

492
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:28,750
Then you'll know
that the Eye of the Dragon...

493
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:31,913
is the prize at the center
of my Guild Maze, won't you?

494
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:35,284
You finish the maze,
you win the prize.

495
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,912
Has anyone ever
finished it before?

496
00:35:40,586 --> 00:35:42,574
They all died trying.

497
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:45,551
But look on the bright side.

498
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:48,016
At least the prize
is still there.

499
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:51,807
Good health.

500
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,782
And jolly good luck.

501
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,807
This is a good one, Ridley.

502
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:39,071
That's no fair!

503
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:29,699
- I give him forty seconds.
- Nah, a minute.

504
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:32,256
I can't believe they're betting
on whether or not he lives.

505
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:33,960
Au contraire, precious morsel.

506
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,693
They're betting on
how long before he dies.

507
00:38:00,396 --> 00:38:02,419
Be careful, Ridley!

508
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,091
Oh, my.

509
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:25,489
This is not right!

510
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:29,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very clever.

511
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,853
But is clever enough?

512
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,288
Come on,
the game ain't over yet.

513
00:40:11,774 --> 00:40:13,932
Very light on his feet,
isn't he?

514
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:23,595
What kind of vault is that?

515
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,798
I think she needs
to visit her friend.

516
00:41:32,327 --> 00:41:33,587
Nice.

517
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:40,584
Well, yes, yes, yes.

518
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:43,183
Very clever. Well done, you.

519
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:45,690
- You were absolutely amazing.
- Thank you.

520
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:47,815
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thank you.

521
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:51,448
I waited fifteen years
for someone to pick that lock.

522
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:54,115
I knew the man
that could survive that maze...

523
00:41:54,156 --> 00:41:55,883
would be able to
get into that vault.

524
00:41:55,923 --> 00:41:57,548
And now, here he is.

525
00:41:57,589 --> 00:42:00,180
The man. You.

526
00:42:00,222 --> 00:42:04,711
Why don't you give me
what's rightfully mine?

527
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:08,682
What about honor
amongst Thieves?

528
00:42:10,888 --> 00:42:13,944
What a romantic notion.

529
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:17,043
Do you honestly believe
I could've amassed my wealth...

530
00:42:17,086 --> 00:42:18,518
if I worried about honor?

531
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:22,643
So, pretty boy...

532
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:24,173
if you don't want Hugo here...

533
00:42:24,218 --> 00:42:27,183
to rearrange your features
for you...

534
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:29,774
I suggest you just give it up.

535
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:38,245
Who the hell is he?

536
00:42:38,283 --> 00:42:39,908
Who the hell are you?

537
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,439
I don't know who you are...

538
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,503
but be prepared
for a lesson in pain.

539
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,136
You must be joking.

540
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,701
I never joke when Mages trespass
in my Guild!

541
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:13,333
This is the map you're after.

542
00:43:15,077 --> 00:43:18,201
Clear a path,
and I'll put it out.

543
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,635
Do it.

544
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:43,191
Let go of me!

545
00:45:00,558 --> 00:45:01,956
You OK?

546
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:04,052
We got to save Marina.

547
00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:07,216
Wait. What about the Dwarf?

548
00:45:07,257 --> 00:45:09,882
You get the Dwarf,
I'll get the girl.

549
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:12,889
Wait. How come I always
got to get the Dwarf?

550
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:14,081
Damn!

551
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,315
Ridley, we already
have the Dragon's Eye.

552
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:34,319
Let's take it to Sumdall
and sell it.

553
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:36,285
Snails, we're not leaving
without Marina.

554
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,285
Listen to you, Ridley!

555
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,114
You're going to risk your life
for a Mage?

556
00:45:40,152 --> 00:45:41,640
Listen, Snails...

557
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:42,878
What?

558
00:45:45,184 --> 00:45:47,150
I wouldn't do that...

559
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:49,909
if I were you.

560
00:45:59,915 --> 00:46:02,005
Hey, it's you.

561
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:04,578
You know her?

562
00:46:04,614 --> 00:46:05,841
We're acquainted.

563
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:08,210
Is that the Elf
you were drooling over?

564
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:10,042
I wouldn't put it that way.

565
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,875
But, yeah, that's her.
Pretty, huh?

566
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:13,969
They all look alike to me.

567
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:15,944
Silence!

568
00:46:15,979 --> 00:46:18,444
Where is the girl?

569
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:19,774
None of your business.

570
00:46:19,812 --> 00:46:22,471
Wrong, Human.

571
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,999
It is my business to arrest you
and Marina of Pretensa...

572
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:28,908
and to take you
and the scroll you stole...

573
00:46:28,944 --> 00:46:30,637
back to the Empress of Izmer.

574
00:46:32,577 --> 00:46:35,565
So you're the law, are you?

575
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:37,097
I should have known.

576
00:46:37,142 --> 00:46:38,835
One of your fellow lawmen...

577
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,568
in fact, the Chief
of the Crimson Brigade...

578
00:46:40,608 --> 00:46:42,267
beat you to the punch.

579
00:46:42,308 --> 00:46:44,433
He just took off with Marina!

580
00:46:44,474 --> 00:46:46,905
- Damodar.
- That's him.

581
00:46:46,941 --> 00:46:48,873
Only he's not working
for the law anymore.

582
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:51,429
He's working for Profion.

583
00:46:51,473 --> 00:46:55,268
He's the one you want, not us.

584
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:13,493
Your Majesty.

585
00:47:15,203 --> 00:47:18,259
Yes, Norda.
Have you found me the scroll?

586
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:19,825
No, Your Highness.

587
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:22,629
I have unfortunate tidings
to report.

588
00:47:22,668 --> 00:47:26,532
It seems Profion
also seeks the Rod.

589
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:28,499
But how could he know?

590
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:30,362
I do not know, milady.

591
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,025
Damodar has captured
Marina of Pretensa...

592
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:34,463
and the scroll...

593
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:37,828
but I have her companions
in my custody.

594
00:47:37,865 --> 00:47:39,331
What is your command?

595
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:45,086
Seek Damodar out.

596
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:47,097
We need that Rod.

597
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:50,926
The Council demands my response
imminently.

598
00:47:50,963 --> 00:47:54,087
Norda, please hurry.

599
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:55,822
Our time is running out.

600
00:47:55,862 --> 00:47:57,919
As you wish.

601
00:48:07,494 --> 00:48:09,584
Gather the horses.

602
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:11,353
We will track Damodar.

603
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:14,749
They will travel with us.

604
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:17,485
Should they try to escape...

605
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:18,956
kill them.

606
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:43,286
Tell me...

607
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,782
Why were you
at the Thieves Guild?

608
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:52,014
It isn't exactly
a sightseeing spot, is it?

609
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:58,211
We needed money for supplies.

610
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:14,108
You'll have to do better
than that.

611
00:49:18,515 --> 00:49:20,310
I'm curious.

612
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:23,878
You're a Mage...

613
00:49:23,915 --> 00:49:28,937
and yet you're
disgracing your family...

614
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,036
by consorting with Thieves.

615
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,443
You're a disgrace to Izmer,
conspiring against the Empress.

616
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:42,300
I have no dispute with her.

617
00:49:42,344 --> 00:49:43,832
You know me.

618
00:49:43,877 --> 00:49:49,400
I have served her family loyally
for many a year.

619
00:49:50,876 --> 00:49:55,240
It is Profion's desire
to dethrone her...

620
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:58,770
not mine.

621
00:49:59,842 --> 00:50:02,705
Then why do you help him?

622
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:12,404
Look at me.

623
00:50:13,672 --> 00:50:16,263
Look at me!

624
00:50:18,771 --> 00:50:22,863
If I do not obtain the Rod...

625
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:25,063
I will die.

626
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:28,331
Please...

627
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,336
help me.

628
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:36,394
I'm sorry, but I...

629
00:50:36,435 --> 00:50:38,798
I cannot help you.

630
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:48,159
Foolish girl.

631
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:52,758
I can suck...

632
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,254
the information I want...

633
00:50:56,299 --> 00:50:58,991
right out of you.

634
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:21,389
Your friends have procured...

635
00:51:21,427 --> 00:51:24,915
the Eye of the Dragon...

636
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,153
from the Thieves Maze.

637
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:32,823
A key...

638
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:34,518
of some sort.

639
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:01,781
Can't I just walk?

640
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:06,480
Don't you people know Dwarves
are terrified of horses?

641
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,679
Get over it.

642
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:11,612
A lot of Dwarves are afraid
to show their true feelings.

643
00:52:11,652 --> 00:52:13,447
I'm not, OK?

644
00:52:37,848 --> 00:52:39,972
They followed the valley.

645
00:52:40,014 --> 00:52:41,673
I know these lands.

646
00:52:41,714 --> 00:52:43,475
There's a shortcut up ahead.

647
00:52:43,514 --> 00:52:45,877
Through the forest
and over those hills.

648
00:52:47,046 --> 00:52:49,671
It means leaving the trail...

649
00:52:49,713 --> 00:52:52,940
but if Damodar sets up camp
and we ride all night...

650
00:52:52,979 --> 00:52:56,002
we stand a good chance
of cutting him off.

651
00:52:56,045 --> 00:52:57,670
All right, let's go.

652
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:04,068
I love the way you track.

653
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,099
You wouldn't happen
to be single, are you?

654
00:53:07,144 --> 00:53:08,541
What?

655
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:11,007
There's no harm in asking
is there?

656
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:13,031
It just so happens
that I'm single.

657
00:53:13,076 --> 00:53:15,303
Can you believe it?

658
00:53:15,342 --> 00:53:17,433
How old are you?

659
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:20,133
Twenty-three. I know
I'm a little young for you.

660
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:22,538
What if I get my hands
on an aging potion?

661
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,539
I'll sacrifice
a couple of years for you.

662
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:28,832
I'm 234.

663
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,600
Oh, damn.

664
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:33,866
I didn't mean
that much of a change.

665
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:52,362
Hurry.

666
00:54:00,434 --> 00:54:02,025
Ridley, look... Beholders.

667
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:04,794
Relax, Snails.
We'll just sneak around 'em.

668
00:54:13,298 --> 00:54:14,888
Now what?

669
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:17,795
A little distraction.

670
00:54:35,728 --> 00:54:37,751
All right, Snails, stay close.

671
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:47,920
All clear.

672
00:54:57,425 --> 00:55:00,948
OK. I'll get Marina.
You get the map.

673
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:02,581
OK. Hey, wait, Ridley.

674
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:04,589
How you get the girl
and I get a map?

675
00:55:04,623 --> 00:55:06,350
We got to work out
some new plans.

676
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:07,548
Go.

677
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:17,520
Be careful.

678
00:55:19,055 --> 00:55:20,247
All right.

679
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:25,546
You, too.

680
00:55:37,718 --> 00:55:38,944
Let's go in.

681
00:55:41,017 --> 00:55:43,948
We were not meant
to enter this place.

682
00:55:45,283 --> 00:55:48,771
This task
they must complete alone.

683
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:11,605
I'm Damodar.

684
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:42,373
A little black magic.

685
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:53,564
All right, Damodar.

686
00:56:53,605 --> 00:56:56,400
Nice.

687
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:03,693
Piece of cake.

688
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,824
I knew this was too easy.

689
00:57:27,632 --> 00:57:30,359
Need a hand?

690
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:42,585
It's OK.

691
00:58:49,852 --> 00:58:52,317
Let's get you out of here.

692
00:58:52,351 --> 00:58:53,840
Come on.

693
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:09,107
Just like you Thieves.

694
00:59:09,149 --> 00:59:12,807
Always taking things
that don't belong to you.

695
00:59:12,848 --> 00:59:15,212
All right. Now...

696
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:17,679
I'm mad.

697
00:59:17,715 --> 00:59:21,737
You want to play, do you?

698
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,507
Yeah. Let's play.

699
00:59:25,846 --> 00:59:29,073
OK, you win. Game over.

700
00:59:52,141 --> 00:59:53,266
There they are!

701
00:59:53,308 --> 00:59:55,796
So much for getting
out of here without a fight.

702
01:00:05,073 --> 01:00:06,403
Thanks.

703
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,837
Anytime.

704
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:37,466
Hit him! Hit him!

705
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:07,458
Let's go!

706
01:01:44,523 --> 01:01:45,853
Come on.

707
01:01:49,689 --> 01:01:52,621
You cannot be serious.

708
01:01:52,655 --> 01:01:54,677
I've never been so serious.

709
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:57,551
Oh, please.

710
01:02:21,316 --> 01:02:25,748
If you'll give me
the Dragon's Eye...

711
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,647
I might decide...

712
01:02:28,682 --> 01:02:30,807
to let you die quickly.

713
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:33,373
Go to hell!

714
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:17,536
Not your usual punctual self.

715
01:03:19,473 --> 01:03:22,030
Where's my Dragon's Eye?

716
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,370
I have it.

717
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:33,371
Really?

718
01:03:33,405 --> 01:03:35,461
Show it to me.

719
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,426
Let him go first,
and it's yours.

720
01:03:49,735 --> 01:03:51,462
Snails, don't!

721
01:04:22,397 --> 01:04:25,919
Make it easy on yourself.

722
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:29,224
Give me what is mine.

723
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,259
Never!

724
01:04:34,294 --> 01:04:37,088
You're as stubborn
as your friend.

725
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,155
Very well.

726
01:04:44,126 --> 01:04:46,614
You've made your choice.

727
01:04:52,658 --> 01:04:53,851
Come on, Ridley!

728
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:00,346
Transporting!

729
01:05:04,689 --> 01:05:06,678
Come on, Ridley!

730
01:05:06,722 --> 01:05:08,983
Come on!

731
01:05:36,817 --> 01:05:40,475
The Council has voted.
You must oblige us.

732
01:05:41,716 --> 01:05:44,307
You understand the consequences
of your decision...

733
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:46,940
Do not patronize me, Azmath...

734
01:05:46,982 --> 01:05:49,811
for I understand all too well.

735
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:56,346
Yes, I violate the law
in defying the Council...

736
01:05:56,381 --> 01:05:59,346
but if I were
to give you this Scepter...

737
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:02,369
my crime would be graver yet...

738
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:04,901
for I would be
defying my conscience...

739
01:06:04,946 --> 01:06:07,036
and our people.

740
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:11,607
Have you all forgotten?

741
01:06:11,645 --> 01:06:16,168
This Council was created to
protect the people of Izmer...

742
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:17,437
but ask yourselves...

743
01:06:17,477 --> 01:06:20,204
Is this what you are doing?

744
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:23,333
I say not.

745
01:06:23,376 --> 01:06:26,433
Your concern
is only for yourselves...

746
01:06:26,476 --> 01:06:28,135
not the people.

747
01:06:28,175 --> 01:06:30,504
And Your Majesty
is forcing the Empire...

748
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:32,063
to the verge of civil war...

749
01:06:32,108 --> 01:06:34,006
in the best interests
of the people?

750
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:38,473
The man who convinced you
to take the Scepter from me...

751
01:06:38,507 --> 01:06:41,939
so that he would leave
the state defenseless.

752
01:06:43,272 --> 01:06:45,329
Be careful, my friends...

753
01:06:45,373 --> 01:06:49,532
for once he's done with me,
this Council may be next.

754
01:06:53,104 --> 01:06:55,593
War benefits no one, Profion...

755
01:06:55,638 --> 01:06:57,500
and I oppose it.

756
01:06:59,136 --> 01:07:02,727
But if it is necessary to obtain
the freedom of our people...

757
01:07:04,302 --> 01:07:08,597
then no cost could be too great
to achieve that goal.

758
01:07:08,635 --> 01:07:10,999
Do you hear her words?

759
01:07:11,035 --> 01:07:14,761
She violates our highest law!

760
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,732
And then seeks to force us
into submission...

761
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:21,425
with a threat of war.

762
01:07:21,466 --> 01:07:25,455
Each citizen of Izmer,
whether a Commoner or a Mage...

763
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:29,396
deserves an equal right
for prosperity...

764
01:07:29,431 --> 01:07:31,363
and as Empress...

765
01:07:31,398 --> 01:07:35,420
this is how I decree
Izmer shall be run...

766
01:07:35,464 --> 01:07:38,827
from this day forward.

767
01:07:38,863 --> 01:07:40,226
Such pretty words.

768
01:07:40,262 --> 01:07:43,591
My friends, I warned you...

769
01:07:43,629 --> 01:07:46,720
that this headstrong child...

770
01:07:48,228 --> 01:07:51,092
will defy you and destroy you.

771
01:07:51,128 --> 01:07:55,616
Her youth
denies her the wisdom...

772
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:59,353
to understand why
some things cannot change...

773
01:07:59,393 --> 01:08:02,722
but idealism is for children...

774
01:08:02,759 --> 01:08:08,316
and a child is not fit
to govern an Empire.

775
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:10,586
I ask you one last time!

776
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:14,079
Will you submit
to the ruling of this Council...

777
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:16,555
and relinquish your Scepter?

778
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,851
I was praying...

779
01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:20,912
that you would
find the wisdom...

780
01:08:20,956 --> 01:08:24,648
to see that the path
I propose for Izmer...

781
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:27,745
is the right one.

782
01:08:28,788 --> 01:08:30,912
I do not wish to fight you...

783
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:35,147
but I will not
leave the Empire...

784
01:08:35,187 --> 01:08:39,142
at the mercy
of an unscrupulous charlatan!

785
01:08:40,686 --> 01:08:44,617
So decide as you must,
but know one thing...

786
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:49,577
I am not afraid.

787
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,174
A wonderful performance.

788
01:09:07,215 --> 01:09:10,476
My friends, ask yourselves...

789
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:13,207
are we prepared to see
our Empire...

790
01:09:13,247 --> 01:09:15,610
destroyed by a child?

791
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:22,103
Then is now not the time
we should act?

792
01:09:23,546 --> 01:09:26,137
Then down with the tyrants...

793
01:09:26,179 --> 01:09:28,235
and let the war begin!

794
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:00,534
What is he doing?

795
01:10:03,205 --> 01:10:05,898
Isn't he going to use
any spells?

796
01:10:05,938 --> 01:10:07,597
Wait.

797
01:10:38,999 --> 01:10:41,056
How did you do that?

798
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:46,030
The Elven people do not require
spells to work with magic.

799
01:10:46,065 --> 01:10:49,088
You use magic.

800
01:10:50,364 --> 01:10:52,795
We are part of it.

801
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:55,887
Part of magic?

802
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:59,656
As are all living creatures,
including Dragons.

803
01:10:59,696 --> 01:11:05,026
Sadly, Humans see only
their destructive powers.

804
01:11:07,728 --> 01:11:09,660
I had a dream. I saw...

805
01:11:09,695 --> 01:11:11,717
You saw a Dragon being born.

806
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,316
It was amazing.

807
01:11:14,594 --> 01:11:16,457
Life was exploding all around.

808
01:11:16,493 --> 01:11:17,890
So it should.

809
01:11:17,926 --> 01:11:21,323
You see, when Dragons are born,
they bring new magic with them.

810
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:24,882
Magic is the life force
of our world.

811
01:11:24,925 --> 01:11:28,220
It keeps nature
and everything around us...

812
01:11:28,258 --> 01:11:30,485
in balance.

813
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:36,389
And if many Dragons should die?

814
01:11:36,423 --> 01:11:41,117
Life would wither as it must...

815
01:11:41,156 --> 01:11:44,020
and the balance
would be destroyed.

816
01:11:44,055 --> 01:11:46,419
The Rod.

817
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,315
You and your countrymen...

818
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:53,411
are very close
to irreparably destroying...

819
01:11:53,453 --> 01:11:57,112
the fabric of magic
with this Rod you seek.

820
01:11:57,153 --> 01:11:59,710
The Rod is man-made...

821
01:11:59,752 --> 01:12:02,718
unnatural.

822
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:05,240
It must not be disturbed.

823
01:12:08,484 --> 01:12:11,416
You must rest.

824
01:12:37,379 --> 01:12:40,708
I'm sorry about Snails.

825
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,043
I'm sure you are.

826
01:12:51,877 --> 01:12:53,740
He died for a good cause.

827
01:12:53,777 --> 01:12:56,867
A good cause?

828
01:12:58,509 --> 01:13:01,566
What cause is that?

829
01:13:01,609 --> 01:13:04,540
The Empress against Profion?

830
01:13:07,474 --> 01:13:08,996
Politics.

831
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:12,973
I'm through with all that.

832
01:13:16,106 --> 01:13:18,230
I'm not going to die
over some power struggle...

833
01:13:18,272 --> 01:13:19,704
between a couple
of greedy Mages.

834
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:21,568
No, you're wrong.

835
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:24,571
No, you're wrong! Mage!

836
01:13:24,605 --> 01:13:27,036
You never had to live
on the other side.

837
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:29,060
You know what?
Snails was right.

838
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:30,797
There is nothing we can do
to change it...

839
01:13:30,837 --> 01:13:33,394
and if I had listened to him,
he would still be alive.

840
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:35,959
Just because some Mages are evil
does not mean they all are.

841
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:37,298
I'm not!

842
01:13:41,702 --> 01:13:44,691
Let me let you in
on a little secret.

843
01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:48,427
The Empress that Snails died for
stands to lose everything...

844
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:51,058
because she is fighting
to change things.

845
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,861
As if she has anything
to worry about.

846
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,295
You are so naive.

847
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:00,697
She risks everything...

848
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:03,197
because she does not believe
the system is fair.

849
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:05,857
Profion seeks to dethrone her
because she believes...

850
01:14:05,898 --> 01:14:08,727
that Mages and Commoners
should be treated as equals.

851
01:14:08,764 --> 01:14:12,662
She is fighting to change
what you hate so much!

852
01:14:15,763 --> 01:14:19,559
That, Ridley,
is what Snails died for.

853
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:37,188
When Vildan told me what was
happening with the Empress...

854
01:14:39,293 --> 01:14:42,588
I wanted to do
all I could to help her.

855
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:46,117
But even then,
I did not understand...

856
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:49,248
why she would want Commoners
to be equal with us.

857
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:54,816
But now...

858
01:14:55,889 --> 01:14:59,049
after being with you
for only a few days...

859
01:14:59,089 --> 01:15:03,180
and seeing how you always manage
to find your way...

860
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:08,010
I understand why the Empress
is right.

861
01:15:12,453 --> 01:15:14,645
Please, Ridley.

862
01:15:14,686 --> 01:15:17,846
Help me show them
we are not like they are.

863
01:15:25,717 --> 01:15:27,580
You know, for a Mage...

864
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:34,674
you're pretty smart.

865
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:16,334
It will protect you.

866
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:18,501
Thank you.

867
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,225
All right. This is it.

868
01:16:57,269 --> 01:16:59,701
This is the entrance
to the dungeon.

869
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:11,296
What happened?

870
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:14,226
What is it?

871
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:18,328
It's a wall force of some kind.

872
01:17:18,366 --> 01:17:20,354
I've never seen
this kind of magic.

873
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:28,319
Only you were meant to pass.

874
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:35,719
I guess I go alone, then.

875
01:17:41,595 --> 01:17:42,992
Be careful.

876
01:17:43,028 --> 01:17:46,755
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

877
01:18:53,649 --> 01:18:54,740
Great.

878
01:18:56,883 --> 01:18:58,041
Now what?

879
01:20:40,098 --> 01:20:42,189
Sorry, Snails.

880
01:21:07,027 --> 01:21:09,185
Finally,
a Mage who got what he deserved.

881
01:21:11,793 --> 01:21:14,691
Why do you disturb
the Rod of Savrille?

882
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:19,121
To save the Empire of Izmer.

883
01:21:20,325 --> 01:21:21,847
Who...

884
01:21:21,891 --> 01:21:23,481
What are you?

885
01:21:23,524 --> 01:21:26,354
I am Savrille,
creator of the Rod...

886
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:29,651
cursed with the crime of trying
to control the Red Dragons...

887
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:32,281
and sentenced
to this purgatory...

888
01:21:32,323 --> 01:21:36,254
until someone worthy
of its power takes it.

889
01:21:36,288 --> 01:21:38,584
You are such a man?

890
01:21:40,554 --> 01:21:42,611
I don't know
if anybody's such a man.

891
01:21:45,254 --> 01:21:47,117
But I'm going to find out.

892
01:21:48,353 --> 01:21:52,478
Be warned. Anyone who wields
the power of the Rod...

893
01:21:52,519 --> 01:21:54,815
shall suffer a horrible fate...

894
01:21:54,853 --> 01:21:57,682
for the evil it creates
cannot be undone...

895
01:21:57,718 --> 01:22:00,513
unless its spell is broken.

896
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:01,847
How do I break the spell?

897
01:22:01,885 --> 01:22:05,407
That, you must discover.

898
01:23:20,271 --> 01:23:23,293
The Empress has called
her Dragons upon us.

899
01:23:26,803 --> 01:23:29,564
Don't just stand there
admiring them!

900
01:23:29,603 --> 01:23:30,864
Destroy them
before they reach us.

901
01:23:30,902 --> 01:23:32,334
Hurry! Hurry!

902
01:23:34,036 --> 01:23:35,831
Prepare to fire!

903
01:23:35,869 --> 01:23:37,164
Fire!

904
01:23:45,934 --> 01:23:47,331
Come on.

905
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:02,491
Get up! Prepare to fire again!

906
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:04,393
Move that crossbow.

907
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:07,294
Aim for their wings, you fools!

908
01:24:10,163 --> 01:24:12,390
Fire, you fools! Fire!

909
01:24:34,659 --> 01:24:36,522
What have I done?

910
01:24:42,157 --> 01:24:43,316
Come to me.

911
01:25:05,654 --> 01:25:07,483
I found the Rod!

912
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,113
Thanks for saving me
the trouble.

913
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:29,447
Feels good, doesn't it?

914
01:25:29,483 --> 01:25:30,880
Remember...

915
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:36,212
your stupidity and persistence
got your Thief friend killed.

916
01:25:36,248 --> 01:25:37,975
Don't let it be responsible...

917
01:25:38,015 --> 01:25:41,412
for finishing off the rest
of your social circle.

918
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:48,941
Oh, look.

919
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:52,967
I've cut her. What a shame.

920
01:25:53,012 --> 01:25:54,376
Don't hurt her.

921
01:25:54,412 --> 01:25:56,809
Then give me the Rod!

922
01:25:56,845 --> 01:25:59,538
And you'll release them?

923
01:25:59,578 --> 01:26:02,441
Don't do it, Ridley.

924
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:08,436
You have my word.

925
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:36,068
Finally.

926
01:26:36,105 --> 01:26:38,128
You said you'd let them go!

927
01:26:42,104 --> 01:26:43,899
I lied.

928
01:26:43,937 --> 01:26:45,368
Kill them...

929
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:50,028
slowly.

930
01:28:07,257 --> 01:28:10,552
Give that to me.

931
01:28:17,888 --> 01:28:20,581
You said you'd set me free.

932
01:28:29,652 --> 01:28:33,175
Now what about my head?

933
01:28:50,115 --> 01:28:51,842
Here they come!

934
01:28:55,815 --> 01:28:57,337
Come, Damodar.

935
01:28:57,381 --> 01:28:59,074
To the roof of Sumdall.

936
01:29:12,745 --> 01:29:14,210
Fire!

937
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:48,371
My destiny.

938
01:29:51,805 --> 01:29:54,703
Come to me.

939
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,624
Look. I've cut you.

940
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:08,147
What a shame.

941
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:11,574
You can run, Your Ladyship...

942
01:32:11,615 --> 01:32:15,569
but you'll never run far enough!

943
01:32:18,114 --> 01:32:23,740
Let their blood
rain from the sky!

944
01:32:34,112 --> 01:32:36,543
You'll pay for that, boy.

945
01:32:36,578 --> 01:32:40,304
You really think
that you can steal my destiny?

946
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:45,140
I'll invent a new destiny
especially for you...

947
01:32:45,176 --> 01:32:46,402
full of pain.

948
01:32:47,409 --> 01:32:52,340
A new kind of pain
and new senses to feel it with.

949
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:54,534
Not if I kill you first.

950
01:32:56,341 --> 01:33:00,238
This will be a real pleasure.

951
01:33:20,237 --> 01:33:22,100
Not so talented, eh, Mr. Ridley?

952
01:33:22,137 --> 01:33:26,568
I've enjoyed our little chat,
but now it's your time to die.

953
01:33:45,332 --> 01:33:49,287
My little tracker.
I could...

954
01:33:50,332 --> 01:33:51,991
Hey, Mage!

955
01:33:52,032 --> 01:33:55,793
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

956
01:33:58,597 --> 01:34:00,153
Back for more?

957
01:34:00,197 --> 01:34:03,685
You really think you can
use that, you little burglar?

958
01:34:23,426 --> 01:34:24,982
Well, that's impossible.

959
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:28,015
Bring them down on him, Ridley!

960
01:34:28,059 --> 01:34:29,684
Destroy him!

961
01:34:52,254 --> 01:34:54,152
I won't become you.

962
01:35:00,853 --> 01:35:04,285
What have you done?

963
01:35:08,152 --> 01:35:11,515
Your Majesty.

964
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:18,349
It's over, Profion.

965
01:35:18,384 --> 01:35:21,747
The battle maybe, Your Majesty.

966
01:35:21,783 --> 01:35:23,476
Maybe...

967
01:35:25,582 --> 01:35:29,911
but not the war.

968
01:36:45,336 --> 01:36:46,563
Thank you.

969
01:37:15,597 --> 01:37:19,085
People of Izmer...

970
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:24,561
at long last, I do declare
that you are now all equal.

971
01:37:24,595 --> 01:37:27,390
Let the celebration begin.

972
01:37:43,259 --> 01:37:45,088
You hear that, buddy?

973
01:37:47,392 --> 01:37:49,119
That's for you.

974
01:37:50,892 --> 01:37:54,085
Nothing's going to be the same
without you.

975
01:37:56,557 --> 01:37:58,852
But I guess I'll
have to get used to that.

976
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:02,781
I just hope wherever you are...

977
01:38:04,689 --> 01:38:07,587
you know that you did
make a difference.

978
01:38:10,522 --> 01:38:12,078
You helped things change.

979
01:38:26,519 --> 01:38:29,814
You finally got it.

980
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:31,339
Your big score.

981
01:38:39,684 --> 01:38:41,047
I guess I'd better get going...

982
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:43,514
or I'm going to miss
my own knighting ceremony.

983
01:38:43,549 --> 01:38:45,481
Ridley the Savior.

984
01:38:45,516 --> 01:38:47,379
Can you believe it?

985
01:38:54,747 --> 01:38:56,474
