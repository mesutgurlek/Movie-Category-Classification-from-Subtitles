1
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
He's on the way, Mack.

2
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,600
- I'll drop him right in your lap.
- We're all set up.

3
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,440
Alex, everything by the book.
No stunts and no wrecks today, all right?

4
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,760
Oh, shit!

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,800
It's little things I'm trying to get used to.

6
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,120
Like, if I drop my napkin
out in a restaurant, Alex gives me his.

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,640
Car door needs opening, he opens it.
My neighbor's abusive? He yells at 'em.

8
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,280
The other night, we were watching a video,
he let me pick it out.

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
D-Do you want to slowly merge into...

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,320
- Signal first!

11
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,280
Too late. OK.

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,520
- That's good.
- All right.

13
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
My last boyfriend wasn't the romantic type.

14
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,000
Two years ago, for my birthday,
he gives me pepper spray.

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,440
I think it's perfume.
I end up in the emergency room.

16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,600
Relationships based on
extreme circumstances never work out.

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,560
Right.

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,720
- Right?
- No!

19
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Watch the glass!

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,640
Your boyfriend drive like this?

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,360
Oh, Alex? No. No, no, no.
Alex is so completely different.

22
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,720
He works... he works beach patrol.
He spends all day on a bicycle in Venice.

23
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,800
Shit.

24
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sure he's on the beach right now.

25
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,000
That's how we met, by the way.
I was jaywalking.

26
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,440
Jaywalking, huh?

27
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Well, jaywalking is a crime.

28
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Yeah, but I needed to get across
and at the point...

29
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,120
Dip!

30
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,120
Ow.

31
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,000
Another dip!

32
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,200
Oh! Aagh!

33
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,920
Two dips.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,520
- It's our seven-month anniversary tonight.

35
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,840
Neither of us has ever dated longer.

36
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,840
Why don't you slow down...

37
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,240
..and tell me your problem, huh? Good.

38
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,920
Uh, make a left here.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,600
Uh, turn, signal! Easy!

40
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,520
Shit!

41
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,280
Miss, pull over to the side, please.

42
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,040
Move over to the side, please!

43
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
- Side.
- I can't! There's a cliff!

44
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,440
On my command!

45
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,400
Shit!

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,200
Hold your fire, he's too far!
Everybody in the car!

47
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,920
You're under arrest.

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,520
You have the right to remain silent.

49
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,560
Ow. That hurt.

50
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,560
Pull over to the side.

51
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,480
- I can't!
- Stop right here.

52
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,200
This is absolutely not my fault, Mr Kenter.
I need my licence back.

53
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,760
Oh, my God.

54
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,040
What? What?

55
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,800
Stop! Stop!

56
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,200
You'll never drive in this town again.

57
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,800
Alex?

58
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,600
Annie.

59
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,800
What... What happened? What...?

60
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,800
- How'd the driving test go?
- Oh, it, uh...

61
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,320
Not good. Not good.

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,040
Um, why aren't you... at the beach?

63
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,520
You know, it's funny. There's this...

64
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,040
..perfectly...

65
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,920
- ..reasonable explanation...
- You're a madman, Shaw!

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,200
Nice working with you, as always.

67
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,960
They've apprehended
one of the suspects,...

68
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,840
..thanks mainly
to SWAT member Alex Shaw,...

69
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,800
..who was the officer injured
in today's chase.

70
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,960
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie about...

71
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,200
You never said
you were on the suicide squad.

72
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,800
You knew I was a cop. I said that I was...

73
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
Wait.

74
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,840
Oh, come on. Ow.

75
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,000
When I told you about Jack
and how he was always getting hurt,...

76
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,520
..and how I would never date
anybody like that again,...

77
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,200
..you didn't think, "Maybe I should tell her
what I do for a living"?

78
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,320
Exactly. And blow it?

79
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,200
- When were you gonna tell me ?
- Well, today.

80
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
Oh, today?

81
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,120
Yeah, today was the day.

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,400
You know what I pictured you doing
in Venice? I pictured you...

83
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,720
..busting teenage pickpockets,...

84
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,000
..walking old women across the street,
drinking lemonade.

85
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,240
I do fill in for a friend
at the beach occasionally.

86
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,320
And I often, often
enjoy a nice glass of lemonade.

87
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
You know what?
I feel I don't even know you.

88
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,720
I don't know who you are any more.
I don't understand.

89
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
We got to spend some time together,
then we'll get to know each other.

90
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,640
- Let's go away together.
- OK, where?

91
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
The Caribbean.

92
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,760
Oh, the Caribbean.
Do you have a concussion?

93
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,320
We work six days a week, Alex.

94
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,600
We've never even been away
for a... a weekend.

95
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,720
I was going to surprise you tonight,
but, uh...

96
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
It's a cruise.

97
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
This is so unfair, Alex.

98
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,080
You can't pull out tickets
to some exotic island...

99
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,760
..and think that'll make everything OK.

100
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,400
I don't expect that I can make it all right,
but, maybe I thought we could.

101
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
No. Don't do that.

102
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
I wanna be depressed.
I don't want you to do that.

103
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,760
Don't!

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,720
All right, all right.

105
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,920
- Don't.
- I won't.

106
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,720
Welcome to the Seabourn Legend.

107
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,360
Thank you. Welcome.

108
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,400
Oh, now, this is a cute couple.

109
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,240
How about a picture? Don't move!

110
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,400
- What are your names?
- Annie and Alex.

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,720
My name's Dante.

112
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
- A big smile for the newlyweds?
-Actually, we're not newlyweds.

113
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,080
Only $34.50 for a double set of mugs, and if
you don't like them, you get a photo credit.

114
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,120
Welcome to paradise,
and the name's Dante!

115
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,560
This ship has five passenger decks,...

116
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,520
..A, B, C, D, E.

117
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
You're on deck C.

118
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,160
There's a swimming pool,
a health spa, a beauty salon, a casino...

119
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,560
Hey. Excuse me.

120
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,720
Sir?

121
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm a little upset.
My golf clubs - have you found them?

122
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,800
Yes. They're downstairs in storage
and I'll bring them up...

123
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,800
..as soon as I get
this lovely couple to their cabin.

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,800
These are the coordinates
for the first leg, Captain.

125
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,560
Thank you.

126
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Thruster is in.

127
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,360
- All engines on stand-by.
- Let's take her out, then.

128
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
Welcome to your suite.

129
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,520
Believe me, you'll be sorry to leave room
6088, your happy and humble home.

130
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,560
If you need anything, you just call Ashton.

131
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,640
And let me thank you both
in advance for the generous gratuity...

132
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,440
..l know you'll be leaving me
at the end of this cruise.

133
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,080
- Just kidding.
- But not really.

134
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,280
Oh. And, you two, have a nice honeymoon.

135
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,920
Oh, we're... we're not...

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
..not married.

137
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Thank you.

138
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,160
Thank you.

139
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,760
- Big enough for you?
- Size doesn't matter. You know that.

140
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,920
Yes!

141
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,440
All of a sudden,
I have Love Boat fever.

142
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,920
It feels really good.

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
I am really excited
about being on a cruise ship.

144
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,160
I don't know why.

145
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,440
Maybe they pump drugs
through the air-conditioning system.

146
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,360
What do you think?

147
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,160
You know what I need?
Lots of those yummy little drinks...

148
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,760
..with those
highly impractical umbrellas in 'em.

149
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,600
That is what I need.

150
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,320
Yeah, you're looking good.

151
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,200
So, who's ready to party
on the big boat besides me?

152
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,760
You look tense.

153
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,640
Tense? No. We're here to relax.

154
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
- Let's get a drink.
- Let's go.

155
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,120
We're going to have a really good time.

156
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,960
Yeah!

157
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,560
Love it!

158
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,280
Thank you.

159
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
See you later. Bye.

160
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,560
So, what do you want to do?

161
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,440
Do you want to shuffleboard,
then room or... room, then shuffleboard?

162
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,960
Or hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm?

163
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,240
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

164
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,480
Room, room.

165
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,840
OK.

166
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,760
If it's all right with your new boyfriend
over there. Romeo.

167
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
His name's Geiger.

168
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,840
- Oh?
- Yes. Yes, we talked.

169
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,960
Not very interested in golf
for someone who had a fit about his clubs.

170
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
- Why do you say that?
- Well,...

171
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,040
..the tournament's on behind him.
He hasn't even glanced at the TV.

172
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,120
You're absolutely right. I think
we need to arrest him. Excuse me!

173
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

174
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,640
Aw, honey, you just wanted a hug.

175
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,120
You're so sweet.

176
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,360
I got to ask you to do me a favour,...

177
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,360
..something I've never
asked you to do before.

178
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,360
What's that?

179
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,800
- I need you to boogie with me.
- Oh, no, I don't boogie.

180
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,000
Just run in place. Run in place.

181
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,400
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, I think so.

182
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,560
Come on, baby.

183
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,120
Wake up, boys.

184
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,120
See, the misconception is that fat is bad.

185
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,320
In order to lose fat, you shouldn't eat fat.

186
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,040
Well, guess what, guys?

187
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,800
False. Your body's just a giant computer.

188
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,840
Mm. See, if you don't eat fat,...

189
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,760
..your body's mainframe goes, whoa!

190
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,680
Whoa!

191
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,560
Better keep whatever fat I've got.

192
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,760
So you see, we at Fatbusters...

193
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,760
..well, we say fat is your friend.

194
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,960
Oh, yeah, a good friend, yeah.

195
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,200
I could use a good friend.

196
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,040
Yeah? Here, meet this guy.

197
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,400
- Mmm.
- Good.

198
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,120
There you go.

199
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,960
Ladies and gentlemen,...

200
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,360
..l have a question.

201
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,400
Who here would like a peek...

202
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,800
..at a multimillion-dollar
jewellery collection?

203
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,040
OK. On board, we have the Diamond
Jewellers Of America with us tonight.

204
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,240
They would like to show you something.

205
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,560
Maybe we should get you a little something.

206
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
I'll take a Camel unfiltered.

207
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,640
Aren't you wearing the nicotine patch?

208
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,400
The only way that patch is gonna help me...

209
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,520
..is if I roll it and smoke it.

210
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,760
Good evening.

211
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,440
Big diamond.

212
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Don't bunny-hop.

213
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,040
That's impressive.

214
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,760
I wanted to learn another language.

215
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,320
Her name is Drew.

216
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,160
She wants to know if you're my sister.

217
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,960
Oh.

218
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,640
Let her down easy.

219
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,760
She says you're very beautiful and...

220
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
..our kids will be very beautiful.

221
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,520
Thank you.

222
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,560
Uh, can you picture me as a mum?

223
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,360
I think you'd make a beautiful mother.

224
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,640
Just, uh, don't drive the carpool.

225
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,960
Jeez. Kids... I don't know.

226
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,400
What, kids aren't on the menu?

227
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,960
Uh, kids are on the menu.

228
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
It just depends on who's ordering.

229
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,640
- I love it. It's beautiful.
- You're beautiful.

230
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,160
That'll make a great picture.
Hold on. Let me get this one.

231
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,840
- Look.
- Look.

232
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,520
So, can I order à la carte?

233
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,240
I don't know if you're sittin' in my section.

234
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,360
I requested this table.

235
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,320
Are you a good tipper?

236
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
Hmm. Depends on the service.

237
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,600
It's always service with a smile for you.

238
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,520
How about at every meal?

239
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,960
You getting serious right now?

240
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,720
Well,...

241
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,640
- Yeah, l...
- Wow.

242
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,040
I mean,...

243
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,280
..wow.

244
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,200
I just, you know, the other day,...

245
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,680
..l just found out I'm dating a daredevil,...

246
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
..so this is like, you know...

247
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,240
Oh, you're not serious.

248
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
You're not.

249
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,560
- Hello?
- Annie?

250
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,080
What?

251
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,240
I'm, uh, I'm a little seasick.

252
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,960
Huh? OK.

253
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,840
Let's go.

254
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,640
I'll get the main valve!

255
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

256
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
I'm sorry, sir. You can't be here right now.

257
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,640
I must be lost.

258
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,680
I saw the lights,
thought this was the casino.

259
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
Uh, sir, please don't touch those!

260
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,160
Sure could use a drink.

261
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,760
Any of you gambling men?

262
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,560
- Uh!
- Sir!

263
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,680
Help the gentleman up, please.

264
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,960
OK, sir, come on.

265
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,360
Let's get him up.

266
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,360
Sir, may we assist you
to help find your cabin?

267
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,960
Oh, no. I know where it is.

268
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,560
I... I know when I'm not wanted.

269
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,760
You guys just...

270
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,920
..watch where you're going.

271
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,760
We'll do just that.

272
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,840
Goodnight, sir.

273
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,320
Listen, let's get you back to your room.

274
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Goodnight.

275
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Satellite looks good, sir.

276
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,040
We should have
smooth sailing for the rest of the night.

277
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,560
OK, switch us back to autopilot.

278
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,800
Switching over now, sir.

279
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,960
That's right.

280
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,760
Switch us over.

281
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,160
You never let me have any fun.

282
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,640
No fun? You have all the fun in the world.

283
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
We have fun together, don't we?

284
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,600
Whenever you want something,
I buy it for you automatically.

285
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,080
I take you to concerts, museums, movies.

286
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,560
I do all the housework.

287
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,840
Who does the tidying up? I do.

288
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,560
Who does the cooking? I do.

289
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,080
You and I, we have lots of fun.

290
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,840
Don't we, Lolita?

291
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,800
Come here.

292
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,120
Time for group therapy, boys.

293
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,440
Oh. I wouldn't trade you...

294
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,320
..for all the doctors in the world.

295
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,440
Mmm...

296
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,240
..you take care of me,...

297
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,440
..I'll take care of the ship.

298
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Mm!

299
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,360
Alex?

300
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,240
Annie, Annie.

301
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,440
I've been looking all over the ship for you.

302
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,480
Maybe you should have looked in bed,
where you left me.

303
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,760
You looked so beautiful, I didn't, uh...

304
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,160
..want to wake you up.

305
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,760
Yeah, beautiful woman in bed, naked -

306
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,440
..you had to leave. I get that.

307
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,760
So where were you?

308
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,440
- Skeet shooting.
- Skeet shooting?

309
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,640
You went skeet shooting, but you couldn't...

310
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,680
Is that our song?

311
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,360
..take one day not to go shooting?

312
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,960
I wish they'd play that over and over again.

313
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,240
I need a little fresh air...

314
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,000
..after an evening tied as one
of the most embarrassing of my adult life.

315
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,160
Oh... if you want me to be honest,...

316
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,360
..l kind of like the fact that you got sick.

317
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,960
Well,...

318
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,080
..don't quite know how to respond to that.

319
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,840
Well, all I'm saying is
that I just like taking care of you, that's all.

320
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,080
And what I said when
you were joking about that kid thing...

321
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,480
..for a second,
I thought you were completely serious.

322
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,680
I thought
you were actually gonna ask, you know...

323
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,800
..and last night,
when you were basically blacked out,...

324
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,080
..l was like, he's a cop, and...

325
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,240
..you don't even know his cop number.

326
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,120
My badge number?

327
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,840
Badge number, see?

328
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't even know what it's called.

329
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,960
What does my badge number
have to do with anything?

330
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,640
Well, the point is...
is that if you look at it,...

331
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,000
..we basically don't...
don't even know each other.

332
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,360
And...

333
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,520
Um...

334
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,840
To get that serious and...

335
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,640
..to make that kind of commitment,
I mean,...

336
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,040
..it's probably the last thing that,...

337
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,440
..that we both need right now, right?

338
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,920
Yeah.

339
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,960
Attention.

340
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,840
If you would like to reserve water-skis,...

341
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,440
..paddle boats, jetskis,
or wave runners for use...

342
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,560
..while we're docked
at one of our upcoming ports...

343
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,560
Did you feel
we were underdressed last night?

344
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,440
What's this?

345
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,240
Excuse me. I do believe
I had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.

346
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,160
Actually, it was Make Up Room, Please.

347
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,600
Maybe... maybe you flipped the card.

348
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,920
Maybe I flipped the card.

349
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,040
Let's not split hairs.

350
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,280
Captain on the bridge.

351
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,840
What's wrong, Merced?

352
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,240
I'm late for my guests.

353
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,480
Uh, yeah, I can't explain it, sir.

354
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,040
We're four degrees off course.

355
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,400
Well, switch us back to manual, then.

356
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,920
We tried, sir. The autopilot won't go down.

357
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,200
Well, try again.

358
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,840
I did.
I sent an engineer to check the mainframe.

359
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,160
It's all normal.

360
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,280
I sent Eric to run a mainframe diagnostic.

361
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,440
Everything seems normal.

362
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,680
Human error.

363
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,360
Must be human error.

364
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,160
Keep an eye on it.

365
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,520
Yes, sir.

366
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,880
They were out of size 10s.

367
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,240
You know,
I told them size didn't matter, but, uh...

368
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,520
..they wouldn't give them to me.

369
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,920
- One more thing.
- What?

370
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,440
I'd like to boogie with you.

371
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
We're still four degrees off course.

372
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,320
Did you check the mainframe, Eric?

373
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,040
Captain Pollard, good evening.

374
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,000
How can you be running the ship...

375
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,560
..if you're not on the bridge?

376
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,520
Who is running the ship?

377
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,200
Oh, yeah. I am.

378
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,960
What is this? Who are you?

379
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,000
I spent a great many years
developing computer systems...

380
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
..for these cruise liners,
including this baby.

381
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,760
And then I got pushed away!

382
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,360
What are you talking about?

383
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,560
That's what really infuriates me.

384
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,400
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

385
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,960
How dare you!

386
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,560
Traditionally speaking,...

387
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,240
..isn't it true
the captain goes down with the ship?

388
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,920
Aagh!

389
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,240
- I got one more. Stand right here.
- Oh, OK.

390
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,640
- This is good.
- OK.

391
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,080
Captain, sweetheart, would you mind
taking a picture with my sister and me?

392
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,240
No. Not at all.

393
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,480
Get in the middle.

394
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,520
Right here. OK.

395
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,080
Say Dallas.

396
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,280
Dallas.

397
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,280
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

398
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,880
Nice tropical shower.

399
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,480
Water's gonna be beautiful tonight, ladies.

400
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,440
Good evening.

401
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,360
No, I'm sorry.

402
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,240
Without a jacket,...

403
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,640
..that dress is not appropriate.

404
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,160
Daddy's right.

405
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,960
I like this dress, and it's fine.

406
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,280
No, no, no.

407
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,360
You look like a clown.

408
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,760
No, I don't.

409
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, she's fine.

410
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,840
Let her go.

411
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,720
She'll be back.

412
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,520
Ready,...

413
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
..now.

414
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
What the hell is going on?

415
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,440
I don't know, sir.

416
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,840
Where's the chief engineer?

417
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,160
This almost seems too perfect, doesn't it?

418
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,360
Want me to step on your feet?

419
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,760
You already did.

420
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Oh. I meant again.

421
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,040
Hurry.

422
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,760
You know, I left you alone this morning
because I needed to be alone to think.

423
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,160
Yeah.

424
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,040
See, the one thing that's got me
through everything in my life,...

425
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,960
..the one thing I could always trust,...

426
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,280
..has been my instinct.

427
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,920
It has never been more certain
than it is now.

428
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,040
Really?

429
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,560
Yeah.

430
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,360
What are you saying?

431
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,760
What I'm saying is, uh...

432
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,560
..l think that we should...

433
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,160
Oh, man, no. No, no, no, no.

434
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,720
Come on, keep dancing.
Keep dancing. Come on.

435
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,160
Hold up. Hold on.

436
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,600
Jesus Christ! The main pumps are off!

437
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,160
She ain't pumping out!

438
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,440
Shut down engines three and four!

439
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,840
Get out of here!

440
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Sir!

441
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
Look, they're not gonna hold.

442
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,400
Sir.

443
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,080
- Find the captain, will you?
- Yes, sir.

444
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,960
Harvey, it's an earthquake!

445
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,680
It can't be! We're at sea!

446
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,840
Aagh!

447
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,520
Ooh! Oh!

448
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,760
Look out!

449
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,280
Watch it!

450
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,680
No!

451
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,160
This is my vacation! Damn it!

452
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,840
I had nothing to do with this.

453
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,080
It's not working!

454
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,800
It's all right, it's all right.

455
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,760
It's over. It's over.

456
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,640
Ladies and gentleman,...

457
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,400
..I'm Liza, your cruise director.

458
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,000
Uh, this is only a minor incident.

459
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,000
Everything will be back to normal
in a few moments.

460
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,560
Why do I really not believe her right now?

461
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,160
Terminal malfunction, structural trauma.

462
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,920
Take a look at these monitors.

463
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,760
We're losing power all over the ship.

464
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,800
I want all emergency teams in position.

465
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,760
Get the coastguard on the line.

466
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,160
I don't care!

467
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,040
Put me onto engine control!

468
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,440
It's dead.

469
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,400
Try the low frequencies.

470
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,040
The signal's gone. I've got nothing.

471
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,640
Engine three's down, sir.
Can we do anything?

472
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,560
Try and run a link to the engine room.

473
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,000
Joe,
issue hand-held radios to all the crew.

474
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,000
And, please, somebody find the captain!

475
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,960
Keep trying.

476
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,680
The system's not responding.

477
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,960
- Yes?
- Mr Juliano.

478
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,000
Looks like
the Seabourn Legend isn't fairing too well.

479
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,360
I advise you
to start the evacuation procedure.

480
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,880
Who is this?

481
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,160
Someone you should start listening to.

482
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,040
I want you to sound the alarm immediately.

483
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,400
Time is running out.

484
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,800
I can't do that. Only the captain can.

485
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,400
The captain is dead, Mr Juliano,...

486
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,360
..which means you're now responsible
for the people on this ship.

487
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,720
Don't waste time radioing the coastguard
or code in an SOS.

488
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,600
I've cut off all outside communication.

489
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,960
You don't understand.
Maritime regulations state that...

490
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,240
Mr Juliano,
you are in command of this vessel.

491
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
The authority is yours.

492
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,840
I'll make it easy on you, Mr Juliano.

493
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,680
I'd like you to look at
the emergency fire display.

494
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,360
Look at the portside,...

495
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,760
..C deck, section 686 on your display.

496
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,920
What the hell do you think you're doing?

497
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,080
My God.

498
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,040
Oops.

499
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,960
See what you made me do?

500
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,360
OK, just wait a minute. Please.

501
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,840
And now
the forward section on the A deck...

502
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,760
..on both sides of the bow thrusters.

503
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,240
Also look at deck sections 187 and 188.

504
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,240
Sir?

505
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,840
All the fires are contained
by fire doors, which I control...

506
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,800
..and will open if necessary.

507
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
I've positioned charges throughout the ship...

508
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,560
..and will set them off without hesitation.

509
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,720
Sir, I think you should push the button.

510
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,240
How am I supposed to abandon
the ship while it's moving?

511
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,360
The ship will stop in exactly three minutes.

512
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,120
I give you 15 minutes to evacuate.

513
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,240
Now sound the alarm...

514
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
..or I'll burn her down.

515
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,640
Sir,
I really think you should push the button.

516
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,800
Attention. Attention, please.

517
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,040
This is the First Officer.

518
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,600
All passengers and crew,
proceed to the muster deck.

519
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,960
The Seabourn Legend
is to be immediately evacuated.

520
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,840
This is not a drill.

521
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,240
I repeat, this is not a drill.

522
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,160
Abandon ship for this?

523
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,560
Does that make any sense?

524
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,080
Let's go. Come on.

525
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,040
Everyone through the rear door!

526
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,480
- We've got to find Drew.
- We'll find her, sweetheart.

527
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,960
- She can't hear this!
- I know. We'll find her.

528
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,240
No. No, Frank.

529
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,480
No, I have a feeling about this.
Come on.

530
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,840
Outside, to the muster deck.

531
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,280
Let's go. Follow me.

532
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Yes, please keep moving.

533
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,560
- Sulphur.
- What?

534
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,840
- You smell sulphur?
- What do you mean?

535
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,640
Sulphur out of that vent.

536
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,840
I swear I am never leaving the house again.

537
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,560
Calmly go
immediately to the lifeboat stations.

538
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,240
All hands evacuate.

539
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,640
Engineers and electricians,...

540
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,200
..abandon your posts...

541
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,160
..and assist passengers
at your lifeboat assignment.

542
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,240
This way, ladies and gentlemen!

543
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,240
Please hurry! Please hurry!

544
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,080
Everybody, hang on!

545
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,560
Go!

546
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,240
Hey, no!

547
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,280
No! The doors!

548
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Let me out!

549
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,560
This door won't open!

550
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,560
Let me in there!

551
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,840
Come on.

552
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,440
This way. Quickly.

553
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,960
Ask him, Rupert, ask him!

554
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,840
Look,
I've got to speak to someone in charge!

555
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,240
He's loading the lifeboats.

556
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,200
You're gonna miss them if we don't hurry.

557
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,320
Mum!

558
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,440
Ugh!

559
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,760
Oh, God.

560
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,760
Push away from the ship!

561
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,960
You know what?
I wanna chase something down.

562
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,240
What are you doing?

563
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,840
It seems odd.

564
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,640
They're abandoning ship
in the middle of night.

565
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,040
I'll be right back. Go. Follow the crew.

566
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,360
Uh, no. Alex!

567
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,280
Follow the crew. I'll be right back.

568
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,920
No! Jeez!

569
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,680
Watch your step, ma'am.

570
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,720
Please, please stay seated.

571
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,240
Sorry. Sorry.

572
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,680
Watch your step!

573
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,000
This way!

574
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,400
Huh?

575
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,360
Christ. He's locked us out.

576
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,880
Sir, get yourself to a lifeboat!

577
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,800
Take it easy, man. I'm LAPD.

578
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,440
What? You're what?

579
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,160
What is that?

580
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,560
Have any of these fires been confirmed?

581
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,440
We're loading the lifeboats, sir.

582
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,760
Do you need more confirmation than that?

583
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,920
Yeah.

584
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,880
Last boat! Everybody goes right now!

585
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,840
Everybody, into the boat!

586
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,280
That way, folks! Quickly!

587
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
Come on, come on.

588
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,840
Drew.

589
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,440
Help us, somebody!

590
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,160
Drew wasn't in the room.

591
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,440
Celeste, we have looked everywhere!

592
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,160
You guys,
she's probably on another lifeboat.

593
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,440
But we can't leave without her!

594
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,560
Come on.

595
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,600
I'm sure she's fine.

596
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,960
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

597
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,760
Celeste, there isn't time.
Drew's gotten on another boat.

598
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Who's the officer?

599
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,760
I wanna see my sister!

600
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,960
Go, go, go, go!

601
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
Alex, come on! It's the last boat!

602
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,960
Come on, sir, we gotta move!

603
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
Move it! Quickly!

604
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,760
- Did you find Drew?
- She's not on the boat.

605
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,640
Did someone run a count?

606
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,640
She's probably on another boat, sir.

607
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,840
Now, just get on, OK?

608
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,800
About these fires. Something's strange.

609
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,400
Your board's lit up.
This is sulphur-based smoke.

610
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,440
- It makes no sense.
- Alex, come on.

611
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,080
I can only lower the boat
when the ship isn't moving.

612
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,560
I've got no time left,...

613
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,440
..and I don't know
what this guy is capable of!

614
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,280
What guy? What guy?!

615
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,480
We're on our way.

616
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,920
Oh, my God! The boat is moving!

617
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,040
What is happening?

618
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,040
Annie, jump!

619
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,440
We have to bring it back up!

620
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,640
Hold on to the rails!

621
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,680
Ensign, what's going on?

622
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,440
The winch must be jammed!

623
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
We gotta stop the ship!

624
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,960
I don't have any control!
Now get out of the way!

625
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,960
What..? What...?

626
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,280
What are you doing?

627
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,760
That cable will never hold,...

628
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,640
..and we've got to get them out.

629
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,080
What do you mean, we? Alex?

630
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,960
- OK.
- You got it?

631
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,520
Be careful.

632
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,840
I'll be right back.

633
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,480
OK.

634
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,880
What the hell is he doing?!

635
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,120
He said he'd be right back!

636
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,560
We better get that end back up!

637
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,640
If it hits the water on that angle,...

638
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
..it'll collapse!

639
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,640
Don't move!

640
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,800
Please!

641
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,840
Please pull us up!

642
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,160
We're trying.

643
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,440
Stay calm and keep the weight balanced.

644
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,680
We'll bring you up one by one.

645
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,360
She's still there!

646
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,240
I know she's still on the ship!

647
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,680
Celeste, where are you going?!

648
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,640
No, no, no! Don't climb out!

649
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,640
Don't... Don't move!

650
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,920
It'll fall!

651
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,280
Oh.

652
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,600
Throw me a rope! I need to attach...

653
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,160
Oh, sweetheart, it's not your fault.

654
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,640
OK. Oh, here. OK.

655
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,360
Watch out!

656
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,040
Now, get the rope! Grab the rope!

657
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,560
I'll get it!

658
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,640
Careful!

659
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,640
I got the rope!

660
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,640
Tie it up to the hull!

661
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,240
Pull the slack!

662
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,760
Be careful!

663
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,120
OK!

664
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,960
Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

665
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,240
Whoa! Whoa!

666
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,960
Hold on! Pull them up!

667
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,640
Whoa!

668
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,600
Aagh!

669
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,040
Help!

670
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,000
Alex! Alex!

671
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,920
Dante!

672
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,640
Help! Help!

673
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,040
Help! Help!

674
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,440
Oh! Help!

675
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,640
Help!

676
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,760
Come on.

677
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,960
Pull me up, please! Pull!

678
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,480
Alex! God. Yes, you are nuts.

679
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,840
- Come on. Pull me up.
- I got you.

680
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
Please pull!

681
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,840
Get another line!

682
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,360
Quickly! Get another line!

683
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,960
There has to be something else!

684
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,440
The gangplank! Get the gangplank!

685
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,840
Alex. Alex, Alex.

686
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,760
Hi, uh...

687
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,360
Get everybody on here if you can.

688
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,480
OK.

689
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,440
OK. Thanks, man.

690
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,040
Thank you. OK, thanks.

691
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,120
OK.

692
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,760
Thank you.

693
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,360
That's the last one, sir.

694
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,640
Officer, it's Merced.

695
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,800
- Yes?

696
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,040
We have a situation on the bridge.

697
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,960
I bet we do!

698
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,400
Keep everybody together, Rudy.

699
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,840
I'll be on the bridge.

700
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,960
Stay with the passengers.

701
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,840
It's the radar.

702
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,120
First I thought this was a heavy fog bank,
but it's not moving.

703
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,200
Saint Martin.

704
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,920
Well, there is a harbour on Saint Martin.

705
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,880
He must be stopping us on the island.

706
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,360
What's the heading?

707
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,400
It is full at southeast 165.

708
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,080
You think that's where he's taking us?

709
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,800
You think that's the harbour?

710
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,680
He's taking us to the cliffs
next to the harbour.

711
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,880
He's gonna slam us into a wall.

712
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,760
How long before we hit?

713
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,680
Sir, get back with the other passengers.

714
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,160
How much time have we got?

715
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,080
I'm the first officer on this ship, OK,...

716
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,120
..and you're...

717
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,880
You've lost control of autopilot,
so there's got to be a hard wire link.

718
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,360
Yes, that's exactly right, sir.

719
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,520
But he's running it all by remote,
and there's nothing you can do.

720
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,720
We gotta find the transmitter.

721
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,800
So how's he transmitting the fires?!

722
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,000
The fires don't exist. They're not real.

723
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,960
Smoke canisters. Stun grenades.

724
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,400
Probably put them in the air ducts.

725
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,720
They're small.

726
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,360
They roll,...

727
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,720
..like...

728
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,040
..these.

729
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,880
Golf balls.

730
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,360
Golf balls, golf balls.

731
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,160
Geiger. Let's go get him right now.

732
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,080
Get his cabin number.
We'll get him. I'll get him.

733
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,000
We're locked out.

734
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,120
Where are the skeet guns?

735
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,560
Right here.

736
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,160
- Ow.

737
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,880
Aagh!

738
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,800
Why's everyone trying to kill me?!

739
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,320
What happened? Are you OK?

740
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,280
Ow. Ow.

741
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,880
Stay down, stay down.

742
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,200
You're OK.

743
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,000
I can't override it.
He's changed all the access codes.

744
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,720
We have a very sick boy.

745
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,680
Exactly.

746
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,960
Do you think I'd be doing this,
if I still had my health?

747
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,480
It ends now.

748
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,120
I know who you are.

749
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,280
I know you, too.

750
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,160
You look a little wet.

751
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,960
You see, Alex,...

752
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,880
..l designed this whole autopilot system.

753
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,280
My company sold it off to almost
every shipping line in the world,...

754
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,960
..but when I got sick, they fired me.

755
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,160
I had no defence. They just threw me away.

756
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,840
But now I have
a more aggressive defence system.

757
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,560
Tell me, Alex,...

758
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,480
..did you ever have
a false sense of security?

759
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,960
Aagh!

760
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,720
Everybody, to the deck!

761
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,000
Go! Go! Go!

762
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,000
Nothing's secure, Alex.

763
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,400
That was odd.

764
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,080
You call that odd?
What kind of cop are you?

765
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,480
You're gonna get us all killed!

766
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,160
No, that's his plan.

767
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,160
Where's engine control?

768
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,560
What? Engine control?

769
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,080
We're gonna stop the ship,
then we're gonna get him.

770
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,360
I want you on the upper deck
with the other passengers!

771
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,880
Fine! I'll find it on my own!

772
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,960
Merced, go with him!

773
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,880
Sir, he's highly irrational.

774
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,800
You're an officer on this ship.

775
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,280
Now, make sure he doesn't touch a thing!

776
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,600
Ashton, you OK? Come on, get up.

777
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,080
Keep it moving.

778
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,720
Annie. They won't organize a search,...

779
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,760
..but I know Drew didn't get away.

780
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,680
She's got to be here somewhere!

781
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,560
- They'll find her.
- Just keep it moving.

782
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,080
This way!

783
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,880
Hello, miss. This way.

784
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,880
Dante, stop it.
Do you hear that? Listen.

785
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,680
Yeah,
I hear something coming from down there.

786
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,200
Where? Show me. Come on.

787
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,640
- Harder!

788
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,680
Can anybody hear?! Hello!

789
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,360
Alejandro, I don't like this.

790
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,960
I really don't like this.

791
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,880
It's coming from down here somewhere.

792
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,640
Anyone!

793
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,480
Hello!

794
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,800
Is anybody in there?!

795
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,360
Yes!

796
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,760
Yes, we're trapped!

797
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,160
Get us the hell out of here!

798
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,120
We're trying!

799
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,480
Is there a little girl in there? Drew?

800
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,680
No! Just big women!

801
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,920
Excuse me!

802
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,680
I mean, normal-sized women!
Come on, get us out of here!

803
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,000
Oh, my God,
there's smoke coming out of the vent!

804
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,480
Everybody get back!

805
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,360
It's coming out everywhere!

806
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,360
Ow. We're trying.

807
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,200
Try to block the vent!

808
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,440
Don't worry. We'll get you out!

809
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,080
What are you doing?

810
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,880
They told us to block the vents.

811
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,800
She's right.

812
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,400
I'll help you, lady.

813
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,880
Alejandro, qué pasa?

814
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,400
This smoke's gonna kill us off.

815
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,880
Everybody just hang on!

816
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,280
We'll get you out in a second!

817
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,760
Help me, Harvey!

818
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,800
I'm trying to save your life!

819
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,280
Just hang on!

820
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,720
OK. What is this?

821
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,960
Try that.

822
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,600
- This... this won't work.
- Just try it. I'll find something else.

823
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,160
I told you this won't work!

824
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,080
It's coming out everywhere.
Harv, give me your pants!

825
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,400
My pants?!
No-one else is taking off their pants.

826
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,600
I took off mine.

827
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,280
Why hasn't she taken anything off yet?

828
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,000
Cos I'm not wearing any underwear,
Harvey.

829
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,560
Oh.

830
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,720
I can't breathe.

831
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,680
Come on, hurry up!

832
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,000
Come on!

833
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,360
What do we have?

834
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,560
Yeah, this'll do.

835
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,960
This will do.

836
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,120
Did you try
to close the fuel tanks manually?

837
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,760
Yeah, but he's sealed off
all access to engine room four.

838
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,480
Which of these controls the autopilot?

839
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,360
I don't know. I'm the navigator.

840
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,280
I'm not familiar with this equipment.

841
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,680
Oh, you're not familiar?

842
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,760
I see.

843
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,360
Are you, uh...

844
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,880
..familiar with this?

845
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,320
Sir, this is Merced in engine control!

846
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,360
He's smashing up all the equipment!

847
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,880
Do you copy?

848
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,920
Which of these
is not hooked up to the computer?

849
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,360
There's plenty
not hooked up to the computer...

850
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,280
..but nothing that overrides his programme.

851
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,200
Then we have to fool his programme.

852
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,520
We cannot stop the ship.

853
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,160
I wanna slow it down.

854
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,680
What you gonna do now?

855
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,080
You gonna let the air out of our tyres?

856
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,200
- What are these switches?
- Don't you touch them!

857
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,200
They open the ballast doors!
You wanna flood the ship?!

858
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,520
Sir, this is Merced! Does anybody copy?

859
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,960
Hello? Somebody answer me!

860
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,600
We're gonna flood the ship like you said.

861
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,480
What are you talking about?

862
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,880
Might slow her down.

863
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,800
Right, you shut up! You shut your mouth!

864
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,280
I never said that!

865
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,160
If we take on too much water,...

866
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,080
..we'll all go down.

867
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,440
Sir! Somebody answer me!

868
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,800
Listen...

869
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,360
Flood it.

870
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,480
It's not working!

871
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,680
Will you hurry up?!

872
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,120
Wait. Dante, I think I've got something.

873
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,280
Whoa.

874
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,880
Everybody, back off!

875
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,480
Hurry up! Hurry up!

876
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,760
Yeah, we found the key.

877
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,600
What?

878
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,360
OK, OK.

879
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,320
Kick. Can you kick it?

880
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,080
Look out!

881
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,480
- Aagh!

882
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,960
Can you get out?

883
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,280
Can you guys get out?

884
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,960
If you'll back off with the saw.

885
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,960
What?!

886
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,320
If you'll back off with the saw,
we'll give it a try!

887
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,160
Oh, sorry! I'm sorry. Sorry.

888
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,680
How much longer?

889
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,560
I've never let a million gallons of water
into a ship before.

890
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,960
Give me a second.

891
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,200
I've got three watertight doors to close...

892
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,240
..and I've got to shut off
these sensors as well.

893
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,480
Where's this?

894
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,920
That's the ballast room.

895
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,160
That's right underneath us.

896
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,520
That's what we're flooding.

897
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,680
All right, watertight doors are closed.

898
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,480
Ballast doors should open any minute.

899
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,480
Shit!

900
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,400
Close it! Close it!

901
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,720
You just told me to open them!

902
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,360
Follow me.

903
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,160
I can't close it just like that.

904
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,800
Don't let go of me!

905
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,680
Hold on! Hold on!

906
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,240
I'll... I'll hold on.

907
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,560
You OK?

908
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,160
You're gonna be fine.

909
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,440
Hmm. Huh?

910
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,280
In case anything happens...

911
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,120
..to us,...

912
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,120
..you want me to know that...

913
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,880
..you... you...

914
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,400
..love me...

915
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,640
..and that you're gonna be 15 next month.

916
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,960
Relationships
based on extreme circumstances,...

917
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,040
..they rarely work out.

918
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,280
This way, everybody!

919
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,080
What's going on?
Why has the evacuation stopped?

920
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,600
Stopped? We didn't even start.

921
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,120
Are we sinking? Are we gonna die?

922
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,920
- The important thing is to stay calm.
- You don't even work here!

923
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,880
I've been in worse situations than this
and panicking does not help.

924
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,600
We have our life vests.
We can jump off the ship.

925
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,000
You'd get sucked into the propellers.

926
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,640
Yeah, that would suck.

927
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,560
Alex.

928
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,280
Oh, my God. Drew.

929
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,360
Where you been, huh?

930
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,080
- Is she OK?
- We'll find your mum.

931
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,080
She all right?

932
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,000
Yeah.

933
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,320
Come on, sweetheart.

934
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,280
You OK?

935
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,800
Yeah, I'm fine. What's happening?

936
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,280
Why did the ship start up again?

937
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,160
Why... why did you leave me upstairs?

938
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,920
We have a situation.

939
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,120
I know we have a situation. What?

940
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,800
Geiger's taken over the ship.

941
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,680
Geiger.
I'm-not-looking-at-my-golf-game Geiger?

942
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,080
No, Geiger I'm-a-computer-psycho,
Geiger l-designed-all-the-software,...

943
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,920
..and Geiger l-can-blow-up-everything.

944
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,400
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

945
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,080
- Where is he?
- He's everywhere. Come up here.

946
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,080
That's him.

947
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,480
What?

948
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,320
Go up to the top deck with everyone.

949
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,200
You stay. You stay, and you wait.

950
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,880
Hey, you don't have to save this ship.

951
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,520
Freeze!

952
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,560
Drop the weapon.

953
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,520
Don't shoot.

954
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,280
It's not a gun, it's just a computer.

955
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,680
Drop it, asshole.

956
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,680
Where's your friend Annie?

957
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,720
She's cute.

958
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,720
It would be a shame
if anything happened to her.

959
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,120
Hit the floor now!

960
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,120
I was just trying to make conversation.

961
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,960
I'm putting it down now...

962
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,840
..real slow.

963
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,520
The irony of my situation, Alex,...

964
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,080
..is that dedication to job...

965
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,000
..and devotion to the company...

966
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,280
..was repaid with a terminal illness.

967
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,080
You see, computers
generate electromagnetic fields...

968
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,560
..which, over time,...

969
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,520
..can cause severe copper poisoning.

970
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,360
I'm a smart guy, Alex,...

971
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,760
..and even I didn't know that.

972
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,000
I would have really appreciated...

973
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,560
..some understanding
from upper management.

974
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,520
OK, is everybody OK?

975
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,480
We're fine.

976
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,160
But, no. They dropped me.

977
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,760
They treated me like I never existed.

978
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,960
Where are you going?

979
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,400
I'll go find him.

980
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,160
Hang on. Wait!

981
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,760
Now, I just gotta do whatever I can...

982
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,760
..to get whatever I can get.

983
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,120
You're not gonna stop me.

984
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,240
This time it's goodbye for good, Alex.

985
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,920
How you gonna stop me now, my friend?

986
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,840
Damn it.

987
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,160
Damn.

988
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,760
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

989
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,480
I've heard that music before.

990
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,360
They pipe it in all over the ship.

991
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,480
No, no, no. I've heard this music before.

992
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,960
Ship-shopping music. He's in the mall.

993
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,680
There's a fire in there.

994
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,680
Well, don't worry.

995
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,440
The flames can't get past the fire doors.

996
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,200
Alex.

997
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,160
Alex, Alex.

998
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,280
Don't touch that!

999
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,760
OK, um, I need a... I need a...

1000
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,280
I need my saw.

1001
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,280
Alex! Alex!

1002
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,200
Alex! Oh, God.

1003
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,720
Don't touch anything. Don't touch anything!

1004
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,320
I know where to release the fire doors.

1005
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,080
Don't open the door. It's a trap.

1006
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,080
There's something in the door.

1007
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,600
Baby, we can't get in to you.

1008
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,120
There's something in the door.

1009
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,960
What does it look like?

1010
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,400
Wait. What does is look like?

1011
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,880
OK, it's green,...

1012
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,760
..like a spray deodorant can.

1013
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,880
I don't know. Can't think.

1014
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,800
OK. It's a grenade.

1015
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,880
What?

1016
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,160
There's a number on it.

1017
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,120
There should be a number on it.

1018
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,320
Uh, OK, yeah. It's um... L-1619...

1019
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,760
..uh... Magnum.

1020
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,760
- Is the pin out?
- What?

1021
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,920
Is the pin out?!

1022
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,960
No, the pin's still in,
but it's attached to a wire.

1023
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,200
Yeah.

1024
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,960
Tie the spoon to the grenade.

1025
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,960
Spoon? What?

1026
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,360
With a string.

1027
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,760
Oh, baby, don't say grenade.

1028
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,720
OK. A string.

1029
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,800
Uh...

1030
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,200
..your shoelace! Come on.

1031
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,680
I got it.

1032
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,600
That's it.

1033
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,760
OK, all right.

1034
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,720
OK.

1035
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,000
OK, be real careful.

1036
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,200
All right. Here it goes.

1037
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,160
Uh...

1038
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,600
..you gotta hurry up.

1039
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,800
- OK, OK.

1040
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,520
Got it. Got it.

1041
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,800
Got it. What now?

1042
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,280
Pull the pin out...

1043
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,960
..and remove the grenade.

1044
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,880
Um, uh...

1045
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,360
You pull out the pin,...

1046
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,720
..and I will pull out the grenade.

1047
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,000
OK. Counting. One,...

1048
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,160
..two...

1049
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,360
..three.

1050
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,760
- Whoa!
- Aagh!

1051
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,360
Where is it?

1052
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,360
Where is it? Where is it?!

1053
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,760
It's in your hand.

1054
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,000
Huh?! Take it out. Take it out!

1055
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,360
Take it out. Take it out. Got it? Take it.

1056
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,520
I got it.

1057
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,680
OK, got it?

1058
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,760
Alex!

1059
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,280
Uh, you can open the door now.

1060
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,440
OK.

1061
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,240
No.

1062
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,160
Here's some more dry towels.

1063
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,880
Thank you.

1064
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,400
I am so sorry I yelled at you.

1065
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,880
That's OK, Dad.

1066
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,600
I'm OK.

1067
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,080
OK.

1068
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,880
Where's Alex?

1069
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,400
"Where's Alex?"

1070
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,240
Come over here.

1071
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,400
Just sit down. Don't talk. Don't move.

1072
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,720
- I'm OK.
- You're not OK.

1073
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,360
Stop saying that, all right?

1074
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,880
Are you OK?

1075
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,080
I don't think so.

1076
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,520
What?

1077
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,960
He's adjusting starboard.

1078
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,920
What does that mean?

1079
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,360
Does that mean right, left,
round the island?

1080
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,200
No. Right into the island.

1081
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,600
We're moving again.

1082
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,080
He's turning us half a degree starboard.

1083
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,880
Come on, guys. We're getting closer.

1084
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,560
OK, I'm cutting the serial port connection.

1085
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,520
Anything?

1086
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,160
No, we're still locked out.

1087
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,040
Come on.

1088
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,960
Hey, we're moving.

1089
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,480
We have control again.

1090
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,680
No, we're still dead here.

1091
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,480
Are you sure, sir, because we're turning.

1092
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,360
It's him.

1093
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,960
It's him, it's him.

1094
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,480
He's onboard. Geiger's still onboard.

1095
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,360
Guys, maybe these people can help.

1096
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,480
Hand me those.

1097
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,360
Right there.

1098
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,080
He's taking us right into an oil tanker.

1099
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,160
What?

1100
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,480
You're right.

1101
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,920
She's anchored 16 miles out,...

1102
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,360
..and we are doing 17.8 knots.

1103
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,920
Well, how long till they move?

1104
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,400
From starting their engines, 30 minutes.

1105
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,200
They won't get out of our way in time.

1106
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,080
So, what... what... what does that mean?

1107
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,120
Oh, man!

1108
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,600
Uh, he's turning us another quarter.

1109
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,960
Agh! Damn it.

1110
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,000
Can we turn the ship without the rudder?

1111
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,960
The bow thrusters would do it.

1112
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,320
We can't get there now.

1113
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,080
You guys flooded the access.

1114
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,800
We also messed up his programme, sir.

1115
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,880
No, you almost sunk us.

1116
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,880
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

1117
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,280
Let's take a wrench
and dump it into the engine...

1118
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,160
..and bust the transmission like a car,...

1119
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,720
..cos I've done that.

1120
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,920
With all due respect, this is not your car.

1121
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,280
This is a cruise liner.

1122
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,280
She's right. It's a propeller.

1123
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,800
We got to stop the propeller.

1124
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,200
You could wedge something into it...

1125
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,160
..like a... a steel cable.

1126
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,360
This is not my suggestion, obviously.

1127
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,560
Great idea. I'll go under the ship.

1128
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,680
No, you won't.

1129
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,800
No, you won't. That's not what I meant.

1130
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:12,880
That's a stupid idea.

1131
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,200
No, it's a great idea.

1132
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,160
No.

1133
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,360
It's suicide.
These blades are 12 feet across.

1134
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,880
They'll suck you in and kill you.

1135
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,200
Hey. Hey, Dino, I got one for you.

1136
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,560
OK, who played the German captain...

1137
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,960
..in The Enemy Below?

1138
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,960
Curt Jurgens.

1139
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,080
Down the next stairwell on the left,...

1140
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,960
..straight to the bowels of the ship.

1141
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,840
Bowels. That doesn't sound very good.

1142
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,760
How much time left?

1143
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,840
Not very much. We better hurry.

1144
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,760
Mayday, Mayday.

1145
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,200
This is Seabourn Legend...

1146
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,400
..bearing 80 degrees east-northeast.

1147
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,800
Engine and steering control nonfunctional.

1148
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,280
I repeat. Nonfunctional.

1149
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,720
Where are we going?

1150
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,800
Eindhoven Lion.

1151
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,560
Eindhoven Lion, come in.

1152
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,280
This is Seabourn Legend.

1153
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,480
Eindhoven Lion, come in.

1154
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,160
Eindhoven Lion, this is Seabourn Legend.

1155
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,560
Come in, Eindhoven Lion.

1156
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,480
This is the only way out.

1157
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,400
This all the diving gear?

1158
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,560
Yeah.

1159
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,240
OK, here it goes.

1160
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,440
Huh?

1161
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,600
You think that ship's gonna rescue us?

1162
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,680
What else could it be?

1163
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,880
Alex, maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

1164
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,200
Maybe you should just
leave the propeller alone, huh?

1165
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,000
We have to stop the ship.

1166
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,680
There's not much time left.

1167
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,760
Are you sure this is gonna hold?

1168
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,320
Yeah. We use those lines all over the ship.

1169
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,880
He's not going all over the ship.

1170
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,080
He's going under the ship, all right?

1171
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,280
Annie, Annie. It's OK. It'll hold.

1172
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,560
Hold on. Let me lock it.

1173
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,880
All right.

1174
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,560
Hey.

1175
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,320
Annie.

1176
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,080
What?

1177
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,520
4296...

1178
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,080
..589J.

1179
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,200
I don't know what that is. What is that?

1180
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,160
It's my badge number.

1181
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,600
It's 4296589J.

1182
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,360
Thank you.

1183
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,240
I'll be right back.

1184
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,720
Here's the guideline.

1185
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,560
Feed it into the propeller,
and it will pull the heavy cable in.

1186
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,160
Not too much slack.

1187
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,360
OK, OK, OK. I've got him.

1188
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,800
He's getting too close.

1189
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,880
OK, OK, he's close enough.

1190
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,280
Stop it now.

1191
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,200
Come on, baby. Let it go.

1192
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,440
Let it go.

1193
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,880
It's taking the cable.
It's working. It's working!

1194
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,120
Well, then let's get him up then, huh?

1195
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,160
- Come on.
- Pull him back up.

1196
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,600
It's stuck.

1197
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,680
He's snagged.

1198
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,960
The lines are crossed.
We have to bring him up.

1199
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,000
Come on. Now. Do something!

1200
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,080
It's sucking him in.

1201
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,360
We gotta get him out of there!

1202
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,840
18.

1203
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,160
Come on, baby.

1204
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,400
17.5.

1205
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,880
They're doing it.

1206
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,440
They're slowing us down.

1207
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,840
Oh, no, you don't.

1208
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,080
We gotta get him up.

1209
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:35,320
Come on, come on. Keep pulling.

1210
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,760
Pull.

1211
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,200
Pull him up.

1212
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,760
Keep pulling.

1213
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,560
What the hell's happening?

1214
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,600
It's stuck again!

1215
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,480
Get him up! Get him up!

1216
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,960
It's not gonna hold.

1217
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,160
Oh! Won't go any faster.

1218
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,160
Won't go any faster!

1219
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,280
Watch out!

1220
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,640
Get back! Aagh!

1221
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,360
- I think I broke my arm.
- Alex! Alex!

1222
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,680
Alex.

1223
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,720
Come on. Hold on.

1224
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,160
Come on. Hold on.

1225
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,600
We've got him now.

1226
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,520
Are you all right?

1227
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,400
What happened?

1228
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,080
I don't know, something just...

1229
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,800
Let him go.

1230
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,880
You slowed her down,...

1231
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,280
..but you're not gonna stop her.

1232
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,320
Annie, I don't think your boyfriend
appreciates the logistics involved...

1233
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,800
..in ramming
the most automated ship in the world...

1234
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,680
..into a loaded fuel tanker
with no set anchor path.

1235
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,160
Let her go.

1236
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:58,120
Maybe you can spend
the rest of your days in a mental hospital...

1237
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,760
..sticking leeches to your ass.

1238
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,160
Oh, so you met my nurses.

1239
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,080
They clean the copper out of my blood.

1240
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,080
Doctors gave me a couple of years to live!

1241
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,320
Those bloodsuckers
might give me a few more.

1242
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,880
You walk away now...

1243
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,760
..and there's a chance I might not kill you.

1244
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,720
Listen to you.

1245
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,320
Let him go.

1246
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,680
Now!

1247
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,360
Go ahead.

1248
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,480
Uh-uh.

1249
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,760
Now!

1250
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,080
Go ahead.

1251
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,280
Oh.

1252
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,360
Oh!

1253
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,080
Mr Juliano,...

1254
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,280
..we'll be getting off.

1255
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,560
I hope you don't mind,...

1256
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,960
..but I'll be taking Annie with me...

1257
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,600
..as a little extra insurance.

1258
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,480
You know the one-armed freestyle,
don't you?

1259
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,360
Hey! Come on, or you'll join them!

1260
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,480
This way.

1261
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,560
Hold on, hold on.

1262
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,680
I can't believe they can't see us.

1263
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,440
How can they miss us?

1264
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,400
I can't get her on the radio!

1265
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,600
She's not responding.

1266
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,520
She's closing in at 14 knots,...

1267
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,920
..bearing 166.4.

1268
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,480
She's heading straight into us.

1269
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,000
Get the anchors up now!

1270
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:38,960
Yes, sir!

1271
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,680
Which way did they go?

1272
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,840
The marina. He's going to jump ship.

1273
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,960
You all right?

1274
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,120
I'm OK.

1275
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,760
Hurry up!

1276
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,720
Get moving!

1277
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,360
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1278
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,240
Very physical, aren't we?

1279
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,760
OK,...

1280
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,360
..that way.

1281
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,520
Down the stairs.

1282
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,560
Hold it!

1283
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,120
We're going for a little ride.

1284
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,560
Come on.

1285
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,720
Can't let you go now.
You're my little hostage.

1286
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:40,680
Come on!

1287
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,120
Don't touch me!

1288
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,040
Get down. Get down!

1289
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,880
All right.

1290
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,440
That's it.

1291
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,080
So...

1292
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,240
..aw.

1293
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,120
How do you like your vacation so far?

1294
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,080
Sit down!

1295
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,360
Ow.

1296
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,200
You better hang on.

1297
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,160
Annie!

1298
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,960
Alex? Alex!

1299
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,360
Need a hand?

1300
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,600
Hold on. I got you.

1301
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:47,640
I don't think
you want to be on that ship now, Annie.

1302
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,080
Aagh!

1303
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,760
You know your way around the ship?

1304
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,760
Yeah.

1305
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,360
You're OK?

1306
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,960
What happened?

1307
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,040
Alex, can you hear me?

1308
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,800
I don't like this at all.

1309
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,760
Oh, my God.

1310
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,960
Jeez, we're coming in too fast!

1311
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:24,840
How could this happen on our honeymoon?

1312
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,280
Wait a minute.

1313
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,800
Oh, my God. Why don't we stop?

1314
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,280
Why don't we stop?

1315
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,760
Everyone, move away from the windows!

1316
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,800
Away from the windows!

1317
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,960
Brace yourself for the crash.

1318
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,720
How long before we have power?

1319
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,720
Seven or eight minutes, sir.

1320
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,880
In eight minutes
we'll be blown out of the water!

1321
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,920
Speed the engines full power.

1322
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,400
Prepare for hard forward turn.

1323
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,640
Alex,
if you can hear me, use the ship's intercom.

1324
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,000
Left, Alex, go to the left.

1325
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,480
Alex, can you hear me?

1326
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,160
If you can hear me, use the ship's intercom.

1327
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,280
I can hear you.

1328
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,280
We're running out of time.

1329
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,200
All right, look.

1330
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,080
Which way to the bow thrusters?

1331
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,880
You flooded it. There's no way to get there.

1332
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,360
I can get there.

1333
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,680
Just talk me through it.

1334
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,880
OK. The bow thrusters are two large
wheels connected by a small shaft.

1335
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,120
You can find them at the end of the shaft
below the bilge pump room.

1336
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,160
The bilge pump room.

1337
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,120
Do you copy?

1338
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,880
Yeah, copy that.

1339
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,320
Look, stay with us.

1340
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,000
You talk us through it,
I'll follow your voice.

1341
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,960
OK, you're in section BT-1.

1342
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,360
At the end of the hallway is a hatch.

1343
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,680
That'll bring you into the bilge pump room.

1344
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,960
Hatch. Hatch.

1345
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,320
It's at the same level as where you are,
so there must be some air.

1346
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,360
Have you got it?

1347
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:03,880
You're going to have to lose the vest.

1348
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,680
What do you mean, lose my vest?

1349
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,240
We're going under.

1350
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,040
Damn, man.

1351
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,400
Let's get the hell out of here!

1352
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,400
Move away from the railing!

1353
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,160
Harvey, wait for me!

1354
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,760
Come on, over against the wall!

1355
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,920
What's going on?

1356
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,760
At the far side is a short slide.

1357
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:43,680
That will lead into the bow thruster room.

1358
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,360
Alex, can you hear me?

1359
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,440
We're getting very close.

1360
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,480
The bow thrusters,
they're two large wheels...

1361
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,680
..connected to a shaft...

1362
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,040
..that will turn the propeller.

1363
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,920
Now, when you find the wheel,...

1364
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,160
..turn it as fast you can.

1365
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,760
Hold on, hold on.

1366
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,760
You only turn one wheel at a time.

1367
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,960
If you turn them both,
you'll cancel yourself out.

1368
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,480
Make sure
you turn the starboard wheel only.

1369
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,520
OK, look.

1370
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,160
We have to play tag.

1371
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,480
I'll go down first.

1372
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,880
You follow me in 15 seconds.

1373
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,360
All right.

1374
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,080
They're turning us. Sir, they're turning us.

1375
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,080
Yes.

1376
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,560
Yes, it's working.

1377
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,640
No, no, no, no.

1378
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,600
Make it stop.

1379
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,800
Oh, my God! Everybody down!

1380
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,560
We're going to crash!

1381
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,960
Oh, God!

1382
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,280
Aagh!

1383
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,080
I think we did it!

1384
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,640
We turned it!

1385
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,560
Get down!

1386
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,640
Aagh!

1387
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,360
Whoa!

1388
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,720
I do believe we have a miss!

1389
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,200
Impossible! No!

1390
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,240
No!

1391
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,480
They did it.

1392
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,680
Oh!

1393
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,560
Oh, we made it.

1394
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,400
Oh, Jack.

1395
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,920
Yes. Yes.

1396
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,080
I sure hope somebody got that on tape.

1397
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,080
Yeah.

1398
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,040
Oh!

1399
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,880
Oh, shit.

1400
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,040
Oh, shit!

1401
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,960
Oh, shit.

1402
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,760
Aw, shit.

1403
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,000
Mum.

1404
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Hey!

1405
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,760
Hey!

1406
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,080
We got to get out of here.

1407
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,480
Yeah, no kidding. Come on.

1408
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,960
Come on!

1409
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,280
Come on, hurry up!
They're coming right at us!

1410
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,880
Come on! Faster than that!

1411
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,360
We have right of way here!

1412
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,960
Sorry! Excuse us!

1413
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,280
No way!

1414
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,200
That was close!

1415
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,360
To the bridge!

1416
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,480
Where's anchor control?

1417
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,480
We got to stop her.

1418
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,680
What? Anchor control?

1419
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,960
We can't drop it. We're moving too fast.

1420
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:35,880
Did you see Annie?

1421
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:36,880
No.

1422
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,120
I got it! I got it.

1423
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,560
No. No anchor can stop a moving ship.

1424
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:45,160
It's moving. It's going down.

1425
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,280
I can feel it. We're slowing down.

1426
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,240
No. Too fast. It's not going to hold.

1427
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,080
Harvey!

1428
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,520
Get in the corner! Brace yourselves!

1429
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,440
Oh, my God! We're doomed!

1430
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,680
We're not going to stop!
We're not going to stop!

1431
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,400
Drop the other one.

1432
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,840
I'm telling you. We're still too fast.

1433
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,160
It's stuck.

1434
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:44,920
- God, no. No.

1435
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,680
Where's the horn? Where's the horn?

1436
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,680
How can there not be a horn?

1437
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,080
There's got to be a horn here somewhere.

1438
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,600
Where's he going?

1439
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,880
Oh, shit!

1440
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,680
What you doing with the wheel?

1441
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,960
Huh?

1442
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,080
It doesn't work!

1443
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:15,120
What?

1444
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,200
Jan, hold this a sec.

1445
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,560
Allez! Allez!

1446
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,040
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1447
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:28,200
Aagh!

1448
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,680
I can't believe it.

1449
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,720
This is slowing us down.

1450
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,000
Nine knots.

1451
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,680
Jeez!

1452
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,280
Oh, man! Let's go!

1453
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,360
Huh?

1454
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,440
This isn't happening.

1455
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,480
Oh, no. No more. Not again.

1456
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,360
I found it! I found it! I found it!

1457
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,480
Everybody get out of the way!
There's a big boat coming!

1458
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:00,480
Please!

1459
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,400
Now!

1460
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,680
Run! Jump!

1461
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,600
Swim!

1462
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,720
Come on, people, move out of the way!

1463
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,880
We don't have brakes!

1464
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,160
This is not a dream!

1465
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,240
Jump!

1466
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,600
Abandon your ship!

1467
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,160
Oh, my God! We're mowing them down!

1468
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,920
Stop!

1469
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,120
it... it's helping.

1470
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,960
Seven knots.

1471
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,200
Turn right! Turn right!

1472
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,200
Look out!

1473
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,480
Whoa!

1474
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,840
Shit!

1475
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,160
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

1476
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,880
Two bedrooms, dining room, kitchen, nook.

1477
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,680
Mummy, there's a big boat.

1478
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,280
I know.
There are a lot of big boats here, honey.

1479
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,560
What a cute boy...

1480
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:29,960
..and smart of you to notice all the ships.

1481
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:33,040
The walls are a soft European eggshell...

1482
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,640
God, it'll take forever to stop us.

1483
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,880
Harvey?

1484
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,600
Quick!

1485
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,280
We're not going to fit! It's too tight!

1486
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,320
Get down!

1487
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,600
Aagh!

1488
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,280
Six knots!

1489
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,960
Aagh!

1490
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,080
Aagh!

1491
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,960
Oooh!

1492
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:48,560
What? What? I can't hear you.

1493
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,080
Aagh!

1494
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,040
It's coming.

1495
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,280
Five knots!

1496
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,400
Ooh!

1497
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,120
Four...

1498
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,440
..aagh!

1499
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,480
Stop!

1500
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,240
Here it comes now!

1501
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:58,880
It's really big, Mum.

1502
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,480
Oh, my God!

1503
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,080
Oh, my God!

1504
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,280
Get down!

1505
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,760
Aagh!

1506
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:35,160
Aagh!

1507
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,120
Two knots!

1508
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,640
Almost stopped!

1509
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,840
Oh, no!

1510
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,440
Get down!

1511
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,160
Zero.

1512
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,440
Aagh! Aagh! Ooh.

1513
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,280
My car!

1514
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,960
I got to find Annie.

1515
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,160
Shit! She's going over!

1516
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:25,880
We're tipping!

1517
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:26,880
We're tipping!

1518
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,160
Ow.

1519
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,400
We're docked.

1520
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:51,200
We're docked!

1521
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,600
I can't believe it!

1522
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,160
We're safe.

1523
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:07,960
Zero.

1524
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,440
Say what?

1525
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,600
Bad luck to run ship over town.

1526
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,280
No shit, bad luck, man.

1527
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,880
I just bought a condo here.

1528
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,080
My God.

1529
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:29,000
You all right?

1530
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:32,000
Yeah. I think I broke my other arm.

1531
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,480
The ship's parked in the middle of town,...

1532
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,720
..but, hey, it could've been worse.

1533
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,560
I'm not sure how,
but it could've been worse.

1534
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:41,280
I got to get my girl.

1535
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,280
Thank you.

1536
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,080
Uh!

1537
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,200
Sorry.

1538
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,600
Be careful.

1539
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,280
I'll go check on the others.

1540
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,080
Looks like your vacation is almost over.

1541
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:08,480
Just stay away from me,
or you're going to get hurt,...

1542
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:09,560
..l swear to God.

1543
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,160
What are you going to do, Annie?

1544
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,320
Splash water on me?

1545
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,680
I'm driving now.

1546
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,760
Hey, Annie! Hey!

1547
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,480
Annie!

1548
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,600
Come back! You stay with me!

1549
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:32,280
You're my hostage!

1550
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,160
I need a boat!

1551
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,480
Can I help you?

1552
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,920
I'm a cop. I need to borrow your boat.

1553
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,120
What? You've got to be kidding me.

1554
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,960
This is joke, right?
You're messing with my head.

1555
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,840
Come on, man, you gotta be kidding me!

1556
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,080
Can't you see I'm on a date?

1557
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,560
Alex Shaw, LAPD. Start the boat.

1558
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:54,920
LAPD? I'm in the Caribbean, man.

1559
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
What are you doing here?

1560
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,560
Stop him, Maurice.

1561
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,920
Know how many hours of therapy
I've had because of you guys?

1562
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:01,880
And that shit's expensive!

1563
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:02,800
You drive.

1564
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,280
Hey, hey, where are you going?

1565
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,440
No!

1566
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,160
Hey! Annie!

1567
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,160
OK, OK, take it easy, man!

1568
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:35,160
This boat cost me $150,000.

1569
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,880
That way.

1570
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,160
OK. That's it!

1571
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:46,120
I want a promissory note right now!

1572
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:47,760
Whoa!

1573
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:03,760
Give it!

1574
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,880
Let go of me!

1575
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,800
Ow!

1576
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,680
Do we have a fiery temper?

1577
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,160
You have no idea!

1578
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:12,160
There she is.

1579
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,040
Look! Fireworks!

1580
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,160
It's her.

1581
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,120
What?

1582
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,080
That way, fast.

1583
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,280
Nah, I can't drive that fast!

1584
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,880
There's shallow reefs! Shit!

1585
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,800
Get as close to that plane as you can.

1586
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,000
Give me one good reason.

1587
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,360
If you don't, I'll throw you over.

1588
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:49,480
OK.

1589
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,960
That's a good reason.

1590
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,920
Almost at speed!

1591
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,320
Don't! Don't you...

1592
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,320
Ow! Let me go!

1593
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,280
I think you better stay with me.

1594
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,520
Get closer!

1595
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:11,960
What?

1596
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,360
Let me go!

1597
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:26,160
You want to go? I'll let you go...

1598
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:28,480
..at about 10,000 feet!

1599
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,360
Get me closer!

1600
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:33,760
Huh?

1601
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,040
He's going to shoot the plane!

1602
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,520
Nice shot.

1603
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:45,520
Let's see if he can hold on now!

1604
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,280
Follow me!

1605
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,080
Let go!

1606
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,480
He... he's supposed to let go.

1607
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:00,760
Let go!

1608
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,160
No, no, he's reeling himself in!

1609
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,680
Follow him! Follow him!

1610
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,680
Oh, you little shit.

1611
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,760
Here we go!

1612
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,880
No!

1613
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,560
No, don't!

1614
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,640
No!

1615
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,960
Come here!

1616
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,280
Oh, God.

1617
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,800
Alex! Alex!

1618
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:48,240
Annie!

1619
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,240
Annie!

1620
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

1621
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,800
Hi.

1622
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:08,720
Come on.

1623
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,960
Now hold on!

1624
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,040
Aagh!

1625
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,320
What's he riding that banana peel for?

1626
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:26,480
What's he doing?

1627
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:31,480
Aagh!

1628
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,440
Aagh!

1629
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:56,960
Aagh!

1630
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:01,920
Abandon ship.

1631
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,600
All the crewmembers,...

1632
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:05,560
..abandon ship immediately.

1633
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,720
It's gonna blow, it's gonna blow!

1634
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,560
Jump, fool! Get off that thing!

1635
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,440
Jump!

1636
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:42,920
Hope they can hold their breath
a long time.

1637
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,480
Come on, don't run out of air.

1638
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:48,000
Me not see 'em. Me think they dead.

1639
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,560
They're not gone.

1640
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,680
There they are! There they are!

1641
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,680
Hey, over here!

1642
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,960
Hey, this way!

1643
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,560
Here, come on. I got you. Come on.

1644
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:33,680
Come on, hurry up.

1645
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,080
Hurry up, come on. It's gonna blow.

1646
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,960
Hurry up, it's gonna blow.

1647
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,560
Aagh!

1648
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:04,080
Untie 'em, untie 'em.

1649
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:05,480
You're all right.

1650
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,360
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1651
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,760
I was just so scared. I was so scared.

1652
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:15,200
I didn't think
I was gonna make it there for a second.

1653
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,960
Thank you.

1654
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:29,200
Look what I found in international waters.

1655
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,360
This really is paradise.

1656
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,480
I got something for you.

1657
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:40,960
Oh.

1658
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,400
Wow.

1659
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:46,400
You want to wear this for a while?

1660
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,280
How long were you thinking?

1661
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:53,800
50 years.

1662
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,840
Yeah?

1663
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,360
Yeah.

1664
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:09,400
Can I make all the travel plans
from now on?

1665
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,680
Deal.

1666
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:57,320
Hello.

1667
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:59,480
Mr Kenter.

1668
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:00,520
Oh, Annie.

1669
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:03,760
- Uh... Oh, you're back again.
- Yeah.

1670
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,000
Hope you don't mind.

1671
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,520
I kind of requested you.

1672
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,720
I wanted to make up for last week.

1673
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,000
Why would I mind?

1674
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:14,000
Gosh, uh...
I'm sure it'll go much better today.

1675
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:15,200
Oh, yeah, it will.

1676
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,680
- Had some problems.
- Nervous, yeah, a little bit.

1677
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,680
OK, Mr Kenter, here we go.

1678
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,520
Sorry, but that bus was going way too fast.

1679
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:38,320
I noticed that. Uh, make a left here.

1680
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,520
Got it. Excuse me.

1681
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:43,200
Thank you, thank you.
