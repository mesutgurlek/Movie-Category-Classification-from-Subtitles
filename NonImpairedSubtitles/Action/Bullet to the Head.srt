00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,517
The guy I just saved is a cop.

3
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,061
That's not the usual way I do things,

4
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:06,899
but sometimes you gotta abandon
your principles and do what's right.

5
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,653
Here's the story.
This is the way it went down.

6
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,348
- Shit!
- You okay?

7
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,184
You made me spill my fucking coffee!

8
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,021
Agh. Now it's gonna look like
I pissed in my pants. God damn it.

9
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,273
The way you whipped around that cat,
you don't even like cats.

10
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,276
I got no problem with cats.
I don't like dander.

11
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,696
So you almost roll your car trying not to
hit one out of 600 million cats in the world?

12
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,323
It's bad luck killing a cat.

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,700
Pretty good reflexes for an old guy.

14
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,994
I got your old guy.

15
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,733
You ready?

16
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,153
Louis is ready.

17
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,365
Let's go to work.

18
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,281
Oh, my God. Who do I have to fuck
to get you two assbags to...

19
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,450
Sir, if we could just come in for a minute.

20
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,993
I don't give a shit about your badge, man.

21
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,954
You got a fucking warrant?

22
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,623
'Cause I'm paying a grand a night
for this suite, and I'm about to get laid.

23
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,377
So if you ain't room service and you ain't got
a warrant, then you can go fuck yourselves.

24
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,006
Keep your fucking pants on!
Well, what the fuck is this?

25
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,718
I'm gonna have your job, tough guy.

26
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,974
I still don't see any paper, which means
you got no legal authority to be here.

27
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,101
You must not like your job much,
huh, shithead?

28
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,727
Right now, I'm loving it.

29
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,563
Ah!

30
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,322
Don't forget to get
his watch and wallet.

31
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,407
Right.

32
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,368
Needs to look like a break-in.

33
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,345
I didn't see a thing!
I don't even know the guy!

34
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,271
No!

35
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,321
Ahh!

36
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,079
Hey!

37
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,124
Get him off me!

38
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,209
Get him off!

39
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,089
Let's go.

40
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,091
- Who was in the shower?
- A hooker.

41
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,052
And?

42
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,972
And I handled it. Wanna say goodbye?

43
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,932
Fucker!

44
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,412
- What's bothering you?
- Nothing.

45
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,706
Come on,
something's got your panties in a knot.

46
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,541
Why else are we gonna go meet
Ronnie Earl in public?

47
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,419
Yeah, I don't trust that redneck prick,
that's why.

48
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,922
Job's done. Went fine, no problem.

49
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,423
Why don't you do me a favour?

50
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,885
When we get our dough,
why don't you go away a while?

51
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,930
Take a vacation, maybe go up river,
see your mother.

52
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,348
You wanna clue me in?

53
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,308
I didn't shoot that hooker.

54
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,188
No!

55
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,358
Jesus. She saw you?

56
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,777
- Yeah, but she ain't gonna say nothing.
- How do you know?

57
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,154
'Cause she's more afraid of us than the cops,
that's why.

58
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,865
So it's all good?

59
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,541
- Yeah, it's all good.
- Yeah?

60
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,084
- Yeah.
- It's all good.

61
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,689
Hey, y'all, what do you need?

62
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,693
Miller Lite, and a whisky for my friend.

63
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,861
You got a preference?

64
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,780
- Double Bulleit.
- What's that?

65
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,991
Some kind of whisky nobody's ever heard of.

66
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,160
Why don't you bring your own bottle?

67
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,913
Give him the best bourbon you got,
hot stuff, and don't be gone too long.

68
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,500
That sound as desperate as I think it did?

69
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,878
Yeah, don't worry about it,
you're a real Casanova.

70
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,057
Ronnie Earl's late.
I'm not waiting around for that loser.

71
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,767
The drinks are coming, relax.

72
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,186
I'm gonna go to the can.

73
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,062
If he ain't here by the time I get back,
we're out of here.

74
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,647
- Right?
- Yeah, okay.

75
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,181
- Oh! Sorry about that.
- What the fuck?

76
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,162
Disgusting.

77
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,213
What's up?

78
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,487
Jesus! You motherfucker!

79
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,568
I've been arrested 26 times.

80
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,030
I went to trial four times.

81
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,658
I got convicted twice.

82
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,079
Nowadays, what I'm doing,
I just think of it as a business.

83
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:09,293
The people I work for are shit.
And the people I take out are worse.

84
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,090
I got some rules. No women, no children.

85
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:19,178
Half the money in advance,
and half when the job is done.

86
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,430
Don't trust anybody.

87
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,767
That's how you stay in the game.

88
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,687
And on this one, the game got rough.

89
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,631
You have one message.

90
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,383
Detective Kwon, McKay here.

91
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,426
The local PD has agreed to take you
down to the morgue

92
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,887
and show you Greely's body
and personal effects.

93
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,890
Whatever got him killed, he must've
been close to something sensitive.

94
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,892
We definitely need you to sort this out.

95
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,228
Since the case has the potential
to get touchy with the feds,

96
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,107
we want to maintain radio silence on the
situation until you have some real answers.

97
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,525
Good luck.

98
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:20,572
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm looking for a Lieutenant Lebreton.

99
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,116
Yeah, he's right in that office.

100
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,450
Thank you.

101
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,413
I was in the shower for 30 minutes.

102
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,541
- Thirty minutes?
- About 30 minutes.

103
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,292
Lieutenant?

104
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,169
Hi, Detective Taylor Kwon.

105
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,755
I went to the hotel.

106
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,258
The client asked me to take a shower.

107
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,511
- And then those guys came.
- And what were they looking for?

108
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,265
They wanted my client.

109
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,934
They wanted to kill him.
That's what they came to do.

110
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,186
But I don't get a good look at them.

111
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,649
I can't identify them.

112
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,152
Two guys whacked him.

113
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,695
Looks like a drug deal gone bad,

114
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,364
but the truth is, we don't know shit,
so anything's possible.

115
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,783
They didn't kill the hooker
that Greely was with.

116
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,703
These guys are pros,
I don't know why they'd leave a witness.

117
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,456
That's her. Russian.

118
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,000
I thought all the Russian hookers
went to L.A., New York, or Vegas.

119
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,878
I get into the shower, I told you already.

120
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,298
Is this the first time
you saw that client?

121
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,972
What do you know about Mr Greely?

122
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,018
Ex-WDCPD, Detective grade.
For about six months, he was my partner.

123
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,520
He was kicked off the force
in complete disgrace.

124
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,065
Cop gone real bad. Drunk, gambling.

125
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,193
He stole evidence from a case
he was working.

126
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,111
We still don't know what it was.

127
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,615
- Detective?
- Taylor here.

128
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,118
We ran Henry Hank Greely back through
NCIC for recent known associates

129
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,662
and came up with several reports
of a possible relationship

130
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:54,166
with local career criminal
and protection racketeer Baby Jack Lemoyne.

131
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,418
- So far, that's it.
- Right, I'll check in later.

132
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,338
Who's this guy?

133
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,341
Louis Blanchard, local lowlife, hitman.

134
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,093
Somebody punched his ticket
while he was drinking a beer.

135
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,555
- You got an estimated time?
- Just about midnight.

136
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,185
- DCPD.
- Yeah, it's Taylor here.

137
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,353
Yes, Detective?

138
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,605
Get me a speed check
on a Louis Blanchard, local.

139
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,190
- Blanchard.
- Reputed hitman.

140
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,150
- Get me any known associates.
- Right.

141
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,152
Somebody took him out a couple hours
after Greely last night.

142
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,821
Murder weapon was a five-inch blade
with a three-inch curvature,

143
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,073
mainly used for gutting animals.

144
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,200
The strikes were almost surgical.

145
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,118
Deflated both lungs, punctured the heart.

146
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,120
Detective Kwon,
we've come up with two hits.

147
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,582
Louis Blanchard, 37 years old
with a long list of priors.

148
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,503
Blanchard is a known associate of
one James Bonomo, AKA Jimmy Bobo,

149
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,631
suspected hitman, 26 arrests,
two convictions.

150
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,343
I'll send you his current contact information
via local parole board database.

151
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,803
- Right.
- That's all for now.

152
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,971
And thanks.

153
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,557
So this guy, Louis Blanchard,

154
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:55,227
is a known associate
of a James Bonomo, AKA Jimmy Bobo.

155
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,772
They worked together and they possibly
fit the profile of Greely's killers.

156
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,440
Very good. You get all that off your cell?

157
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,318
So I take it we're looking
for this Jimmy Bobo?

158
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,655
My homicide division is more than capable
of handling this matter, without your help.

159
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,323
You know, I think I'll stick around for a while.

160
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,742
Hold on. You packing?

161
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,246
Bet you don't have a Crescent City
carry permit, do you?

162
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,851
Nobody's here. Leave a message.

163
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,688
Hello, Jimmy. Name's Taylor Kwon.
I'm from out of state...

164
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,942
...following up on the death of a Hank Greely,
former associate of mine.

165
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,321
I think Louis Blanchard's murder
ties into all this.

166
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,114
If you're interested in hearing some more,

167
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,117
meet me at the St. Charles Saloon
in three hours.

168
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,965
It's easy to get
sentimental about things.

169
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,425
Louis was a big boy.

170
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,429
He knew, he took his chances.

171
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,183
I worked with him the last six years,
he never caused me a problem.

172
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,563
But still, we did our job

173
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,107
and we got set up.

174
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,744
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I need a rock glass.

175
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,413
You know, this is a bar,
you can't bring in your own bottle.

176
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,581
You carry Bulleit Bourbon?

177
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,208
No.

178
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,251
Yeah, well, I do.

179
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,423
Here's 20 bucks to rent a glass.

180
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,259
All right.

181
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,478
Salud.

182
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,901
You're a cop, right?

183
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,447
Taylor Kwon, WDCPD.

184
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,618
Look, this isn't a sting. I'm alone.

185
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,704
I wouldn't be here if you weren't.

186
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,043
So I figure you and Louis Blanchard
take out Hank Greely last night.

187
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:29,297
Couple hours later,
you walk into some type of double cross.

188
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,174
Louis goes down, you make it out.

189
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,554
The only part of this story I can't figure out
is why you guys let the hooker live.

190
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,475
When I'm done with this drink,
I'm gonna be done with you.

191
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,646
Hank Greely was an ex-cop.
Washington, D.C.

192
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,982
I'm on the case.

193
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,864
Look, I'm not really interested
in some disposable hired hitter, no of fence.

194
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,324
I want the guys who did the hiring.

195
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,994
You know,
the same guys who took out your partner.

196
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:02,706
They probably held out on you.
Owe you some money?

197
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,041
Let's work together.
We can help each other out.

198
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,836
I don't work with cops.

199
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,174
Is that it?

200
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,218
That's it.

201
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,974
You change your mind, give me a call.

202
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,437
Why don't you have a drink for Louis?

203
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,230
That's probably the only thing
you'll ever do for him.

204
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,497
Ahh!

205
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,101
They're cops.

206
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,271
Dead cops. And you're gonna be dead, too,
if you don't get in here and get fixed up.

207
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,981
Come on.

208
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,617
The cops are gonna be here any second.
They're gonna take your ass in.

209
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,244
Cops aren't gonna help you.
You clipped one of them.

210
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,996
Plus, you got another one
laying over there somewhere.

211
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,206
And they're both rogue.

212
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,625
They're all not gonna be like that.

213
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,045
The pistol you used to kill that cop's
got your fingerprints all over it.

214
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,714
Got two choices.
You come with me and get fixed up,

215
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,593
or you get out here and wait for the cops.
Your choice.

216
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,597
Make up your mind.
My fucking arm's getting tired.

217
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,241
Mr Keegan!

218
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,538
I'm told you had a bit of a problem last night.

219
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,000
A little unfinished business. I'll find him.

220
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,252
That scumbag Greely knew

221
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,296
he needed some kind of insurance policy
in order to blackmail us.

222
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,384
So he found Baby Jack and he gave him
his evidence file for safekeeping,

223
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,262
all of it proving
that we paid off a congressman

224
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,723
to steer a government contract our way.

225
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,687
We have an informant inside his crew.
He gave us the location of the file.

226
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,647
I want you to destroy it.

227
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,507
Okay, so, we are done.

228
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:08,511
Just keep this wrapped for 24 hours.
A&D twice a day for a week.

229
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,138
Otherwise, no direct sunlight.

230
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,975
Keep it dry and absolutely no scratching.

231
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,950
- So what are we doing here?
- Getting matching tattoos.

232
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,161
Piss off, asshole.

233
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,332
Move your leg.

234
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,180
Piss off?

235
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:56,768
You came to me. You asked me for help.
I thought about it and I said, "No."

236
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,771
Then I see all these guys trying to kill you,
and I figure we're in the same boat.

237
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,900
But let's get something straight,
either we do it my way or we don't do it at all!

238
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,176
Hey, Lisa.

239
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,225
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

240
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,395
I gotta talk to you a second, though.

241
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,230
It's been a while.

242
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,607
A girl gets lonely.

243
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,067
- I know. I'm sorry.
- You know?

244
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,318
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

245
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,530
Are you, um, in trouble?

246
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,366
No, I'm good. I'm good.

247
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,368
I need your help with something.

248
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,121
There's a guy out in the car. He's been shot.

249
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,415
This guy's bleeding,
I don't know how bad it is,

250
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,084
but I can't take him to a real doctor.

251
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,712
Lisa, I gotta keep this one alive.

252
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,965
I told you before, I'm not in that business.
I never was.

253
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,218
This is the last time.
I'm sorry, I'll never do this again.

254
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,604
Homicide, Lebreton.

255
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,480
Lieutenant, it's Detective Taylor Kwon.

256
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,858
Look, I'm still in Crescent City.

257
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,526
Yeah, well, you enjoying your vacation?

258
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,862
- This is a courtesy call, Lieutenant.
- Kwon.

259
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,698
I'm still working the Greely case
until I hear otherwise from my boss.

260
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,783
Yeah, well, that doesn't surprise me.
Did you find anything?

261
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,911
Yeah, I got a source.

262
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,871
He's gonna lead me to the guys
who took out Greely.

263
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,124
I bring him in, he's just gonna lawyer up
and then you got nothing.

264
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,339
I gotta go. I'll talk to you later, okay?
I'll keep checking in.

265
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,722
No. This guy, no, he doesn't look like
one of your usual lowlife buddies.

266
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,975
He's a cop.
I made the mistake of saving his life.

267
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:03,937
Well, that's a first.

268
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,313
Hmm.

269
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,066
All right, whatever, let's get him in.

270
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,776
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

271
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,319
What kind of doctor are you?

272
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,738
She did a year in med school.
It's the best you're gonna get.

273
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,759
Have some of this. You'll thank me later.

274
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,518
Have you done this before?

275
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,478
Yeah, a couple times.

276
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,857
Gee, that's too bad.

277
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,695
Jimmy's friends occasionally have
some problems.

278
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,197
I'm Lisa.

279
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,075
Taylor. Taylor Kwon!

280
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,369
There it is.

281
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,954
Okay.

282
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,416
So, how'd this happen?

283
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,003
Did Jimmy do it?
He doesn't like cops very much.

284
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:14,048
Well, I don't like crooks very much.
 The feeling's mutual.

285
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,552
You mind telling me why
you're getting involved in this?

286
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,888
It's complicated.

287
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,890
Are you gonna arrest him?

288
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,560
Well, he's a criminal and a killer.

289
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,147
Yeah, who I guess saved your life.

290
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,236
It's just a scratch, right?

291
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,907
I still have to clean him up, stitch him up.
Then you can have him.

292
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,911
Give him a Band-Aid and a blow pop.

293
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,137
We're closed.

294
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,598
Private club. Just got some friends here.

295
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,892
Can I help you, buddy?

296
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,353
You looking for Baby Jack?

297
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,858
What the shit was that about?

298
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,626
Open the safe.

299
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,471
Thank you.

300
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,494
Get the fuck out!

301
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,289
You're fucking dead!

302
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:52,874
This little number you pulled tonight
may turn out to be the stuff of legend.

303
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,836
Mr Greely thought he was so smart
to hide the file with an associate.

304
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,629
Job well done.

305
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,299
I had the advantage of surprise.

306
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,469
Your false modesty is apparent.

307
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,054
You enjoy your work.

308
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,980
Fascinating reading.

309
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,566
All the terrible things I've done.

310
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,488
But huge amounts of money

311
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,782
can lead a man to temptation.

312
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,582
- I hear you're gonna live.
- Yeah, well, seven stitches.

313
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,833
Could have been worse.

314
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,128
Yeah, she said take these.

315
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,716
- What are they?
- Extract of white tiger juice.

316
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,843
Put a little pound in your pencil there, pal.

317
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,970
White tiger juice, my ass.

318
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,806
What about the good old
"Asians Can't Drive" joke?

319
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,476
You guys can't drive, that's a fact.
No doubt about it.

320
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,606
So that tattoo doctor?

321
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,233
- Yeah.
- She seems okay.

322
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,484
Yeah, she's okay.

323
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,985
Kind of makes you an odd couple, huh?

324
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,654
Yeah, you trying to say something?

325
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,906
What? Whatever, you know.

326
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,492
She chooses to be with you, you must be
giving her something she needs.

327
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,410
Yeah, she's my daughter.

328
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,583
How'd you ever make detective?

329
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,505
You know that tattoo
on your daughter's back?

330
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,466
It's very similar to the one on the hooker
that was with Greely.

331
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,636
Don't tell me you're calling my daughter
a hooker. Don't even go there.

332
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,474
What I'm trying to say is that maybe the
similar tattoos is why you didn't kill her.

333
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,312
It was some sentimental,
dopey identification crap

334
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,981
between, you know, her and your daughter.

335
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,358
What are you, a cop or a shrink?

336
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,362
So, who hired you to take out Greely?

337
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,489
In my line of work,
we generally go through a handler.

338
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,658
This time, it was this jerk named Ronnie Earl.

339
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,326
You talk to this Earl yet?

340
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,078
No, I can't find him.

341
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,205
What about you? What do you got?

342
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,958
- Well, so far, I got you.
- Great.

343
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,751
DCPD.

344
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,421
Give me a speed check on a Ronnie,
AKA Ronald Earl.

345
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,880
- Earl.
- Crescent City local.

346
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,383
- Right.
- Now you're doing your job.

347
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,802
You know, we'll figure this thing out,
then we'll go get them.

348
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,053
Get them and what?

349
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,139
- Then take them out.
- No, you mean take them in.

350
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,640
Right, take them in. Whatever.

351
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,517
How am I supposed to trust you?

352
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,937
I don't know.
Why don't you read some fucking tea leaves?

353
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,732
That might work. You know,
I save your life, I get your wound fixed.

354
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,525
Now what do you want, a ring?

355
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:26,944
Yeah?

356
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,738
DCPD, we got a Ronald Earl.

357
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:29,864
Man, you're aggravating.

358
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,701
- Ronnie Earl AKA Cowboy Ronnie.
- Yeah, that's right. Cowboy Ronnie.

359
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,954
35, born in El Paso. Six feet tall.

360
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,956
- Right. Where is he?
- Brown hair, blue eyes.

361
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,791
- Priors, grand theft auto...
- Car thief.

362
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,210
He's a scumbag. Who gives a shit?
Where is he?

363
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,712
He was busted twice in Oklahoma City.

364
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,214
- Total loser.
- Illegal possession of firearms.

365
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:51,761
And we got a hit on his credit card
at a place called Maison de Santé?

366
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,346
It's a Turkish bath house
in the French Quarter?

367
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,555
I know exactly where it is.

368
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,390
- That's all for now.
- All right, thanks.

369
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,558
Yeah.

370
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,518
Let's go take a bath.

371
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,981
The Crescent City crime wave took an even
more violent turn earlier this evening

372
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,360
with the murder of Baby Jack Lemoyne
and eight of his henchmen

373
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,613
at their Algiers restaurant bar,
The French Lick.

374
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,324
Lemoyne has long been considered
a major racketeer

375
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,242
in the Crescent City underworld scene.

376
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:20,289
Police suspect a rival gang in the Algiers
area of committing the vicious murders

377
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,668
and say it looked like an invasion
of at least five assailants.

378
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,961
I'm Wanda Burton for Channel Two News.

379
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,864
He made a 10:00 appointment.

380
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,742
Charged an hour on his MasterCard.

381
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,035
Hmm.

382
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,287
You're one of them phone guys, huh?

383
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,289
Yeah, I can't do my job without it.

384
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,042
You know, I could use this as a weapon?

385
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,586
I could jam your throat, hit your temple.

386
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,797
And, bang, you'd be toast.

387
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,927
And I just sit there, right?

388
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:19,098
Yeah, I could break this glass and use it
as a cutting edge. Never see me coming.

389
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,475
Or I could use the lithium battery
to poison your drink.

390
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,395
You know, drop it in your coffee.
You won't even taste it.

391
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,815
And I can kill you with this piece of apple.

392
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,067
Yeah, right. How would you do that?

393
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,864
Distraction.

394
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,534
Hmm?

395
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,580
This was Louis' knife. Nice, huh?

396
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,001
You stay here and listen to the radio.

397
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,504
Whoa, whoa, wait. That's bullshit.
I found him, I'm going in.

398
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,964
In my town, we'll do it my way.

399
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,552
Hey, you got 10 minutes,
and then I'm coming...

400
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,756
Now I want you to sit over there
and keep your mouth shut. Forever, okay?

401
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,634
Forever.

402
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,485
Are we gonna do this or what?

403
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,321
Sure, anytime.

404
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,244
You set me up, Ronnie,
and you got Louis killed.

405
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,121
No. That ain't what happened, bro.

406
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,165
Why don't we just cut the bullshit, bro?
What about the client?

407
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,293
I never ask that shit. You know that.

408
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,503
My guy hears from a guy
who hears from a guy.

409
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,046
Who owes me money?

410
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,258
I don't know, but they owe me, too.
All right? I still haven't gotten paid.

411
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,927
What about Louis? You set him up.

412
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,890
No way, Bobo. Not a chance.
Louis was my boy.

413
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,349
Your boy.

414
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,642
Now, look.

415
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,147
That client took him out, I say we go
find that fucker and get us both paid.

416
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,733
That's a good idea.
Why don't you get dressed?

417
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,837
Guns don't kill people,

418
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,007
bullets do.

419
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,842
You made two big mistakes.

420
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,303
You should have checked the weight,

421
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,556
and you should have never tried to burn me.

422
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,811
- Baptiste.
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,147
All right, that's the brother's name,
Marcus Baptiste!

424
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,274
He's a lawyer,
and he's got an office down in the CBD,

425
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,818
and he's got a big old fucking mansion
in the Garden District, all right?

426
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,029
Baptiste.

427
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,531
How much for this to go away?
Give me a number.

428
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,201
Well, I was robbed,

429
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,078
and Louis was clipped.

430
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,332
100 grand?

431
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,336
You know, Louis was a little oobatz,
a little crazy, but I liked him.

432
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,754
I liked him a lot.

433
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,422
He was my partner.

434
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,341
All right, 500 grand!

435
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,426
Come on, that's a lot of cheese,
but I could live with that!

436
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,970
I can't!

437
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,013
Jimmy, no, no, no, no! Jimmy, no!

438
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,431
Oh, my God! Fuck!

439
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,892
No, no!

440
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,266
So, did you find Ronnie Earl?

441
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,268
- It's none of your business.
- Well, what did he say?

442
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,519
I got a problem with you.

443
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,063
Don't touch my gun!

444
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,816
What the hell were you thinking,
taking the firing pin out of my piece?

445
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,984
- Okay.
- Huh?

446
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,529
Okay, all right.

447
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,656
Maybe it was a mistake, all right?

448
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,617
- Mistake?
- Yeah.

449
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,243
But I'm a cop.

450
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,412
You know, I can't let you go
on some fucking killing spree!

451
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,706
Yeah? Well, it's gonna get worse.
If you can't handle it, go home!

452
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,792
Hey, fuck you!

453
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,670
You know, if it wasn't for me, you'd still be
scratching your ass looking for Ronnie Earl.

454
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,884
If we're gonna find the guys
that killed Louis and Greely,

455
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,345
then we gotta work together on this!

456
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,725
You had me at "fuck you." Come on!

457
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,525
Next bum we gotta get is a lawyer
named Marcus Baptiste. I heard of him.

458
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,363
Seen his name in the paper, big shot type.
We'll see.

459
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,740
- DCPD.
- Yeah, it's Taylor Kwon.

460
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:52,866
Yes, Detective?

461
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,035
Get me a speed check on a Marcus Baptiste,

462
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,620
- local lawyer, ASAP.
- Baptiste.

463
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,871
- Right.
- All right, thanks.

464
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,500
What's so funny?

465
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,628
It's been a long time
since I cracked out a cop.

466
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,131
- Bang, down, owned.
- Owned?

467
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,094
- It's Taylor here.
- DCPD regarding Marcus Baptiste.

468
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,428
There's a pen down there.

469
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,559
Marcus Baptiste, 5305 Britania.

470
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,061
- All right, got it, thanks.
- Great.

471
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,442
You were in the Navy, right?

472
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,695
- You were in demolitions?
- Yeah.

473
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,446
Early discharge. No benefits.

474
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,825
Never did find enough evidence
to court martial you

475
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,869
for that C-4 you sold on the black market.

476
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,246
How do you know all that stuff?
With that phone?

477
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,000
Exactly. I ran your file through NCIC.

478
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:47,754
High school dropout, military service,
arrest record, prison time.

479
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,257
Yeah, you can find all of that on one of these.

480
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,136
May want to upgrade from carrier pigeons
or whatever early man uses.

481
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,346
You gotta stop busting my chops.

482
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,516
And that C-4 case,
someone else confessed to it,

483
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,519
but I guess you ain't gonna find that
on my records, are you?

484
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,355
You still did enough fucked up shit
to spend the rest of your life in prison.

485
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,694
That ain't gonna happen,
but I like your spirit, that Samurai thing,

486
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,070
it's nice.

487
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:16,200
First of all, Samurai is Japanese, I'm Korean.

488
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,326
Got it.

489
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,121
That's like me saying
my favourite Italian food are tacos.

490
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,790
That's kind of a stupid analogy.

491
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,474
Wow.
Looks like Baptiste is having a party.

492
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,852
You know,
costumes could work to our advantage.

493
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,105
Slip in and grab him
where he can't make a scene.

494
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,565
Got it covered.

495
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,612
- Hey, how are you?
- Hello.

496
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,075
We'd love for you to join us.

497
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,425
Baptiste, wonderful party!

498
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,468
Hey! There you are.
I was just looking for you.

499
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,304
Why don't the two of you meet me
in the back bedroom there,

500
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,597
we'll play the fox and the hound together
a little bit.

501
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,349
- That's our guy.
- Enjoy yourself.

502
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,393
Wait here.

503
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,020
Hey, kids!

504
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,522
Wonderful party, thank you!

505
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,026
Look at you! Looking great, baby!

506
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,236
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

507
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,616
- Come to me, princess.
- Fabulous.

508
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,368
Yes, baby. Oh.

509
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,497
Ha-ha! Darling!

510
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,334
- Easter Bunny, how's it going?
- Good to see you!

511
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,877
Gonna keep getting naughtier.

512
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:34,755
Keep getting crazier.

513
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:05,077
Gentlemen, despite the reverses
and calamities of the recent past,

514
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:10,540
we believe that this city still has
a bright economic future.

515
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:16,421
What we're going to do is
knock these ghetto housing projects flat

516
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:22,219
and replace them with safe, modern,
prestigious condominiums.

517
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,849
Ah. Gentlemen, our host, Mr Baptiste.

518
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,059
Good evening.

519
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,644
Hope you gentlemen spend some time
at the party.

520
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,646
Pleasure, pleasure.

521
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,192
To our potential success. Cheers.

522
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,985
- Cheers.
- Need anything?

523
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,531
A little privacy, right now.

524
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:46,076
And a little more whisky,
if you can arrange it.

525
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,665
Gentlemen.

526
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,094
- Hey, Tiffany!
- Yes, Mr Baptiste?

527
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,762
- Morel wants some more whisky.
- All right.

528
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,224
- Hey, you know what? Fuck him.
- Mr Baptiste.

529
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,767
Gonna piss in his cup.

530
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:15,730
Any drugs in here?

531
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,792
Grip it and zip it, party boy.

532
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,586
What the fuck is this, a joke?

533
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,050
Nah, it ain't no joke.

534
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:57,898
Yeah.

535
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,150
Meet me by the staircase
at the rear of the house.

536
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,359
Okay, I'll be right there.

537
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,369
I thought you were
just gonna talk to him.

538
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,371
I know, I know.

539
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,515
So, where are we going
for this interrogation?

540
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,850
My hit-the-mattress joint,
it's an old boathouse.

541
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,686
Hey, just don't give me any crap,
I'm not in the mood right now.

542
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,522
What's your problem?

543
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,690
I saw the guy that killed Louis
back at the party.

544
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,443
I wanted to take him out,
but there's too many witnesses.

545
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,697
He's still out.

546
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,407
If he wakes up, just crack him.

547
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,034
What, are you kidding? He's totally out.

548
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,286
Plus he's drunk, what's he gonna do?

549
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,793
Jesus Christ!

550
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,176
Get off!

551
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,934
Nice going, Odd Job!

552
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,395
Good call.

553
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,815
You know, I give you one thing,
one thing to do!

554
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:32,367
You let two unknown men
enter this house uninvited.

555
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,662
Then you allow them to take the owner,

556
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:40,584
and then, unmolested,
they drive off into the middle of the night.

557
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,423
That's a little unfair.

558
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,758
Drunks walk in and out of these parties
all the time.

559
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:52,679
Explain it to him.

560
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,557
Would you take
a look at this, please?

561
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,643
We're monitoring the GPS chip
in Baptiste's phone.

562
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,688
As long as he has it with him,
we can track him.

563
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,238
Extraction could be difficult.

564
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,701
Rescue operations have
a marginal rate of success.

565
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:20,332
The most important thing
is that we eliminate the kidnappers.

566
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,877
Everything else is secondary.

567
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,300
Including Mr Baptiste.

568
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,388
Is that clear?

569
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,486
Just let me handle the questioning,
okay? It's what I do for a living.

570
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,571
There's got to be a method to it, you know?

571
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,449
It's psychology,
you get him to lower his guard.

572
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,284
One sentence at a time, build a rhythm.

573
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:57,577
It's a lot like music.

574
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,997
Break his fucking legs,
he'll give you a Who concert.

575
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,916
Just let me handle it, okay?

576
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,436
That's got to be very uncomfortable.
Here we go.

577
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:28,608
Feel better? That's good.

578
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,530
Now, you know,
you're gonna talk to us, right?

579
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,532
That's a given.

580
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,826
And my associate here, he's a detective.

581
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,663
And he's gonna ask you some questions
and you're gonna answer him.

582
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,124
Remember one thing, though.

583
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,459
If you don't answer to him,

584
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:50,338
you sure as hell are gonna talk to me.

585
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,382
Believe it. You're on.

586
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:01,349
- Nice party.
- Thanks.

587
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,436
I don't remember sending you an invitation,
but I'm glad you enjoyed it.

588
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,521
Oh, I did! Great costumes.

589
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,359
Especially the ladies
in their birthday suits, eh?

590
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:13,027
Don't worry about it.

591
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:16,573
I make sure they're all well-paid
and well taken care of.

592
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,242
I bet you do.

593
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,161
Don't condescend to me, Kato.

594
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,753
- It says here you're a Chicago lawyer.
- That's right.

595
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:33,923
Came here 15 years ago,
passed the Louisiana Bar.

596
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:37,343
Specialised in real estate transactions.

597
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,096
Mr Hot Property, huh?

598
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,431
Thank God for Google.

599
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,602
Well, how does it feel knowing
that you're going to get disbarred?

600
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:52,525
Disgraced in the press, serve hard time,
lose every penny you've ever made.

601
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,527
How long have you been doing business
with Ronnie Earl?

602
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,196
Never heard of him.

603
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,448
No, of course you have.

604
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:02,035
Come on, he hired two hit men
who then murdered Hank Greely.

605
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,538
Ronnie Earl said that you did the hiring.

606
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,707
Yeah, that you paid the money.

607
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,753
You're a crook, Mr Baptiste.
You're an accomplice to murder.

608
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,464
Could we just end the charade? Huh?

609
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,382
I know exactly who you two are.

610
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,511
This is where I live, this is now my city.

611
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,513
I am very highly connected.

612
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,765
You're dealing with people
that are way up the ladder.

613
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,642
You'll never make any of this bullshit stick.

614
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,393
You want my advice?

615
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,896
You let me go and then run to the airport

616
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,065
as fast as you and this dumbbell
can get there.

617
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,234
All right, that's it, okay.

618
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,570
Hey, look, there's nothing you can do to me
I haven't already done to myself for fun.

619
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,988
All right?

620
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,658
How you doing, tough guy?

621
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,493
You think he's comfortable?

622
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,871
Ow! Fuck!

623
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,290
Okay, wait, wait, what do you want?

624
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,625
The tall guy that killed Louis.

625
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,253
- Tall guy. Yeah, it's Keegan.
- Yeah? What's his deal?

626
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:57,924
He's FFL.
Ex-mercenary, Central Africa, West Lebanon.

627
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,510
Now, he contracts out
to Robert Nkomo Morel.

628
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,220
Why'd you set me and Louis up?

629
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:06,140
Morel didn't wanna take any chance that
Greely's death could be traced back to us.

630
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,268
Greely was investigating Morel in DC.

631
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,312
Evidence of his payoffs
to congressmen, senators, judges.

632
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,772
Thought he could blackmail Morel.

633
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,858
Didn't realise who he was fucking with.
That's it!

634
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:18,444
No more!
Hell, I don't want to get myself killed here.

635
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,904
I'm gonna blow your leg off.

636
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:22,365
Okay, I'll tell you about Morel.

637
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,159
He swindled a ton of money
out of West Africa.

638
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,496
He started out buying up
a lot of cheap real estate here in the city

639
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:29,622
using other people's names.

640
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,083
Then he bribed his way into some
big government contract

641
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,376
to redevelop the area.

642
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,421
Look, I mean, this city is up for grabs,
always has been.

643
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,131
We're just taking our share! That's it!

644
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:41,009
This goes way up, man,
we're talking about Washington.

645
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,760
You two are insane if you think that...

646
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:46,055
Okay! Okay, okay, okay, okay, look.

647
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,349
It's around my neck,
I copied Greely's whole life.

648
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,685
Names, dates, accounts,

649
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,562
a little insurance policy
in case Morel got clever.

650
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,233
- Fuck!
- It's a flash drive.

651
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:00,403
Look, you stupid motherfuckers
aren't gonna get away with this.

652
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,738
Keegan's gonna punch your ticket,

653
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,198
and I am gonna be there
and I am gonna watch.

654
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:09,495
I'm gonna have a front row fucking seat.
You stupid and sloppy son of a bitch!

655
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,958
Are you fucking insane?

656
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:17,086
- You don't just kill a guy like that!
- I just did.

657
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:21,049
I'm playing by the rules. Where you live,
the rules are different. All right?

658
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:24,969
He set me up, had my friend killed,
took his chances and paid the price.

659
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,847
By the way, I know guys
that would've done him real slow.

660
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:32,018
- When this is over...
- Oh. You wanna do this dance?

661
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,062
- I won't have a have a choice, will I?
- No, you won't.

662
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,883
Hold!

663
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,468
Hold your fire!

664
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,889
Come on.

665
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,069
Check right!

666
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,488
- Check your six!
- I got a body!

667
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,254
Bomb! Get the fuck out!

668
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,030
A souvenir.

669
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:34,474
You're probably wondering why I happen
to have my safe house all wired up.

670
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,938
Not really. Like most criminals,
you have a paranoid personality.

671
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,050
Here, take the keys and be quiet.
She's probably sleeping.

672
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,129
Oh!

673
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:48,589
What are you doing here?

674
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:51,217
Look, I'm sorry, you must have not heard us.

675
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,594
We were trying to be quiet,
so we didn't wake you up.

676
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,639
I've been up all night.
I was just getting ready to go to bed.

677
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,101
Do you mind if I use your computer?

678
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,019
Oh, that's cute.

679
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,000
Anything interesting?

680
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,335
It's a list of names and payouts.

681
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:31,090
Oh, yeah, I recognise some of them.

682
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:35,386
Uh, that guy's a judge.
Some of the others, local politicians.

683
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,350
What's that folder?

684
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,269
Yeah, go up.

685
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,608
Those are money transfers.

686
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:53,821
Hey, we gotta find this guy,
Robert Nkomo Morel.

687
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:54,947
Shouldn't be too hard.

688
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,574
Yeah, figure out where the asshole is.

689
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:58,576
We keep moving up the ladder.

690
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,958
So, I was thinking that, you know,
what you got going is interesting

691
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,919
because I have always liked tattoos.

692
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,755
- And I think it's fascinating 'cause it's...
- It's just... It's real.

693
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,551
Homicide, Lebreton.

694
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:17,011
Lieutenant, it's Detective Taylor Kwon.

695
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,764
Detective Kwon, how nice of you
to find the time to check in.

696
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,850
Look, I think I broke
this whole thing wide open.

697
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:25,228
There's this guy, Robert Nkomo Morel.

698
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,397
He was chased out of Africa one step
one step ahead of prosecution.

699
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:31,692
I got this flash drive
with a list of all the payouts.

700
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:35,154
As soon as I get back into town,
you'll be the first person I call.

701
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,406
- I told you I'd front you, didn't I?
- Nope.

702
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,659
No. I don't want to have to owe you.

703
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,702
You can make some real money.

704
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:46,249
You got a gift, use it before it passes by.
I'm serious.

705
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,334
Wow, that's great.

706
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:52,505
That's really great.
You're giving me career advice.

707
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,843
All right, forget it.
Bad or good, no good turn goes unpunished.

708
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,556
Tell the cop I'll be outside, okay?

709
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,863
You know, about Jimmy,

710
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,782
you know I'll have to deal with him
at some point.

711
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,242
You mean as a cop.

712
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,203
Yeah, as a cop.

713
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:25,830
All right, look,
just cut him some slack, all right?

714
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:30,835
What if I told you he grew up on the streets,
and then prison.

715
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:33,629
It's the only life he had.

716
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:39,093
Look, you know, I'm sure
he's this brave as hell, very loyal...

717
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,137
But, you know,
we're judged based on our actions.

718
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,807
He's done a lot of bad things.

719
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,437
I better go.

720
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,708
- What took you so long?
- I was saying goodbye to your daughter.

721
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:11,959
Hmm.

722
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:13,836
- Don't.
- Don't what?

723
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,422
- Just don't.
- Don't say goodbye, or...

724
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,926
Oh, don't go there.

725
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:23,346
Shit, it's none of my business.

726
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:27,016
Most of the time,
she doesn't give a damn about me anyway.

727
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,351
I mean, she's all right.

728
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,436
Got a few issues, but what the hell,
who doesn't, right?

729
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,814
- You been married?
- No, never tried it.

730
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,317
Yeah, me either.

731
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,527
So who's Lisa's mother?

732
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,696
Hooker junkie. Dead 15 years.

733
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,366
So, you raised her.

734
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,785
No, I'm not a very good father,
but I supported her.

735
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,996
She turned out to be
a pretty good kid, considering.

736
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,073
When we get ashore,
we gotta split up for a while.

737
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,616
There's someone I gotta go meet.

738
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,159
Who, you got a date?

739
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:31,080
It's a cop, he's from here.
I gotta go tell him what's going on.

740
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,040
So, what about this other guy, Morel?

741
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:38,295
He'll hire an army of lawyers,
and fight the evidence on technical grounds.

742
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,588
But he's still going down.

743
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,132
Down. Is that what you call it? Down?

744
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,258
- Yeah, down.
- Down.

745
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:46,303
Six years at a country club jail,
out in two, back in business.

746
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,555
That's not my idea of going down.

747
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,349
Going down is what happened to Louis.

748
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:54,019
All right, so you do what you gotta do,
I'll handle things my way.

749
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,938
You know what, there is no your way!

750
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,732
Oh, here we go. So much for trusting a cop.

751
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:01,277
- Yeah, you're under arrest.
- Am I really?

752
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,113
Okay, wanna do this dance again?

753
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,449
I tell you what,
unless you're willing to pull that trigger

754
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,993
and put a bullet to the head,

755
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,786
that nine mill ain't gonna be much help.

756
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:12,621
Get out.

757
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,416
It's my car.

758
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,213
As soon as I take Morel down,
I'm coming back for you!

759
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,676
I'll be waiting, Confucius. I'll be waiting.

760
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,013
Amateur.

761
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:32,725
An amateur.

762
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,829
I'd like to talk to you about Mr Keegan.

763
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:56,957
I just talked to him.
I gave him some information I came up with.

764
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:00,836
Turns out the guy that we're looking
for has a daughter. Only child.

765
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,505
All the family he's got.

766
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,924
Well, that sounds very promising.

767
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,136
We'll let Mr Keegan mobilise,
as he would say.

768
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:11,931
But after things calm down,

769
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,808
I need Mr Keegan terminated.

770
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:21,857
These psychotic paramilitaries he uses,
they have a huge respect for him.

771
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:23,526
They see him as a hero.

772
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,486
He's got that perverted sense of honour,

773
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,072
reckless sense of confrontation,
they love that.

774
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,493
Well, that's very impressive, Detective,
but I don't trust him.

775
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:36,205
He does what he does for reasons
other than money.

776
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,708
Sir, I'd think very hard
about this idea of termination.

777
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,126
He's a unique asset.

778
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:46,715
Never trust anyone who doesn't care
enough about money.

779
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:50,970
You see,
Mr Keegan fancies himself as a hero.

780
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,471
Well, guess what?

781
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:57,434
In classical literature, the hero dies.

782
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,784
Hey, how's it going? Just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

783
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:17,246
I need to talk to you. Outside, please.

784
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,123
I can hear you fine in here.

785
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,666
Nothing's easy.

786
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:38,517
No!

787
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,444
All right. Come here.

788
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,821
- You got here fast.
- Not much traffic.

789
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,323
Let's hear it.

790
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,493
Greely and Blanchard are victims
of the same group.

791
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,744
The guy in charge is named Morel.

792
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,873
Greely found out about this in DC
and came down here to blackmail him.

793
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,583
Yeah, I know the rest.

794
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,377
I told you to go home.

795
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:57,304
I know, I've heard the speech.
We should have taken him in.

796
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,943
You know, that still doesn't change anything.

797
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,153
You're welcome.

798
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,072
So, why'd you follow me?

799
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:18,033
I figured Morel had a few more cops
in his pocket.

800
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,830
He was setting me up the whole time.

801
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:27,167
First they take out Greely,
and then you and Louis.

802
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,253
He was there to make sure
my investigation went nowhere.

803
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:37,636
Yeah.

804
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,431
Hello, Jimbo.
You sound like you're having a nice day.

805
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,350
- Who's this?
- You lost your partner last time we met.

806
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:46,270
You and me,
we've got a few things we need to work out.

807
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,647
Hey, hold on a second.
Someone wants to say hi.

808
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,024
- Speak.
- Jimmy.

809
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,409
- They hurt you?
- No, not yet.

810
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,622
You got a good-looking girl.
I got a few ideas what I'd like to do with her.

811
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,125
Touch her and I'll kill you
with a fucking rock!

812
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:09,668
Come here.

813
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,921
This is simple.
We think you have something we want.

814
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:14,214
A flash drive.

815
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:15,591
Looks like I have something you want.

816
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:16,759
Okay.

817
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,221
Don't hurt her. Where you at? Where are you?

818
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:24,266
Market Street Power Plant.
And don't come heavy.

819
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,394
If I see a piece,
your daughter is gonna go right off the roof.

820
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:33,942
So what are we gonna do?

821
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,737
I want to get her back.
Give them what they want, then they die!

822
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,812
You shouldn't be here.

823
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,564
Oh, I think otherwise, Mr Keegan.

824
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:16,068
But don't worry about me.
Just worry about them.

825
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,039
Check him. Make sure he's clean.

826
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,216
He's here. He just rolled up.

827
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:42,928
Jimmy Bobo's in the building.

828
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,975
Okay, Bobo. Up the stairs, third floor.

829
01:09:52,438 --> 01:10:27,806
Hey!

830
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,226
- Make a left.
- Fucking cave bear.

831
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,157
I'm gonna kill you.

832
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,491
Gentlemen.

833
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:51,163
No bickering, please.
We're here to do business.

834
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,583
I assume you brought what I want?

835
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,293
Yeah. Where's my kid?

836
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,796
And where is your friend, the police officer?

837
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:02,507
Who gives a shit where he is?
That's your problem.

838
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:06,511
But you let me go and pay my fee,
I'll hunt his ass down. Fact.

839
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,389
Pay you a fee?

840
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,934
I don't believe I understand.

841
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:15,562
Understand what?
It's 500 grand, he's history.

842
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:20,442
And with that amount,
you would sell your partner out? Like that?

843
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:23,362
He ain't my partner. He's a fucking cop.

844
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:28,951
Half a million seems a bit much,
considering your circumstances.

845
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,662
Your bargaining position is very weak.

846
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,122
250.

847
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,291
Done.

848
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,837
Where's my daughter?

849
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:44,758
She's in the building, don't worry.
She's currently unharmed.

850
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,927
I wanna see Lisa.
You got a problem with that?

851
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,012
Are you guys fucking with me, or what?

852
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:50,806
No problem whatsoever.

853
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,102
Bring her in.

854
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,354
Wait a second. Hey.

855
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,356
You don't have to do this.

856
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,735
When I want your opinion,
I'll buy you a brain.

857
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,270
Hey, let go of her!
Hey! Get your hands off of her!

858
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,938
Let go of her!

859
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,234
You hit her?

860
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,111
How about that.

861
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,612
I think she liked it.

862
01:12:58,249 --> 01:12:59,708
Now, my friend.

863
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,334
The flash drive, please.

864
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,632
Thank you.

865
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,437
Very good.

866
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,023
We're back in business.

867
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:24,816
You can let her go.

868
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,904
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

869
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:32,157
I'd like this thing with the police officer
done quickly.

870
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,825
Don't make me wait.

871
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,703
Let's get out of here.

872
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:45,378
Where's Taylor?

873
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:47,130
He's all right.

874
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,266
Now, Detective Towne,

875
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,436
I want you to make sure that
Mr Bobo and his daughter

876
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:03,897
are safely escorted out of the building.

877
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,023
Yes, sir.

878
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,110
You don't seem to be very happy, Mr Keegan.

879
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:11,446
You're treating this Jimmy Bobo
way too good. Maybe you forgot.

880
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:14,533
Four of our operatives got killed
by this guy last night.

881
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,243
You care about them?

882
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,788
Well, they're mercenaries like you.
They take their chances.

883
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,706
250 is as much as you paid me.

884
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:25,085
Well, Mr Bobo had leverage.

885
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,712
You don't.

886
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,343
I've got plenty of leverage.

887
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:34,970
Mr Towne.

888
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,264
All right.
Look, you don't have an argument with me!

889
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,980
This is my world! Son of a bitch!

890
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,691
I'll kill you! How dare you?

891
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:53,321
I always knew never to trust a man
who doesn't care about money!

892
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,093
Drop your weapon.

893
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:10,232
- Get in there. Get in!
- What?

894
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,858
Just get in there and stay down!

895
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:14,069
Stay down and sit back.

896
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:19,699
There he is! Take him out!

897
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,077
Bitch!

898
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,612
Ready for another round?

899
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,200
I said I was gonna kill you.

900
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,244
Yeah.

901
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,872
It's kind of fun, isn't it?

902
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:51,458
Just you and me, two professionals.

903
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,044
Only one gets away.

904
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,508
Come on.

905
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,638
Look at that.

906
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,350
"Dedicated to the good men
who battled the fire

907
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,643
"that took so many lives
in the year of our Lord,

908
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,020
"1910."

909
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,064
Morel was gonna burn this place down

910
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,941
and build a fucking shopping centre
or some bullshit.

911
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,361
And all the poor bastards
that saved this place,

912
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,363
nobody's gonna remember who they were.

913
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,656
Nobody's gonna even remember
what they saved.

914
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:26,826
Are we gonna fight,
or you plan on boring me to death?

915
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,422
Come here, Jimmy.

916
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:42,008
What are we, fucking Vikings?

917
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,927
Pick it up.

918
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,476
There you go.

919
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:54,813
Pick it up!

920
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,387
I'm impressed.

921
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:38,898
Ohh.

922
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,359
Oh! Oh.

923
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:43,319
Ouch. You okay?

924
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:59,187
Fuck!

925
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,180
I had it under control.

926
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:35,765
Yeah, bullshit.

927
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,475
You were history.

928
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,482
Call it even.

929
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:52,156
Keegan went rogue upstairs
and killed Morel and the rest of them.

930
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,494
We still gotta sort out you and me,

931
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,121
by the law.

932
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:02,166
The law.

933
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:07,005
You know, when it gets down to it,
you're still just another chicken-shit cop.

934
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,678
Let's sort you out.

935
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,930
No! No!

936
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,060
Come here.

937
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:23,146
You son of a bitch!

938
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,522
I know, I know.

939
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,570
Listen up.

940
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:35,366
Keegan shot the guys upstairs.
Tell them I shot the rest.

941
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,369
You tried to stop me, and I shot you, too.

942
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,704
Make that your story.

943
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,209
Yeah, you're welcome.

944
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,300
Lisa, you coming,
or you want to meet some more cops?

945
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,386
I'm gonna stay with him.

946
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,513
Right.

947
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:00,308
I'll be in touch.

948
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,272
Try not to move.

949
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,169
I don't like cops.

950
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,546
You can't trust them.

951
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,006
Let me put it this way.

952
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:35,802
You can only trust them to be
what they really are.

953
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:38,012
But this guy, Kwon,

954
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:42,266
when he turned in his report, guess what?

955
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,686
He didn't rat me out.

956
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:49,691
When the news broke, the story was
the bad guys got greedy, killed each other.

957
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:52,777
So I knew I must have stayed clean.

958
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:57,198
I don't know.

959
01:23:57,282 --> 01:24:00,618
I guess Kwon figured he owed me.

960
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:05,456
Six weeks later, he sent me a message
about maybe having a drink.

961
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,890
I thought I smelled a cop.

962
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:25,601
Guess who's late.

963
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,856
I read about you in the paper.

964
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,316
Looks like you're quite the hero.

965
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,069
Glad everything's working out okay for you.

966
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:38,322
Except for the two holes in my shoulder,
two weeks in the hospital,

967
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,324
and a month of rehab.

968
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,661
I'll be sure to repay the favour some day.

969
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,373
So that's what you came down here
to tell me?

970
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:50,001
Actually, I came down to tell you
a couple things.

971
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,377
All right, shoot.

972
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:54,172
First, I decided to get a tattoo.

973
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,133
Really?

974
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,344
Yeah. Lisa came down to the hospital
to visit me a lot.

975
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:02,513
At the hospital?

976
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:04,724
We got to know each other.

977
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:05,975
Mmm.

978
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,603
Actually, we got to really know each other.

979
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:13,065
Really know each other. That's nice.

980
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,485
You know, I gotta be going.

981
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:16,944
Here's your fortune cookie.

982
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:21,115
I'm not gonna come after you for anything
you did in the past.

983
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,619
But you break the law again
and I hear about it,

984
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:26,537
oh, you're going down.

985
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,127
That'll be the day.

986
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,672
Drinks on my buddy here.

987
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,591
Oh, shit. That hurt?

988
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,814
So that's the way it went down.

989
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:57,902
Nothing much changed except some people
got killed that nobody's ever gonna miss.

990
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:00,655
And I ended up needing a new car,

991
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:03,699
so I went out
and bought myself a special ride.

992
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,787
Why not? You don't live forever.
