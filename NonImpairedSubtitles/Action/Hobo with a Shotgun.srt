1
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,700
Spare some change?

2
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on!

3
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,300
If you wanna make my money you
gotta get rougher than this.

4
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Hey! Hey you!

5
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
You wanna get in on this?

6
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Come On.

7
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,800
Ten dollars.

8
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,100
Ten dollars. Come on!

9
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,500
Hey, fuck you then!

10
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,400
You'll never make money without me.

11
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,600
Alright, alright
let's see some blood.

12
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,700
That's it. That's it.

13
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,200
Go damn it, -

14
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,900
HELP me, they're coming after me!

15
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,800
Please!

16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,000
Lady, please help me,
get this off me!

17
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,800
They're gonna fucking kill me.

18
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
You've gotta help me here!

19
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,700
Please, get this off my neck.

20
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,500
Get back, don't leave me!

21
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Fuck.

22
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,500
You!

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
Please you've gotta help me here.

24
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,500
If you don't help me my hand's
coming off my fucking body.

25
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,700
Please just untie me, that's it.

26
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,200
Oh brother of mine.

27
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Look at you now.

28
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
Boys. This isn't a joke anymore.

29
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
You weren't planning
on leaving town without

30
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
saying goodbye were ya?

31
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah, we've been looking
all over for you.

32
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,900
I was gettin' worried.

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,100
I'm your uncle.

34
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,600
I've known you since you
were fuckin' babies!

35
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,400
This cocksucker gave me the
shittiest Christmas presents.

36
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,700
I hate Christmas.

37
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,900
You fucking brats! Fuck off!

38
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
Drake, stop this, we're family!

39
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,500
It's the rules, Logan.

40
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,800
You're our lucky contestant.

41
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,100
No, please.

42
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,500
Don't put me in there.

43
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,700
Show 'em how to play boys.

44
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,400
Slick. You we're always
my favorite nephew

45
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,600
I swear to God I mean that.

46
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,000
Get your feet in that
fucking deathhole!

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,900
Fuck!

48
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
Ivan my boy.

49
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,900
I want everybody here
to appreciate this.

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,200
Time to get the show
on the road boy-yo.

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Alright you fucking androids.

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,100
My father's got something
he wants you all to see.

53
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,800
And I swear, anybody looks
away for even a second,

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,300
I'll make them wish they
we're fucking aborted.

55
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to the Drake Show.

56
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,000
Tonight's special episode
is going to be filled with

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,700
thrills, and chills,
and my own personal favorite.

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
Lots and lots of that red shit

59
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,700
that flows inside all our bodies.

60
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,600
IVAN?

61
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,800
CHEER you fuckers!

62
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,300
Thank you.

63
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,200
How can you watch
and not do anything?

64
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,900
They're going to
fucking kill me here!

65
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,700
Somebody say something!
Don't just stand there!

66
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,100
You know, ever since our
mother brought Logan home

67
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,600
from the hospital,
I knew he was a fucking coward.

68
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,900
I'll leave town!

69
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,800
You'll never fucking see me again.

70
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,200
Just please, I can't
feel my legs, Drake.

71
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,800
He wants mercy from the Drake.

72
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
From the Drake...

73
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,300
And he should know
better than anybody...

74
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,000
mercy ain't my style.

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
What do you want from me?

76
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,900
Logan is no longer my brother.

77
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,500
Our relationship has been severed.

78
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,100
And now he's all
alone in this world,

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,700
with nothing but a

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,200
barbed wire noose around his neck.

81
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
You can't let him do this!

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,400
It's not just MY life he's ruining.

83
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
Please. Help me.

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,500
Please!

85
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,700
You should have started
beggin' a long time ago.

86
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,000
I've never enjoyed listening to you

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,500
as much as I do right now.

88
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,100
You're a fucking animal Drake!

89
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,600
You're a shitty fucking
weird little animal.

90
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,100
The way I see it,
I'm a fucking miracle worker,

91
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,400
because I am going to make it rain!

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,000
Gun it, Slick!

93
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, can you feel your legs now?

94
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,200
Can ya? Huh!

95
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
Was there something else
you wanted to say to me?

96
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,700
Well, thanks for tuning
in ladies and gentlemen.

97
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,400
Who knows, maybe next time

98
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,200
one of you will be
our lucky contestant.

99
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,600
Enjoy the ride,
my favorite fuckin' uncle.

100
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,300
Go the fuck home everybody!

101
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
And don't forget
to wash your dicks!

102
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
$49.99.

103
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
Ugh.

104
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,300
I dare you to lick his dick.

105
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,400
Woo! Woo!

106
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,000
You bastards!

107
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Hey Slick, you gotta
check this out man.

108
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Fuckin awesome.

109
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
Hey, where the fuck are you going?

110
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,100
Business with dad.

111
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,900
Ah.

112
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,500
Hey Otis. What are ya playing?

113
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,600
I forgot Slick.

114
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,300
I spent all my money in the arcade.

115
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,300
You owe me money.

116
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,500
You're burning me, Otis.

117
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,700
Let me call my mom!
I can get my allowance early!

118
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,500
That must be some
hell of an allowance.

119
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,800
Come on man, he's a kid,

120
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
let it slide.

121
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,800
What did you say to me?

122
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,700
You heard me. Let it slide.

123
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,800
Sh-sh-sh...

124
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,800
The only thing I'm gonna let slide,

125
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,300
is my dick in your pussy.

126
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,700
Hey, Otie - where ya going?

127
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,100
Don't hurt me IVAN!

128
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,700
Shut the fuck up!

129
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
Did that hurt?

130
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,700
No.

131
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,300
You want to know how to
never feel pain again?

132
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,700
No I don't want any more!

133
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,000
Does everybody wanna know

134
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,100
how to never feel pain again?

135
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,200
Come on Otis!

136
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,400
Have at it!

137
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,200
You know how I can tell
I'm making you wet?

138
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,500
No.

139
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,900
Cause you're making
my dick thirsty.

140
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,900
What are you supposed to be?

141
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,200
Some kind of bad ass
murderer or something?

142
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,600
Why?

143
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,300
Does that frighten you?

144
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,100
If you've got money to spend,
nothing frightens me.

145
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,700
Baby, I've got all
kinds of money with

146
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,700
your name written all over it.

147
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,400
Well what are you waiting for?

148
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,300
Let's go.

149
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,200
Awesome.

150
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,400
Nobody messes with you, do they?

151
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,500
Not if they give a
fuck about living.

152
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,500
So how many people have you killed?

153
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,800
What am I? A mathematician?

154
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,100
You're sexy...

155
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,500
You're fucking right.

156
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,400
Are we gonna fuck, or what?

157
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,200
What the hell?

158
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
That's your ride bitch. Come on.

159
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,900
This was not our fucking deal!

160
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm paying you good money.
You're gonna love this!

161
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,400
Let the girl go Punk.

162
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

163
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,900
And who the fuck are you?

164
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Put the knife away kid

165
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,800
or I'll use it to
cut welfare cheques

166
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,000
from your rotten skin.

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,300
Well you better cut
one to Mother Theresa

168
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,800
so you can give it
to her while she's

169
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,200
finger banging you in hell.

170
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
Shut you filthy mouth!

171
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,300
Mother Theresa is a God damn saint!

172
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,400
Serves you right.

173
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,600
What did you think?

174
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,100
He was gonna put a
ring on your finger?

175
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,100
Lock him up with the Sodomites.

176
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,800
And get me the god-damned
chief of police now.

177
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,900
Good day sir.

178
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,400
No, no please, take a seat.

179
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,900
I don't think I've seen
you around here before.

180
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,500
Let me guess,
you rode in on the rail?

181
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,400
That's right.

182
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,000
So I understand you've
been having a little bit

183
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,200
of difficulty with
one of our young men.

184
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,800
Well, I think you're gonna
need a lot of dump trucks.

185
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Dump trucks?

186
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,300
I don't follow you.

187
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,000
You get out there,
get all the criminals,

188
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,100
put 'em in dump trucks.

189
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,700
Take em to a landfill
site and bury them.

190
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,000
Put 'em in the ground.

191
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm not too sure

192
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,000
I know what you're
trying to say here, sir.

193
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,300
What I'm trying to say is that

194
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,500
people don't go bad
like they do here.

195
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,100
Look, if I'm being honest,

196
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,100
I can't argue with
anything you say.

197
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,900
Crime in this city has
become an embarrassment.

198
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,800
I've been suspecting
some of my boys

199
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
are working with Drake.

200
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,600
C of my officers are givingis
that maniac a free reign?me

201
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,900
So thank god for honest
people like yourself.

202
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,800
You better get those officers
and send them packing.

203
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,200
And start this whole
operation all over again.

204
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,400
Between you and me,
I'd love to bring a wrecking ball

205
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,200
down on Drake

206
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,100
But he might as well
be KING around here!

207
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,600
King's fall.

208
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,100
You ought to read a
history book, Chief.

209
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
Now I gave you this little bastard,

210
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,100
put him away for life.

211
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,700
Well, we'll certainly see
what we can do about that.

212
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,500
By the way, did...

213
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,300
anybody officially
welcome you to town yet?

214
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,700
They never do.

215
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,000
Well...

216
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,800
welcome to Fuck-town.

217
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,200
Hold still, you slimy maggot!

218
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Get off me!

219
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,400
These two are the
princes of Fuck town!

220
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,200
Any idea what we should
do with him, Slick?

221
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, hold him still.

222
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Ah!

223
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,300
I'm gonna carve a
billboard into his chest.

224
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
You better get that
knife away from me!

225
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,500
Easy Slick, I think you
might be hurting him.

226
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,700
God, Jesus God boys.

227
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,000
What ever happened to
delicacy and finesse?

228
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
This is so you'll never
forget what you are.

229
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,900
I thought this was
a police station.

230
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,700
Not a fucking circus.

231
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I just wanted to help.

232
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,300
Ah!

233
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And don't forget you
fucking piece of shit,

234
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,900
everyday is garbage day
for street trash like you.

235
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Hey.

236
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,900
You're so hot,

237
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,500
you make me want to
cut my dick off and

238
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,100
rub it all over your titties.

239
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Why don't you just calm down

240
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,700
and tell me what
you're looking for.

241
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
I was hoping to keep it a surprise.

242
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,500
I've had enough surprises tonight.

243
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Quit wasting my time.

244
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
What's it gonna be?

245
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,200
Come on Abby, I'm a regular.

246
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,800
Baby, nothing about you is regular.

247
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,100
Hey, look, I'm the
one with the money

248
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,300
and you're the one
selling your hole...

249
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,200
I know that sweetie,

250
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,300
I'd love to take your money.

251
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,600
So why don't you just
tell me what you're after?

252
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,000
Fuck it.

253
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,900
Just give me the regular, plus 10%.

254
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,200
Okay.

255
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,700
I'm gonna make you love
the taste of my rot!

256
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,300
What the fuck?

257
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,600
Get the fuck off me!

258
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,500
Oh my God.

259
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,400
Help me.

260
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,000
I could use a drink right now.

261
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,600
Do you mind?

262
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,100
I really appreciate your
helping me out today.

263
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,600
If it wasn't for you, who knows,

264
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,100
I'd probably be dead
in ditch somewhere.

265
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,800
I see you have an empty
picture frame here.

266
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,500
Why don't you put a picture of your

267
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,000
famit.

268
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,800
I don't really have
anything worth remembering.

269
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,300
Right.

270
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,500
You seem like a smart
intelligent girl.

271
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,200
You should be teaching.

272
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,700
Tell people about beautiful
things and miracles.

273
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,300
You're obviously not from here.

274
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm not from anywhere.

275
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,900
Yeah, well I fuck for a living

276
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,600
and believe me I don't have
a lot of other options.

277
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,500
Right.

278
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,200
Well, I wouldn't
know about that shit.

279
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
Hey, take it easy.

280
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,400
I think I'm okay now.

281
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,200
I just tell my brain

282
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,700
when I know I'm hurting.

283
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,200
I just say I got nothing
for you buddy...

284
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Nothing to make it go away,
so just go to hell.

285
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,900
And he goes.

286
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,700
He's like a brother to me now

287
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,500
and brothers fight sometimes.

288
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,000
Well, I think it's time to put
you and your brother to bed.

289
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,200
No, I'm not going to stay here.

290
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm gonna go, it's all right.

291
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
No, no, it's okay.

292
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
I want you to.

293
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,600
It's a good one.

294
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,800
I don't even remember
when I slept a real bed.

295
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,300
I am tired.

296
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,500
I didn't get your name.

297
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,900
It's Abby.

298
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,600
Here.

299
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,000
Put this on so you don't
get blood on my sheets.

300
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,400
Oh. Thank you.

301
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,400
Oh, I like that.

302
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,600
This is good.

303
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,300
Thank you.

304
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,000
Well Abby, can I...

305
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,800
tell you something about bears?

306
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,200
Sure.

307
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,600
The bear is a solitary animal.

308
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,800
They like their space.

309
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,700
They live in a magic circle.

310
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,700
They mind if you're
like a mile away,

311
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,900
but if you get inside their circle,

312
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,700
they will maul you.

313
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,900
If a bear's claw would
ever strike your face,

314
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,200
it would take your whole
face right off your skull.

315
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,300
Your eyes, your nose, your lips.

316
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
Everything.

317
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,700
And you would die from it.

318
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,700
Wow.

319
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,800
I didn't know bears
could be so vicious.

320
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,400
They are wild animals.

321
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,100
There's something else about
bears not many people know.

322
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,300
If a bear gets hooked on
the taste of human blood,

323
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,800
he becomes a man killer.

324
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,800
He'll go on a rampage

325
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,400
and has to be destroyed

326
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,900
and that's why you
should never hug a bear.

327
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,500
Give me that fucking money!

328
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,900
You fucking little bitch,

329
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
I'll shove that money up your...

330
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,900
Move bitch!

331
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Make you feel it.

332
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,900
Help!

333
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't let him take me!

334
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,100
Help me someone!

335
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,900
Beautiful. Beautiful.

336
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,400
I love your work.

337
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,400
Hey!

338
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,800
Back for that 10 dollars,
eh dirt bag?

339
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,500
You're right.

340
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,600
Ah!

341
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,100
Yeah!

342
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,000
Beautiful.

343
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,900
I'm only giving you
twenty for that one buddy.

344
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,400
Now get down on your knees,

345
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,800
go on, on you go.

346
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,500
Now I want you to start
chewin' the glass.

347
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
What?

348
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,100
I want you to start
eating that glass.

349
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,900
Go on.

350
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,500
Don't even bother looking at this,

351
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,900
until you start chewing.

352
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,000
Go on.

353
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,100
That's it.

354
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
That's it.

355
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,200
Oh, now smile for the camera.

356
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,500
Holy shit, this is fucking gold!

357
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,300
Now...

358
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,500
pick it up with you mouth.

359
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
That's it.

360
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Arrr...

361
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,400
Good dog.

362
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
You earned your money today.

363
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,600
Yeah.

364
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
Yeah, you heard me right,

365
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,000
I want four big fucking dogs...

366
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,900
Un-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,700
And shave em first.

368
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,400
Lady.

369
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,800
I don't trade for babies.

370
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,100
If you're looking for jewelry
you gotta cough it up.

371
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,800
All right everyone this is
a god damn fucking robbery!

372
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,600
Ah!

373
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,700
Okay, this guy, this guy,

374
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,600
he is a great baby sitter!

375
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,700
Don't worry about Junior.

376
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,400
I'll look after him.

377
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,700
Give me the fucking money or
I'll slit her god damn throat!

378
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,100
Okay, okay.

379
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
What are you waiting for? !

380
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Fucking kill her!
Kill the fucking baby!

381
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,700
Here it is, here it comes.

382
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,400
All right.

383
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,600
Old man you've got five
seconds to give me what I want

384
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,600
or I will end her life.

385
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,900
Put you hands in the cash register,

386
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,100
give me more you piece of shit!

387
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
That's it, that's everything.

388
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,100
1... - No.

389
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,300
2...

390
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,800
Faster, come on!

391
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,100
3!

392
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,800
No!

393
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,900
Come on!

394
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,300
4!

395
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,800
Just fucking kill her already!

396
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,700
I'm gonna sleep in
your bloody carcasses.

397
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,700
Tonight!

398
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,800
Ah!

399
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,100
Jesus Christ!

400
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,100
You vultures

401
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,500
circle this city
tearing off the flesh

402
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,400
from everything that is innocent.

403
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,900
Please don't shoot me.

404
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
I didn't even hurt her.

405
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,100
I want you out of this city,

406
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,500
you and your grave-robbing friends.

407
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,200
Spread the word.

408
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,300
Now!

409
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,000
Pay guns!

410
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,200
Keep the change.

411
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,400
Oh fuck!

412
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,700
Where's the tape?

413
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,500
Leave me alone man.

414
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,100
Take it out.

415
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,700
Now you put it in
your mouth and eat it.

416
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,400
You fucking bitch.

417
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,200
Stop wasting your
time doing homework.

418
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,200
Get up on the block and
make me some money.

419
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,600
Come on baby,

420
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,600
show daddy you ain't mad
at me and give me a kiss.

421
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,300
Listen.

422
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,500
Go home to someone who loves you.

423
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Now.

424
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,500
And you - you're fucked.

425
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,600
Fuck em.

426
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,200
Read em and fucking weep!

427
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,900
You can have the fucking bitches.

428
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,500
Happy Valentines Day,
you fucking sluts!

429
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,800
Kill him! Fucking kill him!

430
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,200
Kill him!

431
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Hallelujah.

432
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,600
I'm gonna come down
both your chimneys

433
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,000
and give you a big present.

434
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,200
Jerk on this you child
molesting shit-licker.

435
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
Ah!

436
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,600
Night watches and other
anti-crime groups have been

437
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,900
seen springing up all
throughout the city and their

438
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,500
inspiration, a brave,
yet still unidentified,

439
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,300
homeless man who has
been delivering justice,

440
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,800
one shell at a time.

441
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,300
A shotgun!

442
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,500
This town is impressed by

443
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,500
a homeless man with
a fucking shotgun.

444
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,100
Ow!

445
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,900
Where's the creativity in that?

446
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,500
So what happened to you?

447
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,400
School bully get your lunch money?

448
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
I don't want to talk about it.

449
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,200
Look Slick, don't make me mad.

450
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,800
Tell me who did this to you.

451
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,500
I don't know. Some bum?

452
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,300
Some bum!

453
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,500
Have you been watching
the fucking news lately?

454
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,700
Don't worry dad,
we carved that fucker up.

455
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,500
You carved him up.

456
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,600
Somebody does this to your brother

457
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
and you treat him like
a Jack-o'-lantern.

458
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,700
Put your head on the table.

459
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,300
Head down, now!

460
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,900
Don't worry son,
everybody gets knocked out

461
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,300
once in a while.

462
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,800
Really?

463
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,600
Have you ever been knocked out?

464
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,500
Fuck no, I'm the DRAKE,

465
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,300
who's going to fuck with me?

466
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,100
But I'm Slick, nobody's supposed

467
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,500
to fuck with me either.

468
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,800
Listen, you've got
a lot of potential,

469
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,800
way more than your brother...

470
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,100
head down.

471
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,400
Maybe even more potential
than me, eventually,

472
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,300
but first you've got to
learn to think bigger.

473
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,900
Bigger?

474
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll crucify him to
a homeless shelter.

475
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That's revenge.
Don't look for revenge.

476
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,100
Look for people's fear.

477
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,900
Okay, fear.

478
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,300
I'll cut a hole through his body,

479
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,100
and I'll make them watch
as I spread his intestines

480
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,500
out all over the street.

481
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,700
Well, you be ugly,
you be hateful when you do that,

482
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,900
some will fear you...

483
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,300
Slick...

484
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,800
I want to fear you...

485
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,200
But I don't...

486
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,700
You've got to show me that
you can scare the shit

487
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,300
out of everybody!

488
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
So why don't you unlock that
imagination of yours and give

489
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,900
them a show that is so fierce

490
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
that everybody in this town

491
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,600
will remember your name forever.

492
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,100
What should I do?

493
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Well, you need to figure
that out for yourself,

494
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,600
but I can give you one
sweet morsel of advice.

495
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,300
When life gives you razor blades,

496
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,300
you make a baseball bat
covered in razor blades.

497
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,400
Do you kids like school?

498
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,600
Hey, I asked you a question.

499
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,500
Do you kids like school!

500
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,700
Yeah!

501
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,400
What about ice cream!
Do you kids like ice cream?

502
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,800
Yeah!

503
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,700
And bicycles!

504
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah!

505
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,700
And Hobos?

506
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,200
Yeah!

507
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,100
I hate Hobos.

508
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:32,900
Disco Inferno

509
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,200
After a horrific act of
arson this afternoon,

510
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,800
a school bus was found burning.

511
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,800
There were an undisclosed
number of children on board.

512
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,700
There were no survivors.

513
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Again, we regret to inform you
that only the charred bodies

514
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,300
of many, many,
burnt children remain...

515
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,400
Hi all you kids out there.

516
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,900
How are you doing today? Good?

517
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,800
Great. Guess what.

518
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,700
I've got something very,

519
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,300
very special to share
with you today.

520
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,800
Are you ready? - Yeah, yeah.
Come on up to

521
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,600
the screen kids. Let go of
your mommy and daddy's hands.

522
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,700
Come, come on, it's okay.

523
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,800
Get as close to the TV as you can.

524
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,100
Do you see this!

525
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,500
This is what you get when
you want to follow a beggars

526
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,000
instead of the DRAKE!

527
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Now It's time to play a new game.

528
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,700
It's called gutter tag.

529
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,100
It's very, very easy.

530
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,100
And every single one
of you gets to play.

531
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,000
All you homeless
people - you're it.

532
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,700
Everyone else - you
get to kill them.

533
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,900
All of them. Otherwise...

534
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
We're going to kill the
rest of your children!

535
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
one more thing before you

536
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,500
continue on your busy day...

537
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,400
I want that Hobo's head on my wall,

538
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,900
and whoever brings him to me,

539
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,900
gets all my broads!

540
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,400
Oh, you're gonna like em!

541
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,100
Grab your guns boys!

542
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,800
Grab your fucking guns.

543
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,000
We got homeless to kill.

544
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,900
So let's go make some dead bodies.

545
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,300
At least he's only
shooting the dirty cops.

546
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,800
We're all dirty cops.

547
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,300
You ever sleep with
a prostitute, kid?

548
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,200
No sir.

549
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,900
Fuck. She's so hot,

550
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,400
I'd eat the peanuts
out of her shit.

551
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,900
Come on. What the fuck
is wrong with you?

552
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,700
This conversation is disgusting.

553
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,100
Well, you can't beat your wife

554
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,600
like you can beat a whore.

555
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,600
That's what I love about them.

556
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Tell you what,
we'll go splits on this one.

557
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,100
You're joking right?

558
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,200
Hey, hey, Abby.

559
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,900
Fuck, I love the smell
of your asshole.

560
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,600
Why don't you get in here
and take me for a ride.

561
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,200
My legs are closed for the night.

562
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,900
Maybe we should get back to work.

563
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,600
You get back to the
fucking station.

564
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,500
Get the fuck out of here!

565
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,800
Come here, baby!

566
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,200
No!

567
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,500
Babydoll.

568
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,500
I am going to break your legs
off to get at your sweetness.

569
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Don't hurt me. I'll do anything!

570
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,400
That's not even a fucking option.

571
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,700
Now, I'll tell you what:

572
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,200
you make sure that I
enjoy what you give me

573
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,000
and I'll make sure that
you can still crawl home

574
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,100
when I'm done.

575
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,400
Oh come on, now I know you want it,

576
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,900
No!

577
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,800
you little fucking whore.

578
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,000
Step away from the girl.

579
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,400
I'm a cop!

580
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,600
Don't do anything fucking stupid!

581
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,500
Shut up!

582
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,500
Look at her.

583
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,200
What do you see?

584
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,400
I don't know man.

585
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
She's... she's just a fuck tube.

586
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,100
She is a teacher!

587
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,600
She despises you,

588
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,600
and so do I!

589
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,600
STOP! STOP!

590
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,500
STOP!

591
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,600
What are you doing?

592
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,200
Let me walk you home!

593
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,500
Why are you out so
late - it's dangerous!

594
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,300
Why are you doing this?

595
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,200
Shit.

596
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,200
What are you doing?
You can't kill them.

597
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,100
I'm cleaning the streets

598
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,900
from the shit and the
smell makes me sick.

599
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,500
They're not bad people.
They're just scared.

600
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,600
You're not afraid of

601
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,200
what they'll do to us
when they come here?

602
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,900
We have to figure something out.

603
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,700
He shot him! The Hobo shot him!

604
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,300
He's back there!

605
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,100
Mom, I need my allowance
early this week...

606
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,800
I just do!

607
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Okay, come on.

608
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,200
Come on.

609
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,300
You're pretty sick, you know that?

610
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,300
Come on, we gotta go.

611
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,700
I gotta go Mom.

612
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,500
Where the hell were you
going after you left here?

613
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,800
What?

614
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,000
Come on, man,
I let you sleep in my bed,

615
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,300
tell me where you went.

616
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,500
I just wanted to buy a lawn mower.

617
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,300
Wait - you wanted
to buy a lawn mower?

618
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,900
Yep.

619
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,800
After all those years living
in box cars and on the

620
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,500
streets, I thought I might
start up my own business.

621
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,400
That's what we'll do.

622
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,200
I've got my own slogan.

623
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,500
You grow it, I cut it.

624
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
You grow it, we cut it.

625
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,200
We'll get out of this
town and go somewhere

626
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,300
where they have nice
big lawns to mow.

627
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,500
This isn't the only
place that grass grows.

628
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,700
Are you serious?

629
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,800
Yeah.

630
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,200
First I gotta wash this
guys asshole off my face.

631
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,600
Slick! Slick!

632
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,100
Slick! They're in there!

633
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,500
Do you need any back-up?
I could join your gang.

634
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Shut up Otis. Now fucking beat it!

635
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,200
You're pissing me off.

636
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,200
Jesus Christ.

637
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,900
Ivan, you're going to
ruin your fucking skates.

638
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,600
I ruin everything!

639
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,100
Let's fuck.

640
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,100
Macaroni, beans, I don't know.

641
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,900
What would you take?

642
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,100
Why are you in such a rush?

643
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,200
You shot a fucking cop.

644
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,700
Everybody wants to kill you.

645
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,900
Oh, all right.

646
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,400
We need a blanket, it's gonna
get cold at night and uh,

647
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,000
some matches.

648
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,900
I don't have much money.

649
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,100
All right.

650
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,200
Don't worry about the money.
We'll hop on a train.

651
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,900
We'll get a job somewhere
and start saving up.

652
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,700
No, no, no, no TV.

653
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,200
We've gotta travel light.

654
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,100
Right. Fuck TV.

655
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,600
Just take what you need.

656
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,300
Okay, I think I'm ready.

657
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,900
Okay, I'm ready too.

658
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,200
Woo!

659
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,700
It's a beautiful day
for a skate rape!

660
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,500
Is there another way out?

661
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,400
Woo!

662
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,500
Oh!

663
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,500
Do you fucking see me?

664
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,800
Do you fucking hear me?

665
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,600
Do you fucking feel me?

666
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,300
Why don't you get up beggar

667
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,500
and beg me for your fucking life.

668
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,200
Ah!

669
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,200
Do you fucking fear me?

670
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Fuck you!

671
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,000
My face!

672
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,700
Don't kill that fuck without me.

673
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,200
Turn that whore
into a baby factory.

674
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,000
Ah!

675
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,200
Hit me again mother fucker!

676
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,000
Come on. Right in my fucking face!

677
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,800
I'm going to wash this
blood off with your blood!

678
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,900
Get away from me!

679
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,700
No!

680
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,800
Don't kill me, don't...

681
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,400
I love murder.

682
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,400
Come on, play with me grandpa.

683
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,000
Fucking play with me Grandpa.

684
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,800
Yeah!

685
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,200
Now we're gettin' rowdy!

686
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,600
Abigail...

687
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Sh-sh-sh...

688
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,700
You!

689
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,200
Do you know me?

690
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,700
He made me come!

691
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,200
Oh God!

692
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,200
Slick, what the fuck
is going on in there?

693
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,400
You better be killing
that fucking hobo!

694
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,500
Get the fuck out of here IVAN.

695
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,700
Now!

696
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,400
Bro?

697
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,700
All right you scum carving fuck.

698
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,200
I'm going to make you
regret a whole lot of living

699
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,200
and teach you some respect.

700
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,500
All right, man, you win, you win.

701
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,900
Just tell me what you want?
My dad owns this fucking town.

702
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,600
I bet there's not on
human being in this town

703
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,500
who's life you haven't ruined.

704
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,600
Pl.. Please don't shoot
my dick off, okay?

705
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,600
I'm young, I've got too
much fucking left to do.

706
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,700
Please!

707
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,000
God damn it boy!

708
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,100
Nooooooo!

709
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,300
I'm gonna get you to a doctor!

710
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,600
Just give me the fucking phone.

711
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,600
What?

712
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,500
Dad...

713
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,700
My whole body hurts

714
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,900
everywhere.

715
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,700
Slick? Where are you?

716
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,700
What happened?

717
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,100
He shot my dick off!

718
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,300
Tell me where you are.
I'll come and get you.

719
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm not gonna make it dad.

720
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,200
I'm dying. I'm dying.

721
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,800
Slick boy, you're tough
and I'm so proud of you.

722
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,000
You're the toughest kid I know.

723
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,700
Thank you.

724
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,300
Hey dad...

725
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,600
You were a pretty rad father.

726
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,000
Slick...

727
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,200
Slick...

728
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,500
Slick!

729
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,400
Fix this girl.

730
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,100
Now!

731
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,500
Stop, you can't do that!

732
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
Just fix her!

733
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,400
Shit!

734
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,000
Summon the plague.

735
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,300
Tell them to bring me that hobo.

736
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,600
Stay with us honey.

737
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,800
Come on, stay with us.

738
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,700
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.

739
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,100
She's fucking dying!

740
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,300
Come on! Stay with me!

741
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,900
Live!

742
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,400
Live you fuckin' whore!

743
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,700
That's it. Come on.

744
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,700
Stay with me. Stay with me.

745
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,400
Hey you.

746
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,600
Welcome back.

747
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,800
It's good to see you.

748
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,600
I wanted to give you something.

749
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,900
They're beautiful.

750
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,500
Just to make sure
you don't forget me.

751
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,000
Where are you going?

752
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,100
I have to get back to work.

753
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,400
Please don't.

754
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,400
You should put them
in your classroom.

755
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,900
They'll be good by the window.

756
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,200
You know I'm not really
a school teacher, right?

757
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,500
You do right?

758
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah, but everybody
ought to have a dream.

759
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
You can't solve all
the world's problems

760
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:43,300
with a shotgun.

761
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,500
It's all I know.

762
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:58,700
A long time ago I was one of you.

763
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,400
You're all brand new and perfect.

764
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,700
No mistakes, no regrets.

765
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,500
People look at you and think of how

766
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,200
wonderful your future will be.

767
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,200
They want you to be
something special.

768
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:25,300
Like a doctor or a lawyer.

769
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:29,500
I hate to tell you this,

770
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,700
but if you grow up
here you're more likely

771
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,700
to wind up selling your
bodies on the streets

772
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:43,600
or shooting dope from dirty
needles in a bus stop.

773
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,300
And if you're successful,

774
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,900
you'll make money selling
junk to crack heads.

775
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:54,600
And you won't think twice
about killing someone's wife

776
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,400
because you won't even know

777
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,100
what was wrong in the first place.

778
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:11,400
Or, maybe you'll end up like me -

779
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,300
a hobo with a shotgun.

780
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,900
I hope you can do better.

781
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,500
You are the future.

782
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,300
That's it!

783
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,500
I am sick and tired of
you fucking junkies!

784
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,700
What's going on?

785
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,500
Abby!

786
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,600
Abby.

787
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,100
Abby, come on.

788
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,900
Ah! Oh!

789
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
Psst.

790
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,800
You got a match?

791
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,000
Ah, the Plague.

792
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,500
You guys fucking rock!

793
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,100
Do you want to see him?

794
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,100
No, I trust you guys.

795
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,700
I can fuckin' smell him from here.

796
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,800
Take him to the truck.

797
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:35,900
You know, I almost
feel sad for you.

798
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,400
You're in the shadow
of your brother.

799
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
And you're just a little tiny thug.

800
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,500
A thug!

801
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,100
Listen you homeless piece of shit.

802
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,300
I'm the only son Drake has left!

803
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,900
And you know what that means?

804
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,900
That means I run the fucking show!

805
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,700
I'm gonna show everybody.

806
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,400
They're gonna fear
the fuck out of me!

807
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,900
In fact, they're gonna
make comic books

808
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,000
out of my hate crimes!

809
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,100
I promise you when
I get out of here,

810
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,200
I'm gonna bite your face off.

811
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,200
That's funny,

812
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,900
because I promised myself

813
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,500
I'm gonna bash your
fucking teeth in

814
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,300
and make a chainsaw out of them.

815
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,700
Fucker.

816
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,900
Hold it right there lady.

817
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,300
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

818
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,500
You want to know if I'm
homeless so you can kill me?

819
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,300
Yeah, are ya?

820
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,600
Some people got a bed to sleep on,

821
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,900
where they can crawl
under the covers

822
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,800
and have a good night's rest.

823
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:57,000
But other people,
they don't got beds at all.

824
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,200
Instead they gotta
find an alleyway,

825
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,400
or a park bench where some
fucker's not gonna stab them.

826
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,900
But just because
they don't got beds

827
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,800
doesn't mean they're homeless.

828
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,900
Cause guess what, they've got
the biggest home of any of us.

829
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,700
It's called the Streets!

830
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,500
And right now, we're all
standing in their home,

831
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:22,600
so maybe we should show
them some god damn respect.

832
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,200
If this is their home,

833
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,900
they've got a right to
keep it clean, don't they?

834
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,600
And sometimes on the streets,

835
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,400
a broom just ain't
gonna fucking cut it.

836
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,300
That's when you
gotta get a shotgun!

837
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,700
So if you want to kill me,
go ahead.

838
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,400
But I'll warn you.

839
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,800
From where I'm standing,

840
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,800
things are looking
real fucking filthy!

841
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,000
Ladies and Gentlemen,

842
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,700
welcome back to the Drake show!

843
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,800
Yeah!

844
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,000
That's how you cheer
you fucking creatures.

845
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,600
Woo!

846
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,600
Thank you. Thank you.

847
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,900
Thank you everybody.

848
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,100
Tonight I have a special
treat for you all.

849
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,300
The culmination of one of
the bloodiest spectacles

850
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,000
we have ever witnessed.

851
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,000
Everybody please a
round of applause

852
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,900
to the team that
made this possible.

853
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,500
The Plague.

854
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:53,200
Now, I want you all to
meet our special guest.

855
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,900
A man I'm sure you've
all heard about.

856
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,500
Ladies and Gentlemen,
without further ado,

857
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,600
let's bring on the man of the hour.

858
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:07,600
The one responsible for the
death of my favorite son.

859
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,300
And here he is,

860
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,500
a worthless,

861
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,000
homeless piece of shit...

862
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,600
Get your hands off me, you demons!

863
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,700
You're crushing my smokes.

864
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,700
When God lost his son,

865
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,100
he knew he'd get him
back in a few days.

866
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,300
He never had to mourn,
not for a single second.

867
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,300
But, I know I can't get son back.

868
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,300
So, what does that make me,

869
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,300
when I know more about pain

870
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:38,600
than the most powerful
being in the universe?

871
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,300
You're a fool.

872
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,300
And a shitty father.

873
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,200
Take him to the glory hole.

874
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,900
Look up at all those people.

875
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,800
I'm your God.

876
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,400
They fear me more than anything.

877
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:10,400
And that fear is what saves
their lives everyday.

878
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,900
If I want something
from them I take it.

879
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,900
If they try to fight
back I kill them.

880
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,100
Fucker.

881
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,100
They live to please me.

882
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,900
Because if they don't,

883
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,200
I cut off their fucking heads!

884
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,900
Well, now you look scared.

885
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,400
Drake.

886
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,400
Eventually, evil...

887
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,000
will turn against evil.

888
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,400
It'll wipe itself out,

889
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,200
leaving nothing but wreckage.

890
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,100
And fucked up memories.

891
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Every time I find
somebody like you,

892
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,100
who wants to be a hero,

893
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,500
who wants to fuck with
me and stop my show,

894
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:11,400
I send em straight to hell.

895
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,100
What the...

896
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,700
Let him go Drake or I'll
chop your boy to pieces.

897
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,500
Abby.

898
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,100
I mean it.

899
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,600
I'll mulch this fucker
into the ground.

900
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,000
What do you think?

901
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,600
Replaceable.

902
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,100
Dad, I'm the only
son you have left.

903
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,300
Quit fuckin' around.

904
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,200
Sorry boy, but...

905
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,900
you've just never had
that much potential.

906
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,700
No one upstages the Drake!

907
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,100
Do you see what I mean folks?

908
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,500
I provide you with nothing
but the highest quality,

909
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,500
adrenaline filled
family entertainment.

910
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,200
Okay, Rip, let's get
us some Hobo head!

911
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,000
Oh!

912
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,900
Let's go home.

913
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,400
Get this off me...

914
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,000
You want to be the
star of this show?

915
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I'll make you shine.

916
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
You take your dirty hands off her,
you bastard.

917
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,300
I'd love to just shoot
her but my audience,

918
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,700
they expect more.

919
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,000
Get your hands off me!

920
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,200
Settle down, honey.

921
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:11,300
This will be the best
trick you ever gave.

922
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,800
Let's start with a nose job, huh?

923
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,800
No!

924
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,700
Get me out of this hole!

925
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,900
How?

926
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,100
Pull my hair!

927
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,600
My hair.

928
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,400
Pull it! Pull it!

929
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,300
Harder! Harder!

930
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,300
Untie me.

931
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,600
Demon's coming back.

932
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,600
She killed Grinder.

933
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:47,000
Now she must take his
place in the Plague.

934
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,200
She's not going anywhere buddy.

935
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,900
Listen to me.

936
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,500
You can't fall asleep now.

937
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,200
You hear me?

938
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,800
There's one more
thing I have to do.

939
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,700
No, I just wanna go to the zoo

940
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:43,300
and see the bears with you.

941
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,700
Don't leave me. Don't leave.

942
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:55,100
Bears don't belong in a zoo.

943
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,400
Stupid fucking bitch.

944
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,100
I'm gonna find her

945
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,100
and I'm gonna fucking kill her...

946
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,600
and I'm gonna cut
his fucking nuts off

947
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,200
and stick it up his fucking ass.

948
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,100
Show's over.

949
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,600
You know, except
for killing my son,

950
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,600
you made my town a
lot more interesting.

951
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,100
You're so fucking crazy.

952
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,700
I would have been
you're biggest fan,

953
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
you worthless street rat.

954
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:58,500
Drop the fucking gun you
cocksucking garbage bag.

955
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,700
Put it down and walk away.

956
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,400
This is your only
chance to leave alive!

957
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,100
You want to die for a town

958
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,700
that never gave a fuck about you?

959
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,400
You'll never beat the Drake.

960
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,800
This town worships me.

961
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,500
Boys, if he shoots.
Kill the fucker.

962
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,500
Whoa, what the fuck are you doing!

963
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,900
Get back inside everybody.

964
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,000
Put you weapons down!

965
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:48,700
I said put the God
damn weapons down!

966
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,400
Okay, get rid of these
fucking animals now.

967
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,800
You fuckers!

968
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,800
You and me are going
on a car ride to hell.

969
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,400
You're gonna miss me.

970
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,000
You're riding shotgun.

971
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Nooooo!
