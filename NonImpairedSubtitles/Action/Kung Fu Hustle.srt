1
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,902
INSPECTOR CHAN

2
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,068
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS

3
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,251
Anyone else?

4
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,595
Such a beautiful woman...

5
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,136
...and you arrest her...

6
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,036
...just for spitting?

7
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,941
Is there no justice?

8
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,207
Is there no law?

9
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,779
Commissioner is only your boss...

10
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,547
...because he paid his dues
to the Crocodile Gang.

11
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,723
And you don't fucking know me?

12
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,525
Sorry, I didn't know
she was your wife.

13
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,628
Ugly coward!

14
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,142
What are you looking at? Never seen
such a handsome gang boss?

15
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,421
Who'd be in the film business?

16
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,354
It's Sunday,
and the theater's deserted.

17
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,661
Where's the car?

18
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,496
Let's go back inside!

19
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,587
Call for help!

20
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,361
No need for that, Northerner.

21
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:01,872
While you were messing with the cop,
your men signed up with us.

22
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,378
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!

23
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:44,245
Stop! You forget the time
I treated you to dinner.

24
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,455
Brother Sum.

25
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,296
Please...

26
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,701
Please spare me.

27
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,106
Don't worry.

28
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:15,511
I don't kill women. You can go!

29
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,943
Thank you, Big Brother.

30
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,523
Cops! Come clean up the mess!

31
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:56,376
THE AXE GANG

32
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,752
In a time of social unrest
and disorder...

33
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,480
In a time of social unrest
and disorder...

34
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,451
...the gangs have moved in
to consolidate their power.

35
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,057
The most feared of them all
is the Axe Gang.

36
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,059
Only in the poorest districts,
which hold no interest for the gangs...

37
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,890
...can people live in peace.

38
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,061
PIG STY ALLE Y

39
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,513
One, two, three!

40
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,423
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!

41
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,944
TAILOR

42
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,683
NOODLES AND CONGEE

43
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,067
My check, please, Donut.

44
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,970
- How much?
- It's on the house!

45
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,342
Donut.

46
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,849
- It's nothing.
- I like you.

47
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,011
I'll ask the wife about
lowering your rent.

48
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,420
Morning, Landlord!

49
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,483
Landlord!

50
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,323
Jill! How you've grown!

51
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,692
Come let me examine you!

52
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,677
Good to see you, Landlord!

53
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,338
What's so good about it?

54
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,676
Don't...!

55
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:22,859
Can you make the skirt slit higher?

56
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,053
Sure!

57
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,698
Look, a comet!

58
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,726
Jane! You naughty girl!

59
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,601
Landlord! You're such a scoundrel!

60
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:42,737
Don't go, Jane! Stay and chat!

61
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,212
I'm only kidding. Jane!

62
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,071
Landlady!

63
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,341
Landlady!

64
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,971
What happened to the water?

65
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,589
Water ain't free!

66
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,996
You talk a lot for someone
who won't pay his rent.

67
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,865
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.

68
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,506
You think that's a problem?

69
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,700
From now on, no water on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays.

70
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,812
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Saturdays.

71
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,849
I just love hearing you fools
complain. Assholes!

72
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,213
Good morning, Landlady!

73
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:58,619
Just pay your rent,
or I'll burn your shop down.

74
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,521
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!

75
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,456
Serves you right you're a coolie!

76
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,831
Months overdue and not even
a "good morning."

77
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,869
You'll be a coolie for life.

78
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,710
There you go, handsome!

79
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,085
What took you so long
with the congee?

80
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,155
I stopped to help an old lady
cross the street.

81
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,087
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.

82
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,490
Was someone just spying on you,
Auntie Six?

83
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:40,223
Don't shoot your mouth off
without proof.

84
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,270
She's crazy.

85
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,533
Go away!

86
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,958
Please can you teach us, sir?

87
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,220
No more soccer!

88
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,762
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.

89
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,596
Take a seat.

90
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,973
Done! Fifty cents, please.

91
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,010
Isn't it great?

92
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,812
It's too good!

93
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,851
Why'd you make him look so good?

94
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,959
Why?

95
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:00,031
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy. I'll handle this.

96
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,704
He's boss of the Axe Gang. Don't you
see the two axes? We're bad guys.

97
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,711
Making him look good
is really bad. Understand?

98
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,179
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!

99
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,978
But I like you, so just pay me,
and I'll take care of it.

100
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,212
No way!

101
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,256
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.

102
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,991
I really care for you. You saw it
for yourself. Seriously.

103
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:32,501
Why don't you pay up. Not much.
Enough for a drink.

104
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,832
Oh, so it's blackmail!

105
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,006
Boss!

106
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,004
Boss!

107
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,012
Now you're dead!

108
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,711
Looks like he's waking up!

109
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,220
I'm not afraid.

110
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,358
You can kill me.

111
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,926
But there'll be thousands more of me!

112
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,397
You want to play tough? The Axe
Gang boss is napping in there.

113
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,366
Whoever wants to die,
step forward.

114
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,140
So you want to fight?

115
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,369
Great! We'll go one-on-one.

116
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,708
Don't even think about cheating.

117
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,709
That old woman with the onion!

118
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:26,389
You look real tough. Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.

119
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,495
What do you do?

120
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,394
I'm a farmer.

121
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,058
Farmers don't fight. Piss off!

122
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,602
He's crazy!

123
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,296
Calling me names?

124
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,067
You're lucky you're a woman.

125
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:50,510
Hey, shorty! Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.

126
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,421
What did I say about cheating?

127
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,851
Sit back down!

128
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,522
You! The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.

129
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,828
No, not you. I mean...

130
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,129
You!

131
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,034
Hey, kid, let's rumble!

132
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,807
All right, all right!

133
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,672
So no one-on-ones today.

134
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,043
You're all such wimps!

135
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,114
He blackmailed me.

136
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,685
Fat woman, you're
in charge here, right?

137
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,622
Fat woman, my ass!

138
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,556
I'm with the Axe Gang!

139
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,856
Axe Gang, my ass!

140
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,020
Boss!

141
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,791
Boss, my ass!

142
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,229
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!

143
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,667
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!

144
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,970
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!

145
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,649
You nitwit! Let's see you call backup!

146
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,647
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.

147
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:08,820
Don't you go away! Go put
a down payment on your coffin!

148
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,773
Who threw the firecracker?

149
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,505
I'm one of you, brother.

150
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,362
Mind your own business!

151
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,033
It's raining. Go bring in your laundry!

152
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,608
Fat woman!

153
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,892
You blackmailing me too? I ain't afraid.

154
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,202
I...

155
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,893
Did anyone see what happened?

156
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,566
Don't! My back's broken!

157
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,037
Call for help!

158
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,721
Hold on, calm down. You hungry?

159
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,287
Keep quiet.

160
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,108
No.

161
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,458
Who did this?

162
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,239
I'll count to three.

163
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,237
One...

164
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,817
...two...

165
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,456
I did it!

166
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,161
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?

167
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,460
Sorry!

168
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,594
Look away, kid.

169
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,207
Get rid of him!

170
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,569
We're the bad guys!

171
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,772
We're meant to do the ass-kicking...

172
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,877
...not the other way around.

173
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,385
And it's all because these morons
posed as Axes.

174
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,787
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.

175
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,723
We'll handle this.

176
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,796
You! Take care of it.

177
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:52,075
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living. Give me a break.

178
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,912
Pick that one too, if you're so good.

179
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,309
Come.

180
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,820
I'll count to three.

181
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,649
Hurry!

182
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,226
Ready? Three!

183
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,037
That's quick!

184
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,901
Brother Sum, we really
want to be Axes.

185
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,980
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.

186
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,647
Ever killed anyone?

187
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,308
I've always thought about it.

188
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,086
Then go kill someone.

189
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,223
I will!

190
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,650
Go on!

191
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,550
Thank you, Brother Sum.

192
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,598
We can always find a use for that type.

193
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,846
I told you before,
you've got to look tough.

194
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,506
Tougher!

195
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,615
Tougher!

196
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,247
Act the part.

197
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,891
And try to stay awake.

198
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,424
It's tiring being tough.

199
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,688
Tiring? It's our living!

200
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,529
The streets out there are filled
with money and women.

201
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,432
You only need the will
and determination...

202
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,938
...to seize the opportunity to win.

203
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,767
This is our big chance!

204
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,640
We just kill someone,
and we're in the gang.

205
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,606
Then it'll be money and women
all the way!

206
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,418
Don't be like those beggars...

207
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,351
...with no ambition.

208
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,458
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!

209
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,460
Get lost!

210
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,133
Come here and say that!

211
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,464
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!

212
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:58,234
The four-eyes, the fat woman
and all the residents of Pig Sty.

213
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,173
But they're good at kung fu.

214
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,178
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?

215
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,979
Didn't I tell you I know
Buddhist Palm kung fu?

216
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,225
Hey there, handsome boy. Stop.

217
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,657
Amazing!

218
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:23,330
Do you know you have
a special aura?

219
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,371
You're so young, but you have
the bone structure...

220
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,940
and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.

221
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:35,707
If your chi flow can be channeled,
then you will be invincible!

222
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,441
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.

223
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:44,685
The duty of upholding world peace
and punishing evil will be yours.

224
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,179
Sure.

225
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,528
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.

226
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:54,222
But as it's fate,
I'll let you have it for $ 10.

227
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,559
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL

228
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,067
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.

229
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,508
I was saving to study to be
a doctor or lawyer...

230
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,080
...but this was world peace.

231
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,438
Let go of the girl!

232
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,227
Hey! It's the Buddhist Palm!

233
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,725
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."

234
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,629
You must be loaded.

235
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,196
Have you killed anyone lately?

236
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:22,385
He's a fool, and she's mute. Losers!

237
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,989
I realized then that good guys
never win. I want to be bad.

238
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,920
I want to be the killer!

239
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,425
- Ice cream!
- Where?

240
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,996
Make mine a vanilla.

241
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,533
Chocolate for me!

242
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,073
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?

243
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,683
Look at her run!

244
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,375
You're such kung-fu masters,
go take it on the road.

245
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,877
You belong in the circus, not here!

246
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,279
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.

247
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,951
Everyone has his reasons.

248
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,214
We don't want to make trouble.

249
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,086
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.

250
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,388
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!

251
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,728
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.

252
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,833
You okay?

253
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,296
Masters.

254
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,906
We have nothing precious
to give you...

255
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,415
...but take this as a token
of our appreciation.

256
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,187
Thanks for saving us!

257
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,922
Stop the crying. This isn't a show!

258
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,660
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?

259
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,634
You may know kung fu,
but you're still a fairy.

260
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,043
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!

261
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,975
Once a fairy, always a fairy.

262
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,675
Look at you. What's with
the red underwear?

263
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,342
Why not a diaper while you're at it.

264
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,647
What's wrong with red underwear?

265
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,724
Where were you
when there was trouble?

266
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,853
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!

267
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,521
I'll reason with you.

268
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,965
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.

269
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,400
Pay up or pack up!

270
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,733
Don't you worry. I'll pay it.

271
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,399
Think you're a smartass,
Rabbit-Tooth Jane?

272
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,205
What's it to you, tub of lard?

273
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,540
Bitch!

274
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,343
Calm down, Landlady.

275
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,811
This is your fault.

276
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,321
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.

277
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,653
How could you do that?

278
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,762
Shut the hell up!

279
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,240
You think you can out-yell me?

280
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,113
The fat lady can really sing.

281
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,643
Watch this!

282
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,797
What happened?

283
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,106
What do you mean,
what happened? You try it.

284
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,242
- Me?
- Quick!

285
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,346
Sorry! You okay?

286
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,451
I think you should get closer
and take better aim. Okay?

287
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,611
Okay!

288
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,497
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?

289
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,608
Where's the third knife?

290
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,710
God knows where it went.

291
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,346
Could it be the same one? Can't be...

292
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,277
- Don't!
- Sorry.

293
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,283
What are you trying to say?

294
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,618
I just remembered I have
something to do. See you!

295
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,286
Uh-oh. They've seen us!

296
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,230
Stay back!

297
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:13,903
Don't panic! Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.

298
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,636
Please, no more bright ideas.

299
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,217
Oh, what the hell!

300
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,550
Not you again, asshole!

301
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:33,094
Get back to your business!

302
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,422
Split up!

303
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,863
Split?

304
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,134
What're you doing here?

305
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,466
Looking for you. Weren't you hurt?

306
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,835
I'm fine!

307
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,811
How come you always recover so fast?

308
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,637
I don't know.

309
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,644
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.

310
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,046
Maybe it's better that way.

311
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:14,920
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!

312
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,925
I never knew you were so deep.

313
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,654
All the sadness one can bear...

314
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,905
...down the river everywhere.

315
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,804
Hey, get out of the way!

316
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,243
Move!

317
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,077
I'll slap you to kingdom come!

318
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:44,285
Look at those four-eyes
carting around a coffin.

319
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,613
What morons!

320
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,988
Don't blame me for making you leave.

321
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,224
We'll let Buddha decide...

322
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,101
...whether you stay...

323
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,704
...or go.

324
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,600
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE

325
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,353
Have some tea.

326
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,692
We're grateful for
some professional help.

327
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,532
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School...

328
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:40,700
...Iron Fist from the Hung School
and the Hexagon Staff...

329
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,269
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.

330
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,711
Their warrior days are long over...

331
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,653
...but they're still top fighters.

332
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,889
This job is a great challenge for us.

333
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,751
Now, that's professionalism.

334
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:03,264
Number One Killers. Expensive, yes,
but worth every penny!

335
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,423
No!

336
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:09,665
Number one is the Beast,
the world's top killer.

337
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:14,441
He was so dedicated to kung fu,
he went crazy.

338
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,911
I heard he's now in an asylum.

339
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,815
So you're the top killers now.

340
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:26,355
Strictly speaking,
we're just musicians.

341
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:31,424
<i>A song that wrenches the heart</i>
<i>O where do I find a knowing ear? </i>

342
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:36,098
Great poem, isn't it?

343
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,699
We'll be saying goodbye soon.

344
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,367
Who knows when we'll see
each other again.

345
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,311
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.

346
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,783
Let's take this opportunity
to spar a little.

347
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,388
No. We still have a lot to pack.

348
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,887
You're right.

349
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,331
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!

350
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,366
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!

351
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,837
Hexagon Staff, with its
thousand moves. Mystical!

352
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,640
Till we meet again!

353
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,309
More lipstick!

354
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,699
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.

355
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,687
Sorry, we're closed.

356
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,888
You can make a suit in no time.

357
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,555
We're moving.

358
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,565
This is good material!

359
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,568
You know your stuff.

360
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,267
This has high artistic value.

361
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,206
How high?

362
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,475
At least a few stories...

363
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,712
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.

364
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,047
Let's kill them all and make
this place a brothel.

365
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,212
Don't block my view!

366
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,762
What's going on?

367
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,344
Good!

368
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,351
Don't block my view!

369
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,690
Damn! I told those nitwits to leave,
but they're still here.

370
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,592
- Really?
- Yeah.

371
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:09,148
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?

372
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,317
Sorry, sorry. It's nothing!

373
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:55,055
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.

374
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,099
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!

375
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,492
Die? In this racket?

376
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,696
Sorry, sorry!

377
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,999
Get out of my way!

378
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,507
Hang in there, Tailor.

379
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,615
Be quiet!

380
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:30,595
Give us a break! Why push us so far?

381
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,476
There's another master?

382
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,588
It's the Lion's Roar!

383
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,097
I thought that was a myth.

384
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,271
Who knew the Lion's Roar
really exists?

385
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:26,034
That's the last we'll see of them.

386
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,544
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!

387
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,542
Start the car!

388
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,450
Boss!

389
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,889
Keep it down! Have you no manners?

390
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,460
Get lost. People are trying to sleep.

391
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,599
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!

392
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,463
Scumbags!

393
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,349
I can't hang on much longer.

394
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:29,597
But having seen
real masters like you...

395
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,392
...I can now die in peace.

396
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,503
Don't say that.

397
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,606
We're ordinary folks.

398
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,537
Ordinary's a blessing.

399
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:43,167
Don't call us masters.

400
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,246
But you're such great fighters!

401
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:49,681
If only you'd helped earlier,
they wouldn't have to die this way.

402
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:54,350
Like Donut said,
everyone has his reasons.

403
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,854
Years ago...

404
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,454
...we saw our only son killed in a fight.

405
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,394
Revenge can be devastating.

406
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,930
Do you understand?

407
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:11,198
Why don't you train us
to be top fighters...

408
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,366
...and we'll avenge them!

409
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:18,704
Becoming a top fighter takes time.

410
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,442
Unless you're a natural-born
kung-fu genius.

411
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:25,384
And they're one in a million.

412
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,157
It's obvious I'm the one!

413
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,930
Don't think so.

414
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:47,275
Everyone! We swore
we'd never fight again.

415
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,844
But we broke that promise today.

416
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,574
For your own safety, please all leave!

417
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,582
In great power lies great responsibility.

418
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,957
There's no escaping from it.

419
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,921
Donut, you're hurt bad.

420
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,655
Rest now.

421
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,037
We can't understand
what you're saying.

422
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:18,766
Donut!

423
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,812
I know you, four-eyes!

424
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:39,821
You seem prejudiced against
the sight-challenged.

425
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:43,295
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.

426
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:50,870
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.

427
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,134
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?

428
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:57,502
Help me!

429
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:03,080
"Help me! Help me!"
Want to play, punks?

430
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,084
The Dragon Style? The Tiger Style?

431
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:14,263
Come down here, and I'll smash
your glasses. Come on!

432
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,162
You know I'd do it, right?

433
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,833
Swear to it!

434
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,769
Swear!

435
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,908
Have you no respect? Where were you
when I needed you?

436
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,376
You sound like a wimp!

437
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,713
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.

438
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:40,617
No killing, no arson,
no robberies, no rapes...

439
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,350
...all because of you!

440
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,858
You're a numb-nut!

441
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,595
Follow me!

442
00:57:58,274 --> 00:57:59,901
It's a stickup! Where's the money?

443
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,009
Where's the money?

444
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,745
What're you looking at? I'm serious!

445
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:19,685
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.

446
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:39,775
The money's in here.

447
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,549
Let go of the girl!

448
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:35,231
He's a fool, and she's mute. Losers!

449
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:22,116
Go away! You're dragging me down!

450
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:27,982
Go home and raise pigs.

451
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,385
Go, before I kill you.

452
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:26,613
You! Whatsyourname!

453
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:39,128
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!

454
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:43,129
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.

455
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,199
Brother Sum!

456
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:55,868
One look at you, and I knew
you'd do anything.

457
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,168
Right!

458
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,143
You just needed your chance.

459
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:00,974
Damn right!

460
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,811
We've an assignment for you.

461
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,543
Anything, Brother Sum!

462
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,398
"Research on abnormal people."
What's that?

463
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,373
A mental asylum.

464
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,345
Soldiers!

465
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,247
Boy Scouts!

466
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,409
Tanks!

467
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,556
No worries.

468
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:44,352
When the Boy Scouts change shifts,
you have exactly five minutes.

469
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:48,463
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell...

470
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:53,295
...and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.

471
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,698
What about you guys?

472
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,868
We're your lookouts.

473
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:16,214
Five minutes. Hurry!

474
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:35,361
The world's top killer
indeed looks the part!

475
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,731
It's only a title.

476
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:42,359
Cut the bullshit. We want two people
killed. Name your price.

477
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,429
Name my what?

478
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:52,076
I've killed so many trying to find
a worthy adversary.

479
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:55,714
So far, I've never found one.

480
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,883
That's why I stayed inside.

481
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:02,457
Had I met my match,
I'd have been out long ago.

482
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,093
If you find me a worthy opponent...

483
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,559
...I'll do it for free. No charge!

484
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,892
Do you have someone?

485
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:16,300
Yes. Brilliant fighters who are
up to the challenge.

486
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,804
But first, will you show us
some moves?

487
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,035
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.

488
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:26,677
You numskulls aren't worthy!

489
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:32,848
He doesn't look the part.

490
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:38,955
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.

491
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,028
You sure you got the right guy?

492
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:44,530
Absolutely. I swear I did
exactly what you told me.

493
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:49,794
Please show us some moves,
Mr. Beast. Don't make it hard for me!

494
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,599
You dumb or what?

495
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,432
You know what this is, old man?

496
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:57,311
Ever seen a fist this big?

497
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,608
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!

498
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,717
Really? Try me, then.

499
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:08,716
Is he okay?

500
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:17,057
So you say you can fight?

501
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,456
Harder!

502
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:21,325
Harder!

503
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:25,904
Harder!

504
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:32,303
You hit like that and call yourself
a gangster?

505
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,583
A foreign gun!

506
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:09,582
In the world of kung fu,
speed defines the winner.

507
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,590
The Beast is the best of them all.

508
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:20,522
The Axe Gang extends its respect!

509
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,171
The real masters,
together in one room!

510
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:10,473
Only the world's top killer...

511
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,841
...has such an aura.

512
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:14,810
Likewise.

513
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,079
Could you two be the fated lovers...?

514
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,243
Paris...

515
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:20,513
...and Helen of Troy!

516
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,984
A pleasure, indeed.

517
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:27,093
We're here to deal
with the Axe Gang...

518
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,992
...and only the Axe Gang.

519
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:33,766
You should've killed me before.

520
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:38,540
Now you're committing suicide.

521
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:42,040
You're living on borrowed time.

522
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:45,203
You can't escape your fate!

523
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,280
What's this? A funeral bell?

524
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:52,451
With the Beast here,
let's see whose funeral it is!

525
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,018
So you're on their side?

526
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,352
Don't get me wrong.

527
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:01,121
I only want to kill you...

528
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,198
...or be killed by you.

529
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,670
What do you think?

530
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:14,173
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.

531
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:18,143
So be it. Let's do it.

532
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,308
Okay.

533
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,874
Let's do it!

534
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,405
Piece of cake. I can handle this.

535
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,717
Good try, but a little off target.

536
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,160
The Lion's Roar?

537
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,256
Wait!

538
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:07,266
I didn't know the Lion's Roar
could be done with a speaker!

539
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:09,768
What a blow!

540
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:42,400
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.

541
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,560
You do it!

542
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,731
- I'm gonna puke! I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!

543
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,976
You! Come over here.

544
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:56,143
- Hit him!
- Yes!

545
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,489
- The head!
- Of course!

546
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:04,387
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.

547
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,357
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!

548
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:07,654
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

549
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,319
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!

550
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:10,760
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

551
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,696
Beat the shit out of him!

552
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:15,759
What're you doing?

553
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,440
You want me to hit him
or beat the shit out of him?

554
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,542
You're making me very confused!

555
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:52,863
Wow, that's a big fist!

556
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,839
Why did you hit me?

557
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:59,104
Where are they?

558
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:01,602
How could you let them escape?

559
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:11,709
No one gets away from me!

560
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,562
Why did he save us?

561
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:30,830
Young people make mistakes.

562
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:34,939
But at least he finally made good.

563
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:39,207
Look at him! Beaten to a pulp.

564
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:45,249
Do you have any last requests?

565
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:07,440
Hey, wait!

566
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,643
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.

567
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:10,028
There's no one here!

568
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,438
CHINESE MEDICINE

569
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:34,118
It's a miracle he lasted this long.

570
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:37,060
The herbs should help him.

571
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:41,702
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.

572
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:46,204
All his bones and tendons are broken.

573
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:49,309
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.

574
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,972
It can't be possible...

575
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:53,705
Unless he's...

576
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,576
What's that smell?

577
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,579
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.

578
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,548
Let me handle this.

579
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,808
This makes no sense.

580
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:43,515
Who knew the Beast could clear
the chi flow...

581
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:46,252
...and thus unleash
the boy's true potential?

582
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,362
We should've guessed.

583
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:53,999
He is the one!

584
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,380
Is this for real?

585
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:09,108
You're still alive, you turncoat?

586
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:11,684
Kill him, men!

587
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,008
What kind of move is that?

588
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:10,868
Kids' stuff!

589
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:42,368
If our son were alive,
he'd be his age now.

590
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:47,880
If he studies hard, he could grow up
to be a doctor or lawyer.

591
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:50,882
A stuntman, more likely!

592
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,606
Not bad. Let's go.

593
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,719
I can even stop bullets...

594
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:54,466
What? The Toad Style
of the Kwan Lun School?

595
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:55,830
Oh, no!

596
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:55,355
Remember the Palm move
that falls from heaven?

597
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,686
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.

598
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,335
I surrender!

599
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:47,300
What kind of move was that?

600
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,231
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.

601
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:04,315
Master!

602
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:21,993
Hey! Tell him not to put snot
on the glass.

603
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:24,757
You two, put your pants on!

604
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:27,594
No licking if you're not buying!

605
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:38,564
Kid, you have the bone structure
of a kung-fu genius.

606
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:42,539
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.

607
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,304
Because it's fate, I'll let you
have it for $ 10.

608
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:46,537
Wait!

609
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:49,381
You want more...?
