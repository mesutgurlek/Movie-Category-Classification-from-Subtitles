1
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:18,967
I wonder what reservation
they let him off of?

2
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:28,415
My trucks overheating.

3
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:32,752
It's 30 miles to the next station.
I need some water.

4
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:38,523
Maybe you should've stolen
a better truck, Tonto.

5
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:48,835
- You've got a big mouth, convict.
- He's only joking, Chief.

6
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:54,413
- Could I have some water?
- You mean firewater, Tonto?

7
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,079
Jesus Christ. Hold it!

8
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:03,154
He's a state prisoner, you asshole.

9
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:06,622
Knock it off.

10
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,660
Hold it, you asshole.

11
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,393
Get out of the way.

12
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:23,069
Don't move, convict.

13
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:37,951
APO 657, unit 25 to APO 478.

14
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:41,855
Escape in progress.
Two officers shot.

15
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:45,759
Fugitives in a blue flatbed truck.
Two men.

16
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:51,461
An Indian, tall, 200 pounds,
escaped with Albert Ganz.

17
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:56,439
They're armed and dangerous.
Get here, quick.

18
00:04:57,477 --> 00:05:03,313
Escape in progress. One Indian
and prisoner Albert Ganz.

19
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,092
If we slept over at your place,
you could put on a clean shirt.

20
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,502
What makes you think I've got
any clean shirts at my place?

21
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:06,073
Great morning.

22
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:18,319
I want her young, tall, thin.
Real thin.

23
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:22,086
She's got to have nice legs.

24
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,663
I don't like jeans. Jeans are cheap.

25
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:33,261
A dress. A nice summer dress.
No, I know you don't get it.

26
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,537
- What about me?
- I need one more for my friend.

27
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:42,944
Make her an Indian.
No, not with a turban.

28
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:46,210
A squaw.

29
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,651
It'll be the Walden Hotel,
near Broadway.

30
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:57,923
Ask for... G P Polson.

31
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:01,625
Just be a couple of hours. Right.

32
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:25,589
- That's a crummy breakfast.
- I've got a crummy day ahead of me.

33
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,061
- What are you talking about?
- Jack, I hate that attitude.

34
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:37,067
What difference does it make?
I make you feel good.

35
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:41,697
- What do you want from a guy?
- You make me mad.

36
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:46,369
I don't have time for this.
I've got to go to work.

37
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:06,198
- You really are hopeless.
- That's what I always say.

38
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:11,133
- Call me later.
- You want me to? Good.

39
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:16,674
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Here, take this.

40
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:20,210
You know what the man said:

41
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,942
The coldest winter I ever spent, was
the summer I was in San Francisco.

42
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:32,151
We aren't going by the store again.
We need to save a little bit.

43
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:36,015
- I liked that carpet.
- We can't afford it.

44
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:40,318
I know we can't afford it,
but I'd like it.

45
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:44,953
You want me to go out
and steal for the money?

46
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,301
- Surprise, Luther.
- You were locked up.

47
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:59,241
- I want the money that Reggie hid.
- What are you talking about?

48
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:04,577
You want that Indian
to snap her neck?

49
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:08,686
- We were partners.
- Billy, break it.

50
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:13,918
No. I'll get you the money,
but I can't get it till Monday.

51
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:19,531
Honest. The place we've got
it stashed is closed.

52
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:24,636
Monday morning is when it opens.
I'll get the money right to you.

53
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:33,612
I always liked you, Luther.
You were fun to hang out with.

54
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,773
- We're going to keep her.
- Trust me.

55
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:44,253
If you mess with us, I'll put holes
in her you never even thought of.

56
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:47,825
- Ganz, please.
- Don't fuck up.

57
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,621
Rosie!

58
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,128
- Hey, Algren, need any back up?
- No, you make me nervous.

59
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:27,756
Your wife makes you nervous.
The radio said you had something on.

60
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:31,665
A guy named Polson
had his credit cards lifted.

61
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:35,899
One of Polson's cards rented
that green coupe over there.

62
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,640
It's just a laugher?

63
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:44,271
It was a kid with a switchblade.

64
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,649
- Well, you guys are experts.
- We don't need any big artillery.

65
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:54,486
I'm just trying to help out.
I love to watch pros work.

66
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,494
- I don't need your help.
- You can come in.

67
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:02,122
Stake out the lobby.
How's the car running?

68
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:07,329
- How's the wife?
- Mean as a snake.

69
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,479
You guys were in last week.
I'm not supposed to be hassled.

70
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,627
- We just want to search a room.
- Not unless you've got a warrant.

71
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:36,064
- You should've been a lawyer.
- What the shit is this?

72
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:40,365
- We're looking for a Mr Polson.
- Room 27.

73
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,634
- Okay, get it over with.
- Is he alone?

74
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,246
A couple of girls went up.

75
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:52,350
- You guys be careful.
- And you stake out the lobby.

76
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:57,250
- I'll let you handle it, Al.
- Thank you.

77
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:34,950
This isn't exactly
my life's ambition.

78
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:41,327
It's a part-time thing. I've got a
kid who's staying with his granny.

79
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:47,406
You don't want to hear personal
stuff. Are you listening to me?

80
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:55,372
Did you hear a goddamn word I said?

81
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:05,284
How much money have you got left?

82
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:23,068
Hi, Liz. It's me.
What's going on?

83
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:30,410
Nothing, just a couple of cops.
How was your date?

84
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:37,989
You've got to stop
sitting still for that kind of shit.

85
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:03,572
Ask who it is. Right?

86
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:10,912
- Who is it?
- Police, open up.

87
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:16,026
- Open up, right now.
- Keep stalling.

88
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:20,188
Hang on,
I've got to put something on.

89
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:36,104
When I tell you to jump,
you jump.

90
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:47,225
Call for help now!

91
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,326
Operator?

92
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:49,251
Jack, there are two of them.

93
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,398
Stay here.

94
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:10,365
- Operator...
- Drop the phone, lady.

95
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,680
Let me go.

96
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:29,984
Billy, bring her out.
He ain't going to shoot.

97
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:36,268
Come on.

98
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,174
Shut up.

99
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:56,851
My God!

100
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,993
No!

101
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:18,705
You, toss me that piece,
and he won't waste him.

102
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:25,511
Jack, don't give them the gun.
Don't do it!

103
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:33,123
Don't do that for me.

104
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,616
Get the car.

105
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:34,611
Nice gun.

106
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:08,543
- What happened?
- Read the report.

107
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:13,088
Two cops get blown away
by a credit card booster?

108
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:18,219
- Those guys were good cops.
- They fucked up.

109
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:22,333
That's what you say,
that's what you always say.

110
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:26,460
- We're always fucking up.
- The truth hurts.

111
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:31,303
- It don't figure.
- Can I borrow a piece?

112
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:35,641
When somebody steals your gun
you usually file a report.

113
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:39,978
Two cops died
because you fucked up.

114
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:44,815
That isn't going to bring them back.

115
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:50,792
Cates, I want to see you right away.
Do you read me?

116
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:54,990
I hear you. Your voice carries.
Five minutes.

117
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:04,739
There's a lot of people
getting shot with 44s lately.

118
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,607
People must be getting
mad about something.

119
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:14,083
- You're an accessory to murder.
- Give me a break.

120
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:17,722
His real name is Albert Ganz.

121
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,656
He's from back East,
but did an armed robbery out here.

122
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:25,695
He broke out of prison
a couple of days ago.

123
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:28,799
A real animal. Read this.

124
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:34,901
Did he give you a return match,
or didn't he like the merchandise?

125
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:38,532
- Fuck you.
- I'll take a rain check.

126
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:42,943
This is from the first weapon
Ganz used.

127
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:47,347
It's a perfect match,
but it's not from the Walden Hotel.

128
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:52,422
It was fired six hours earlier.
We found him on a park bench.

129
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:55,389
There are some bad people out there.

130
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:59,622
If there weren't,
what the hell would we have to do?

131
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:06,033
He took me down, then he put on
the tv. Then you people arrived.

132
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:11,233
That's it, but I think he's going
to give you guys a hard time.

133
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,471
He likes shooting cops
a lot more than getting laid.

134
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:20,676
This is his stuff from the hotel.
The big guy's room was empty.

135
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:29,755
A speedloader.
This guy's got a 44 like yours.

136
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:34,058
- He's serious about his artillery.
- Here's the files.

137
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,370
- Billy Bear.
- He's worked with Ganz before.

138
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:43,804
- Who's this guy?
- Henry Wong. He worked with them.

139
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:48,140
Kehoe, come here.
I want to show you something.

140
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:55,276
- Tell me, same guy?
- Dick Fucking Tracy.

141
00:22:55,487 --> 00:23:01,426
- Any of these guys still around?
- One of them is in the slammer.

142
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:05,063
- Get in here, Cates.
- Yeah!

143
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,563
Goddamn speedloader! Kehoe.

144
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:16,532
I want to be left alone on this one.

145
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:22,978
There's an official department
policy about cop killings.

146
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:28,085
Any man crazy enough to kill a cop
is a great danger to civilians.

147
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:33,281
We can't seem
like we're in the revenge business.

148
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:36,552
What's bothering you?

149
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:40,221
It bothers me when cops get killed.

150
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,335
You might be more of a team player
on this one, hot dog.

151
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:49,270
Hotdogging has been working
real well so far. I've got a lead.

152
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:52,308
You can do things your own way.

153
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:58,439
You nail this guy
and make us all look good.

154
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:02,314
But if you screw up,
you're going down.

155
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:07,618
You know how to send a guy out
with a real great attitude.

156
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:47,229
- I'm here to see Reggie Hammond.
- He's in 18.

157
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,664
- You want company?
- No, thank you.

158
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:57,504
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to sell your body to the night</i>

159
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:04,377
<i>Roxanne you don't have</i>
<i>to put on the red light</i>

160
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:12,920
<i>you walk the streets for money</i>
<i>don't care if it's wrong or right</i>

161
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:16,390
<i>Roxanne! </i>

162
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,291
Is that Hammond?

163
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:28,667
- Hammond.
<i>- Put on the red light! </i>

164
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:33,170
<i>- Put on the red light! </i>
- Hammond!

165
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:41,652
- Have you got a name, cop?
- Cates. I want to talk to you in private.

166
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:47,923
You're single,
no fixed address, no relatives.

167
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:51,790
One conviction, armed robbery.
Six months to go.

168
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:55,957
- Are you writing my life story?
- Not likely.

169
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:59,194
I just need a little help.

170
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:05,405
It's Henry Wong. An old friend
of mine. He's looked better.

171
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:12,847
I've been in that cell for 2<i>% </i>½ years.
I'm getting out in 6 months.

172
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:17,988
You've come to the wrong person.
I don't fuck my old friends over.

173
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:22,718
That's too bad. I thought
maybe you were a smart boy.

174
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:26,763
I guess if you were real smart,
you wouldn't be a convict.

175
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:31,266
A second-rater like you
would be no help against Ganz.

176
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:35,770
Ganz will be in jail
for two years after I get out.

177
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:41,538
It didn't work out that way.
A big Indian busted him out.

178
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:45,408
- Cates.
- Yeah?

179
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:50,350
I can help you get Ganz
if you get me out of here first.

180
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:54,253
To get him
I've got to be on the street.

181
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:59,728
I want Ganz as bad as you,
and we've got no time.

182
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:02,731
- Bullshit.
- I'm serious.

183
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:08,897
- Get me out of here.
- I'll think about it, Reggie.

184
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:11,941
Cates!

185
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,308
You've got to get me
out of here, man!

186
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:19,916
Cates!

187
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:24,122
Fuck you!

188
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:37,033
- Let me borrow your pen, Bob.
- Are you using your own name?

189
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:39,796
Shit, no.

190
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:47,405
If all this comes down,
I'm not going to burn for you.

191
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:52,482
And if it comes down,
your ass is new-mown grass.

192
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:56,643
- You've got him for 48 hours.
- Sure thing.

193
00:27:56,855 --> 00:28:02,384
You've got a big career ahead of you
as a forger.

194
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:19,603
- Hammond.
- Okay, send him through.

195
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:24,340
You've got to sign him.
He's all yours.

196
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:31,388
- You need me more than you thought.
- That shows you how desperate I am.

197
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:36,584
- Is that suit prison issue?
- $957. I wore this shit in.

198
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:41,199
- We're after a killer.
- My reputation is as a ladies' man.

199
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:46,326
Maybe we can get you dressed
and go on a pussy hunt.

200
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:51,101
I've already got that department
taken care of.

201
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:56,304
You've got a lady? The generosity
of women never ceases to amaze me.

202
00:28:56,481 --> 00:29:00,349
I don't work like this. No deal.

203
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:06,047
- We have no deal. I own your ass.
- What a way to start a partnership.

204
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:10,024
We ain't partners,
brothers, or friends.

205
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:13,596
I'm keeping you
until Ganz is locked up or dead.

206
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:19,169
If Ganz gets away, you're going
to be sorry you ever met me.

207
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:21,771
I'm already sorry.

208
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,652
This is your car? It looks like
you bought it from a brother.

209
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:39,348
I got you out. Where are we going?

210
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:43,153
We've got to see
a guy called Luther.

211
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:46,764
- Is Luther part of the gang?
- What gang, Jack?

212
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:53,929
I can read a police file, shithead,
and quit calling me Jack.

213
00:29:54,106 --> 00:30:00,011
- It's better than shithead.
- I may call you worse than that.

214
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:32,068
Right up there,
but he isn't expecting company.

215
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:38,911
Luther isn't very stable.
I don't want you getting shot.

216
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:42,780
Right there. 232.

217
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:49,324
- What are the chances he's packed?
- 100%.

218
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:52,463
You'd better leave me a gun.

219
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:58,869
Sure thing, asshole.
You just hang on.

220
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:05,466
I hope this big move of yours
turns out to be something.

221
00:31:56,962 --> 00:32:02,298
What's happening, Luther?
Did that hurt? It looked real painful.

222
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:08,004
Luther, I'm talking to you.

223
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:14,669
- Hammond, drop that gun.
- Don't point that gun at me.

224
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:19,180
- Don't point your gun at me!
- Hand me that gun.

225
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:44,937
- I'm looking for Ganz.
- I haven't seen him for years.

226
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,206
You just took a shot at me.
I think you know where Ganz is.

227
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:52,043
Who gives a fuck what you think?

228
00:32:57,689 --> 00:33:02,126
You better tell this boy something.
He's having a ball with this door.

229
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:09,831
Luther, are you angry with me?

230
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:14,938
What are you smiling at?
Your big move turned out to be shit.

231
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:20,336
I was defending myself.

232
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:24,073
- I want to make a citizen's arrest.
- Shut up!

233
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:29,152
- What have you got there, Jack?
- Carrying a concealed weapon.

234
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:33,724
Resisting arrest.
I'll think up some more tomorrow.

235
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:38,352
- I bet you will.
- Get him out of here.

236
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,193
- Bye, Luther.
- Fuck you, Reggie.

237
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,892
I want a lawyer.

238
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:50,600
You stay right here... okay?

239
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:53,767
Get your hands off me.

240
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:10,026
You ladies look like
you need some assistance.

241
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:15,064
We don't need some court-appointed
lawyer trying to bullshit us.

242
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:21,695
The city is coming down
on people involved with vice.

243
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:28,502
- Hello?
- Jack Cates, any messages?

244
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:35,483
Some lady called to say she still
wants her occasional roommate.

245
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:40,681
<i>She'd like to talk it over</i>
<i>tonight after work. </i>

246
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:47,559
Look, Elaine, I don't know
when I'll be able to come by.

247
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:50,758
I'm working too hard at this.

248
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:55,736
I'm not happy about it. I've got
a few things to take care of.

249
00:34:55,907 --> 00:35:00,071
This is not the way people
who care about each other behave.

250
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:05,108
Shit!

251
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:09,617
You're both going to do
a little time. 30 days each...

252
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:14,815
...unless we talk
some real business.

253
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:20,089
- We can go in this room.
- Let's go.

254
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:28,502
- I was about to get some trim.
- We're not on a trim hunt.

255
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:33,975
- My stomach is starting to growl.
- We eat when I say we eat.

256
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:40,380
I want some food now. If you
don't like it, take me back to jail.

257
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:46,990
You've been treating me like shit.
I want to eat in a nice place.

258
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:54,189
Hold it. I'm hungry.
Let's go get something to eat.

259
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:57,425
I want mandolins and violins...

260
00:35:57,602 --> 00:36:02,039
Here...
There's your goddamn dinner.

261
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:05,565
Come on.

262
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:13,907
- Who was that on the phone?
- None of your business.

263
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:18,077
- Keep your mouth shut.
- I think it was your lady.

264
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:24,057
- What's her problem?
- The same as half the population.

265
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:28,131
She can't get the job she wants.
It pisses her off.

266
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:31,393
- What do you care?
- I'm in jail.

267
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:35,596
I was surrounded by guys
in blue suits 24 hours a day.

268
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:39,539
The clothes you wear,
you look like you'd love it.

269
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:44,671
- Where to, convict?
- Mission District. Indian hangout.

270
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,969
- Tell me about your girlfriend.
- I don't give out details.

271
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:15,078
I've been in prison. I'm tired
of hearing lies about pussy.

272
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:18,272
- Was it last week?
- Last night.

273
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:21,612
- Was it fun?
- Yeah...

274
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:25,346
In the morning
we got in a fucking argument.

275
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:28,993
At least you took care
of business first.

276
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,425
Does she have big titties?

277
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:37,500
I can see this is going
to be a long night, convict.

278
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:52,372
- What's the deal?
- Billy used to work at this club.

279
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,987
- I heard him talk about it.
- This is a bad neighbourhood.

280
00:37:57,155 --> 00:38:01,615
You just back me up.
Pretend like you've got a piece.

281
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:05,421
They may beat me up,
but they'd kill you.

282
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:10,796
It's amazing how far a gun
and a badge will take some guys.

283
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:15,406
A bullshit attitude and experience
is what gets you through.

284
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,147
White cops
used to fuck with me and my friends.

285
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:28,479
- They just flash their badges.
- Experience is what counts.

286
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:31,416
- You want to bet?
- Two problems.

287
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:35,821
I ain't playing games,
and you've got nothing to bet with.

288
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:42,297
If we get any kind of lead, turn
your back and let me get some pussy.

289
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:46,494
Any man who talks about women
like you, can't get it up anyhow.

290
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:51,165
I've been in prison for three years.
My dick gets hard if the wind blows.

291
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:59,010
It's a bet, but when you lose,
you tell me the truth.

292
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:03,643
- What is Ganz after?
- What are you talking about?

293
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,984
Fuck you! The bet's off.

294
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:10,252
All right, look...

295
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:14,797
If I lose, I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

296
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:21,901
You've got a deal. Hell, I might
even give you my badge.

297
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:25,509
Bullshit and experience
is all it takes.

298
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:31,513
Come on and experience
some of my bullshit.

299
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:14,455
Not a popular place
with the brothers.

300
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:19,961
I always liked country boys.
They'll sure as hell like you.

301
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:39,647
Howdy.

302
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,861
- How do?
- Yeah?

303
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:03,495
I'd like something to drink.
Vodka.

304
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:06,541
How about a Black Russian?

305
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,515
Black Russian. That's a funny joke.

306
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:20,351
I'm black,
but I'd rather have plain old vodka.

307
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:23,551
As we're standing here talking. - 

308
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:29,325
- I wonder if you know
where I could find Billy Bear?

309
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,733
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of Billy Bear?

310
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:40,144
Look here...

311
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:46,005
- You heard of him now?
- What are you talking about?

312
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:51,154
- I'll look around for a while.
- I don't give a shit what you do.

313
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:53,688
Good.

314
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:12,033
I've never seen so many backward-ass
country fucks in my life.

315
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,907
You look like regulars.
I'm looking for Billy Bear.

316
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,243
This is our place, nigger.

317
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:23,513
You're a big, tough, country faggot.

318
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:28,447
Are you out of your mind?
Get up against that pole.

319
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:32,595
Do you think
I'm playing a goddamn game?

320
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:40,995
This is a police matter. I'm looking
for an Indian named Billy Bear.

321
00:42:41,172 --> 00:42:45,131
I know everybody in here
wants to cooperate with me.

322
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:52,846
That's not even necessary.
I've got the situation in hand.

323
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:58,955
Some of us citizens
are behind you all the way, officer.

324
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:05,187
- What's you problem?
- I'm on parole.

325
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:08,594
Sit your country ass down.

326
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:13,192
Listen up.

327
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:17,137
I don't like white people.
I hate rednecks.

328
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:21,870
You people are rednecks.
I'm enjoying this shit.

329
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:28,976
- You're loaded here.
- Tax refund.

330
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:32,713
Bullshit!
You're too stupid to have a job.

331
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:39,191
You don't like that?
You hate that shit, right?

332
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:45,393
- What kind of cop are you?
- I'm your worst nightmare.

333
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:50,063
I'm a nigger with a badge. I can
kick your ass whenever I like.

334
00:43:55,246 --> 00:44:02,311
One of them was underage,
another attacked a police officer.

335
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,819
You're going out of business.

336
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,721
Let's see
what we can fuck with next.

337
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:15,156
Okay, listen... The Indian
hangs out with a chick up the block.

338
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:19,235
Chinatown. She lives
on top of the jewellery store.

339
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:24,898
- I didn't ask about the girl.
- You'll have to settle for that.

340
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:28,671
That's all I know.

341
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:36,042
Look, hoss, you start
running a respectable business -

342
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,418
- And I won't have to come in here
and hassle you every night.

343
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:50,196
The rest of you cowboys should know
that there's a new sheriff in town.

344
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:59,073
His name is Reggie Hammond.
You all be cool.

345
00:45:20,331 --> 00:45:24,358
- How's it going?
- You've got something for me.

346
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:30,371
- What are you talking about?
- The gun you took off the redneck.

347
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:35,368
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

348
00:45:35,546 --> 00:45:41,576
- There you go.
- And the switchblade.

349
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:44,983
You don't miss anything, Jack.

350
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:48,317
It was real smooth how I took it.

351
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:53,657
You owe me a piece of ass.
Give me the gun, we'll call it even.

352
00:45:53,831 --> 00:45:59,098
You did a good job, Reggie.
You deserve a reward.

353
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,238
Here.

354
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:11,313
- Fucking bastard.
- That I am.

355
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:17,079
Hey! Let's go get us an Indian
down the alley.

356
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:34,430
I don't think anybody's home.

357
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:37,597
Let's check around back.

358
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:50,385
I hope we have as much fun
as we had in that hillbilly bar.

359
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:55,355
Did you see the way
I handled those boys?

360
00:46:55,526 --> 00:47:01,226
Why don't you get a megaphone
and announce we're coming?

361
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:13,371
- What the hell are they watching?
- I don't know.

362
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:19,073
tv has changed. Get this.

363
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:23,678
That must be Billy's girlfriend.

364
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,822
- Police, nobody move.
- Stay where you are.

365
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:38,466
- Drop it, or he gets another one.
- This girl thinks she's Babe Ruth.

366
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:43,198
- Police. Put the goddamn gun down.
- Don't give me that police shit.

367
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:48,144
Look, don't shoot.

368
00:47:48,312 --> 00:47:52,612
I'm just going
to reach for my badge.

369
00:47:56,487 --> 00:48:00,787
- I've seen fake badges before.
- Hey, sweetheart...

370
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:04,223
Listen up.
This guy's one nervous cop.

371
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:08,127
Shut up! I'm the calm type.

372
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:12,292
I know you don't want me
to shoot you.

373
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:16,166
Just hand me over the gun.

374
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:26,011
- You assholes better be real.
- Hey, let's see your badge.

375
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:30,415
- I don't have a badge.
- Call the cops.

376
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:37,757
Put that phone down. You're both
going to answer some questions.

377
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:45,727
All right...
which one of you sees Billy Bear?

378
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:52,035
The son of a bitch isn't here
and he's not coming back.

379
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:58,273
- You can do better than that.
- He hasn't been here for two weeks.

380
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:01,612
It sounds like a stormy romance.

381
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:07,587
Yeah, I went a couple of laps
around the track with him.

382
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:12,024
Wait, I've been
in prison for three years.

383
00:49:12,196 --> 00:49:17,259
Maybe these ladies would like
to go around the track with us.

384
00:49:17,434 --> 00:49:20,597
- Fuck off.
- Come on.

385
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:27,000
If you find Billy,
tell him to stay out of my life.

386
00:49:28,112 --> 00:49:30,637
Let's go.

387
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:37,682
This sucks!

388
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:42,052
A maniac gets hold of my gun
and starts killing people with it.

389
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:46,128
I ought to be at home in bed
with my girl. - 

390
00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:53,294
- Not out on the streets
with a charcoal-coloured loser.

391
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,270
Just leave.
I can take care of Ganz by myself.

392
00:49:57,441 --> 00:50:00,410
You can't take care of shit.

393
00:50:00,577 --> 00:50:04,343
You've been dicking me around
since we started.

394
00:50:04,515 --> 00:50:11,318
- You've given me nothing.
- I'm impressed with you, too.

395
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:15,185
Kicking in the door
on a couple of dikes.

396
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:20,194
Either Luther or you has to tell me
what the fuck this is all about.

397
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:23,595
You got 48 hours.
The clocks running.

398
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:28,295
- I don't like the way you ask me.
- Who gives a damn?

399
00:50:28,472 --> 00:50:33,000
You're just a crook
on a weekend pass.

400
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:37,739
You're just a spear-chucker
with a prison number.

401
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,780
I'm through fucking around.

402
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:46,922
Tell me the truth
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

403
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:53,757
You're going to kick my ass?
You've lost your mind.

404
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,196
I'm not in the mood.

405
00:50:57,368 --> 00:51:01,065
It's going to be embarrassing
for you and the police force.

406
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:05,004
Look, nigger, I fight dirty.

407
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:49,713
You little fucker!

408
00:51:51,088 --> 00:51:55,923
Don't put me in the fucking garbage!
Get the fuck off!

409
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:37,697
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

410
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:41,360
- It's all right. I'm a cop.
- Get your hands up.

411
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:47,673
I'm too fucking tired.
My gun and badge are in the car.

412
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:51,576
Check it out, Bill.
Get in the car.

413
00:52:56,787 --> 00:52:59,756
What the hell is going on?

414
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:05,395
Two women called and said a couple
of hoods broke in to their place.

415
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:11,592
We rousted them.
You can straighten it out.

416
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:17,365
Why don't you do it yourself?
We've got better things to do.

417
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:23,207
- I'll file a report tomorrow.
- I'll file a report tonight.

418
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,941
It goes with the territory.

419
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:41,426
- It's good your friends came.
- You want to try it again?

420
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:46,297
- You'd call your buddies back.
- They saved your ass.

421
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:52,466
- That's what you'll tell them.
- I'll put it in my report.

422
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:56,579
I bet you will.

423
00:53:58,115 --> 00:54:01,983
- How much do I owe you?
- Ten bucks.

424
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:07,314
Mother fucker!

425
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:17,660
You come clean or we're going again,
right here and now.

426
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:22,066
I want to know what's going on
between you and Ganz.

427
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:35,241
I've been waiting for some money
for a long time... $ <i>% </i>½ million.

428
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:40,713
Are you starting to get the picture?

429
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:45,054
Tell me about the money.

430
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:50,097
Me and some friends
hit a dealer during a sale.

431
00:54:50,267 --> 00:54:53,430
It's the kind of money
nobody reports stolen.

432
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:59,941
One of the guys dropped dime on me.
He now has your gun.

433
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:04,945
- He's after your money?
- You're a real bright cop.

434
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:10,576
How much do you want?
Do you want to split it 50-50?

435
00:55:10,754 --> 00:55:14,690
- Not likely, convict.
- I can't have any of it?

436
00:55:14,858 --> 00:55:18,521
I believe in the merit system, boy.

437
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:24,133
- I'll be real good from now on.
- Where's the money?

438
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:31,396
In the trunk of my car.

439
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:34,510
Right, partner.

440
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:44,886
But get this: We ain't brothers,
partners or friends.

441
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:50,049
If Ganz gets away with my money,
you'll be sorry you ever met me.

442
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:10,239
- Where's the goddamn car?
- Be cool, the car's parked.

443
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:14,748
- For three years? Bullshit!
- Bullshit?

444
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:19,752
I'll let you in on a little secret.
You just passed it.

445
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:38,370
- Now what?
- Now you get to play cop.

446
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:43,138
Watch that building
while I have a sleep.

447
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:48,751
You son of a bitch! You knew
where the money was all along.

448
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:54,482
- I almost got my ass shot off.
- Being a cop is a hard job.

449
00:56:54,691 --> 00:57:00,254
The garage opens at seven o'clock.
Wake me up at a quarter to.

450
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:07,097
Jack, tell me a story.

451
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:12,037
- Fuck you!
- That's one of my favourites.

452
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:16,445
Yeah, yeah...

453
00:57:57,687 --> 00:58:01,919
- You're sleeping on the job.
- They open in five minutes.

454
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:06,461
- Go look for Ganz.
- You took a chance leaving it here.

455
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:11,897
I knew Ganz was away.
I knew Luther wouldn't cross me.

456
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:16,334
Lutherjust crossed the street.

457
00:58:18,175 --> 00:58:23,670
The guy took a shot at a cop
and is back out on the street.

458
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:27,283
The judicial system is shit.

459
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:33,482
- I want to pick up my car.
- What's the name?

460
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,215
Reggie Hammond.

461
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:40,021
- This is three years old.
- Yeah, I've been busy!

462
00:58:40,197 --> 00:58:46,864
Al, bring out 29-012.
It's been here three years.

463
00:58:47,037 --> 00:58:53,169
- Charge the battery.
- We do that every month.

464
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,985
Thanks a lot.

465
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:16,356
There he is.

466
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:53,035
Look at all the dust on my car.
He should take it to a car wash.

467
00:59:53,203 --> 00:59:56,400
I didn't know darker people
went in for foreign jobs.

468
00:59:56,573 --> 01:00:02,205
Some white asshole had just bought
the last shitty sky-blue Cadillac.

469
01:00:36,246 --> 01:00:40,774
I hope none of my fellas
sees me riding around in this car.

470
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:44,886
- I don't care how it looks.
- It has no class.

471
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:50,994
Class isn't something you buy.
Look at you in that $500 suit.

472
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:21,056
- Is that suit yours?
- They used to be in style.

473
01:01:21,257 --> 01:01:26,889
If you switch from armed robbery
to pimping, you're all set.

474
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,127
That's the money.

475
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:37,736
Look out!

476
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:16,358
Hey, put that down.

477
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:27,306
Luther!

478
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:38,420
I'm going after the money.

479
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:08,647
Come on. Stay close.

480
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:04,640
- Freeze.
- I'm a cop.

481
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:51,046
Meet me at Vroman's,
and bring the shit. Thank you.

482
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:28,080
Vodka with a twist,
and I'd like to run up a tab.

483
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:34,897
- Hey, baby, I'm Reggie Hammond.
- So what?

484
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:43,105
- Hey, my name's Reggie Hammond.
- I'm with somebody.

485
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:50,602
How you doing?
My name's Reggie Hammond.

486
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:54,177
This ain't my night.

487
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:36,047
- You look awful.
- Yeah? Well, so do you.

488
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:42,664
From what I've heard, you've
lost Ganz for the second time.

489
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:48,099
And some soul brother
beat the crap out of you.

490
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:52,367
- Did any calls come in?
- Nothing.

491
01:08:53,843 --> 01:08:59,008
Kehoe.
Ordnance.

492
01:09:00,817 --> 01:09:05,151
<i>- Your reports are late, Cates. </i>
- They'll be in tomorrow.

493
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:11,817
You can depend on it.
Bullshit.

494
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:15,293
- I'm heading out.
- I've got to wait for a call.

495
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:19,834
You really ought to get some rest.

496
01:09:20,002 --> 01:09:24,598
Yeah, he's here.
Cates, for you. Line three.

497
01:09:26,008 --> 01:09:30,604
- Motherfucker, where are you?
- I'm at work, asshole.

498
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:37,686
Elaine, I'm sorry. I thought it was
somebody else. Police business.

499
01:09:37,854 --> 01:09:46,489
- No wonder you're so popular.
- I'm sorry about all this.

500
01:09:46,662 --> 01:09:49,256
- Jack.
- Jack?

501
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:54,768
I almost forgot, your pal
from the vice squad phoned.

502
01:09:54,937 --> 01:10:02,469
- You rousted a bar with him last night.
- Why didn't you tell me?

503
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:06,206
- What's the goddamn number?
- It's on my desk.

504
01:10:06,382 --> 01:10:12,719
- I've got to put you on hold.
- Don't put me on hold.

505
01:10:14,056 --> 01:10:17,253
You son of a bitch.

506
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:22,027
It's under the light.

507
01:10:35,945 --> 01:10:38,846
- Reggie Hammond.
- Where are you?

508
01:10:39,015 --> 01:10:44,749
I've been waiting for you to call.

509
01:10:44,954 --> 01:10:49,391
I'm at Vroman's in the Filmore.

510
01:10:49,559 --> 01:10:54,758
I know you don't know the place.
The brothers hang out here.

511
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:59,527
I'll be right there.
Don't move your ass.

512
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:03,695
- Elaine's on the other line.
- Jesus!

513
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:08,302
- Elaine?
- Jack... Fuck you!

514
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:11,378
Shit.

515
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:01,848
- My name is Reggie.
- I'm Candy.

516
01:13:02,058 --> 01:13:06,654
Look, if I don't get some trim
tonight, I'm going to bust.

517
01:13:06,829 --> 01:13:12,267
- You know, sex.
- Can't you ask me better than that?

518
01:13:14,737 --> 01:13:19,834
It's 10:05, by 10:10,
I want to be into some flesh.

519
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:24,878
Let's go across the street...
I don't have any money.

520
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:28,710
You can't even pay for the room?

521
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:33,014
Jack, I want you to meet
my friend Candy.

522
01:13:33,222 --> 01:13:36,123
- Hello.
- And goodbye.

523
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:41,855
- Maybe I'll see you later.
- I hope so. You're so rude.

524
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:46,092
- Where's Luther?
- Where's Ganz?

525
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:51,205
You missed him. Luther took a cab
to the hotel across the street.

526
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:55,571
- Maybe we should pay him a visit.
- It makes no sense.

527
01:13:55,745 --> 01:14:00,444
There's a Do Not Disturb sign
on his door. We'll see him tomorrow.

528
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:05,350
- That way we'll catch Ganz.
- Why don't you just take the money?

529
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:10,048
I could have done that,
but I want Ganz as much as you do.

530
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:14,195
I'll let you in on a secret...

531
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:20,760
Keep it. I'm too tired
to argue about that.

532
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:29,275
Thanks for calling.

533
01:14:34,383 --> 01:14:39,218
Calling you a nigger,
I didn't mean that stuff.

534
01:14:39,388 --> 01:14:43,347
I was just doing my job
and keeping you down.

535
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:49,327
Doing yourjob
don't explain everything, Jack.

536
01:14:55,204 --> 01:15:00,642
As long as you're being Abe Lincoln,
you see that girl?

537
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:05,247
She'd love to take me to a hotel
and fuck my brains out.

538
01:15:05,414 --> 01:15:11,080
- I need the money for a room.
- I've got...

539
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:21,124
- 20.
- That should be fine.

540
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:26,564
- Have fun.
- I'll have sex, Jack.

541
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:35,275
- You come here often?
- This is my favourite place.

542
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:41,246
This is my wife.
Are you whispering in my wife's ear?

543
01:15:41,417 --> 01:15:45,046
I've got rent money for one night.

544
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:49,554
Lack of pussy makes you brave, man!
Let's go.

545
01:15:57,366 --> 01:16:01,700
- Where do you want to go?
- Over to the hotel.

546
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:12,309
Shit! Excuse me, please.

547
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:19,216
- Wait a minute!
- That was quick.

548
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:23,152
Luther's on the move.

549
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:58,419
Open your coat... both sides.

550
01:17:00,562 --> 01:17:04,089
- Let her go.
- Money first.

551
01:17:04,266 --> 01:17:10,899
Show me. Set it there.

552
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:16,568
- Rosalie, are you okay?
- What are you talking about?

553
01:17:16,745 --> 01:17:19,942
I said I wouldn't hurt her.

554
01:18:28,183 --> 01:18:31,550
Goddamn! You lost a stolen bus!

555
01:18:31,754 --> 01:18:36,782
Five deaths are related to Ganz, and
you blow it for a nigger convict.

556
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:42,287
I called him a nigger,
you bet I did.

557
01:18:42,464 --> 01:18:48,892
That piece of shit hasn't spent
one legal day in his life.

558
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:53,007
This is it for you.
Suspension, review board.

559
01:18:53,175 --> 01:18:57,669
- You're protecting a con!
- Goddamn it!

560
01:18:59,381 --> 01:19:04,614
This man has got more brains
than you'll ever know.

561
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:11,487
- He's got more guts, too.
- That don't mean shit to me!

562
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:14,823
Let's get out of here.

563
01:19:17,099 --> 01:19:20,796
Where do you think you're going?

564
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:25,702
- Don't be so hard on the guy.
- You go fuck yourself, convict.

565
01:19:45,794 --> 01:19:50,128
- How did my car get here?
- I had it impounded.

566
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:55,635
- You're going back to the slammer.
- Ganz got away with all my money.

567
01:19:55,804 --> 01:20:00,832
Now you're taking me to jail in my
own car. That don't seem right.

568
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:05,275
A lot of things don't seem right.

569
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:10,908
I could use a drink. I'll buy.
It'll be my goodbye present.

570
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:17,150
- I feel like I let you down.
- No, it was a longshot.

571
01:20:17,326 --> 01:20:22,662
- We gave 'em a hell of a run.
- But we didn't catch 'em.

572
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,966
- Hello?
<i>- Let me talk to Kehoe. </i>

573
01:21:07,943 --> 01:21:13,779
Kehoe, answer the damn phone.
It's for you.

574
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:17,282
- How's it going?
<i>- Not so good. </i>

575
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:21,354
- How about the other guys?
- They're on the street.

576
01:21:21,523 --> 01:21:26,392
- Airport? Train station?
- They're clean.

577
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:32,990
They dumped the bus in Chinatown.
Other than that, we've got nothing.

578
01:21:33,168 --> 01:21:37,229
I'll get back to you later.

579
01:21:42,844 --> 01:21:45,711
Nothing! No Ganz, no Indian.

580
01:21:45,881 --> 01:21:51,012
Airport's clean, bus station,
train station, docks... Shit!

581
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:55,987
It's too bad. Our partnership
ended before it got started.

582
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:59,218
Some partnership.

583
01:21:59,394 --> 01:22:04,730
- What's up with your lady?
- We had another fight. Why?

584
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,394
If I was depressed and had a lady,
I'd go and see her.

585
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:14,406
No, I'll make it up to her tomorrow.

586
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:22,339
- What about that big Indian's girl?
- He won't be going back there.

587
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:26,715
They found the bus
down in Chinatown.

588
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:32,554
- Maybe he's visiting his girl.
- Billy's girl isn't interested.

589
01:22:32,728 --> 01:22:36,425
- She'll put a bullet in him.
- Yeah, I'm reaching.

590
01:22:36,598 --> 01:22:40,762
Well, you've got important things
to do, like going back to jail.

591
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:46,563
- Chinatown?
- Yeah.

592
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:07,222
There she is, Jack.

593
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,993
What ever play I make, back me up.

594
01:23:16,171 --> 01:23:19,800
Come on.

595
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:33,051
I hear you've got visitors.
Don't give me any crap.

596
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:36,213
Answer my questions!

597
01:23:36,425 --> 01:23:40,225
You're Billy's girl.
You've always been his girl.

598
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:44,764
The man can live or die,
it's up to you. Let us in.

599
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:49,627
Otherwise he's a dead man.

600
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:56,342
- He's in the room down the hall.
- Where's Ganz?

601
01:23:57,813 --> 01:24:01,613
- Down the other corridor.
- All right, come on.

602
01:24:47,929 --> 01:24:52,389
Give it up, Billy.
You've got no chance.

603
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:03,035
Billy, you're going to lose.

604
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:15,513
Get down!

605
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:20,253
Come on.

606
01:25:31,606 --> 01:25:34,598
It's all over.

607
01:25:38,046 --> 01:25:41,880
I'll kill you!

608
01:28:03,925 --> 01:28:09,124
You ought to know, Reggie, if you
come up against me you will lose.

609
01:28:09,297 --> 01:28:13,961
There's one more little thing
I've got to take care of.

610
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:24,344
Hey, cop, come on.
I've got something for you.

611
01:28:36,024 --> 01:28:40,484
- You're not going to make it.
- What are you talking about?

612
01:28:40,662 --> 01:28:45,326
I've got your gun. I've got
the money. I've got everything.

613
01:28:47,602 --> 01:28:51,698
- Blow his fucking brains out.
- Bullshit! He won't try it.

614
01:28:51,873 --> 01:28:54,000
Right, cop?

615
01:28:57,045 --> 01:29:00,708
Are you crazy, man?
I was just bluffing.

616
01:29:03,652 --> 01:29:09,716
I got hit!
I don't believe it. I got shot.

617
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:16,025
- You're done, end of story.
- You!

618
01:29:47,662 --> 01:29:50,631
I've got to go, okay?

619
01:29:54,736 --> 01:29:59,139
- Here's something for you.
- I'm not a pro.

620
01:29:59,307 --> 01:30:03,209
Buy yourself something.
I'm in a rush.

621
01:30:03,378 --> 01:30:07,872
I've got a cop
waiting for me downstairs.

622
01:30:09,484 --> 01:30:15,753
I'll be back in about six months
and we'll go dancing.

623
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:22,059
- Okay, take care of yourself.
- You, too.

624
01:30:22,931 --> 01:30:26,264
See you later.

625
01:30:39,814 --> 01:30:43,648
So tell me how great you were.

626
01:30:43,852 --> 01:30:47,344
I don't go in for that macho shit.

627
01:30:47,555 --> 01:30:52,083
I was great.
I should have my dick bronzed.

628
01:30:56,364 --> 01:31:00,266
Is this what you want to talk about?

629
01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:04,804
I've been waiting for that money
for three years.

630
01:31:04,973 --> 01:31:08,534
Where's your
merit-system shit now?

631
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:12,737
It's your money.
It'll be there when you get out.

632
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:21,811
- You don't want any of it?
- It's not my style.

633
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:28,786
I need a car. Loan me a couple
of thousand when you get out.

634
01:31:30,632 --> 01:31:37,003
- What kind of car do you want?
- A convertible. I'm a rag-top man.

635
01:31:39,574 --> 01:31:42,737
- Deal.
- Good.

636
01:31:49,117 --> 01:31:52,951
Even if you do give me the money
for a car, it don't mean shit.

637
01:31:53,121 --> 01:31:58,525
If I ever hear of you crossing
the line, I'll bust your ass.

638
01:32:02,297 --> 01:32:10,227
Both of us know that I'm going
to be honest from now on.

639
01:32:13,107 --> 01:32:19,444
But if I did decide to be a thief,
do you think you could catch me?

640
01:32:21,716 --> 01:32:25,447
Can I have my lighter back, Reggie?
