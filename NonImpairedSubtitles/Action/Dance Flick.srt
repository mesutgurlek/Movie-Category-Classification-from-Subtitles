1
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,293
Yeah, come on!

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,184
Get off me!

3
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,317
Get back!

4
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,417
- In your face.
- He's trying...

5
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,054
You know you like it! Right here!

6
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,024
Whatever.

7
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,318
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

8
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,619
- Your turn, go.
- Do it!

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,753
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

10
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,798
- Look at him!
- Drill! Drill! Drill!

11
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,144
- Where'd he go?
- Yo!

12
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,608
Wait, wait! Wait!

13
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,779
Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop that!
Stop that!

14
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,281
Stop that! Hey, hey, this is my house!

15
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,867
This is my house!
We not gonna have that here.

16
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,744
Now, we got a tie.

17
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,829
- What?
- What?

18
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,205
That's right.

19
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,707
The baddest two crews are left.

20
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,043
And I'm talking bad. Super bad.

21
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,879
I'm talking Wesley Snipes don't pay his
taxes bad.

22
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,632
We talking T.I.
Buying machine guns bad.

23
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,051
We talking everything on the CW bad.

24
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,679
- Yeah.
- Now, the only way to settle this...

25
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,097
...is a rematch.

26
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,892
That's right, that's right.
So, what y'all gonna do?

27
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,602
- Let's do it.
- No, wait.

28
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,772
Y'all go on over there and talk about it.
Go talk about it, talk about it.

29
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,566
Sugar Bear is gonna kill us
if we lose his money.

30
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,651
Come on, Thomas, we can take these
fools, man.

31
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,028
All we need is for D
to do his signature move.

32
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,489
- No, I'm not sure that's a good idea.
- He can't, it's too dangerous.

33
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,867
Yo, I don't care about that, man.
D's gonna do it.

34
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,869
But he could break his neck
and be crippled forever.

35
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,080
D don't care about that, man. All right,
he gonna take one for the team.

36
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,416
But like a hundred million Americans,
D doesn't have insurance.

37
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,293
- Yeah, he's right, I don't.
- Yo, man...

38
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,837
...he's doing the move and that's final.
I want this.

39
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,716
Exactly. You want this.
Look, man, there ain't no "I" in "team. "

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,092
- There ain't?
- No.

41
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,969
- What about "group"?
- Not in "group" either.

42
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,053
- Crew?
- No.

43
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,638
- Troupe? Gang?
- No.

44
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,724
- Einsemble?
- You just mispronounced that word...

45
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,933
...to make it sound
like it had an "I" in it.

46
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,019
Yo, forget about all that, man.
Let's do it.

47
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,229
- But, guys!
- Stay out of your business, D!

48
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,732
- Come on, man!
- So, what y'all gonna do?

49
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,027
Double or nothing, $5,000.

50
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,656
All right, well, put the money in the hat.

51
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,121
Oh, well, cat's out the bag.

52
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,083
You heard the man, $3,000.

53
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:17,089
Did I say three? I meant $5,000!
Now, what you gonna do?

54
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,927
- We in.
- Oh, yeah, we got us a battle now.

55
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,345
Show them some love!

56
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:29,810
That's right, these young men are gonna
be battling it out for $7,000 in cash!

57
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:40,029
$10,000. And one of my loud-ass suits
from my loud-ass suit collection...

58
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,866
...comes in a variety of ghetto colors,
Flavor Flava eyes yellow...

59
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,118
Kool-Aid red, ashy gray...

60
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,080
...and for weddings and funerals,
Djimon Hounsou black.

61
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,625
Y'all ready to do this?
Well, let's get it on.

62
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,854
Yo, this dude is whack.
Why is everybody going crazy over him?

63
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,067
He's the director and your cousin.
Anything he do is fine.

64
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,236
Yeah! This is my movie.

65
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,492
It's all you, D.

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,205
Look at this dude.

67
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:42,925
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight!

68
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:01,902
That money is ours!

69
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,779
- All right!
- All right!

70
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,948
Yo. Give me the oil, give me the oil.

71
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,384
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

72
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,390
Oh, no!

73
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,148
Looks like we got us a winner!
The 409 Crew it is!

74
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,150
Yeah!

75
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,125
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

76
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,878
- Oh, no, not at all.
- Good.

77
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,422
Come on, kids, it's empty!

78
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,512
There we go.

79
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,146
- You want some chicken?
- No, thank you.

80
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,734
I love the ballet.

81
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,989
Never had the body for it, though.
That's why I chose football.

82
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,700
That's me when I was nine.

83
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,119
You dance?

84
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,539
I used to.

85
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,958
When I lived in the suburbs.

86
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,795
Megan, honey, you hungry?

87
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,172
Hey, Megan, will you help me
with my home...

88
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,508
Special delivery for Megan...

89
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,889
- Megan, honey, we're really busy.
- But, Mom, you promised.

90
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,476
I know, sweetie, but it's about to start
raining, and I need to fix the brakes...

91
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,979
...and I have to drop off
the life insurance check.

92
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:04,108
- This is the biggest day of my life.
- All right, sweetie.

93
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,068
You're the best, Mom.

94
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,128
Don't you worry. I won't let you down.

95
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,799
I'll make it to that audition if it is
the last thing I do.

96
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,010
You're gonna die, bitch.

97
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:53,616
Oh, no! Oh, my God! Help me! Please!

98
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,451
Over there, over there, hurry!

99
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,745
- Oh, thank God!
- Free gas!

100
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,789
- Yeah, baby! Premium!
- Wait, people!

101
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,625
Where's everyone going?

102
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,127
We've hit the jackpot!
Get me some gas.

103
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,426
- We need something to put it in!
- Help me! My seatbelt is jammed!

104
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,054
Oh, please, help me!

105
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,722
In here, somebody give me a hand!

106
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,266
I was on the way
to my daughter's audition.

107
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,227
Okay, miss, I need you to lift up and
swing your body towards me, okay?

108
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,231
- Okay. Please, hurry! I can't get it.
- I can see it. Almost!

109
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,027
Got it! I got it!

110
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,490
What the hell!

111
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,869
Miss White, is there anything you would
like to share before you begin?

112
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,791
Well, I think my thighs look really fat
in this outfit.

113
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:48,045
Valtrex does not work.
I have no gag reflex.

114
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,005
I meant about your routine.

115
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:57,096
Well, nothing other than it's something
that my grandfather helped me with.

116
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,974
This should be good.

117
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,584
Oh, my God. I'm okay.

118
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,837
Thanks, you guys.
It's just a few cuts and bruises.

119
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,673
Don't worry about me.
I'm just gonna get a lift.

120
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,477
Don't worry, baby.

121
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:50,232
I'll get there even if it kills me.
Not even Brandy can stop me.

122
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,821
Oh, shit, not again.

123
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,166
Yeah! I'm Rick James, bitch!

124
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,717
Yeah, okay.
Yes, I'll find a way to tell her gently.

125
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,221
Your mother died,
and, no, you didn't get in.

126
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,307
- What?
- Next!

127
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,436
You mean,
my audition wasn't good enough?

128
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,108
I ain't asked you all that.

129
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,987
Come on, kids, let's move away from
this long-winded ho.

130
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,199
Come on, babies. Goodness.

131
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,552
Well, if it isn't my two dancing
delivery boys.

132
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,264
- Where's the other Musketeer?
- He died in a tragic dance accident.

133
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,267
I'm talking about my chocolate bar,
bitch!

134
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,646
- Don't get cute.
- I got it right here, Sugar Bear.

135
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,524
It's all good.

136
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,735
Now, I told y'all two,
when I gave you that loan...

137
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,862
...that I'm gonna need my piece of the pie.

138
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,572
I got it right here.

139
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,617
Pumpkin pie.

140
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,494
I ain't gonna sugarcoat this.

141
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,996
Yeah, I is.

142
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,876
I heard about you two fools getting
served at that dance battle.

143
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,589
But I like you two, so I'm gonna give
you a chance to make things right.

144
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,218
I'm gonna give you till the end of next
week to bring me my chips.

145
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:47,057
But if I don't get them by then,
we all gonna be crying over spilt milk.

146
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,270
Spilt milk and crumbled cookies.
Now get out!

147
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,607
Somebody get me a fork.
Who back there?

148
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,703
The Suburban Express has arrived
in the ghetto on track two.

149
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,663
Dad?

150
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,290
- Megan.
- Hi.

151
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:15,085
Hi. So, you got a lot of baggage?

152
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,630
Well, you left me when I was 10,
Mom is dead.

153
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,175
I haven't had a decent date in a year
because of my low self-esteem...

154
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,720
Honey. I'm talking about your luggage.

155
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,265
Yeah, well, it's over there.

156
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,268
Keep the platform clear of all luggage,
guns and knives.

157
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,732
Okay. Now, look, I'll grab this.

158
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,400
You grab the rest. I'm double parked.

159
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,114
Home, sweet home.

160
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,449
I don't wanna talk to you!

161
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,285
Come on, honey,
I'll give you the grand tour.

162
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,578
I'll kill you, bitch!

163
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,831
Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it great?

164
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,250
Now, listen, sweetheart, I know this
may not be what you're used to...

165
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,254
...but I got a perfect spot picked out
for you. What do you think?

166
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,512
Yeah, I know. It's a little out in the open.
But I got a little work to do on it.

167
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,264
It's gonna be great,
I promise you, honey.

168
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,975
When I'm done, it's gonna be perfect.

169
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,078
This just won't do.

170
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,052
Hey.

171
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,182
Well, all right, everybody.
Let's get this place cleaned up.

172
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,601
Mr. Crackhead.

173
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,479
Have fun.

174
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,359
Grab a brush, grab a broom.

175
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,237
Grab a mop and bucket.

176
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:10,659
Come on, everybody
and we'll scrub, scrub, scrub it.

177
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,206
Clean up your own shit, hey.

178
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,833
Kiss my furry a-hole.

179
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,961
- This bitch can't sing. I'm out of here.
- Word.

180
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:30,554
I shot him, it was at a quarter to 1:00
Nobody was there so I didn't run.

181
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,975
It was 2007, October 1
Under my bed is where I hid the gun.

182
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,478
Man, you killed it.
You're under arrest for murder.

183
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,189
What you talking about, man?
I didn't... I didn't even do nothing.

184
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,858
Got your confession on tape.

185
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,277
I shot him, it was at a quarter to 1:00

186
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,197
- Man, that wasn't even me, man.
- He hid the gun under the bed.

187
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,657
A- Con, what up, dawg?

188
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,160
- What up, man?
- Chilling.

189
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,454
So, what's up, man?
You going back to school?

190
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,747
Are you serious, man?

191
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,167
All these losers running around here
with hopes and dreams.

192
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,127
Teachers want you to better yourself.

193
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,796
Nah, man. Give me prison any day, fam.

194
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,383
Yeah, totally don't agree with you.
So what are you gonna do?

195
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,845
Come on, man. The judge says
it's either school orjuvie.

196
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,515
I'm only one crime away from
going back, B. I'm excited, man!

197
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,186
Kickball, arts and crafts, showers.

198
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,645
Yo, I'm about to go to the bank, man.

199
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,399
- Cool. You're gonna make a deposit?
- Nah. Withdrawal.

200
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,612
Tell your mom I'll be by later
for some pie.

201
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,863
Okay.

202
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,621
Ray? I ain't gonna beat around the bush
with you.

203
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,082
You blind, son.

204
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,585
Ain't no easy way to say
you're a blind little bastard.

205
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,045
I know, Mamma.

206
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,631
Ain't nobody gonna have pity on you
'cause you blind.

207
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,175
Now, wipe them tears.

208
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,178
These ain't tears, Mamma.
These is eye boogers.

209
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,764
Then blow your eyes!

210
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,559
Now, I done showed you
how to do things once.

211
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:04,981
But now you're on your own.
But you remember, you blind, not stupid.

212
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,234
Okay, Mamma.

213
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,573
Just get out the car, you stupid, blind
son-of-a-bitch!

214
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,619
- Ray?
- Yes, Mamma?

215
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,705
You know how many steps it takes
to get to the school, right?

216
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,125
Yes, Mamma. I also remember
how many licks it takes...

217
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,793
...to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

218
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,505
- Just take your stupid, blind ass on.
- Yes, Mamma.

219
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,592
One, two, three!

220
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,558
Now, contrary to rumor, my door is
always open, from 5:00 to 5:05 p. m.

221
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,935
At which point
I usually take my three-hour lunch.

222
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,396
So, if you miss me, you can catch me
every other Tuesday...

223
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,359
...of every other leap year,
from 4:45 a. m. To 4:47 a. m.

224
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,404
So just know I'm here to give you kids
some guidance.

225
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,450
Bobby! What are you doing writing
on that wall with a marker?

226
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,120
Use this spray paint. Don't you want
people to be able to see your work?

227
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,080
- Oh, yeah, let me try that.
- Damn fool.

228
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,500
Come on, blondie, pick up the pace.
I'm getting my wig rotated at 11:00.

229
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,045
Johnny! Take that condom off!

230
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,797
You know you can't feel anything
with it on!

231
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,091
- You right.
- These damn kids today...

232
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,886
...don't even know how to get low.

233
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:21,349
Okay, here we are. Here's your locker
and here's your combination.

234
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,561
Now, do you have
any questions or concerns?

235
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,606
Well, I do have a few concerns.
It's kind of a pressing matter...

236
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,483
...but I know you don't have much time.

237
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,362
She's good.

238
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,367
Jimmy Hopper, please come
to the principal's office. Jimmy Hopper.

239
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:45,373
Girl, don't be leaving your bag on the
floor. It's like giving it to charity.

240
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,337
- Hi, I'm Charity.
- I'm Megan.

241
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,883
- Are you a dancer?
- I used to be.

242
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,385
Yeah, me, too. Until I had my baby.

243
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,266
Get busy! Go, Charity! Get busy!

244
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:09,481
Go, Charity! Get busy! Go, Charity!
Get busy! Go, Charity! Get busy!

245
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,485
Go, Charity! Go! Go! Go!

246
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,884
Oh, my God!
You bring your baby to school with you?

247
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,262
Hell, yeah! I am a good mother, okay?

248
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,847
You can't just be leaving your baby
with anybody.

249
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,101
These nannies be beating
on your children like LAPD.

250
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,105
I keep him with me because that way
I know that he is safe and sound.

251
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,314
You know what I'm talking about?

252
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,192
You can't just be leaving your kid
with anybody.

253
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:58,655
These people out here be crazy,
neglecting their children. Okay.

254
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,199
All right, boo boo, you remember
to breathe through the vents...

255
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,201
...and Mommy loves you, punkin!

256
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,840
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Tracy.

257
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:21,761
I was wondering if you have a dance
partner for the senior showcase...

258
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,888
'cause I was thinking
we could be partners.

259
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,309
There's this really romantic scene
in Romeo and Juliet.

260
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,645
That's great.
I've always wanted to play that part.

261
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,815
You'll be a great Romeo.

262
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,650
I'm not talking about Romeo.

263
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,153
You're so funny.

264
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,577
"Delighted that he was fat
Delighted that he was old...

265
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,038
"No doubt in the world about that
Delighted that he had gold"

266
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,708
How now, brown cow.

267
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:59,299
Scene. An actor prepares.
Acting, people...

268
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,388
...is action and reaction.

269
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,602
- Oh, shit!
- Yes, son, yes! Yes, that is truth!

270
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,604
- You don't know me.
- I see murder in your eyes.

271
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,981
Yes, that's good, son.

272
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,859
You need an agent. You are excellent.

273
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,488
Now, what will you do to act?

274
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,241
What are you willing to sacrifice...

275
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,120
...for your art, son? Yes?

276
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,458
Are you willing to die for it?
Are you willing to cry for it?

277
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,170
Are you willing
to lose your manhood for it?

278
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,430
No? You, get out of my class,
get out of my class!

279
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,600
You call yourself an actor? Get out!

280
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:54,354
Damn it, I gave up my manhood...

281
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,690
...twice.

282
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,650
Yes, it hurt. I bled.

283
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:04,155
But I got five weeks' work
on a non-union student film.

284
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,909
Now, class, there are 50,000 people
who have the audacity...

285
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,329
...to call themselves actors.

286
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,165
- Yeah, like Jessica Simpson.
- Yes, like Jessica Simpson.

287
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,126
Did any of you guys see
Employee of the Month?

288
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,752
Refund, please!

289
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,006
That Dane Cook makes me do this.

290
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,343
Well, I kind of like that movie.
I thought she did a really good job.

291
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,845
I saw it four times.

292
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,013
Yeah, I guess I'd rather see her act than...

293
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,599
...ruin the Cowboys' chances
of ever winning the Super Bowl.

294
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,854
It seems as though we have a debate
going on here.

295
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,647
How about those mom jeans?

296
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:42,902
Irregardless of what you may think of
Miss Simpson, she is a success story.

297
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,988
Of the 50,000 people that call
themselves actors...

298
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,699
...there's only 500 working actors.

299
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:52,579
Of that 500, most of them are white.
There are a few roles for black people...

300
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,040
...but those roles are usually
for the Wayans brothers.

301
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,629
We must all, in our lives
and in our craft, have one thing.

302
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,301
Dignity. Yes, dignity.

303
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,888
Well, I remember one time,
they offered me a role...

304
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:15,977
...in a despicable, disgusting,
stereotypical racist movie.

305
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,896
Do you know what I told them?

306
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,566
- Yes, Miss White?
- You turned it down.

307
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,694
Hell, no! I took that money!

308
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,363
But I did it with dignity.

309
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,991
Let us watch.

310
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,287
Boy, you ain't picking
that cotton fast enough.

311
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,706
Massa, no!

312
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,043
I be's the best cotton-picking
picaninny this side of Jubilee.

313
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,254
Yes, sir, I's a cotton-picking fool!
They call me Lightning Jack.

314
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,883
- See, I just love picking me some cotton.
- Boy, you lie talking me?

315
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:51,304
Massa, I's be here forever. I cuts my
own foot off, sir, to show my love to you.

316
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:58,019
I love me some massa. No, Massa. No!

317
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,274
Integrity.

318
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,989
Attention, ladies!
Everybody take your place.

319
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,701
I am your dance instructor...

320
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:19,415
Ms. Cameltoé.

321
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,046
Now, I'm sure most of you have heard...

322
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,132
...that I have a huge count...

323
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,427
Excuse me, country music collection...

324
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:35,139
...but that's irrelevant.
I have one interest here today...

325
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,183
...and that one interest is dance.

326
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:42,772
I wanna see you dance and I wanna
see you smile. Understood?

327
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:46,526
I barely saw you there. You look like
a needle. You look like a gutted worm.

328
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,821
You look like the number 11.
What are you, Mary-Kate or Ashley?

329
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,658
I've inserted tampons bigger than you!
I don't teach by the pound.

330
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,743
You, shave it!

331
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,997
What do you think this is,
Busch Gardens? Trim it!

332
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:02,083
Flatten it. Look who freed Willy!

333
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,919
Whale spotting! Grecian tanker!

334
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,880
You've got more chins than a Chinese
phone book.

335
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,339
How about some butter for those rolls?

336
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:12,051
We do the mashed potato here,
we don't eat the mashed potato.

337
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,430
Please. You gonna keep the baby?
I hope so.

338
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,851
And what's your situation? Did you
grow up next to a nuclear power plant?

339
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,936
You look like you were yanked
through a closed door.

340
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,355
You know, you're never gonna make it
as a dancer, Sister Sledge.

341
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,940
If I were you, I'd kill myself.

342
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,359
My life is over!

343
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,820
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

344
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,864
It was a metaphor!

345
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:37,285
Girls, if you wanna have a successful
senior showcase...

346
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,870
...you're gonna have to step it up.

347
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,955
Nora, show them how it's done.

348
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,877
Be a tree.

349
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,546
A cloud.

350
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,716
An earthworm. An acorn.

351
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,927
- Wow, she's amazing.
- A pair of lips.

352
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,179
That's Nora, she's a triple threat.

353
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,473
- She acts, sings, and dances.
- You're a cup of coffee.

354
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,600
She's won every competition out there.

355
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,810
Excellent, Nora, excellent!

356
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,147
Perfect, perfect, perfect.
Brilliant, A-plus!

357
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,440
Now, for the rest of you cows...

358
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,692
I want you to follow me over here
to the balance beam.

359
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,236
All right, that's good, Jack, that's good.
Now, take it to the right.

360
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,072
Take it to the right.
Now the left, come on!

361
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,491
All right, now bring it up the middle.
Let's go, come on.

362
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,494
Jeez, give me that.

363
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:24,666
You have got to take your ball
and drive it hard into your opponent!

364
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,543
And I mean drive it long and hard.
Let's go again.

365
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,463
- Dad, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, shoot.

366
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,383
Did you ever wanna try something new...

367
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,343
...but were afraid of what your friends
might think?

368
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,097
What, like bonking a hooker?

369
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,474
Nothing wrong with that.
Your first time should be special.

370
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,559
No, that's not what I mean.

371
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,937
Did you ever wanna try something
other than basketball?

372
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,022
Like having a strong man pin you down?

373
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,692
His hot breath breathing down your neck
as you struggle to the ground...

374
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,988
I know what you're getting at.

375
00:26:56,198 --> 00:27:00,201
If you wanna join the wrestling team,
you have my full support.

376
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,829
Now, remember, we got
basketball practice this afternoon, huh?

377
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,790
Lady-killer.

378
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,145
Excuse me!

379
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:31,733
This is the dancers' table, and from
what I understand, you no longer dance.

380
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:37,947
- Damn, Nora, you are so mean.
- Not mean. Just real.

381
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,908
Come on.

382
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,080
Don't worry about Nora.
She is all bark and no bite.

383
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,915
Besides, those are the rich bitches...

384
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,001
...and you don't wanna
sit with them anyway.

385
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,631
Now, this is us, right over here.

386
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,426
Holla, holla, holla, holla!

387
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,764
Now, these are my roll dogs.
This is Uglisha and what's her name.

388
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,390
- Hey, girl!
- Hey, girl!

389
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,560
Wait, you don't know her name?
I thought they were your friends.

390
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,898
No, no, girl. I didn't say they were
my friends. I said I roll with them.

391
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:15,443
You see, I hang out with them because
they make me look better.

392
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,362
Now, what would I be doing being
friends with a bitch with a keloid...

393
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:23,201
...and some run-over shoes?
Look at her shoes. They tragic. God.

394
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,704
Uno!

395
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,457
What an asshole.

396
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,961
Who, girl? 'Cause you know in this
school you got to be more specific.

397
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,173
- Him.
- You talking about the corny brother...

398
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,550
...with the Cosby sweater
and the Dumbo ears?

399
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,262
Yeah. The one with the dried lips,
big forehead, and ashy knuckles?

400
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,347
That's my brother.

401
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,727
No, I wasn't talking about him. Him.

402
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:50,937
I don't usually do it.

403
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,438
- Cousin.
- Him.

404
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,232
- Yo, really?
- Nephew.

405
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,359
I'm really sorry.
I don't mean to offend you...

406
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,945
Oh, girl, I'm just messing with you!

407
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,240
She got you, girl. She got you good.

408
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:06,410
Yeah, she's like, "I'm surrounded by
black girls. Backpedal, backpedal. "

409
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,663
I think she's sweating Tang.

410
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,916
- She's so crazy.
- Scared me.

411
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,716
- They like my little minions, you see?
- Yeah. It's fun...

412
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,584
Come on, guys! Yeah!

413
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,668
All right.

414
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,813
Baby, look at me...

415
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:19,025
I'm just an average teen...

416
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,695
In gym class I watch you undress...

417
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,908
It's no secret that
fashion is my interest...

418
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,620
I got something in me...

419
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,664
I'm gonna set it free...

420
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,793
I'm Lance from 'N Sync's
number one fan...

421
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,672
Don't you know I love Bass
Now you know that I'm gay...

422
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,049
Flame...

423
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,802
I'll be gay forever...

424
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,055
I will always love guys...

425
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,431
Guys...

426
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,101
I'll wear chaps made of leather...

427
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,479
Do you think Tom Cruise is bi?

428
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,897
Gay...

429
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,525
Brokeback Mountain was heaven...

430
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,861
Is Ryan Seacrest straight?

431
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,196
Flame...

432
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,950
I'm gonna love men forever...

433
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,202
Baby, remember, I'm gay...

434
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,956
Remember, he's a member
Remember, he's a member...

435
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,332
Remember, he's a member...

436
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,876
I'm gay...

437
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,170
- Remember, I'm gay
- Gay!

438
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,050
One of you lucky boys is gonna be
my partner in the big showcase.

439
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,761
Now let's get started. You.

440
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,887
Go get her.

441
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,145
Next!

442
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:44,402
Yeah, you better be smiling.
Stop shaking.

443
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:51,701
Man up, dude! Come on, guys,
I weigh exactly 97.2 pounds.

444
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,620
I had one grape this morning, one!

445
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,456
- We're out of here.
- Guys, no! Don't go!

446
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,500
Save it, lard ass.

447
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,838
My life is over.

448
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,843
- I'll do it.
- Do what?

449
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,555
- Whatever it is y'all trying to do.
- You think you can lift me?

450
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,640
Shit, I could lift you.

451
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:17,893
Wait.

452
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,031
- Now what?
- You take your half boner off me.

453
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,949
My bad.

454
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,868
- Now put me down.
- All right.

455
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,413
Damn, I think I broke a nail.

456
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,125
So, we going to Club Violence tonight.
It's a hip-hop club. You should come.

457
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,878
- Yeah, sure.
- Are you 21?

458
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,131
No. I'm in high school.

459
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,885
So, what are you saying? I'm stupid
'cause I'm 21 and still in high school?

460
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,137
No, no, no, not at all.

461
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:57,141
Yo, A-Con, Megan needs a hook-up
on an ID for Club Violence tonight.

462
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,144
- Word. Give me $50.
- For what?

463
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,021
So I can get you some ID for $20.

464
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,566
You know Club Violence
ain't no square dance, right?

465
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,780
That's all right. I'll dance in circles,
probably around you.

466
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,032
Snap!

467
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,409
- She gonna roll around you, fam!
- All right.

468
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,078
She gonna roll around you.

469
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,663
All right, girl, let's roll.

470
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,544
- I think mami feeling you, fam.
- She probably got friends, too.

471
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,965
Oh, no, I'm good, B.
I need me a Queen Latifah type chick.

472
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,676
Corn rows and broad shoulders,
you know what I mean?

473
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,430
So, if I get jumped,
she knocking everybody out.

474
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,812
Yo, up here!

475
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,733
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, girl!

476
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,492
Come back in here, you little brat!
Quit playing around!

477
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,411
I'll be right down, Megan.

478
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,580
- Hey, girl!
- Hey!

479
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,209
Are we stopping somewhere first?

480
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,044
No. Why?
Do you need to stop somewhere?

481
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:12,049
No, I was just wondering,
is he coming to the club with us?

482
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:15,219
- Yeah. Why? Is there a problem?
- No. Not at all.

483
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,138
Okay, then, let's roll. Come on.

484
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:23,561
You are going to love Club Violence.
All the big ballers get shot there.

485
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,689
Speaking of which, you gonna need this.
It's your ID.

486
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,733
Oh, my God, her hair is horrible.

487
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:34,572
She has buckteeth, a lazy eye, and
needs to wax that unibrow. Who is this?

488
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,823
That's you!

489
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,079
- You're right.
- Come on.

490
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,914
Hey, Uglisha! Hey, Keloid!

491
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,332
- Hey, girl!
- Hey, girl!

492
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,044
- Charity, can I ask you something?
- Sure, what is it?

493
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,506
How do I look?

494
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,261
Girl. You ain't going nowhere with me
looking like that. Hold on.

495
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,763
Uglisha, let us use your car right fast.

496
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,307
- No, but I can't let...
- But nothing!

497
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,184
We ain't going nowhere,
we just wanna sit in it.

498
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,936
Nobody trying to take
your beat-up bucket.

499
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,813
Anyway, come on, let's go. Get...

500
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,857
- I thought...
- Just get in, hurry, hurry up.

501
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,525
You, hold this.

502
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,613
All right, here we go.

503
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,907
First, you need to take off
that sorry ass coat...

504
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,992
'cause it's country,
and you look country in it.

505
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,620
Take off those whack ass earrings,
'cause those are played.

506
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:26,540
And those shoes they've got to go.
Come on, hurry up. All right.

507
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,793
Now, put this on.

508
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,964
And take a little bit of this
and some of that.

509
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,384
Now, you are good to go, girl.
You look good. You ready.

510
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,181
Yo, check it.

511
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,729
- What it do, shorty?
- Damn!

512
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,525
- Girl, you looking good now.
- Let's bounce, girl.

513
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,444
Not y'all.

514
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,785
- Yo, what up, A-Con?
- Yo, what up, fam, you good?

515
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,411
- Chilling.
- All right. Dude.

516
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:08,082
Oh, hell, no. Con.
Got some girls coming to the after party?

517
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,833
No doubt, I'll bring the condoms, B,
I got you.

518
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,835
- Yeah, I'll be there, man.
- You ain't invited.

519
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,004
- Cool, I'll bring the chips.
- Hey, A-Con.

520
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,757
- How you doing, love? Love, you good?
- Good, looking good.

521
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,384
- You're looking better.
- Thank you.

522
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,678
- What up, ma?
- Get out of here!

523
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,597
Sorry, I'm taken.

524
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,183
Hey, ladies!

525
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,771
Yo! Hook a sister up.

526
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,358
- Don't look, don't look.
- At who?

527
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,777
My baby daddy, that's him over there.
Don't look.

528
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,408
I see you. How you doing?

529
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,661
Why don't you ask
how your son is doing?

530
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,122
That's a line you ain't tried in a while.

531
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,876
- Can I buy you a drink?
- You need to buy your baby something.

532
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,169
You right.

533
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,379
- Hey, bartender.
- Yeah.

534
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,881
Let me get a milk on the rocks,
and put it in a sippy cup.

535
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,049
- You got it.
- Oh, yeah...

536
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,719
...and a Patrón pineapple for my son.

537
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,559
- So, you wanna dance?
- No.

538
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,646
Come on, Charity.
You know you wanna dance with me.

539
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:18,235
That's all you ever wanna do,
is argue with me and dance with me.

540
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,821
Come on.

541
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,117
You so crazy.

542
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,662
I'll be back in, like, five minutes, okay?
One second.

543
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,373
Turn around!

544
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,896
So, what do you wanna drink?

545
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,690
I don't know.
You're the genius, remember?

546
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,776
You know everything.

547
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,110
I don't know everything.

548
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,863
Like I don't know how Jermaine Dupri
got with Janet Jackson.

549
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,282
And I don't know why porn stars pray.
It's pointless.

550
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,034
You know God's up there like...

551
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,163
I definitely don't know how Star Jones
didn't know her husband was gay.

552
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,956
I mean, he laughs like this.

553
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:17,628
You need to take care of your
responsibilities.

554
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,130
Yeah, but you still love me though,
right?

555
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,801
You right. You know what, boo?

556
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,054
I was thinking that we should have
another baby.

557
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,441
This is my song! Yes, yes!

558
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,944
I'm so happy! Yes, yes!

559
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,450
I'm so excited! Yeah!

560
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,996
Yes!

561
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,418
- Come on, let's dance.
- No, I really don't feel like dancing.

562
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,546
Come on. I wanna see you
dancing circles around me.

563
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,508
- Okay.
- Watch the body.

564
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,646
Let me show you how it's done.

565
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:21,859
Right.

566
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,112
- Where am I?
- Where are you?

567
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,489
- I don't know. Where am I?
- Where'd you go?

568
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,283
- Where did I go? I don't know.
- Seriously, though.

569
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,034
- Where are you?
- Here I am.

570
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,496
- Oh, hey. That was...
- Just magic.

571
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,082
Follow me.

572
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,627
Yeah. Step. Step.

573
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,090
- This is easy.
- Yes!

574
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,886
That's right, your boy A-Con
in the building right now.

575
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,638
Yeah, here we go, y'all. Bass drop!

576
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,103
Put your hands up
Put your hands up...

577
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,481
You got a $20 bill
Put your hands up...

578
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,733
You got a $50 bill
Put your hands up...

579
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,235
You got a $100 bill
Put your hands up...

580
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,280
Now give me all your goddamn money,
everybody, right now!

581
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,450
That's right, B!
Come on, that's right. Put it in there.

582
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:15,787
Trick or treat, smell my heat,
so me and my baby moms can eat.

583
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,122
Come on!

584
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,835
Hey. Yo, where y'all suckers going?

585
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:27,382
Well, well, well, if it isn't the Pied Piper
of short dancers.

586
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,635
We're ready to battle.

587
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,930
So you think you can dance?
Well, step up. Bring it on.

588
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,766
'Cause we,
we America's best dance crew.

589
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,935
Yeah!

590
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,690
Hey! What'd I tell you?
Like Michael Jackson's video!

591
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,943
- I lean, you catch me.
- Okay. Okay. All right.

592
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:49,279
I think y'all better roll bounce
before we stomp your yard.

593
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,741
And take honey here with you,
'cause she's coyote ugly.

594
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,034
You better be at the Streets.

595
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,705
We gonna be at the Streets, fam,
so y'all best be on yourjob.

596
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,417
Oh, we on ourjob. Let's roll, 409!

597
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,504
- What you gonna do?
- What'd I say?

598
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,506
Man!

599
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,512
Thomas, hang on!

600
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,560
Thomas, wait! Hold on a second.

601
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:23,063
- What was that back there?
- Believe me, you don't wanna know.

602
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:27,943
- Well, I had a great time tonight.
- I'm glad you liked the club.

603
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,404
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- You got a ride?

604
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,905
No, I'm just gonna walk home.

605
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,867
No, no, no, no. There's too many
wannabe thugs around here.

606
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,538
- Yeah, I'll walk you.
- No, it's fine, I can protect myself.

607
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,415
I was actually hoping
you could protect me.

608
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,922
- You're serious.
- Yeah, I'm serious.

609
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:50,591
Well, what are you gonna do?

610
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,219
Don't worry about me.
Lil' man is packing.

611
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,889
Good night.

612
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,310
Do you have one of those?

613
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,481
- I had a really great time tonight.
- Yeah, me, too.

614
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,151
If you ever wanna, like,
hook up sometime...

615
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,946
...and work on your dance moves,
I'm totally, like, up for it.

616
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,199
- Well, yeah, that'd be great.
- Well, I'll see you tomorrow, then.

617
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,786
- All right. Thanks for the dance.
- No problem.

618
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,415
You have to teach me that one.

619
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,708
- Okay.
- Okay.

620
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,293
- See you.
- Bye.

621
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,463
My house is that way.

622
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,235
Are you gonna do your show tomorrow?

623
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:00,827
Don't have any more alcohol.
Don't you see what it's doing to you?

624
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,748
It's ruining your life. You're on the floor
with no shirt and tight pants.

625
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:18,387
Promise me you're not gonna have
any more alcohol.

626
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:20,472
I promise.

627
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:24,518
Don't have any more alcohol or else
I'm gonna disown you. Say you promise.

628
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,186
I don't have anyone.

629
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,563
What? What do you mean?
Of course you have me.

630
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,691
I don't have a little black boy.

631
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:34,569
That's true but that doesn't mean
you don't have me. So say you promise.

632
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,987
I promise.

633
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,913
All right. Let's warm up.

634
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,822
Okay, let's do this.

635
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,868
- Okay.
- Yeah, now you're getting it.

636
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,494
See, hip-hop is aggressive.

637
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,831
It's raw, so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna invade your space...

638
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,207
...and then you invade mine back.

639
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,418
- It's like a battle. All right?
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

640
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,794
All right. So, I'm gonna guide you.

641
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,129
- Okay.
- Okay.

642
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,632
Your space, my space.
Your space, my... How's that feel?

643
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:38,758
- Good. Good.
- Good? All right.

644
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,427
'Cause I'm gonna let go
of the training wheels now, so...

645
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,678
- Really?
- Yeah, get ready.

646
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,055
- Okay.
- You got it. Feel it.

647
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,769
It's aggressive.
You gotta be aggressive towards me.

648
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,271
Okay.

649
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,774
Bitch, what's wrong with you?
You just gonna invade my space?

650
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,068
Don't invade my space!

651
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,072
You're gonna invade my... Knees!

652
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,449
Good.

653
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,993
Now what you gotta do
is learn how to back your shit up.

654
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,039
- You wanna try it again?
- No, no, no.

655
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,457
- All right.
- I'm good.

656
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,501
Very good. Very good.

657
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:16,796
So, that's it for today. Tomorrow
I'm gonna teach you how to do this.

658
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,800
Okay.

659
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,514
So, tell me, what's up
with you and A-Con?

660
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:28,099
I don't get why you guys hang out.
You're so different.

661
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:32,521
Look, me and him got into some stuff
a while ago. He got caught, I didn't.

662
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,564
But he never ratted me out,
so I owe him for that.

663
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,651
But don't you wanna be something
more than just a street thug?

664
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,904
I know you've got bigger dreams
than that. What do you wanna be?

665
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,739
I wanna be a doctor.

666
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,700
I bet you wanna work with kids,
don't you?

667
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,161
- No, vaginas.
- What?

668
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,622
I wanna be a vaginacologist.
They're all I think about.

669
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,251
Big ones, small ones, the cute ones
with the little Hitler mustaches on them.

670
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,962
Or how about the ones that are fat
like Jay-Z's lips?

671
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,508
But I gotta get into college first, so...
But what about you?

672
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,135
What does your mom think
about you dancing hip-hop?

673
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,096
My mom's dead.

674
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,890
Well, how come
you never talk about her?

675
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:12,519
What am I supposed to do?
Run around the school yelling about it?

676
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,020
If it helps.

677
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,942
My mom's dead!
She's dead! My mom's dead!

678
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,364
This book is so good.

679
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,538
- You like Thomas, don't you?
- No.

680
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,458
Well, he's okay, I guess.

681
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:40,672
He does have a nice smile,
beautiful skin and luscious lips.

682
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,758
But I love his big, fat...

683
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:47,804
Hey, hey, hey, girl! That is my brother.

684
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,432
What? I was just gonna say "butt. "

685
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,767
Well, you should see his...

686
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,519
Girl, I wonder who that could be.

687
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,772
I hate when people come by
unannounced. So tacky.

688
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,322
What do you want?

689
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:09,159
You know what I want, Charity.
I'm here to pick up my son.

690
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:19,878
Hey, son.

691
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,675
All right, I'm out.

692
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,764
I'll be back next week
to pick him up again.

693
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,104
He's such a good father.

694
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,357
Yes! I got in!

695
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,442
What is it? What's happened?

696
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,528
- Dr. Thomas Anderson!
- Let me see. Hold on.

697
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:49,407
"You and everyone else that applied
have been accepted...

698
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,618
"to Just Community College. "

699
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,747
Just Community College?

700
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:02,420
Just Community College!
That's great. You got in!

701
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,130
Congratulations!

702
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:07,384
That's great!

703
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,055
Megan, tonight I'm taking you out
to celebrate.

704
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,391
- Don't look.
- Okay.

705
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,476
- Stairs, there's stairs.
- Where?

706
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,186
- Right now.
- Okay.

707
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,648
- I'm so excited.
- I'm glad.

708
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,109
- Are you looking?
- No, I'm not looking.

709
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,236
- All right. Are you ready?
- Yes.

710
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,612
Surprise!

711
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,160
I'm sorry. I can't go in there.

712
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,413
What do you mean
you can't go in there?

713
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,957
- This is where I'm taking you.
- No.

714
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:43,211
Come on.
It's opening night. You're going.

715
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,464
She risked her life...

716
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,218
What a sacrifice...

717
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:54,431
Smashed by a truck
Last words were, "What the fuck?"

718
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:57,350
Momma's gone, momma's gone...

719
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,478
No more can you see her face...

720
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,232
Or hear her voice on the phone...

721
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,737
Your momma's dead, momma's dead
And she's never coming back...

722
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,741
Your momma's dead, momma's dead
That's right, she's never coming back...

723
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,075
You can wish...

724
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,327
She's never, never coming back...

725
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,704
You can cry...

726
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,789
She's never, she's never coming back...

727
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:22,292
Now go kill yourself...

728
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,877
That's right, she's never coming back...

729
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,342
Mom!

730
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,681
Encore! Encore!

731
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,310
- I thought you would've liked it.
- I did.

732
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,270
You wasn't acting like you did.

733
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,898
Wasn't even being loud.
I didn't hear you heckle once.

734
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,276
I'm sorry.

735
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,070
I don't want you to think I didn't have
a good time tonight, Thomas...

736
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,073
...but dancing
isn't a part of my life anymore.

737
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:59,078
Why not? You just woke up one day
and decided to waste your talent?

738
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,624
How do you know I have talent?
'Cause I danced at the club?

739
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,460
Because I saw the look on your face
when you did it, Megan.

740
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,087
It's the same look you had tonight.

741
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,758
It's the same exact look that you had...

742
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,636
It's the same... Mother...

743
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,681
Guys, can you quiet down here, please?
Can I talk to the girl?

744
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,934
Low self-esteem? Vulnerable?

745
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,645
Thank you.

746
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,816
- Like I was saying...
- Yeah.

747
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,235
I saw the look on your face
when you did it.

748
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,906
It's the same look you had tonight.
Goofy, happy, pale with freckles.

749
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,742
So, if you're gonna tell me something
about not dancing...

750
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,369
...then tell me something real.

751
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,830
Maybe I don't want it to be real.

752
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,208
What I want is to wake up
and see my mom.

753
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:49,379
For things to go back to the way
they were when life made sense.

754
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:53,216
And it's all my fault.
She got scraped off the highway for me.

755
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,593
For my damn audition.

756
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,555
- She was rushing, it was raining. I...
- Wait, it was raining?

757
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,766
Well, yeah,
but she promised she would be there.

758
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:03,226
I made her promise.

759
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,396
Damn! So, it was raining
and you still made her promise?

760
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,065
- Yeah, and then I didn't wait for her.
- That's messed up!

761
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,401
So, even if she didn't die,
she still would've been late?

762
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:16,072
I know I should've waited for her,
but they called my name and...

763
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,074
And then I didn't say anything.

764
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,493
So she would've got there
and been stuck outside.

765
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,828
That's what you're saying?

766
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,788
Well, technically, yeah,
but they called me.

767
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:27,083
You didn't put your mother's name
on the list? Are you kidding me?

768
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,211
Well, I had to go over my dance moves,
so I didn't have time to!

769
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,921
You didn't have time
for your own mother?

770
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,965
The person who gave birth to you.
You didn't have time for her?

771
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,091
- No, I... No, I...
- Okay.

772
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,051
No, I see what kind of party? This is.

773
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,847
Cry me a river.

774
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:45,435
All she wanted was for me to dance.

775
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,937
No. All she wanted was to live.

776
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,565
Not that she didn't support your dream.

777
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,318
It's just, the point is
you killed your mother.

778
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:57,155
And she's never coming back.
She's dead because of you!

779
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,574
God hates you, okay?

780
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,119
So, you not dancing
doesn't make any damn sense at all.

781
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:06,915
I know! But she...

782
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,503
I just don't think I
could do it without her.

783
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,715
Do you want this?

784
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,051
I mean,
do you really wanna go to Juilliard?

785
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,138
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

786
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,934
Well, then, it's on you
to make your dream come true.

787
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,146
Oh, shit, black girls.

788
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,483
So what you're gonna wanna do
is make that left, go up three blocks...

789
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,027
- I don't know you, and...
- What are you...

790
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,404
- Thomas, what are you talking about?
- Sistahs! Yeah!

791
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:46,371
- So this is where you live?
- Yep, this is it.

792
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,622
Oh, my God!

793
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,749
This is my dad's music room.

794
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,419
He's actually pretty good,
if you like the buckets.

795
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,214
I don't.

796
00:52:56,632 --> 00:53:01,928
He's working tonight,
so he's gonna be gone all night.

797
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:09,394
So that means we could probably
play the TV as loud as we want. Yeah!

798
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:13,106
There's a Blue's Clues marathon!
It's not working.

799
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,942
Well, I was thinking more like...

800
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,822
Make hotdogs?

801
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:25,076
Not exactly. Okay. More like...

802
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:33,042
Ice cream. Who has two thumbs
and wants ice cream? This guy.

803
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,127
No.

804
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,880
Charades. I like charades.

805
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,173
- All right, I'm good at this.
- Yes!

806
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,217
Yoga. You're doing yoga.

807
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,429
- Leap frog. Okay. You're riding a pony.
- Yeah, yeah, yes, yeah!

808
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:47,265
No, Thomas! Have sex!

809
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,477
Why didn't you say something?

810
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,563
Well, I'm a little shy.

811
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:10,413
Yo. Sugar Bear wants to see you.

812
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,750
Who's that scary-looking guy?

813
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,835
Who, him? That's nobody.

814
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,755
- Just an old friend, you know.
- Okay.

815
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,883
- We should all get together sometime.
- Yeah, great.

816
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,677
I'm just gonna go hang out.
Do some cardio. Read.

817
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,930
- Well, have fun.
- I will. I really...

818
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:32,769
Hey, yo, Thomas, they caught us, fam.
I don't know how they found you, though.

819
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,441
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

820
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:45,156
So, I'm gonna give you a call
around 9:11?

821
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,074
That's a little late, but that's okay.

822
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,495
And I also got us
some Police concert tickets.

823
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:54,081
Oh, my God, I love the Police!
I'm so excited!

824
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:57,418
There's a COPS marathon. COPS.
Love it, right?

825
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:01,172
- Okay, I'll TiVo it.
- Okay. Bye.

826
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,050
Bye!

827
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,554
You ain't got my dough yet?

828
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,016
You know how much bread,
how much cheddar...

829
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,393
...how much cake that is?

830
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,438
I want my chips!

831
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,107
Don't worry, man, we gonna have
your money for you, Sug.

832
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,110
- When?
- Soon as possible, fam.

833
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,404
Well, that ain't good enough.

834
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,867
There's a dance battle coming up,
and I suggest you win.

835
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,330
- What if we lose?
- No!

836
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,875
No! No!

837
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,840
And I am telling you...

838
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,760
My belly's growling...

839
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:53,057
I like glazed ham, pig feet and toes...

840
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,477
The Biggest Loser, I say no...

841
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,480
Give me mo, mo, mo, mo steaks...

842
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,275
Chicken and ribs, too...

843
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,903
I'm not living without food...

844
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:10,950
I don't wanna be no Nicole Richie...

845
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,704
Chips by the mountain
Soda pop from the spout...

846
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,457
You can say what you wanna
I'm not working out...

847
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,336
Fry me some chicken, strike up the grill...

848
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,505
'Cause you're gonna feed me...

849
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:31,012
That's right, you will, yes...

850
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:35,808
I am smelling food...

851
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:41,063
I'm so hungry...

852
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,734
Smucker's is the best jam
I've ever known...

853
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,653
And you, and you, and you...

854
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:51,699
You're gonna feed me...

855
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:58,331
Feed me...

856
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:05,630
Feed...

857
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:15,598
Me...

858
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,773
Be aggressive, guys! Let's score!

859
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,484
Excuse me!
Come on, let's get that basket!

860
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,779
Why do they call you nappy?
I don't understand it.

861
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,784
Why don't you "D" up on her?

862
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:38,329
You know, maybe if you weren't so tired
from having sex with Thomas...

863
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,872
...maybe you could guard her.

864
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,416
How do you know
I had sex with Thomas?

865
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,252
Who's the ho now?

866
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:47,838
- Give that back!
- No!

867
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,049
You are going down, Twiggy!

868
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,385
You bow-legged bitch!

869
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:58,391
Break it up! Break it up! Get off of her!

870
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,850
What are you doing?

871
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:03,688
I am not gonna have two nubile,
sweaty teens fighting like that...

872
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,315
...making me moist in my own gym!
Do you understand?

873
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,403
If you've got a beef to settle,
we're gonna settle it my way. Got it?

874
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,322
Oh, yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

875
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,241
- Get her!
- Come on! Get that ass!

876
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,451
- Grab it!
- You want some of this?

877
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:20,371
I'm gonna make it rain
on these hoes! Yeah!

878
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:24,125
Show me what you got!
Let me see some ass!

879
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,883
What is wrong with you guys?

880
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:37,471
Do you know what's at stake here?
We're talking state championships!

881
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,307
Hey! Stand up, Weiner!

882
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,769
You're not looking polished, Knob!

883
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,022
You gotta play hard, Cockran!

884
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,232
Headd! You gotta give me some!

885
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,235
Don't you guys wanna know
what it feels like to be winners?

886
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:55,114
To be 10 men,
holding each other after a big victory?

887
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,867
Standing naked in the showers...

888
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,995
...screaming at the top of your lungs,
foam flying?

889
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,830
Yes! Yes!

890
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,916
Yes! Now, that is the spirit, son!

891
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:09,128
Now, the rest of you,
get your head in the game!

892
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,338
Let's go!

893
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,553
So, how did he catch it?

894
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,389
Probably one of them kids at school.
You know kids.

895
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:23,142
I told him to wear a condom,
but does he listen to me? No.

896
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,227
Just like his damn daddy.

897
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,982
Now you sit there and let it itch.

898
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,818
So, I heard about the fight.

899
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,821
Yeah. It was all Nora's fault.

900
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:39,533
It was all Nora's fault?
You didn't have anything to do with it?

901
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:42,495
No! She's just jealous of me
and Thomas.

902
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,665
Well, what do you expect?
It is hard out there for a white girl.

903
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,959
It used to be that y'all just show up
and bat your eyes...

904
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,377
...and the brothers would come running.

905
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,880
But now, the competition is fierce.

906
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,382
You see, girl, first
it was J. Lo with Puffy.

907
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,469
She opened the door
for every Latina this side of the border.

908
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:02,098
Then it was Kimora Lee Simmons
leading a dojo ofAsian bitches.

909
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:04,100
And now, we got Kim Kardashian...

910
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:07,228
...and her big, Armenian ass
pulling brothers right and left.

911
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,438
So, what is a rich white girl
supposed to do?

912
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,525
The last thing she needs is you coming
in here with your blonde hair...

913
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,443
...your perky breasts,
and a little bit of rhythm...

914
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,904
...taking the last sellout brother left.

915
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:20,324
You think that Nora
is the only oppressed white girl?

916
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:23,327
Well, I'll have you know,
I have paid my dues.

917
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,209
Excuse me, miss?
Have you been drinking?

918
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,213
- Nope.
- Ma'am, step out of the car.

919
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,727
The damage isn't that bad.

920
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,986
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to have you blow into this tube.

921
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,409
Ma'am, I meant this tube.

922
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,912
It's a lot bigger.

923
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,842
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to take you in.

924
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,311
Time's up, Miss White.

925
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,104
You're free to go.
Hope you learned your lesson.

926
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,439
What took you so long?

927
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:37,109
Your flashback was longer
than your time in County...

928
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,278
...and that don't make you one of us.

929
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,405
I thought we were friends.

930
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,076
What do you mean, we're not gonna pay
Sugar Bear back his money?

931
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,746
'Cause I'm tired of Sugar Bear
always trying to punk us, B.

932
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,332
What type of self-respecting thug
pays back a debt?

933
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,917
So, what are you gonna do
when he comes after us?

934
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,920
He ain't coming after us.
We gonna get him first.

935
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:59,548
- Meet me under the bridge tonight, 8:00.
- No.

936
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,091
- Bitch.
- Okay.

937
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,692
There's something I need to tell you.

938
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,903
You're pregnant? Oh, no.

939
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,031
What? No, Thomas, I'm not pregnant.

940
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:28,494
Good, 'cause with your big head
and my ears, God only knows.

941
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,497
No, I'm performing
at the senior showcase...

942
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,500
...and then, who knows, maybe Juilliard.

943
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,834
That's great!

944
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,586
And I was kind of thinking, you know...

945
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,839
...maybe we should just kind of cool it
for a while.

946
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,050
What do you mean?

947
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:46,262
I'm saying I think we need
to take a break.

948
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,180
Break, definitely,
yeah, we should definitely take a break.

949
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,932
How long you need, like,
30, 40 minutes?

950
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,600
We actually should synchronize
our watches...

951
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:54,603
- So we can meet up...
- No, Thomas. I need space.

952
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:59,400
Okay. Space. Space is good.
That's enough space?

953
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,110
Thomas, we're done.

954
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,904
Definitely. This has been
a long rehearsal, very tough.

955
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,364
Thomas, I'm leaving you!

956
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,283
I don't wanna be
your girlfriend anymore!

957
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,451
We spend more time
defending our relationship...

958
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:10,828
...than actually having one!

959
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:14,790
Nobody wants to see us together.
Not my friends and not yours.

960
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,959
I'm saying it's over.

961
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,045
Fine.

962
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:24,258
- Fine, leave! Get out!
- Sorry! I'm sorry!

963
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,145
God has put you in my path
and I aim to keep you!

964
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:41,525
I'm making steaks for dinner
and I expect you to stay.

965
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,564
Megan!

966
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:30,157
So, here's my number. You just call me.
You married?

967
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,285
That's sexy. I'll talk to you later.

968
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,788
Oh, shit.

969
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,384
- Hey.
- Hey.

970
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,679
Can we talk?

971
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,599
Can we talk, Charity?

972
01:04:56,643 --> 01:05:02,356
I just want to let you know, from now on,
things are gonna be different.

973
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,193
I don't wanna be the kind of father...

974
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,113
...that his kid only sees him
on the weekends.

975
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:13,826
That's not the kind of life I want
for my son. My son!

976
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,162
- You don't even know his name.
- It doesn't matter!

977
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:21,250
Maury said it was a 99.9% chance
that he is mine!

978
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,335
And I'm gonna honor that!

979
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:29,341
Anyway, I want my kid to wake up
every morning and see my face.

980
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,803
Here, put this in his room.

981
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,514
I'm out.

982
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,898
Hey, sup, man, I gotta talk to you.

983
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:51,613
- I ain't going with you.
- What you mean you not going with me?

984
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,198
I mean this shit is dangerous!

985
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,284
Of course it's dangerous, it's a drive-by!

986
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,660
But we can get the money.

987
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,996
All we have to do is battle the 409s
at the Streets tonight...

988
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,331
...pay Sugar Bear back, and we're good.

989
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:04,835
Nigger, did you wear a pink shirt
to a drive-by?

990
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,338
It brings out my eyes.

991
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,884
Look, if you walk away from this,
I'll walk away with you.

992
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:15,304
Walk away from what?
I'm not you, Thomas.

993
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,473
I can't go to Just Community College
like you...

994
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,892
...be a doctor,
operating on people and shit.

995
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,604
Yes, you can, man!
If I can do it, you can do it!

996
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,440
Not with these hands!

997
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,568
I got guns for hands!

998
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,906
They call me
Edward Triggerhands, fam.

999
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,493
For me, it's all about respect.

1000
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,331
A- Con...

1001
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,724
Are you wearing the elastic
I asked you to wear?

1002
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,559
Keep your chins up.

1003
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,104
You're never gonna be a Nora.
Have a good show.

1004
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,023
Yes, this is she.

1005
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,276
Hey, Charity. Where's Thomas?

1006
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:14,321
The last time I heard,
he and A-Con went after Sugar Bear.

1007
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,157
- What?
- Yeah, well, they owe him $5,000

1008
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,284
...and they can't come up with the money.

1009
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,495
There has to be another way.

1010
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,581
Well, if he had a crew,
he could've battled at the Streets...

1011
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:28,877
...and possibly won the money back,
but where we gonna find a crew?

1012
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:33,090
Hey, guys! Thomas is in trouble
and he needs our help.

1013
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:36,218
There's a battle at the Streets tonight
and he needs a crew.

1014
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,720
So, what are you saying?
You want to start a crew?

1015
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,013
Yeah!

1016
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,724
And who's gonna be in this "crew?"

1017
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,978
Well, maybe you don't wanna step out
of your perfect world...

1018
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,398
...but there's a lot going on
under the radar at Musical High.

1019
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,608
Take sweet little Tracy, for example.

1020
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,944
She has really bad hair.

1021
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:57,155
Tyler has a horrible smile!

1022
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,199
And what about you, Nora?

1023
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:02,244
I mean, everybody knows
that you're the best dancer in school.

1024
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,829
Let's do this!

1025
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,420
What about the showcase?

1026
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:35,110
The 409 Crew coming up, y'all!
409, yeah!

1027
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,987
It's that time, y'all.

1028
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:40,449
Now, I believe that our distinguished
panel of random extras...

1029
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,284
...have made their decision.

1030
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,703
May I have the envelope, please?

1031
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:47,623
Man.

1032
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,833
And for all you people
at home watching...

1033
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,793
I am wearing all yellow.

1034
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:55,797
This is a tight moment.
Tighter than the button on my suit.

1035
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,717
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner!

1036
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,386
- The winner is...
- Hey, yo, Truck!

1037
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,305
- What do you want, punk?
- Hey, hey. Hey, now.

1038
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,641
I wanna battle! Me and you, one on one.

1039
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,684
That's not how it goes.
You have to have a crew to battle.

1040
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:09,645
- Says who?
- It's a written law of the Streets.

1041
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,147
Says it right there.
"No dance battling without a crew. "

1042
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,775
- And you don't have a crew.
- Oh, yes, he does.

1043
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,777
Megan? What are you doing here?

1044
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,613
Oh, no, this for street dancers only.
They're not street dancers.

1045
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,282
We gonna do it
just like we do it on the Streets.

1046
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,701
Now the baddest man hit my hand.

1047
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,913
Now you've been challenged.
Do you accept?

1048
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,331
- Let's do this.
- All right.

1049
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:33,085
Then it's gonna be the 409 Crew versus,
what's your name, young man?

1050
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,337
- Thomas Uncles.
- The Uncle Toms!

1051
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,922
Show your love!

1052
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,466
Let's go, 409, let's go!

1053
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,135
Uncle Toms, assemble!

1054
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,786
We got this.

1055
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,008
Hey, wait a minute, I thought only
the good guys get to go in slow motion?

1056
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,639
- Hey, yo, Thomas.
- A-Con!

1057
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,891
What's up?
Wait, what happened with Sugar Bear?

1058
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,477
Mr. Stache took care of that, man.
We good.

1059
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,646
Now let's serve these suckers, B.

1060
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,148
Everybody huddle up.

1061
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:37,649
Hold on, man!

1062
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:41,653
Yo, how we gonna compete
with these guys with these guys?

1063
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,490
We got this, A-Con.

1064
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,035
All right, everybody.
You just do what you do best, okay?

1065
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,620
Let's do this!

1066
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:18,273
- What's going on?
- I don't think I can do this.

1067
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,275
Remember the routine you used to do
at the club?

1068
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,819
Do that and you'll be great.

1069
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,029
Okay.

1070
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,913
I didn't mean that club.

1071
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,643
That's my girl!

1072
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,520
What's this?

1073
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:04,945
Yeah!

1074
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:23,171
Nigger! Did you wear tight ass shorts
and skates to a battle?

1075
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,840
Yeah. So did you.

1076
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:30,303
Oh, yeah. And it worked for T.I.
In ATL, right?

1077
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:31,972
What up, dawg!

1078
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:48,697
Wee!

1079
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,156
Stop weeing!

1080
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,473
Yeah! What!

1081
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,183
Yeah!

1082
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,396
They did their thing tonight!

1083
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,857
And the judges have made
their decision.

1084
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,942
And the winner is...

1085
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,527
- A tie?
- What?

1086
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:33,909
Oh, hell, no!
Y'all can't do this to these kids!

1087
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,369
What y'all want to see?
Y'all want to see them battle it out?

1088
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:41,082
All right. We gonna do this
the Stache way.

1089
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:46,588
Each crew gets one move, no rules,
and the audience will decide.

1090
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,840
Let's get it on!

1091
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,471
Let's go. They got one move left,
and we know what that is.

1092
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,557
Three, four, five, six, seven.

1093
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,402
- What are they doing?
- Stealing our move, man!

1094
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,784
I'm stealing your shit!

1095
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:19,287
Now what?

1096
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,873
Yo, that's not fair. You stole our move!

1097
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:25,961
That's true.
But you still got one move left.

1098
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,128
Sugar Bear?

1099
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,882
I came here to get my bread,
my chips, my cheese.

1100
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,510
- Here you go.
- I'm talking about my money, bitch.

1101
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:34,803
Don't get cute.

1102
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,097
All right, fat boy, let's see what you got.

1103
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,162
I'm about to get in your ass!

1104
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,132
Am I still cute?
I look like a black Gumby?

1105
01:15:55,426 --> 01:16:00,472
Uncle Toms! Uncle Toms!
Uncle Toms! Uncle Toms!

1106
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,557
And the crowd has spoken!

1107
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:06,811
The winner of this year's
Battle of the Streets and $5,000

1108
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,772
...goes to the Uncle Toms!

1109
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,149
Yeah! Show your love!

1110
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:15,153
Now that's a battle right there!
That's what I'm talking about!

1111
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,912
- Good work, guys!
- Hey!

1112
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,121
Hey!

1113
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,749
That was really wild,
what you did out there.

1114
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:31,628
Thanks. I couldn't let you go out there
and risk your future.

1115
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:35,757
Oh, my gosh, Megan!
Megan, congratulations, girl!

1116
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,675
Thanks, Charity.

1117
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,929
By the way,
I brought somebody with me.

1118
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:44,599
- Well, now, that certainly was different.
- I guess it was.

1119
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:48,061
So, you and your entire crew
missed the senior showcase for this?

1120
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:52,232
Ever since I started hanging out
with these guys, I've learned a lesson.

1121
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:55,110
Some things are more important
than going to college...

1122
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,529
...or getting a high-paying job...

1123
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,740
...or inventing something
that could save the lives of millions.

1124
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,535
It's something we like to call respect.

1125
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:07,580
And you only get it here, in the Streets.

1126
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:08,748
Yeah!

1127
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,000
Well, this might surprise you...

1128
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:14,546
...but I know a little something
about the hip-hop.

1129
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,131
What you know about hip-hop?

1130
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:20,510
Well, back in the day, I happened to be
one of the best beatboxers around.

1131
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,262
- Is that right?
- Yeah!

1132
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:25,557
- Well, why don't you kick a beat then?
- All right.

1133
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:32,480
That beat is hot.
But her lips ain't moving.

1134
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:35,358
- Oh, yes, they are.
- Yo!

1135
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,406
We like to party...

1136
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,075
We don't cause trouble
We don't bother nobody...

1137
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,452
We're just some men that's on the mic...

1138
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:49,247
And when we rock upon the mic
We rock the mic right...

1139
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,791
I am a human beatbox...

1140
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,721
Hold onto me.

1141
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,703
What's the matter, Thomas?

1142
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,040
- You think you know me?
- Yes.

1143
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,376
Then you need to see me in the light.

1144
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,964
Are you afraid?

1145
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,717
No. I'm not afraid.

1146
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,552
You should be.

1147
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:02,278
- Aren't you even a little scared?
- No. More disappointed than anything.

1148
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:04,822
You just turned around
with glitter on your face.

1149
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,659
- You don't even have fangs.
- Let's dance.

1150
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:20,797
- Now you're dancing.
- At prom. And next year, at Juilliard.

1151
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:25,051
Thomas, why didn't you take me
when you had the chance?

1152
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,220
You don't know what you're saying.
You don't really want this.

1153
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,765
It will change your life.
Besides, you know what they say.

1154
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,059
Once you go black, you never go back?

1155
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:37,063
No. You shouldn't do it until you're
with the one you'll be with forever.

1156
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:39,357
I dream of being with you forever.

1157
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,027
- So you really want this?
- Yes. Give it to me right now.

1158
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:47,073
You're gonna live a long
and happy life with me.

1159
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,118
Oh, shit, white guys.

1160
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,745
So, what you're gonna do
is leave the car up front.

1161
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,957
Here are the keys.
It's the one blasting Coldplay.

1162
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:58,668
Don't steal anything, okay? Scurry on.
