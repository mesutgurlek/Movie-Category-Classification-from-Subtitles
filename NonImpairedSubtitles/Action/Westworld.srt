00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:36,281
Hi. Ed Ramsey from Delos.

2
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:40,115
If there's anyone who doesn't know
what Delos is, well, as we've always said...

3
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,920
...Delos is the vacation of the future, today.

4
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:46,821
At Delos you get your choice
of the vacation you want.

5
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:50,892
There's Medieval World, Roman World
and, of course, Westworld.

6
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,992
Let's talk to some people
who've been there.

7
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:54,468
Pardon me, sir. What is your name?

8
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:57,028
Gardner Lewis.
Just got back from Westworld.

9
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,640
Tell us how you liked it, Mr. Lewis.

10
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,268
When you played cowboys and Indians
as a kid, you'd point...

11
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:03,904
...go "bang, bang" and the other kid
would lie down and play dead.

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,381
Well, Westworld is the same thing, only...
only it's for real!

13
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:12,480
I shot six people!
Well, they weren't real people!

14
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:15,316
What Mr. Lewis means is
he shot six robots...

15
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:19,723
...scientifically programmed to look, act,
talk and even bleed just like humans do.

16
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:20,728
Isn't that right?

17
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:24,096
Well, they may have been robots.
I mean, I think they were robots.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,028
I mean, I know they were robots!

19
00:01:27,237 --> 00:01:29,831
Yes, the robots of Westworld are there
to serve you...

20
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:33,808
...and to give you the most unique
vacation experience of your life.

21
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:34,935
Thank you, sir.

22
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,304
And you, madam?

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,504
Hello.

24
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:39,809
What is your name?

25
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:43,148
My name is Janet Lane,
and I was in Roman World.

26
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,379
What is the one thing that stands out
in your mind about Roman World?

27
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:48,924
Oh, well, I think it would be...

28
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:51,424
...the men!

29
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:53,855
I just feel marvelous! I mean...

30
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,161
...it's just a warm, glowing place to be!

31
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,899
Thank you very much.

32
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:01,698
Oh, thank you very much!

33
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:03,239
Goodbye.

34
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:04,364
Goodbye.

35
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:06,764
And you, sir?

36
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:07,707
Yeah?

37
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,301
What is your name, sir?

38
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,041
Oh, I'm Ted Mann.
I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis.

39
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,748
And, which world did you
just come from, sir?

40
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:16,718
Oh, you're not going to believe this!

41
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:20,244
I've just been the sheriff of Westworld
for the last two weeks!

42
00:02:20,356 --> 00:02:22,221
Did it seem real to you, sir?

43
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,760
It's the realest thing I've ever done!
I mean that!

44
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:25,988
Thank you very much.

45
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:26,858
Yeah.

46
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:28,994
And you, sir?

47
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,329
My name's Arthur Caine.
I've been in the castle.

48
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,700
I've had a couple of sword fights
and three jousts.

49
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,497
And I...

50
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:39,566
I married a beautiful princess.

51
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,607
Is that something you've
always dreamed of doing, sir?

52
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,043
All my life!

53
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:49,542
There were some of the comments
of people who've just returned from Delos.

54
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:50,813
Why don't you arrange...

55
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:55,221
...to take our Hovercraft to Medieval World,
Roman World and Westworld?

56
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,388
Was it worth $1,000 a day?

57
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,620
Yes!

58
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:04,590
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you!

59
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:13,066
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.

60
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:17,039
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.

61
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:35,395
This is Delos Control to Station 3.

62
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,834
You are cleared on Vector 79, on 195...

63
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:44,234
We anticipate scanning
in about four and a half minutes.

64
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:02,748
I'm not worried at all. I'm just...

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,091
I'm just curious.

66
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,929
How much do they weigh?

67
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:09,788
Three or four pounds.

68
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,330
That heavy.

69
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,632
Do they have much of a kick?

70
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,237
A Colt.45?

71
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,402
Well, I never fired one before.

72
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:29,943
What about that thing
where you go like this over the gun?

73
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,584
- Fanning?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,281
- What about it?
- Is that hard to do?

75
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:40,225
Now...

76
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:44,096
The gunbelt, does it have those strings
to tie around your leg?

77
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,429
If that's the kind you want.

78
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:49,494
That's the kind I want. I think it's
probably better for quick draws, you know.

79
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:53,302
It all depends.

80
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,806
What kind of gunbelt did you have
the last time?

81
00:04:57,947 --> 00:04:59,915
I had the one without the strings.

82
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,610
And you could draw fast?

83
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,820
Then maybe it doesn't matter after all.

84
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,125
The guns they give you are real guns?

85
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,558
Real guns.

86
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:19,826
That's incredible.

87
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,132
Give us a shift to 197...

88
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:26,039
...and take it down to Port 43.

89
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:29,042
Negative acceleration at 22.

90
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,872
So long as you maintain
passenger comfort.

91
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:36,750
Sigma-sigma was transferred
according to the log at 041.

92
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:42,021
The orientation on the resort
will now begin.

93
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:44,183
Please put on your earphones.

94
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,229
Don't you want to listen?

95
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:50,059
I heard it the last time.

96
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:54,769
...consists of three separate resort areas,
each with its own special appeal.

97
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,529
Whichever resort you have chosen...

98
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,007
...we are sure you will have
a fascinating and rewarding stay here.

99
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:04,870
Western World is a complete re-creation
of the American frontier of 1880.

100
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:09,441
Here it is possible to relive the excitement
and stresses of pioneer life to the fullest.

101
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,115
Western World is a life of lawless violence,
a society of guns and action.

102
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:19,424
This is Medieval World, where we have
reconstructed 13th-century Europe.

103
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,324
A world of chivalry and combat,
romance and excitement.

104
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:27,167
Our teams of engineers have spared
no expense in this re-creation...

105
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,568
...precise to the smallest detail.

106
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,296
Then we have Roman World:

107
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,671
A lusty treat for the senses in the setting
of delightful, decadent Pompeii.

108
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:40,212
Here the traveler experiences the sensual,
relaxed morality that existed at the peak...

109
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,217
...of the Imperial Roman Empire.

110
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:44,911
All together,
these resorts comprise Delos...

111
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,888
...the most exciting vacation spot
in the history of man.

112
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,887
This is Delos Control to Station 3.

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,622
Your negative deceleration should be 25...

114
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:57,291
...and your ground speed should be
355 and dropping.

115
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,792
The whole spectrum of technology
has been employed in Delos...

116
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,268
...for the vacationer's pleasure.

117
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,364
Expensive and unusual,
Delos is not for everyone.

118
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:09,707
But for those who choose it, it is truly
a unique and rewarding experience.

119
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,325
We have you on Grid 5.

120
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:24,957
Notify ground crews.

121
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:33,835
Stand by. Locking in now.

122
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:40,437
Shut down 2, shut down 3.

123
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,844
Shut down 2, shut down 3.

124
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,676
Nice job, everybody.

125
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:11,740
Welcome to Delos.

126
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,468
Please go to your color-coded tram...

127
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:18,514
...which will take you
to the world of your choice.

128
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:21,112
Give your name to the attendant.

129
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:24,642
Welcome to Delos.

130
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,313
Please go to your color-coded tram...

131
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,789
...which will take you
to the world of your choice.

132
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,019
May I have your name, please?

133
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:31,991
John Blane.

134
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,460
- Peter Martin.
- Thank you.

135
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:37,261
Please go to your color-coded tram
which will take you...

136
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,231
...to the world of your choice.

137
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,999
We are sure you will enjoy your stay
in Western World.

138
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:45,267
Was she a...?

139
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,703
Probably.

140
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,536
That's amazing!

141
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,908
Supposedly, you really can't tell...
except by looking at the hands.

142
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,877
They haven't perfected the hands yet.

143
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,478
Nothing can go wrong.

144
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,123
You will enjoy your stay in Roman World.

145
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:06,226
While you are there, please feel free
to indulge your every whim.

146
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:09,763
Medieval World exists for you, the guest.

147
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,957
Nothing can go wrong.

148
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,824
I have a quick fade on the CRT and my
balance controls don't seem to help me.

149
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:16,754
I'm keeping this in real time.

150
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,824
Switch me over to an on-line status
and I'll do it manually.

151
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:23,466
You've got a three-millisecond cycle delay
which should be computed in.

152
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,064
I don't know what to do
if the stagecoach is late.

153
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,007
Oh! It's fantastic!

154
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,400
I reckon that's everything.

155
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,598
Bath's down the hall.

156
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:35,633
Bath'll cost you two bits for hot water.

157
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,045
Dinner at 7:00, breakfast at 6:30.

158
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:41,043
Get lunch on your own.

159
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,812
Couple of places in town to eat.

160
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,444
Don't look like much here,
but we have everything.

161
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:47,882
Just a minute.

162
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,364
You mean to tell me he's a robot?

163
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,302
That's what I mean to tell you.

164
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,641
We're paying $1,000 a day for this?

165
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,374
It's authentic.

166
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,012
The West of the 1880s.

167
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:20,215
Well, at least they could've made it
a little more comfortable.

168
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,455
But that's the point.

169
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,820
This is really the way it was.

170
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:29,330
If you wanted comfort,
you should have stayed in Chicago.

171
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:31,930
Julie would have loved all this!

172
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,763
Poking around for hours
in all those funny shops, looking for silly...

173
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,237
What the hell is wrong with you?

174
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,773
You're a lawyer!

175
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,967
You know better than anybody else
what a ride she took you for.

176
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:43,409
Well, the kids...

177
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:45,273
Fine, the kids!

178
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,082
But you're here, six months later,
still thinking about her.

179
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,618
No, not really.
She just came to mind, is all.

180
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,319
There's a lot to do here.

181
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,118
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.

182
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,293
What about you?

183
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:11,764
Vodka martini on the rocks
with a twist of lemon. Very dry, please.

184
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,930
Just give him whiskey. He's new in town.

185
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,244
You've got to get into the feel of the thing.

186
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:23,505
I feel silly.

187
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:25,105
Why?

188
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:27,881
It's like a joke.

189
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:33,412
It's not a joke, it's an amusement park.
It's the best amusement park in the world.

190
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,988
All you have to do is have fun.

191
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,753
There's some pretty
rough-looking customers here.

192
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,227
How many of them are...?

193
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,560
Guests like us?

194
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:44,855
Who knows?

195
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,528
That's the beauty of this place.
It doesn't matter.

196
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,032
It may look rough,
but it's still just a resort.

197
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:10,319
There's no way to get hurt here.
Just enjoy yourself.

198
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,168
What is this stuff?

199
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,233
It doesn't say.

200
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,138
God! Give me this!

201
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,936
Puts hair on your chest.

202
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,537
Yeah.

203
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:56,461
Sloppy with your drink.

204
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,039
Get this boy a bib.

205
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:14,313
Go on!

206
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,462
He needs his momma.

207
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,100
Kill him.

208
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,308
You talk too much.

209
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:44,376
You say something, boy?

210
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:52,016
I said, you talk too much.

211
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,264
Why don't you make me shut up?

212
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,921
Your move.

213
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,010
Pretty realistic, huh?

214
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:21,609
Listen, are you sure he was a...?

215
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,153
Of course. You don't really think
you shot anybody, do you?

216
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:29,524
Wow!

217
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,355
Hey, John...

218
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:36,925
How do I know I'm not going to kill
another guest with this thing?

219
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:41,360
Try it.

220
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,800
Shoot me.

221
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:49,671
Go on, shoot.

222
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,440
Shoot!

223
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,890
The gun has a sensing device.

224
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,219
It won't fire at anything
with a high body temperature.

225
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:08,562
Only something cold, like a machine.

226
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,558
They thought of everything.

227
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:18,671
The Black Knight won't be repaired
till tomorrow afternoon.

228
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:26,579
Yeah, I have the banquet scheduled
for 5:30, if that conforms.

229
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,822
What do folks do for companionly
entertainment in this town?

230
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,666
I wouldn't know about such things.
I'm just runnin' this hotel.

231
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,998
Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon
down at the end of the street.

232
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,575
Now, I won't have talk of that woman
in this house.

233
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,233
Not over my dinner.

234
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:31,805
The food's real good, ma'am.

235
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,277
Thank you, stranger.
You're a gentleman of some breedin'.

236
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,580
Isn't she terrific?

237
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:40,480
Who's Miss Carrie?

238
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:30,729
You fellas new in town?

239
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:33,463
Yep.

240
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:35,298
Whiskey.

241
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,443
Just passin' through?

242
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,238
Maybe.

243
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,215
Lookin' for some fun?

244
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,111
Maybe.

245
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:50,219
Well, you've come to the right place.
There's plenty of fun here.

246
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,823
That's Cindy and Arlette.

247
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,697
Arlette's from Paris.

248
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,958
Perhaps you gentlemen
are taking a likin' to 'em.

249
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,392
Perhaps.

250
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:04,232
They're real accommodatin'.

251
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:08,866
- They look it.
- Listen...

252
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:12,380
Why don't you just go on upstairs
and we'll reckon accounts later?

253
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:16,146
- Sounds good to me.
- Are those two girls machines?

254
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,513
Now, how can you say a thing like that?

255
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,114
Come on.

256
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:37,330
What's goin' on?

257
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:40,998
They're robbin' the bank.

258
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,573
Robbin' the bank?

259
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,870
Hey, maybe we oughta go help out.

260
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,381
You don't know.
It might be fun to play bank robbers.

261
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,078
Look, Pete, this is better.

262
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,691
There...

263
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:42,532
There is something I have to tell you.
I don't know if it matters...

264
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,363
...but it matters to me.

265
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:55,309
I haven't ever had a...

266
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,687
Well, I hardly know you,
if you know what I mean. I mean...

267
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,687
We just met a few minutes ago.

268
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,388
You're probably very nice.

269
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,447
I feel funny.

270
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:37,814
Why?

271
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:33,543
I think you're very nice.

272
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:46,221
How was it? Wasn't it terrific?

273
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:49,159
Boy, machines are the servant of man!

274
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:51,095
Wasn't that great?

275
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,860
Not bad.

276
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:56,136
Not bad. Now you're the big lover!

277
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:00,268
Well, you know how it is.

278
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:02,472
Some guys have a way with women.

279
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:05,876
Shooting stopped.

280
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,914
I guess we missed the robbery.

281
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,487
You can't have everything.

282
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:18,386
John...

283
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,492
...this place is really fun!

284
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,084
I think it's the jugular unit.

285
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:16,027
- What do you think?
- Should we try and rewire her?

286
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:18,998
No, I'd replace the whole unit
rather than try and repair it.

287
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,056
With a 10?

288
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,700
Use an XX-50 if we have any in stock.
The double X's have a longer lifespan.

289
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:25,534
A 50 may not fit in here.

290
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:29,708
Maybe you can shift the integrator unit
further up into the cavity.

291
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:31,437
I'll try it.

292
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,685
Balance servo again?

293
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:41,277
Yeah, she fell over this afternoon.

294
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,548
I think it's the sensor.

295
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,322
If it's the central unit we'll open her up.

296
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:48,658
You get a confirmation before you do that.

297
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:54,696
What's he in for?

298
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,100
Central malfunction.

299
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:58,465
Another one?

300
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,325
Since we opened the resort,
we had a failure and breakdown rate...

301
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:20,384
...conforming to computer predictions.

302
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:25,158
That is 0.3 malfunctions
for each 24-hour activation period...

303
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,494
...concurrent or not.

304
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:30,033
Now, this was an anticipated operations
aspect of the resort...

305
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,003
...and we were fully able to handle it.

306
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:35,975
The majority of the breakdowns
were minor or peripheral...

307
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:38,002
...until about six weeks ago.

308
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,407
Then Roman World had a rise
in breakdown rate...

309
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,074
...which doubled in a week.

310
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:45,579
In addition,
we saw a disproportionate rise...

311
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,486
...in central as opposed to
peripheral breakdowns.

312
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,289
Now, we identified some problems
with humidity control...

313
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,561
...and regained homeostasis.

314
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:58,195
Despite our corrections,
the breakdown rate continued to climb.

315
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,694
Then Medieval World began
to have trouble.

316
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:03,727
Now we're seeing
more Western World breakdowns.

317
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:07,437
And there's a clear pattern here
which suggests an analogy...

318
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:11,569
...to an infectious disease process
spreading from one resort area to the next.

319
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,381
Perhaps there are
superficial similarities to disease.

320
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,646
It's only a theoretical concept.
There are many ways to order that data.

321
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:22,752
I must confess,
I find it difficult to believe in...

322
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:24,689
...a disease of machinery.

323
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:27,284
We aren't dealing
with ordinary machines here.

324
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,354
These are highly complicated
pieces of equipment...

325
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:33,256
...almost as complicated
as living organisms.

326
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:36,670
In some cases, they've been designed
by other computers.

327
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:39,364
We don't know exactly how they work.

328
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,450
Okay, up gain 437...

329
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,350
I'm not getting sound pickup
from the tenth quadrant.

330
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:58,282
Okay, my telemetry is good.

331
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,294
Repeat, I have good telemetry.

332
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:05,057
We have sunrise at 0.43.

333
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,225
Ready on all quadrants.

334
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:08,562
Energize grid.

335
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,960
Grid energized.

336
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:16,739
All right, then give me a 436,
if you can patch that in.

337
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,836
If not, 435.

338
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,011
I have sound now. Thank you very much.

339
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,742
Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon
and cinnamon toast.

340
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,582
Do you have cinnamon toast? You do?

341
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:31,851
Okay, send it down
to Central Control Room, Console 3.

342
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:33,085
Wait a minute.

343
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:35,355
What was that? No grounding on Unit 5?

344
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:39,626
Try a bypass.
I have readings on all units, 5 included.

345
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,496
Hold on a minute.

346
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,233
All right, let's stand by
for resort activation.

347
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:54,746
You ready on Phase 443?

348
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,010
443.

349
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:03,054
Okay, we're going to activate at 59...

350
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:07,451
Lower gain Alpha 2...

351
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,634
Ready on six, on five, on four...

352
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:18,365
...on three, on two. Activate now.

353
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:07,346
"Oh, give me a home

354
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,116
"Where the buffalo roam

355
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:15,923
"And the deer and the antelope play

356
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:19,691
"Where seldom is heard

357
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:23,165
"A discouraging word

358
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,907
"And the skies are not cloudy all day"

359
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:56,629
What do you want?

360
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:01,000
"Home, home on the range"

361
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:06,741
Not one word.

362
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:09,410
Do you mind if I finish shaving?

363
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:18,648
Have you no sense of...

364
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,101
Was he bothering you?

365
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,736
He isn't gonna bother you again.

366
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,469
I'm here to tell you
that things have changed.

367
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,310
There's law here now.

368
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:13,903
You can't go around plugging
whoever you please.

369
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,681
But, Sheriff, it was self-defense.

370
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,646
That's what they all say.

371
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:22,551
He shot a man. He'll have to stand trial.

372
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,357
Judge'll be here next week.

373
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:27,790
If I were you,
I wouldn't trouble over your friend here.

374
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:29,591
Judge Benson likes to hang 'em.

375
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:31,288
Hang 'em high.

376
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:32,559
Look, Sheriff...

377
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,656
Beat it.

378
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,401
I said, beat it!

379
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:59,158
I've never been in jail before.

380
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,494
First time for everything.

381
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,265
But I haven't done anything wrong.

382
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,400
You shot a man. That's something.

383
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,831
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

384
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,111
Well, Chicago's a long way from here, fella.

385
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,941
A thousand miles and more.

386
00:40:51,899 --> 00:40:52,923
Hold it!

387
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,996
I guess that sort of makes us desperados.

388
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:25,529
Yeah, I guess.

389
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:30,526
Well, what do we do now?

390
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:32,999
The way I figure it, anything we want.

391
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:36,005
- There's no law in that town now.
- I'll say.

392
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:39,938
We go in there,
and we do anything we want!

393
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,313
You know what?

394
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,240
What?

395
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:47,487
I almost believe all this.

396
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:49,781
Why shouldn't you believe it?

397
00:41:50,157 --> 00:41:51,818
It's as real as anything else.

398
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:53,482
Yep.

399
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:54,922
I reckon.

400
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:56,954
What can you give me in Grid 7?

401
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:59,431
We have that on SM-514.

402
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,067
Transfer, now.

403
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:05,297
Transferred.

404
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,034
Reschedule.

405
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,974
She wants to meet the king.
We have to restructure for that.

406
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:11,170
Can't disappoint a guest.

407
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:15,181
Yeah, listen, this is the third day in a row
that I've called you about my laundry.

408
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,546
You've got all my shirts...

409
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,211
We're rechecking the tapes
on the mechanism now.

410
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:22,486
We have programmed infidelity
in the queen...

411
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:25,150
...as of two minutes ago.

412
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:29,060
All right, coming up on the castle, zero...

413
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:30,691
Now.

414
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:33,800
It also conforms with your five-year history
at this time of the year.

415
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,332
Leave me now.

416
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:56,215
My queen!

417
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:05,491
If the king should hear of this,
we would both be put to death!

418
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:09,125
I would be more than happy
to die for you, my lady.

419
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:11,867
Let us pray it shall not be so.

420
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,737
I have news.

421
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:18,712
The Black Knight has returned,
and seeks a match with you.

422
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:21,442
The Black Knight...?

423
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,675
None other.

424
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:25,050
Is he pretty tough?

425
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:28,913
He has the strength of ten,
and cunning besides.

426
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:31,713
But...

427
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,251
...his sight is weak in his left eye.

428
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:37,123
Stay to his left and you will prevail
and win the day.

429
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:40,862
Confirmation of the reprogramming
of that Black Knight...

430
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:44,096
...for left lateral weakness and instability
for tomorrow.

431
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,267
I shall see you on the morrow?

432
00:43:46,974 --> 00:43:47,998
My lady.

433
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,068
Schedule for tomorrow a.m.
It's his last day in the resort.

434
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,732
Let's make it a lulu.

435
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,439
Tomorrow a.m. Broadswords.
Schedule locked.

436
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:29,481
We have a problem
with the air conditioning in Beta section.

437
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,915
Send a crew out.

438
00:44:31,352 --> 00:44:33,843
Yes! He can be sheriff any time he wants.

439
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:36,149
That is correct. Just give him the badge.

440
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:51,097
Now, I'm the new law around here.

441
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:54,907
You think you can handle things?

442
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,839
You wanna try me?

443
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,732
A thousand pardons, my lord.

444
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:34,476
What is your name, child?

445
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:36,605
Daphne.

446
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:38,943
Daphne.

447
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:43,182
Oh, I love this place.

448
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:45,289
I love my horse.

449
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:47,187
I love my horse and I love Julie.

450
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:48,626
Oh, shut up, will you?

451
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,528
I like the spots on my horse.

452
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:54,390
- Did you see the spots on my horse?
- Your horse is beautiful.

453
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:57,369
- Thank you very much. I like yours, too.
- Thank you.

454
00:45:58,839 --> 00:45:59,828
Look out!

455
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:01,601
Let me handle this!

456
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:26,929
Goddamn it!

457
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,565
- Do you suppose it's real?
- Hell, no!

458
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:32,628
That's not supposed to happen!

459
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,004
Maybe it is! Maybe it's part of the thing!

460
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:39,311
The hell! Goddamn machines, anyway!
That's not supposed to happen!

461
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:42,506
A rattlesnake struck a guest?

462
00:46:42,616 --> 00:46:44,345
He was shooting at it and he missed.

463
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:46,750
The snakes are programmed
never to hit on a strike.

464
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,152
- Was the guest injured?
- Minor puncture wounds.

465
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:51,280
It's inexcusable to injure a guest.

466
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,990
Pick up that snake for a total post at once.

467
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,690
Check all the snake's central mechanisms
tonight during the repair period.

468
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,302
Doesn't anything work around here?

469
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:26,849
Logic circuits on the snake
simply failed to respond.

470
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:29,752
There was no sign
of mechanical damage or tampering...

471
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,723
...and no clue to the malfunction.

472
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:33,856
Central mechanism psychosis?

473
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:36,291
I feel we should shut down
the resort for a month.

474
00:48:36,363 --> 00:48:37,796
Oh, that seems rash.

475
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:40,992
A snake injured a guest.
We can't allow that to happen.

476
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:43,829
Many elements of the Delos Resort
are potentially dangerous.

477
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:46,270
That's part of the appeal.
But if they become truly dangerous...

478
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,329
I agree.

479
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,473
We can announce
that the resort is overbooked...

480
00:48:50,544 --> 00:48:53,411
...and not allow any further
new guests to arrive.

481
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,707
We can take care of the ones already here.

482
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:59,309
If we can't insure the safety of the guests,
we'll be in desperate trouble.

483
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:02,549
But we can insure their safety.
Everything's fine.

484
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:51,429
All right, let's start that bar fight.

485
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:52,739
Cheat!

486
00:49:59,446 --> 00:50:01,607
John, what do you say?

487
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,542
Hit me.

488
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,927
Now, that's just rude!

489
00:51:18,859 --> 00:51:20,793
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!

490
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:56,511
What's his problem?

491
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:59,648
Nothing. He got shot up today,
so we're taking the opportunity...

492
00:52:59,726 --> 00:53:02,194
...to replace the visual cortex.

493
00:53:02,362 --> 00:53:04,353
Using the new infrared units.

494
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,990
And we're increasing audio sensitivity.

495
00:53:11,972 --> 00:53:13,496
You called for me, my lord?

496
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:14,662
Yes.

497
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:19,111
How long have you been
in the palace, Daphne?

498
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:21,408
Since I was three, my lord.

499
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:23,809
Charming.

500
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:28,117
I think we ought to get
to know each other better, Daphne.

501
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:29,954
Better, my lord?

502
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,623
I can reward you well.

503
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:37,856
My lord...

504
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:39,525
Daphne...

505
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:42,198
My lord!

506
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:43,729
Daphne...

507
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:48,233
My lord forgets himself!

508
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:52,510
Problem with the girl.
Program breakdown.

509
00:53:53,446 --> 00:53:54,640
What's the trouble?

510
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:57,011
One of the castle machines
isn't responding.

511
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:59,210
Refusing a guest seduction.

512
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:01,616
Get her out of there,
and report it to central repair.

513
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:02,814
Right.

514
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,114
Refusing...?

515
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,608
- Did you find the trouble?
- No apparent trouble.

516
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,806
But she wasn't following programming.

517
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:30,508
She refused a guest seduction
and she is a sex model.

518
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,115
Certainly is.

519
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:33,678
Will they shut down?

520
00:54:33,753 --> 00:54:37,519
No, the directors feel that to close down
now would hurt tourist confidence.

521
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,058
I don't like it.

522
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,392
Breakfast.

523
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,151
I'm never gonna drink again.

524
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:38,681
Okay, 437...

525
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:41,351
I'm not getting sound pickup
in the tenth quadrant.

526
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,389
Please set numbers to console...

527
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:03,772
Hold, varlet!

528
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,978
Are you speaking to me?

529
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:17,750
None other, sire.

530
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:21,186
Look, I'm hungry and l...

531
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:27,523
Prepare for thy doom,
thy scurrilous knave! Huh!

532
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:30,261
Wait a minute! Can't we talk this over?

533
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:32,234
What, have you no spine, varlet?

534
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,299
Well, I...

535
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:37,070
The queen!

536
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:42,574
Full monitor.

537
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:47,108
Okay.

538
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:50,079
Let him go.

539
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:52,816
Oh, what a hangover.

540
00:58:14,274 --> 00:58:15,673
All right, varlet!

541
00:58:21,314 --> 00:58:23,282
We're losing a little tolerance.
Bring me up.

542
00:58:55,548 --> 00:58:57,675
Shut down! Shut down immediately!

543
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,646
Circuits don't respond, sir!

544
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,857
Then cut the robot power!

545
00:59:06,926 --> 00:59:07,790
Power cut!

546
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:11,227
Oh, my head!

547
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,132
I'm freezing!

548
00:59:24,877 --> 00:59:26,538
Gotta get to the hotel.

549
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,775
I think I'm gonna be sick.

550
00:59:42,362 --> 00:59:45,422
- They're not responding!
- Shall we cut the main power grid, sir?

551
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,432
Shut it all down! Shut it all down!

552
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,569
Hold it!

553
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:07,445
Come on, not now.

554
01:00:07,987 --> 01:00:09,284
Not you again.

555
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:11,418
It's too early.

556
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:15,792
Let me do it this time.

557
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:20,691
Your move.

558
01:00:32,345 --> 01:00:33,607
I'm shot.

559
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,036
What?

560
01:00:35,915 --> 01:00:37,143
I'm shot!

561
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:48,986
John...?

562
01:01:01,774 --> 01:01:02,968
Oh, my God!

563
01:01:06,112 --> 01:01:07,101
Draw.

564
01:01:18,157 --> 01:01:20,523
Sir, we have no control
over the robots at all!

565
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,227
- They're running on stored charge!
- How long can they go?

566
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,867
Some will begin to run down in an hour.
Others can go a full 12!

567
01:02:51,551 --> 01:02:54,577
- Turn the main grid back on!
- The relays must be frozen.

568
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:56,582
We can't get back our power!

569
01:02:56,656 --> 01:02:58,021
Hello? Hello?

570
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,668
Now, how are we going to get out of here?
All these doors are electrically powered.

571
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:49,539
Now, get these doors open in here
before we all suffocate!

572
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:04,133
Temperature elevated, 98 degrees.

573
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,531
Oxygen, 17 percent and dropping.

574
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,372
Get that power on
so we can open these doors.

575
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:46,535
Hey!

576
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:48,341
Don't shoot me!

577
01:07:49,548 --> 01:07:50,810
Hey, wait a minute!

578
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,480
What's the matter with you?

579
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,221
Hold out your hands.

580
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,850
Let me see your hands!

581
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,128
You're a guest!

582
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:08,689
You really gave me a scare.

583
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:12,066
Look, everything's broken down.
The machines have gone crazy.

584
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:13,728
You know about the machines?

585
01:08:13,906 --> 01:08:15,533
Yeah, I repair 'em.

586
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:18,099
There's one chasing me now. A gunslinger.

587
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,402
Gunslinger.

588
01:08:20,246 --> 01:08:23,181
Must be a model 404, maybe a 406.

589
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:26,451
If he's a 406,
he's got all the sensory equipment.

590
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,452
It's a beautiful machine!

591
01:08:28,554 --> 01:08:29,612
He's after me!

592
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:30,780
I don't doubt it.

593
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:31,879
What can I do?

594
01:08:31,957 --> 01:08:34,050
There's nothing you can do. He'll get you.

595
01:08:34,126 --> 01:08:35,559
You haven't got a chance.

596
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:37,425
There must be something!

597
01:08:37,496 --> 01:08:40,329
Fella, don't kid yourself.
There are things you could try:

598
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:43,798
Acid for his visual system,
noise for his hearing...

599
01:08:44,804 --> 01:08:47,136
No matter what,
he'll always be one jump ahead of you!

600
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,696
You haven't got a chance!

601
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,137
Yes, I do.

602
01:23:19,444 --> 01:23:20,809
Help me!

603
01:23:27,786 --> 01:23:29,185
Help me!

604
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:35,759
Help me!

605
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:43,725
Help me!

606
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:49,904
All right. It's all right.

607
01:24:11,663 --> 01:24:12,789
- It's okay.
- Help me!

608
01:24:12,864 --> 01:24:14,263
All right, all right.

609
01:24:14,332 --> 01:24:16,300
- Help me!
- You're gonna be all right.

610
01:24:16,735 --> 01:24:17,929
Help me!

611
01:24:31,382 --> 01:24:32,610
No water...

612
01:24:33,118 --> 01:24:35,177
- Go ahead. Go ahead and drink.
- No water...

613
01:24:35,253 --> 01:24:38,051
- I'm trying to help you.
- No water. No. No!

614
01:26:53,558 --> 01:26:55,890
Why don't you make arrangements
to take our Hovercraft...

615
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,690
...to Medieval World, Roman World
and Westworld.

616
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:01,726
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.

617
01:27:01,866 --> 01:27:05,199
Boy, have we got a vacation for you,
vacation for you...

618
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:07,898
...for you, for you, for you...
