00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:10,040
Big Momma's House [2000]

2
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Ready?

3
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,400
FBl.

4
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,680
- Throw that piece of shit in there.
- No, wait.

5
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,040
Sit down and shut up, you old fool.

6
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,360
Ten thousand.

7
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,760
- On... bug-eye boy.
- What?!

8
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,360
Big balls, huh? Big cojones, huh?

9
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
- I'll take that bet.
- Ready? And fight!

10
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,840
Y'all never heard of Soul, Korea?

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,760
- FBl! Everybody freeze.
- Don't move.

12
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,800
- John!
- A little help down here, please?

13
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,800
No doubt. Are you all right?

14
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,160
I'm just takin' a bath
with Old Yeller down here.

15
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,480
Could you open the cage? I'm a married man.
I'm not used to this much attention.

16
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Satellite TV and a six-pack
do not a full life make.

17
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,480
You gotta understand. I'm not like you.

18
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
On the street, I gotta keep it simple.

19
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,280
You know what I mean? I can't have
a family and home out there distracting me.

20
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
That's funny.
I couldn't be out there without it.

21
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,600
OK. We've got a live one, people.
Conference room in five.

22
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,800
Oh, Malcolm. Didn't recognize you
with the make-up off. Got the Michaels file?

23
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
- Got it.
- Good. Bring it here.

24
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm just sayin', on the street I can't have
no distractions. I gotta be ready for anything.

25
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,800
- Nice.
- You too grown for this shit, man.

26
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,400
A prison escape leaves one man dead.

27
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,640
Lester Vesco,
serving a life sentence for murder,

28
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,080
has escaped from a federal penitentiary.

29
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,320
He is seen here on security cameras
robbing the Century Union Bank.

30
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,120
- Vesco is extremely dangerous.
- Oh, my God.

31
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,120
What's wrong?

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Nothing's wrong.

33
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
You know, how would you like
to go on a little vacation?

34
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,440
- I don't know. We've never been on one.
- How fast can you get ready?

35
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,160
Ready.

36
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,200
Well, you look ready to me.

37
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,960
Grab your medicine.

38
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,440
Got your seat belt on?

39
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,440
- Yup.
- Let's roll.

40
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,760
Lester Vesco. Not a nice man, people.

41
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,520
Two years ago, he robbed a bank,
popped a guard and the bank manager

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,240
and walked out with two million
in cash and bearer bonds.

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,320
We got him, but the money
was never recovered.

44
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,760
Twelve hours ago, he killed a prison doctor

45
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,520
and drove out the front gate
in the man's Volvo. Very creative.

46
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
- What about the girl from the robbery?
- Lester's girlfriend. Sherry Pierce.

47
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,080
Never convicted. Worked in the bank.

48
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,360
So she gives him access to the vault,

49
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,840
cries on the stand
and walks away with two million large.

50
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,000
Exactly. But we never proved it.

51
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,240
She's pretty smart.
Keeps a low profile, works two shit jobs.

52
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,480
Now it looks like she's in the wind.

53
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,160
So we find her,
we find Lester, we find the money.

54
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,280
- What about this stepbrother in Oakland?
- You and Gallagher take it.

55
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,880
- Get some warrants. Set up a surveillance.
- Great. Malcolm and I can stay here

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
and hit the phones.

57
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,120
No, no, I've got something special
planned for you two.

58
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,880
Sherry's got a long-lost grandmother
in Cartersville, Georgia.

59
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,960
And who knows, Malcolm? Maybe you'll find
an Armani outlet - by the Piggly Wiggly.

60
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,920
That's all, people.

61
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,560
- There's Big Momma.
- What a classic scene.

62
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,080
Genteel old lady, pruning her roses.

63
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,360
Lord, I done told Sadie about this dog.

64
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,600
Let me catch you here again
and I'll barbecue some hot dog!

65
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
- Got it.
- You know what, man?

66
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,080
Erskine and Stoner probably caught
that girl Sherry two days ago.

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,720
They just wanted us to sit here
pickin' ticks off our asses.

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,760
Nobody's tried to kill you for days.
The stress must be overwhelming.

69
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm just here to catch a bad guy.
If it goes down hard, so be it.

70
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,640
If we could get in to plant the surveillance
equipment, we wouldn't be stuck here.

71
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,560
Hey, what do we have here?

72
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,440
Must be one of those Southern traditions.
Exchanging baked goods in the street.

73
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Nah, you bring them over.
That's how you meet the new neighbors.

74
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,400
Oh, man.

75
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,800
- Where are you going?
- While she's out, I'll set the surveillance.

76
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,360
Stall 'em.

77
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,360
- Stall them?
- Trust me.

78
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,680
- Malcolm!
- Four and a half minutes.

79
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,640
- Well, how-dee, ladies.
- Hello, neighbor.

80
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,280
Welcome to Maple Drive.
We hope you will come to love...

81
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,840
Oh, shut up and give the man
your dry old Bundt cake so I can go home.

82
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,400
You'll have to excuse Hattie Mae.
Her stomach's not feelin' too good.

83
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm Miss Patterson

84
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,360
and this is Miss Other Patterson.

85
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,440
We call her that because she's from
a whole different set of Pattersons.

86
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,960
- My name's John.
- John what?

87
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,160
- Patterson! Isn't that a weird coincidence?
- Yes, it is.

88
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,560
Maybe we're all related.

89
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,320
I used to be married, but not any more.

90
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,040
Oh, Lord. Is she with Jesus?

91
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,880
No. Actually, Jesus,
I think, is how he pronounces it.

92
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,440
He was the gardener.

93
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,440
I caught him spreadin' fertilizer
in the bedroom, if you know what I mean.

94
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,040
'Scuse me, honey.
Here's your corn bread. I got to go.

95
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,200
No, you can't! Ladies, it was really a pleasure.

96
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Wait. You can't leave.

97
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,320
Where's this great Southern hospitality I've
heard about, Hattie Mae? lf I can call you that.

98
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,760
I was hoping we could sit in the front porch
and shuck corn, shoot squirrels...

99
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,080
Boy, you ain't right. Did somebody
hook you up to a jumper cable?

100
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,720
When I say I got to go, move - I got to go.

101
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,240
Wait!

102
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,840
I'm not crazy, just a little lonely.
We could spend some quality time together.

103
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,040
Say, you know what I do
when I have an upset stomach?

104
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,400
I jog. Yes! Come on!

105
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
It's good when you got the runs.
Come on, me and you around the block.

106
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,880
Listen, either I can go around you, or
I can go through you. Whichever you decide.

107
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,520
Fine.

108
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,600
Shit!

109
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,440
- You cannot go in there.
- You're sayin' I can't go in my own house?

110
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,920
No, I'm telling you, you cannot go in there
without giving me a big

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,280
Southern welcome.

112
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,720
That's it. A little sugar on it.

113
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,160
If you want a second helping, let me know.

114
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
- Cos I got two knees!
- No, I'm good. God bless ya.

115
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,040
- Cos I got to go.
- Yeah. Thanks for the corn bread.

116
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,920
Jesus, let me just make it to the bathroom
before I lose my bowels all over myself.

117
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Jesus.

118
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Will I make it?

119
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,040
Have mercy, Lord.

120
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,800
Those stewed prunes!

121
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,720
They just goin' right straight through me.

122
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,120
I done seen a lot of scary shit in my day,

123
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,720
but damn - that was a lotta ass.

124
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,240
I think I need a splint or somethin'.

125
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,560
Just... I'll be all right.

126
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
"Dr Green. Wilshire Pediatrics."

127
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Here we go.

128
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,600
God.

129
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,480
Miss it. Miss it.

130
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,880
Think you can throw me off my shit?

131
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm in the zone.

132
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,720
100 dollars. Come on.

133
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,280
- That shit don't count.
- What do you mean?

134
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,800
- You were in my grill.
- 100 bucks, man.

135
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,560
Who could be callin' her at this time of night?

136
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,200
Trussy! How ya do...

137
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,400
Oh, Lord. William's in the hospital again?

138
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,200
I'll be there. I'm prepared.
I can stay a week or two weeks...

139
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,960
She's leavin', man. Now's our chance
to tap the phones. Come on.

140
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,080
- Driver, please get me to the bus station.
- Yes, ma'am.

141
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,720
I gotta go and help my friend out
for a couple of weeks.

142
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,240
Over here.

143
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,440
Jesus!

144
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,360
Back up off me.

145
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,720
- Sorry.
- Hello. This is Hattie Mae Pierce.

146
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Go on, leave me a little message. As soon as
I get back, I'll give you a shout. God bless.

147
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,160
Big Momma? It's Sherry.

148
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,960
Surprised, huh?

149
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,080
Listen, I was taking a little vacation

150
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,560
and I was headed in your direction,

151
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,400
and I thought maybe I'd stop in and check
on you since I haven't seen you in a while.

152
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,200
But it looks like you're not home,
so I'll see you on the next trip.

153
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,480
No!

154
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,120
- We lost her.
- No! Look...

155
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,320
And, Big Momma, I just want you to know...

156
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,520
I know it’s been a long time
since we've talked, but...

157
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,720
I really do love you
and miss you very much.

158
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,280
Praise the Lord.

159
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,200
It's my baby Sherry!

160
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,040
Big Momma, you're there!

161
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,760
Hi!

162
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,200
Yes, I'm here, honey child,
lamb chop, sugar foot.

163
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,240
Hang up.

164
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,840
I know things haven't been so great
between us these past couple of years,

165
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,000
and I just want you to know

166
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,560
that your place is the only place
that's ever really felt like home for me.

167
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,280
And I can't wait to see you
and I love you very much.

168
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,240
Well, I'm...

169
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,640
I'm glad it felt like a home to you, Sherry.

170
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,640
You hurry home, then. All right?

171
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,760
And I'm gonna make sure that I lock you up

172
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,280
so you don't get away from me ever again.

173
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,120
- Bye, Big Momma.
- OK, Sherry. Bye-bye.

174
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,560
- What the hell did you just do?
- Kept us in play.

175
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,400
If Big Momma's not here, she'll leave,
and then we have no case.

176
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,400
Don't worry.

177
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
Big Momma'll be here.

178
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,880
Hello. This is Hattie Mae Pierce.

179
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,600
Hello. This is Hattie Mae Pierce.

180
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,360
Hello. This is Hattie Mae Pierce.

181
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,760
All right, Trent.
Mind your manners. No back talk.

182
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,880
And remember... Look at me.

183
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,960
And remember that our business
is our business.

184
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,040
They're here. Now here's the earpiece.

185
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,240
If anybody asks, tell them
it's your new hearing aid.

186
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,360
How do I look?

187
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,600
If I were an 85-year-old man
with cataracts and a bad hip,

188
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,640
- I'd take a run at you.
- Man, shut up.

189
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,400
Big Momma? We're here.

190
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,000
Lord!

191
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,360
- Look what the wind done blew my...
- Hi.

192
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,960
Damn, you fine...

193
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,240
Sherry, you changed.

194
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,440
Me? Look at you, Big Momma!
I hardly recognize you.

195
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,440
Child, that's only make-up.

196
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,160
Now come on over here
and give your Big Momma a great big hug.

197
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
It's so good to see you, Big Momma.

198
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,360
- I thought you'd forgotten all about me.
- Hush your mouth, child.

199
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,280
- Big Momma could never forget that ass.
- What?!

200
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
Ma. Asthma.

201
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,720
Remember you had asthma?

202
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,000
I remember it like it was yesterday.

203
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
You used to puff and wheeze
somethin' wicked.

204
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,440
I said "Sherry, are you all right?"
You said...

205
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh, damn. Big Momma gettin' light-headed.

206
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,000
Wait a second.
Maybe we should take you upstairs.

207
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,000
Bless your little asthmatic heart.

208
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,320
- Who's he?
- Oh, Big Momma. That's Trent, my son.

209
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,720
You haven't seen him since he was a baby.

210
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,960
Oh, yeah. Trent!

211
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,080
Hi, Trent.

212
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,120
- Say hi.
- I should've known just by lookin' at him.

213
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,800
Look at that nappy little grapefruit head.

214
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,640
You know, it runs in the family.
Grapefruit heads.

215
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Your granddaddy had a big-ass head.

216
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,840
The hotel out by the freeway had a pool.

217
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,800
- Sweetheart...
- He's a quick little one, isn't he?

218
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,720
- Yeah.
- They grow up so fast,

219
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,400
what with the color television an' all.

220
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,960
But he'll come to find Big Momma
pretty quick herself.

221
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,920
- I'm starving.
- Are y'all hungry?

222
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,040
- Actually, we are pretty hungry.
- Come on in. I'm here to take care of y'all.

223
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,320
Come on, Sherry. Come on in.

224
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,440
- Sherry, let me get this bag for you.
- Oh, no, Big Momma. I got it.

225
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,920
You can take mine.

226
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,920
You are somethin'. Isn't he?

227
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,080
You're gonna love Big Momma's cooking.

228
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,080
Think it's gonna be windy today.
There's a draught.

229
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,960
There we go.

230
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,880
See, Sherry, I like to make sure

231
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,960
that my food is properly lubricated.

232
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,640
It goes down easier that way.

233
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,760
Oh, my God. He's gonna kill her.
This guy can't even make toast.

234
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,960
Let's see what's in there to cook now.

235
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
We got some pork chops,

236
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,680
turkey necks...

237
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,800
Child, you like these?

238
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,600
One for me...

239
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,960
Well, I'm probably not gonna eat them,
but you can have mine. All right, Sherry?

240
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,080
Now, Sherry,

241
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,960
sit back, watch and learn.

242
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,760
Malcolm, I don't know how to tell you this...
but your face is falling off!

243
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,760
Big Momma? Are you OK?

244
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,080
- Where's that pot?
- I'm gonna go and start setting the table.

245
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,880
Yeah, you do that, Sherry. Where's that pot?

246
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
Malcolm!

247
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,880
What are you doin' over there?

248
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,600
- What are you doin'?
- Take it easy!

249
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Big Momma,
I think you just had a Peeping Tom.

250
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,560
That's all right, child.
I get them all the time.

251
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,120
You do your housework in the nude
and it tends to attract the wrong element.

252
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,000
Nothin' like a little excitement
to get the blood goin'.

253
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,200
While I fix dinner,

254
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,440
tell me what brings you
to Big Momma's house after all these years.

255
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,240
Well, we were just on a little vacation.

256
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,680
Middle of the night seems
a funny time to go on vacation.

257
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,960
I thought you might have been in trouble.

258
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,040
- How did you know we left at night?
- I didn't.

259
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,880
No, no.

260
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,840
- Big Momma, are you OK?
- Oh, yeah.

261
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,360
Ain't nothin' but some scaldin' pork grease.

262
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,000
- Here. Let's dry you off.
- So what about it, child?

263
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,280
You in trouble? Is there something
you wanna tell Big Momma?

264
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,440
Big Momma, is that duct tape on your face?

265
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,840
Oh, dear! The duct tape.

266
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,840
I guess you're wonderin'
why I got the duct tape.

267
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,360
- It's a beauty secret.
- Really?

268
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,400
Yes. You never used duct tape
to get rid of them unsightly hairs?

269
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,160
- No.
- It works particularly well on the bikini area.

270
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,480
- Really?
- No doubt, girl.

271
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,400
The pork chops are on fire.

272
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,920
Big Momma, here!

273
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Who's ready to eat?

274
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,960
We could always run down
to Ring-A-Ding Burger.

275
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,840
Get him a Smiley Meal.

276
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,160
Oh, no, Big Momma. This...

277
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,520
This looks great.

278
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,000
Well, then, eat up. Take you a big old forkful.

279
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,200
Watch it. The plate's hot now.

280
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,560
I hope I didn’t put too much seasoning salt.

281
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,160
- Would you like me to get that for you?
- No. I got it, Sherry.

282
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,480
Who could it be at this time of night?

283
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,600
Just a second!

284
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,320
I wonder who this could be,

285
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,720
surprisin' me this time of evening.

286
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,440
I say, I wonder who could be
at my door so late at night.

287
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,640
There's my sugar.

288
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,640
You'd better put that nasty-ass tongue
back in your mouth before I rip it out.

289
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,040
Yes, ma'am. My mouth is closed.

290
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,680
But these hands is open for business.

291
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,280
Big Momma, who was it?

292
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,960
Oh, that's just a Bible salesman.

293
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,880
- Sherry, let's go back and finish supper.
- You can run, but you can't hide.

294
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,400
Oh, I'm sorry. Ben Rawley's the name.

295
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,760
- Pleased to meet you.
- Sherry.

296
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,960
- Big Momma, you didn't say you had a man.
- Child, I ain't got no man.

297
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,160
Why, she got every man in town
sniffin' round like dogs.

298
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,120
- I do?
- Do I smell some greens?

299
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,360
- Yeah, come on in. There's plenty.
- Oh, no!

300
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,080
Now, Ben, you know you can't eat no greens.

301
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,440
Greens give you gas somethin' wicked.

302
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,960
Last time I had Ben over for greens,
I had to re-wallpaper.

303
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,600
- Ben, let me show you to your car.
- Wait a minute!

304
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,520
You look different.

305
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,280
- Different?
- You know, I said the same thing.

306
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,600
That face and those eyes. You've changed.

307
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,600
- Changed?
- Yes, ma'am.

308
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,840
You're gettin' younger every day.

309
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Sherry, say good night to Mr. Rawley.

310
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,880
Good night. Nice to meet you.

311
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
Take it easy, Hattie.

312
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,480
Who the hell do you think you are?

313
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:13,160
Comin' up here, tryin' to put your
nasty-ass lips on me. I am not street booty.

314
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,800
I will not be treated like street poontang!

315
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,800
Ben, if you wanna get with me...

316
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,720
I mean... you will never
get with me! Understand?

317
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,560
And even if I was interested,
which I definitely am not,

318
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,000
you be goin' about it the wrong way.

319
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,880
- How am I supposed to go about it?
- You don't come in a woman's house

320
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,280
and lead with your shaboink-boink!

321
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,880
Women don't respond to that.

322
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,560
I should've bought you somethin'.
Like a corsage.

323
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
This ain't no damn prom.

324
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,720
Ben, you gotta bring a woman
somethin' special.

325
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,600
Somethin' that means it's from your heart.

326
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,640
Come on. You's a OG, aren't you?

327
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,480
You's a fake one,
but you's probably a OG, huh?

328
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,400
All right, well, get it together.

329
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,520
- Thanks, Hattie, baby.
- Good. Get your ass outta here.

330
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,080
Oh, and that seersucker suit?

331
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,560
Sherry made a call today. Who was it?

332
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,400
A Dr Green in Los Angeles.
A refill on the kid's allergy prescription.

333
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,920
She's done nothing to try and contact Lester.

334
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,120
Well, she will. And when she does,

335
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,800
- we'll be there to catch her.
- That's right.

336
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Superfly!

337
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,360
You know?

338
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,840
You wanna give me those,
or have you grown too attached to 'em?

339
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,880
"Prescription called in for Trent Pierce."

340
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,240
"Hafarth's Pharmacy, Cartersville, Georgia."

341
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
I know what you're up to.

342
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,040
You think you're nickel slick,
but I got your penny change.

343
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,960
What you talkin'?
I'm just takin' in a little air.

344
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,000
You can't fool an old fool.
Sadie's got it all figured out.

345
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,920
Look, you old bat, this is a federal...

346
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,960
The man ain't been here for two days
and you all over him.

347
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,800
Oh! You think me and the white...
No, I don't get down like that.

348
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,440
Are you drinkin' that corn liquor?
Are you sippin' on the yak?

349
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,360
Maybe I have. But somethin's goin' on.

350
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,480
I got my eye on you two.

351
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,880
What a day. What a damn day.

352
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,760
Big Momma, someone's here to see you.
They say it's an emergency.

353
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,080
Emergency? What kind of emergency?

354
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,000
Your...

355
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,640
Oh, that.

356
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,680
Child, when you get to be my age,
they're like yard dogs.

357
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,840
If you don't put 'em on a leash,
they'll just roam all over the neighborhood.

358
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,080
- Big Momma, you gotta come out here quick.
- What you talkin'?

359
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,280
- Big Momma, it's time.
- Time for what?

360
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,520
Ritha's gonna have her baby.

361
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,160
Oh. That's great. Thank you for stoppin' by.

362
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,920
Be sure to send me an invitation
to the baby shower.

363
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,600
Her water broke comin' back from the movie.
The baby's due any minute.

364
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,960
- And you got to deliver it.
- Excuse me?

365
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,160
- You're the midwife, aren't you?
- Midwife?

366
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
Big Momma!

367
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
- What are you doing?
- Screamin'!

368
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,080
I find that it calms the spirit.

369
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,440
Matter of fact, let's all scream.

370
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
Good. See? It works.

371
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,520
It's not like... I don’t know what I'm doin'.

372
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,040
Take it easy. I've called the paramedics.

373
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,760
Just stall, and then get out of the way
when they get there. OK?

374
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,680
All right. Excuse me, darlin'.

375
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,640
Let's close these, OK? You don't want
your business wavin' all in the air.

376
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
Oh, no! Don't!

377
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,240
- I said close 'em!
- They don't close!

378
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,640
Well, then, maybe that's how
you got this way in the first place!

379
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,200
- Get this baby out of me!
- Where is she?

380
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,720
- Just breathe, sweetie.
- Thank God you're here.

381
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,760
Listen, child. You do
what the paramedic says. OK?

382
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,680
Big Momma gonna be in the kitchen...
bakin' up a storm.

383
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,640
- Bakin'?
- Paramedic?

384
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,160
Nolan is a security guard
at the lumberyard.

385
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,720
Head security guard. I got two men
and three dogs workin' up under me.

386
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,280
How you doin'? I'm Nolan, Ritha's brother.

387
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,120
- Paramedics? Is something wrong?
- No!

388
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,000
I knew it. I told you this senile old hag
was gettin' too old to be doin' this.

389
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,880
Who are you callin' senile?
You wanna step outside?

390
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Look, I took CPR.
Can't be too much harder than that.

391
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,160
Damn! That's a baby.

392
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,920
Will you shut up, please?
Big Momma can handle this. Get outta here!

393
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,360
Big Momma's here, darlin'. Don't worry.

394
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,800
OK, now. Nolan, get your chunky ass in gear
and find me some hot water.

395
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,720
Lena, I need towels. Lots of towels.

396
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,120
- Towels.
- Now somebody get me some lard.

397
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,840
Preferably Crisco.

398
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,760
We got a baby about to slide into the world.

399
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,720
- Hold my hand, Big Momma.
- Hold her hand.

400
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,400
Hold my hand! Hold my hand!

401
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,160
OK, you're doin' good.

402
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,280
I'm doin' good.

403
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,120
What they need Crisco for?

404
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
They use Crisco for everything here.

405
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,720
I can't breathe.

406
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,280
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,240
- I saw this in a movie once.
- Stop, Big Momma!

408
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,480
- Here are the tongs.
- Is that sterilized?

409
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,320
Oh, yeah. I used WD-40
and some Easy Off on it.

410
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,560
Big Momma, we're not frying a chicken!

411
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,560
Give me this plunger.

412
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,120
Here we go.

413
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,000
- Look at the head.
- I see something.

414
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,120
- The head?
- I don't know. I'm lookin', it's lookin' back!

415
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,560
For God's sake.

416
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,320
Big Momma, what you doin' now?

417
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,720
I don't think you need those, Big Momma.

418
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,880
Hold your breath.

419
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,240
It's a girl!

420
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Oh, Lord!

421
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,640
Ritha, it look like Leroy.

422
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,680
Thank you, Big Momma.

423
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,520
Look at her.

424
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,480
She's somethin' else.

425
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,000
Gimme my baby.

426
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,840
That's a baby.

427
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,360
Good night, Big Momma.

428
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,200
Let me tell you...

429
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,920
Big Momma, you were amazing.

430
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,960
Oh, thank you, child.

431
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,680
- I wonder what they'll name him.
- I don't know.

432
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,280
If it was a boy, they could have named it,
like... Requan or Trevon.

433
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,280
- Trevon is cute.
- You think that?

434
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,400
But it's a girl. You gotta pick a girl name.

435
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Shaniqua.

436
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,920
- You don't like that?
- Come on now, Big Momma.

437
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It should be a biblical name, right?

438
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,760
- Something beautiful like that.
- That's right.

439
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,760
Big Momma, do you remember this?

440
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,480
Oh, my word!

441
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,920
Yes.

442
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,600
- Here.
- Sherry, no. No, I couldn't, Sherry.

443
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,640
Big Momma, I just wanna make sure that
if I ever have to go away for a long time

444
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,320
you have something to remember me by.

445
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,680
Well, all right.

446
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,240
And I know it's a little tarnished, but it's
gotten me through some pretty tough times.

447
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,600
Tough times? Sounds like a man's involved.

448
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,920
Somethin' like that.

449
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,040
Sherry, you know that old boyfriend
you had, who got in trouble?

450
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,800
Whatever happened to him?

451
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,920
Oh, Big Momma, that's such a long story.

452
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,400
I'd better go check on Trent.

453
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,400
- You need anything?
- I'm fine. Thank you, honey.

454
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,880
- Sit out here and catch my breath.
- OK. I understand.

455
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,640
Shit!

456
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,440
Who are you?

457
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,880
- Excuse me?
- Who are you?

458
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,440
Oh, me? I'm sorry.

459
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,920
Sometimes I just get so caught up
in my work that I forget things and...

460
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,360
I'm Malcolm. Hi. How are you?

461
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,560
Big Momma asked me to come by and fix...

462
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,560
- At 5.45 in the morning?
- No doubt.

463
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm an electrician. You know?

464
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,000
Shit!

465
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
You're not really an electrician, are you?

466
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,520
No. No, I'm the...

467
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,680
You got me. I am busted.

468
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,200
I didn't go to electrical college,
if that's what you mean.

469
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,040
But I'm a handyman.
Yeah, handyman's my thing.

470
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,840
- What are you doing?
- How you doin', man?

471
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,840
Wait a minute.

472
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,640
Trent?

473
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,680
How did you know his name?

474
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,400
Big Momma been braggin'
all over town about you.

475
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,240
- She has not.
- Yes, she has.

476
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,440
"Trent's so smart.
Trent's so cute. Trent knows karate."

477
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,320
- I know a little bit.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

478
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,360
Show me a little bit of your moves.

479
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,960
I'd love to show him.
Don't worry. I won't hurt him.

480
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,600
What the hell is he doing?

481
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,640
- Trent, baby, be careful.
- You're kinda quick.

482
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,880
Let me show you what I got.
Which way I'm comin'?

483
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,560
OK, it just got serious.

484
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
Honey, careful.

485
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,360
- Trent, honey, you cannot be that rough.
- You're only a pre-teen.

486
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,920
Why don't you come inside now
and let this man finish his work?

487
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,760
- See you later, Trent.
- Bye.

488
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,840
I used to take a little karate myself.

489
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,360
OK, I'm gonna go inside now.

490
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,280
I'll come back and check on you in a while
just to make sure you haven't killed yourself.

491
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,240
I appreciate it.

492
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,960
You blew your cover.

493
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,320
John, if you was thinkin' straight,

494
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,800
you'd realize Malcolm's our best shot
for crackin' this case.

495
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,560
Sherry ain't never gonna
tell her grandmother about Lester.

496
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,000
Hurry up, man. She's leaving.

497
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,360
I'll search the house while you're gone.

498
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,880
Sherry?

499
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,760
Where are you off to?

500
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,280
I'm dropping Trent off to play basketball.

501
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,600
And then... I'm just gonna
go into town for a little bit.

502
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,720
OK. Well, good. I'll go with you.
I need to do some shopping anyway.

503
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,600
- No!
- Trent, move over.

504
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,440
This ass here could do some serious damage.

505
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,360
Sherry, I'm not on your gearshift, am l?

506
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,360
- No, Big Momma. You're all right.
- All right.

507
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,600
Get your seat belt on.

508
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,200
Here we go on our way to the store.

509
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,120
Shit.

510
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,520
- Hattie! I've been lookin' for you.
- Well, good. Keep lookin'.

511
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,920
Big Momma, stay and talk to your friend.
I'll talk to you later. OK?

512
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,960
- Wait!
- I'll be right back.

513
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,320
Hattie, I need to do this
before I lose my nerve.

514
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,000
You run along or that ain't all you gonna lose.

515
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,320
Listen. Hattie, listen to me.

516
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,240
It was my mother's.
It's been on my dresser for 30 years.

517
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,200
Just sittin' in my little apartment doin' nothin'
when it could have been out seein' the world.

518
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,200
I just want to give you somethin',

519
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,600
just to prove to you
I know how to give my heart to a woman.

520
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,160
- There you are!
- Girl, we've been lookin' all over for you.

521
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,640
Hattie!

522
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,800
Hold on a minute. You losin' weight?

523
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
Yeah. I been workin'
with that new ab roller.

524
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,560
With the handles up here.

525
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,160
Well, sugar, it workin'. You understand me?

526
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,720
- Come on now. We gonna be late.
- Late for what?

527
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,120
Maybe you're in a dark alley.

528
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
Maybe not.

529
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,360
Maybe you're walkin' home
from a church social.

530
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,000
Maybe you're standin' on your sun porch
smokin' a pack of Virginia Slims.

531
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,280
But where's an' ever you be,

532
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,960
you got to be prepared for this.

533
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,440
That was a little fast. Let me do it again.

534
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,240
Come on, Gertrude. This is good for you.

535
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,200
Don't you think you're being
a little rough on the ladies?

536
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,720
You think a mugger'll be easy on you?

537
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,840
Somebody attack you on the street, you think
they gonna do it delicately? I don't think so.

538
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,200
Now, where were we?

539
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,200
I think you were gonna ask
for another volunteer.

540
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,520
And, personally,
I would consider it a privilege.

541
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,680
OK. Let's go with some real-life situations.

542
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,400
All right. Now, first off...

543
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,000
Go on. Stand right there.

544
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Here?

545
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,600
Let's say

546
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,640
you walkin' down the street,
struttin' your stuff,

547
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,400
and somebody scream out
to you "Hey, baby!"

548
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,520
"Back that thing up and show me
what you got." What you gonna do?

549
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,920
Well, I'd say...

550
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,880
I got a size ten,

551
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,360
and I'm about to cram it up his bony ass.

552
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,680
What if that don't work?

553
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,880
What if he decide he still wanna
get a little piece of that?

554
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
All he got to do is this.

555
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,680
You done messed up now.

556
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,280
Get him, Hattie Mae!

557
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,920
Sorry about that. I didn't think it made
much sense to defend myself delicately.

558
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,040
Most attackers seek out people
who look like they can't defend themselves.

559
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,480
- Ain't that right, Nolan?
- Yes.

560
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,520
See, you only got a second

561
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,880
to turn fear and panic into power!

562
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,520
- Power!
- That's right. You can't be scared.

563
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,520
You got to fight back.

564
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,160
There you are! I've been
looking all over for you.

565
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,640
I know I got some explainin' to do.

566
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,120
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

567
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,760
I paid way too much for this new wig
to mess it up here.

568
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,760
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- I feel free!

569
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,160
Hattie, are you done with him?

570
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,920
- Can I have a go?
- Most definitely.

571
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,160
Oh, my damn.

572
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,600
OK, ladies...

573
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,840
Big Momma, what is going on?

574
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,480
- They make these cars so low.
- Hi, Trent. Momma, you need some help?

575
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,640
No, I'm not that old, Sherry.
I don't need no help.

576
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,360
- How you doin'?
- Good.

577
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,360
How was basketball?

578
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,720
- It was all right.
- You OK? I'm gonna go start dinner.

579
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,160
And make sure you put
the fatback in the greens.

580
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,280
Hey. This yours.

581
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,240
You didn't know Big Momma
knew that move, did you?

582
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,920
That's called an assist.

583
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Trent, me and you haven't had much time
to just sit down and talk.

584
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,360
Your momma didn't happen
to talk to you about

585
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,440
where you were going to next, did she?

586
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,720
She didn't happen to say anything
about meetin' up with an old friend?

587
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,480
I don't know.

588
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,840
Trent, you know I'm your Big Momma, right?

589
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,160
You could talk to me and confide in me.
You know that, right?

590
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,760
I said I don't know. And anyway,
Momma said we shouldn't tell our business.

591
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,600
That some stuff we should
just keep to ourselves.

592
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,240
Is that right?

593
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,960
Did somethin' happen
while you were down at basketball?

594
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,840
- The older guys were mean to me.
- Say what?

595
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,280
They kicked me off the court.

596
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,160
No, see, I knew it.
Don't nobody mess with my babies.

597
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,840
Who do they think they are, kicking you
off the court? That is a public court.

598
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,000
Let me go get my nine, OK?
Oh, no. I'll keep that...

599
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,560
You know what, Trent? Let me calm down.

600
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,320
How about we take a little walk
down to the park?

601
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,960
Thank you! Get off the court, suckers.

602
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,120
Is that all you got?

603
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,640
Well, get ready to sit down,
cos you ain't gonna last long once we start.

604
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,520
Ain't that right, Trent?

605
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,720
- So, Granny thinks she got game?
- Oh, yes. I got game.

606
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,880
Got two words, too: I'm back.

607
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,400
- You're too fat to be ballin'.
- Say what?

608
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,440
You look like a damn shaved bird.

609
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,400
Look at you. Just fly your...

610
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,720
Never mind, young man.
I'm not even gonna get into it with you.

611
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,000
- Man, here's your rock.
- Didn't know I could catch that, huh?

612
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,680
Back at ya! Didn't know
it was comin'. Let's do this.

613
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,040
Come on, little man.
We gonna take you to school.

614
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,360
We own that ball.

615
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,400
Pickin' on a little man. I'm at ya.

616
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,880
Look at ya now. Runnin' your mouth.

617
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,280
What you gonna do, Grandma?

618
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,520
What the hell...?

619
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,080
Game point.

620
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,840
- Damn!
- Air Momma!

621
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
- That's game.
- Yes!

622
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,920
We won!

623
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,200
Yes! We won!

624
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,160
We won! Oh yes, baby!

625
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,360
I'm so happy! We won!

626
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,360
It smells good, Big Momma.

627
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,480
- Morning, Sherry.
- Good morning.

628
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,640
Trent wanted waffles. Have a seat.

629
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,120
- No, I'm gonna have some toast.
- OK.

630
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,360
Malcolm's been askin' about you.

631
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,280
- Really?
- Yes.

632
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,200
He was wonderin' how long
you were gonna be in town.

633
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,320
He thought you might be meetin' up
with some old friends from California.

634
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,200
I wonder what would make him think that.

635
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,200
Maybe somethin' you said?

636
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,200
Sherry, if you gonna be in town for a while,
you oughta spend some time with that boy.

637
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,760
Get to know him.

638
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,360
You really think he's gonna solve
all my problems, don't you?

639
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,160
Oh, yeah. Child, if I was 40 years younger

640
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,800
and able to walk down the street
without trippin' over my own breasts,

641
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,160
yes, I'd take him on. I'd give him a taste.

642
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,760
Oh, shoot!

643
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,920
Damn.

644
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,040
- Got a little jam on ya?
- Yeah. I just washed this, too.

645
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,360
Big Momma, do you have any soda water?

646
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,360
Yeah. Top shelf, Sherry.

647
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,520
Oh, my damn!

648
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,040
- What's wrong, Big Momma?
- Stains.

649
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,200
I hate stains because they's hard to get out,
and that's a jammy-jam stain. I know.

650
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,880
- Hey, Malcolm.
- Hey, little man. What you up to?

651
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,560
We're goin' fishin'.
Mom's gonna let me drive the boat.

652
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,560
- How you doin', Sherry?
- Here to empty out the septic tank?

653
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,120
You got jokes.

654
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,360
No. Actually, I was in the neighborhood,
so I was just stopping by.

655
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,360
Malcolm, you ever gone fishing?

656
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,080
Oh, yeah. I fish in the neighborhood
all the time. Yeah, I know a thing or two.

657
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,560
- Really?
- Yes, really.

658
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,840
I do all kind of fishing.

659
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,080
I just haven't caught anything
worth holding onto.

660
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,200
Maybe you're using the wrong bait.

661
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,360
What kind of bait should I be using?

662
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,320
Mom?

663
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,240
Can Malcolm come with us?

664
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,880
Sweetie, I'm sure Malcolm has
more important things to do today.

665
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,160
- Actually, I don't.
- Come on, Malcolm.

666
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,920
Mom doesn't know what she's doin'.

667
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,360
I could show you where all the hot spots are.

668
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,320
Sure. I don't see why not.

669
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,080
- Come on, Malcolm. I've never been fishing.
- Never?

670
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,080
Nothin' to it.

671
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,040
- Mom, did you see that fish jump?
- I did. Looked like he was smiling at us.

672
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,880
- Like he was laughing.
- Laughing at Malcolm.

673
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,880
- That's funny?
- No, I mean...

674
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,280
Look at your pole!

675
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,160
Give me the camera.

676
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,160
Hold still. Gotcha!

677
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,280
Are you OK? Do you need a hand?

678
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,120
Oh, man!

679
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,840
- There you go.
- Thank you.

680
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,560
- Put that on you. A little nippy, huh?
- Yeah.

681
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,600
You know, there's...
something about your eyes.

682
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,080
I don't know. They're really familiar.

683
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,080
I know you think you can recognize my eyes.

684
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,560
But you know what? A lot of people
have these eyes. These ain't even mine.

685
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,000
I borrowed 'em from a friend,
and I gotta have 'em back by dusk.

686
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,200
Yeah, I'll be... Plop!

687
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,000
Hold your hoe. Gotta go.

688
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,240
Then you don't have much time.

689
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,720
He loves it out here.

690
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,680
It's a great place to grow up.
You should know that.

691
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,240
Yeah, but you forget and you move on

692
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,560
and your life takes you places
that you never thought you'd go.

693
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,800
Where has your life taken you?

694
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,320
Far away from here.
And I'm not sure if I'm goin' back.

695
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,600
Really?

696
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,440
Mom! I can't catch anything.

697
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,680
Keep trying, sweetie.

698
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,320
Sherry, your last boyfriend...

699
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,560
What was he like?

700
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,720
Most people aren't who they say they are.

701
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,240
Yeah, well, you gotta
trust somebody sometime.

702
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,560
Why not start with me?

703
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,720
- Mom!
- They're too fast for you, Trent.

704
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,360
- Why don't you just take a break, OK?
- You don't have to be fast.

705
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,840
What you got there?

706
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,080
Let me help you with that, little Trent.
Let me see that.

707
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,960
Sometimes, when you wanna
catch somethin',

708
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,560
you just gotta slow down.

709
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,360
Be patient.

710
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,320
Then they might come to you.

711
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,880
Thanks, Malcolm.

712
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,520
That's what I do... catch the lightnin' bug.

713
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,240
I see you're a man of great taste.
Need anything else?

714
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,280
Laptop? Cameras? AK-47? Stereos?

715
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,440
Rolex?

716
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,400
Guess not.

717
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,800
- I'll take it.
- Great. That'll be two hundred.

718
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,280
Your girl told me a hundred.

719
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,440
I don't care what she said.
That gun'll cost you two.

720
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,760
Two hundred, or this transaction
goes real bad, real quick.

721
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,280
It just went bad, didn't it?

722
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,480
Pull it.

723
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,320
A hundred's good.

724
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,320
I can do a hundred.

725
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,480
- Thank you.
- Good night.

726
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,640
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

727
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,800
Oh, no. Sure, I can handle him.

728
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,200
Yeah. Don't you worry.
He knows exactly what he's doing.

729
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,320
Bye.

730
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,040
- What the hell are you doing?.
- Don't start.

731
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,240
No, Malcolm, I loved the little Jerry Maguire
moment with the kid. That was very touching.

732
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:22,040
It might make it a little awkward
when it's time to arrest her, but...

733
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,600
John, my attraction to her
is strictly professional.

734
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,480
- Great.
- And trust me: she's innocent.

735
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,520
And that's based on what?
Your "professional" attraction to her?

736
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,480
- Everybody freeze!
- Goddamn! You freeze!

737
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,680
Damn! Y'all cut Big Momma up
into little pieces.

738
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,640
- Oh, shit!
- Nobody's done nothin' to Big Momma.

739
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,920
FBl.

740
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,720
Looks like we'll have to arrest this guy now.

741
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,640
Shit, man, you ain't gotta do that.

742
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,760
I'm a fellow law-enforcement officer myself.
You know, maybe I can help.

743
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,760
Get up. Come on.

744
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,760
- OK, OK.
- All right.

745
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,880
Now, I've gone undercover as Big Momma.

746
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,720
As you can see.

747
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,760
That what that is?

748
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,040
Yeah.

749
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,000
Now listen, Nolan. This is top-secret.
We're after a hardened criminal.

750
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,120
What I need you to do is stake out the bank.

751
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,680
- Can you handle that?
- No problem.

752
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,000
All right. Now, what I'm saying is,
shut your mouth on this one.

753
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,040
I mean it - hush. Don't say nothin'. Nada.

754
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,280
You with me? All right.

755
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,800
If you can do that, we might
find a place for you on the force.

756
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,960
- You'd be in.
- In the Bureau?

757
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,640
Right in the Bureau.

758
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,760
Probably you'd get the F, but you won't
get the BI until some years have gone by.

759
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,600
- Right. Cos there's some work involved.
- Exactly.

760
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,240
Like the bank work. I'm all over it!

761
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,040
- Bye.
- Hot damn!

762
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,800
Trent?

763
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,080
Big Momma?

764
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,040
- You awake?
- Yes, Sherry.

765
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,040
Is everything all right?

766
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,160
Oh, yeah. I was just coming
to check you were OK with...

767
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,360
I'm sorry.

768
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,360
That scared me.

769
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,480
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

770
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,480
That's good.

771
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,480
I remember when I was a little girl
and it used to storm like this

772
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,000
and you would wrap your arms around me.

773
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,440
- You mean like this?
- Yeah.

774
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,200
And I just felt like
nothing in the world could ever hurt me.

775
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,320
Doesn't this feel so good?

776
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,400
It feels so damn good.

777
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,040
- Big Momma?
- Yes?

778
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,200
- What's that?
- What's what?

779
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,880
That.

780
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,360
It's...

781
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,720
That's just my flashlight.

782
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,600
The storm knocked out all the power and...
I had to get a big old flashlight.

783
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,600
OK.

784
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,920
- You OK?
- Yes. Just tryin' to get comfortable.

785
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,880
All right.

786
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,880
- Let's try to get some sleep.
- That's easy for you to say.

787
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,760
You know, when I called you the other day,
I didn't think you'd even wanna talk to me.

788
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,080
Why would you say that, Sherry?

789
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,600
Well, it's been a long time
since we've talked,

790
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,200
and I'm not a little girl any more.

791
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,320
And I know that you've probably heard
some things that I'm not very proud of.

792
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,320
Well... Maybe I didn't wanna
believe those things.

793
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,000
Maybe I only wanted
to believe the best about you.

794
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,560
You sure have changed, Big Momma.

795
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,120
How so?

796
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,560
Shoot, when I was a little girl,
you'd whup my butt if I even looked guilty.

797
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,920
Well, it got your hind parts
in shape, didn't it?

798
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,360
Well, you learned your lesson.

799
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,960
Yeah, I learned how to look innocent.

800
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,360
- Big Momma...
- Yes?

801
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,200
Is there another flashlight under there?

802
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,040
Hi.

803
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,040
What the hell are you doing here?

804
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,080
- Somebody may see you.
- No worries about that.

805
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,080
I got Nolan watching the perimeter.

806
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:59,080
He'd like his own gun, and he wants to know
if we can use secret code names.

807
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,200
- You better watch him.
- Oh? And who's gonna watch you?

808
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,960
- What are you talkin' about?
- You slept with her, man. She got to you.

809
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,680
- I didn't sleep with her. Big Momma did.
- OK. Thanks for the visual.

810
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,120
You know what I mean.

811
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,840
Are you puttin' on your make-up
in the dark now?

812
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,600
Big Momma?

813
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,480
- Come on, Big Momma. We're gonna be late.
- Late? Late for what?

814
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,280
Church. We're leaving in five minutes.

815
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,000
OK, maybe she got to me. But believe me,
this will not affect my work on this case.

816
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,160
That big bag she took downtown
the other day.

817
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,920
- Yeah?
- She didn't come back with that, did she?

818
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,360
Not affect your work. Fine.

819
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,760
You know, Malcolm, if you wanna
save this girl, then that's fine.

820
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,720
But you gotta get her to confess everything,

821
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,800
or else, when we catch Lester,
she's gonna go down with him.

822
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,800
"Every Time I Feel The Spirit."

823
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,680
Yes, good people,

824
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,760
we are not havin' service this morning.

825
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,320
This morning, we're havin' church!

826
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:53,480
You know, the Lord got me
to thinking the other day that

827
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,120
maybe it's time that I stopped preaching

828
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,120
and started listening!

829
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,120
And maybe one of our saints here

830
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,400
could offer us a word from above.

831
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,280
All right!

832
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,480
Earlier this week, I went to my phone

833
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,480
and the Lord took my dialing finger.

834
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,920
- And after about three rings...
- Three rings!

835
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,880
I heard

836
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,720
a sweet, angelic voice say...

837
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,080
Boy, you better get that thing outta my face.
Move, Rev! Go now.

838
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,040
That's right. It was Hattie Mae Pierce.

839
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,000
- Saints, we can learn a lot from this lady.
- Yes, we can.

840
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,880
For she has been to sorrow's kitchen

841
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,160
and licked the pot clean.

842
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,680
Are you ready to testify?

843
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,840
Oh, well, I guess I could say a few words.

844
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,680
Go, Big Momma!

845
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,120
You just put me on the spot today, Reverend.

846
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,680
I really wasn't expectin' this, Reverend.

847
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,640
Well, let's see.

848
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,520
- You know what to say.
- Come on with it.

849
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,520
Let's see.

850
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,400
Well, I asked him. I said "Lord,

851
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,840
should I talk about the evils

852
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,160
of drugs?"

853
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,840
No, no, no!

854
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,480
Big Momma don't know
nothin' about no drugs.

855
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,160
Unless y'all talkin' about Harry Belafonte.

856
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,760
Lord knows I was addicted
to that man for about ten years.

857
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,680
So, anyway, what I'm here to say is

858
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,640
that some of us

859
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,720
Live secret lives.

860
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,200
We don't want people to know the real us.

861
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,120
We hide behind our smiles

862
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,200
and polite conversation.

863
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,040
And underneath it all,
we do a lotta nasty shit.

864
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,160
'Scuse me, Reverend.

865
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,400
So sorry about that.

866
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,840
Anyway, we've all sinned.

867
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,640
Lord knows I've sinned.

868
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,680
I've lusted in my heart.

869
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,280
In my living room.

870
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,720
In the hot tub at the Red Roof Inn.

871
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh, and in the back of an EI Camino!

872
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,280
Watch out there, now.

873
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:45,520
But that's neither here nor there.
OK, please, disregard that last one.

874
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,360
Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that

875
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,200
our secrets...

876
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,520
they eat away at us.

877
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:01,160
So, if we want to be protected - hear me now -

878
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,360
we got to confess everything.

879
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,600
Because the truth

880
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,760
shall set you free.

881
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,040
And when that day happens,

882
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,560
- won't it be a happy day?
- That's your song.

883
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,480
Hallelujah!

884
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,360
- OK, we're home.
- My bladder got me just runnin'.

885
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,200
Maybe I should come in for a little nightcap.

886
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,200
Consider your night capped.

887
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,480
- You hear somethin'?
- What?

888
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,680
Freeze!

889
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,240
Surprise!

890
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,200
Surprise.

891
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,480
Surprise, Big Momma.

892
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,480
I don't think Big Momma
likes surprise parties.

893
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,480
Let's eat.

894
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,240
Big Momma, where did you get that from?

895
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,800
Come on, why don't you give it to me?
Give it up before you hurt somebody, OK?

896
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,160
- I'm about to go secure the perimeter.
- Nolan!

897
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,000
- John...
- This is all we need. Him screwing this up.

898
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:56,120
- Why'd you let all these people in here?
- It's a surprise party. I didn't know about it.

899
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,920
Keep your eyes open.
I'm goin' upstairs to change for the party.

900
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,600
Good idea.

901
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,680
Hi, Ben. How you doin'?

902
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,840
I guess you're wonderin'
what I got you for your birthday.

903
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,400
Don't tell me
your momma had more jewellery.

904
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,160
If you don't want it, you don't have to...

905
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,760
What is that boy up to now, Big Momma?

906
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,760
You stay down here
and watch the food. I'll go up.

907
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,720
All right.

908
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,120
Trent? What are you lookin' for?

909
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,720
Nothing.

910
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,920
Why don't you go downstairs
and help your momma with the food?

911
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,280
Yes, ma'am.

912
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,960
Damn.

913
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,560
Big Momma?

914
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,880
Yes?

915
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,840
Where'd you put the sweet corn?
Is it outside in the freezer?

916
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,400
Sherry, is there anything
you wanna say to Big Momma?

917
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,920
No, Big Momma. Why do you ask?

918
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,880
Oh, really?

919
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,400
Then I guess this chain isn't the only thing
that came back to me tarnished.

920
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,640
- I found the money, Sherry.
- What money?

921
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,800
Oh, my God. It's Lester.

922
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,720
Big Momma, I'm so sorry,

923
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,000
but I gotta go. I gotta get outta here.

924
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,080
Sherry!

925
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,680
Hey, officer. I'm lookin' for...
Miss Hattie Mae Pierce's house.

926
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,960
- You know where she live?
- Big Momma?

927
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,360
- Yeah.
- You less than two miles away.

928
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,600
She gonna die when she sees me.

929
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,520
Sherry... Now you gonna have to
tell me what's goin' on.

930
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,480
- Everything, Sherry.
- I can't.

931
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,920
I'm beggin' you to trust me. I mean...
you can trust your Big Momma, can't you?

932
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,840
- Now, who's this Lester?
- I thought I was in love with him.

933
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,920
He stole my keys. He got into the vault.
He shot two people.

934
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,640
He must have hid the money in Trent's
locker before they arrested him.

935
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,760
Are you saying you didn't know
anything about the money?

936
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,920
What about that big bag
you had the other day, Sherry?

937
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,520
What about the phone call
you made in town?

938
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,960
Happy birthday.

939
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,120
And the phone call was
to set up your surprise party.

940
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,560
You're tellin' the truth. You didn't have
anything to do with the robbery.

941
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,280
Of course I did.
I knew that the keys were missing,

942
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:52,320
and I didn't say anything to anybody
because I was afraid I'd lose my job.

943
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:56,400
Is that it? That's the big mistake
you made, Sherry?

944
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,400
Big Momma, I should have said something.

945
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,280
I know what kind of man Lester is.

946
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,280
Oh, Sherry!

947
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,560
Big Momma, what are you doing?

948
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,800
Oh, excuse me, child.

949
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,480
Sometimes Big Momma just feel like
kissin' folks, that's all.

950
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,480
Well, could you warn me next time?

951
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,440
Yeah, sure.

952
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,440
Sherry, listen to me.

953
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,360
You're not to blame.

954
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:30,120
Lester stole the keys. Lester stole the money.

955
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,360
And Lester shot those people.

956
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,840
Big Momma, I should have known
I could trust you. Thank you so much.

957
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,800
Everything's gonna be OK. All right?

958
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:48,560
I'm gonna call Malcolm.
He'll help us fix everything. No worries.

959
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,680
No worries. I'll fix it.

960
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,680
Yes, ma'am!

961
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,920
I've been waitin' on this moment
ever since I first laid eyes on you.

962
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,720
Can't get enough of your love, baby.

963
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,480
Hattie, I'm tired of bein' alone.

964
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,640
Ben, whatever you started in that bed,

965
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,840
trust me, you gonna finish alone.

966
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,440
Oh, Hattie baby...

967
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,160
Ben, I swear, if I see your shaboinker,
all hell's gonna break loose.

968
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,760
Holy shit.

969
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:44,240
Good Lord! What in the hell
is goin' on up in there?

970
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,680
- Hey, Big Momma.
- Hi, Trent.

971
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,760
What in the hell is goin' on over there?

972
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,880
Hey. You're back so soon!

973
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,520
What do you mean, "so soon"?

974
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,560
And what the hell's wrong with this door?

975
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,680
How about I hop in there
and we go for a spin?

976
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,120
Big Momma?

977
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,480
- There you are.
- Everyone's lookin' for you.

978
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,160
- What are you doing?
- I'm just freshenin' up.

979
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,320
- Come on! Time to cut your cake.
- Everybody's waitin' on you.

980
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:30,400
Driver, if I give you $20, would you
step outside and kick his ass for me?

981
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,320
- Yes, ma'am.
- No. Sir, you do not have to kick my ass.

982
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,160
Wait a minute. Just wait.

983
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,960
Look. OK, if you really must know,

984
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,760
it's a surprise party for you,
and if you go in there now you'll ruin it.

985
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,920
Well, if that’s my party,
looks like I'm missin' it.

986
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,480
Christ.

987
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:11,560
It's so loud in here. Maybe you'd be
more comfortable over at my house.

988
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,240
- We've been lookin' all over for you.
- It's time to cut your birthday cake.

989
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,680
All of this for my birthday?

990
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,960
Everybody's all dressed up and looking good.

991
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,880
I wanna freshen up
and get out of my traveling clothes.

992
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,480
No, don't worry about that. You look fine.

993
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,400
Listen, I got some dress-up clothes, too.
I wanna put mine on.

994
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,800
Now where's that cake?

995
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,840
- Damn!
- That was fast!

996
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,280
What the hell are you doing, Nolan?

997
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,600
Y'all sure went through
a lotta trouble for Big Momma.

998
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,800
You know, that's rare these days.

999
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,400
So much else to do
that you forget about people.

1000
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,760
- Big Momma is here.
- What you talking about?

1001
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,600
- She's back. The real Big Momma is back.
- Damn!

1002
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,960
- You want me to take her out?
- No.

1003
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,000
Just keep her away from Malcolm until
we figure out a way to sneak her out of here.

1004
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,080
OK. You got it.

1005
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,120
You know, Big Momma
a whole lotta woman. I may need help.

1006
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,120
You two? in my bed?

1007
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,440
Hell, no!

1008
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,440
Hattie Mae, I can explain.

1009
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,400
Explain it to the fat end of my baseball bat.

1010
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,480
Trent? Sweetie?

1011
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,120
"Scratch, scratch, scratch,
went the clawing at my door."

1012
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,840
"'Who's there?' I said,
hoping it was only my imagination."

1013
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,560
Mom, look. It's ghost stories.

1014
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:02,320
Where's my Sherry?
Where's my baby Sherry?

1015
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,880
- In my house, in my bed...
- Malcolm, I've been lookin' all over for you.

1016
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,840
- You'll never believe who's here.
- Who's here?

1017
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:17,640
Plenty of fun people. Let's dance over
and meet some, shall we? Come on.

1018
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,160
Sherry?

1019
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,800
Big Momma, work it out!

1020
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,800
He don't know what to do with it.

1021
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,200
Shit.

1022
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,440
Can I at least say goodbye
to my grandmother?

1023
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,800
Yeah.

1024
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,680
Big Momma?

1025
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,280
Sherry, is that you?

1026
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,560
What a beautiful surprise.

1027
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:21,000
Yeah, Big Momma. I just wanted to come
and say goodbye, cos we have to leave now.

1028
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,240
But I just got...

1029
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:27,160
I don't want you to leave.
Please, don't leave.

1030
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:32,320
No, Big Momma, we have to go now. And I
just wanted to say thank you for everything.

1031
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,640
You said goodbye. Now let's go.

1032
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,640
- Freeze, sucker!
- Nolan? What the hell are you doing?

1033
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,320
Put that thing down.

1034
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,600
You freeze... sucker.

1035
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,640
- Don't shoot me.
- Lester, no.

1036
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,520
Oh, shit.

1037
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,160
Oh, Jesus!

1038
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,720
I forgot my keys.

1039
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,440
Big... Big Momma?

1040
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,400
- Are y'all Double mint twins?
- Freeze! FBl.

1041
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,240
Not in Big Momma's house!

1042
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,240
Oh, shit!

1043
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,000
I can't feel my knees. Oh, Big Momma!

1044
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,320
- Hit me, you fat piece of junk?
- Lester, no!

1045
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,240
Don't you hit her.

1046
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,440
Don't turn over on me! Oh, Lord!

1047
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,240
Oh, man.

1048
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,720
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1049
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,840
- You were all over that shit.
- Yeah. I was somethin', huh?

1050
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,800
Easy.

1051
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,400
But I gotta tell you... This gettin' shot part,
it's not as much fun as you'd think.

1052
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,760
Malcolm.

1053
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,000
Trent.

1054
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,240
Watch out!

1055
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,400
Yes. Well, somebody
better tell me somethin',

1056
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:50,760
cos this sho' is some freaky shit.

1057
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,680
Yes, and I'll bust in your head again
if I catch you foolin' around with my kin.

1058
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,680
Blood is thicker than water.

1059
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,600
Is that morphine in there?
God, it beats the hell out of aspirin.

1060
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,040
Sherry.

1061
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,600
Go inside, sweetie. OK?

1062
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,320
How's he doin'?

1063
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,160
He's fine.

1064
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,400
Good.

1065
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,920
You thought I was guilty
the whole time, didn't you?

1066
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,840
You went to all this trouble
to try to catch me in a lie

1067
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,400
and you were the one being dishonest.

1068
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,640
I was just doin' my job.

1069
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,320
So the lake and everything,
that was just you doin' your job, right?

1070
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,840
No.

1071
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,080
"You gotta trust somebody sometime.
Why not start with me?"

1072
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,960
I find that hard to believe, Malcolm.

1073
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,040
How do you feel, Malcolm?
Nervous about your testimony?

1074
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,360
Nervous? No.

1075
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,320
No, I'm cool.

1076
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,520
This won't be the first time I've testified.

1077
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,280
This one ain't gettin' away.

1078
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,000
Let's hope. This is your basic
hostile jury. Good luck.

1079
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,000
Yeah. All right.

1080
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,200
Yes, brothers and sisters.

1081
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,000
Reverend, I've come to testify.

1082
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,920
- What's he doin' here?
- This is God's house,

1083
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,400
where all of his children are welcome.

1084
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,480
Yeah, maybe all exceptin' him.

1085
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,840
- This better be good, son.
- Yeah.

1086
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,960
Now wobble-wobble, and drop it like it's hot.

1087
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,160
I've come here today to

1088
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,520
ask for understanding.

1089
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,800
I believe the Good Book says
"lf you don't know me, don’t judge me."

1090
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,600
- That was Tupac.
- Definitely Tupac.

1091
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,520
Tupac. All right.

1092
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,640
Well, Trent, what does it say?

1093
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:37,440
Mom says Jesus said we should
love one another as we love ourselves.

1094
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,000
No, Trent. That's an old lyric from AI Green.
I got it in the car.

1095
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,960
Jesus did say that.

1096
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,760
- Amen!
- Yes, he did.

1097
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,640
Anyway... Trent, do you remember
that day at the lake

1098
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,280
when I told you that
if you wanted something bad enough

1099
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,040
you gotta be patient
and it might come to you?

1100
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,680
Well, I think that only works with fireflies.

1101
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,800
But if it's someone important,
you gotta put yourself into it.

1102
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,200
You have to go get it.

1103
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,160
Sherry, the make-up...

1104
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,640
You know, the whole...

1105
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:14,000
And the protrudeness...

1106
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,680
Excuse me.

1107
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,680
Look, that was fake.

1108
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,040
But what I feel about you...

1109
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,280
That's real.

1110
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:30,040
You know, Reverend,
I think the Lord is trying to give us

1111
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,240
some true words through this brother here.

1112
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,680
Well, may the angels speed
your path on up here, Big Momma.

1113
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,760
Sherry, why are you still sittin' there?

1114
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,760
Girl, come on up here and get your man.

1115
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:06,160
This morning we're having church!
