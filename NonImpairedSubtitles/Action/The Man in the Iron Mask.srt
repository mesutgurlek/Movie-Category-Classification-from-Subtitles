1
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,446
[Aramis]
Some of this is legend,

2
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:22,125
but at least
this much is fact -

3
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:26,602
when rioting citizens of France
destroyed the Bastille,

4
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:30,809
they discovered in its records
this mysterious entry...

5
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,482
You dead yet?

6
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:18,996
[Man] Aramis!

7
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:23,161
Aramis!

8
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,917
Porthos is...

9
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:30,600
[Porthos] I'm sorry, my dears.
You would have enjoyed it.

10
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,278
He's hung like a donkey.

11
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,082
- So are you!
- Really?

12
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:39,601
He's been asleep so long,
I'd forgotten.

13
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:41,914
OK, go on now.

14
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:43,915
Leave His Holiness alone.

15
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:47,155
I'll bring you back tomorrow,
when he's in a better mood.

16
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:50,600
Go on, ladies. Go!

17
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:58,440
Stop praying
and revel with me, Aramis!

18
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,401
I need my spirits lifted.

19
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:03,157
I'm old, I'm weak,
my strength is gone.

20
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:04,677
Porthos!

21
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:08,154
- I'm praying.
- I just said that.

22
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:11,634
Are you deaf, too?
I know you're blind,

23
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:15,080
because if you'd seen those tits
you'd have tears in your eyes.

24
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:17,598
There's more to life

25
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:19,197
than a good pair of tits.

26
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,683
Really?

27
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:25,561
If you can name me one thing,

28
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:27,282
one single thing,

29
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,832
that is more sublime

30
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:32,836
than the feel of a plump pink
nipple between my lips,

31
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,802
I'll build you a new cathedral.

32
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,116
Forgiveness.

33
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:41,195
Forgiveness?

34
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,923
[Porthos farts]

35
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:48,675
Forgive me...

36
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,240
Forgive me...

37
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:54,077
Am I forgiven?

38
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,764
Hm? Am I forgiven?

39
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:04,754
Your forgiveness isn't sweeter
than a plump nipple.

40
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,721
Don't you understand?

41
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,113
I'm trying to pray!

42
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:11,195
You're always praying!

43
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:17,920
[Aramis] D'Artagnan!

44
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:21,679
Oh! D'Artagnan!

45
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:23,436
How are you, young pup?

46
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:25,435
You interrupted
a theological discussion.

47
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,719
- So I see.
- Welcome. Sit down.

48
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:30,876
No, I come upon
the King's business.

49
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:33,319
He wishes to see you.

50
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,076
You serve him loyally,

51
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:39,362
even though people throw
rotten eggs at his emblem.

52
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,036
D'Artagnan, look at you!

53
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:45,037
You look so young
and I feel so old.

54
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,920
The King says immediately.

55
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:56,235
One for all, d'Artagnan.

56
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:00,361
And all for one.

57
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:07,082
We were all Musketeers once.

58
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,153
I wonder how Athos is doing.

59
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:16,240
Relax, Raoul.

60
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:18,235
After all, you're my son.

61
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,918
How could any woman resist you?

62
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:22,676
When will you ask her?

63
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:25,403
Today, as we arrive...

64
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:27,759
or when we leave.

65
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,914
When I think about it,
I get confused.

66
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,154
Will this help?

67
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:36,803
Mother's ring.

68
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:38,795
I can't take this. It's yours.

69
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:41,557
She died giving you to me.

70
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:46,274
I want to die knowing it's worn
by the woman my son loves.

71
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:48,514
Go! Bring back your fiancée.

72
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:21,384
Your Majesty, the attack
will come at dawn.

73
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,697
No, no. Do not
underestimate the Dutch.

74
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,777
These troops will be
cut off here,

75
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,300
so shift them here and here.

76
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,297
Then we outnumber them there.

77
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:35,865
Send that.

78
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,061
Your Majesty!

79
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,420
The yellow sash.

80
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:41,179
As your advisors,
we feel that it's...

81
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,736
- ..our duty...
- Yes, our duty to inform you

82
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:47,215
that there are riots in Paris.

83
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,183
Riots?

84
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:52,178
Paris is the most beautiful
city in the world.

85
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:55,144
Why should my people
feel anything

86
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,659
but pride and contentment?

87
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,145
Of course, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:00,376
I'm sure they are
content and proud.

89
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,502
But they are also starving.

90
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:07,262
If we distributed some of the
food reserved for the army...

91
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:10,383
[Man] The priest Aramis!

92
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,378
Father Aramis, His Majesty
is experiencing difficulty

93
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:27,902
- with the Jesuits.
- The Jesuits?

94
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:31,376
They have declared
His Majesty's wars unjust.

95
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,378
His Majesty should speak
to their leader.

96
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,899
But who is he?

97
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:38,625
No one can keep secrets
like the Jesuits.

98
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:40,264
Ah, Aramis!

99
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,541
Your Majesty.

100
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:52,856
You are a priest,
but once you were a Musketeer.

101
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,618
Like my father,

102
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,618
I have trusted you
with the gravest of missions.

103
00:07:58,746 --> 00:07:59,701
So...

104
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:05,662
I want you to find the
secret leader of the Jesuits.

105
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,737
And when you have,

106
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,737
for God and for France,

107
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:11,384
I wish you to kill him.

108
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,460
I know this is
a terrible thing I ask,

109
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:20,936
especially from a priest.

110
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:23,381
Can you accept this mission

111
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,855
and keep it private?

112
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:33,177
When I discover the identity
of this Jesuit rebel,

113
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:38,698
I will kill both him
and the man who told me.

114
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:42,540
Once a Musketeer,
always a Musketeer, hmm?

115
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,737
[The King] About these riots...

116
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,340
We have stocks
on the wharves now.

117
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:51,859
Distribute that.

118
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:54,062
But that food is spoiling.

119
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:56,706
That's why it wasn't
sent to the army.

120
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,663
Then you must hurry.

121
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,977
What an excellent idea,
Your Majesty.

122
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,375
Look at that stitching!

123
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,138
Don't they look glorious?

124
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:08,296
Not so glorious as you.

125
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,897
Who is that?

126
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,580
Raoul, the son of Athos.

127
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:22,576
François, you may like
young soldiers,

128
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:25,622
but I'm referring
to the beauty with him.

129
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,935
Her name is Christine.

130
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:39,136
[Fanfare]

131
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,263
Your Majesty?

132
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,856
What now, d'Artagnan?

133
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:19,060
Assassins falling from the sky?

134
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,863
I was not told
of the pig chase.

135
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:24,139
Look at these men's faces.

136
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,613
Howthey admire you.

137
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:28,183
With you protecting me,

138
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,017
what fool would try to harm me?

139
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,698
A fool's blade can be
sharper than his brain.

140
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:35,695
Let us play a game.

141
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,298
Let's pretend that I am king

142
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,340
and you are captain
of my Musketeers.

143
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,255
Pretend my wish is law,

144
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:45,461
and my wish is
to enjoy this party.

145
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,899
As should you.

146
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,576
[King Louis] Ladies!

147
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:03,058
Christine...
ever since I arrived...

148
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:05,135
- Monsieur? Mademoiselle?
- No, thank you.

149
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:07,895
- Christine...
- Raoul!

150
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,781
D'Artagnan!

151
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,424
Captain, may I present
Christine Bellefort.

152
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:15,023
Enchanté.

153
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:17,698
D'Artagnan
is my father's best friend.

154
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,581
I am honoured

155
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:22,542
you granted my request
to join the Musketeers.

156
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,262
The honour is mine.

157
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:26,141
One for all...

158
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:28,215
And all for one.

159
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,022
Christine...

160
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:35,941
I love you.

161
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:38,822
And I love you, Raoul.

162
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:42,214
I'll never be rich,
but you have my heart.

163
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:44,454
Then I am richer than the King.

164
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,456
I have something to give you...

165
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:51,735
[Shrill squealing]

166
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:57,534
[Louis] We offer a contest
of cunning and agility.

167
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:59,740
Behold our unicorn!

168
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,413
Whoever captures our unicorn,

169
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,540
shall win its treasure.

170
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:13,936
Now, to the chase!
I command you all!

171
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:19,532
The pendant will be yours!

172
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,734
Christine, isn't it?
I'd have thought it impossible,

173
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:29,897
but the excitement of the chase
has made you more beautiful.

174
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:32,498
Sire, l...thank you.

175
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,256
You blush.

176
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:36,380
You do not wish to look
beautiful for your king?

177
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:40,742
No, sire! I mean...yes...
Of course, sire!

178
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:43,179
- I mean, you are...
- It's all right.

179
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,824
You're not used
to these surroundings.

180
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:49,817
That is a condition
we can happily remedy.

181
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:57,456
You would fit nicely
as a lady-in-waiting.

182
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:02,572
His Majesty is...
very...very kind.

183
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:07,782
But I am engaged to Raoul -
or will be when he asks me.

184
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:09,741
You would choose a soldier

185
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:12,133
who has not yet proposed

186
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:13,657
above a king?

187
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:16,736
I can only be faithful
to my heart.

188
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:19,896
But how faithful
is that heart to you?

[Pig grunts]

Your Majesty?

198
00:17:14,937 --> 00:17:18,213
I understand you saved
my son's life today.

199
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:21,812
God smiled upon us,
Your Majesty.

200
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:24,047
And you are not hurt?

201
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:27,573
- No, my lady.
- That is good.

202

Captain?

203
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,888
Raoul, son of Athos,

204
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:46,413
has withdrawn his request
to join the Musketeers.

You have improved.

00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:04,621
It's been so long!

210
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:06,421
So it has, my friend.

211
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,141
What's the occasion?

212
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,612
As you say, it's been too long.

213
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:15,173
The great d'Artagnan
must have the best wine.

214
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:17,731
If the great Athos offers,

215
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:20,291
then the great d'Artagnan
must drink.

216
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:24,661
I'm sorry I haven't been
to see you lately, my friend.

217
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:28,133
Head of the King's bodyguards?
Must keep you busy.

Especially with this king.

Still, I should
have come more often.

220
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:35,092
Oh, I belong to the past,

221
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,572
when grown men wore the uniform.

222
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,858
At least it gives you time

223
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:43,379
- to practise your violin.
- And feel sorry for myself.

224

My son is grown.
He proposed to a wonderful girl.

225
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:50,177
The errors of my life
are made right in him.

226
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,300
Now, for the life
I've always wished him,

227
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,659
- he's leaving home.
- Athos, l...

00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:07,300
What's wrong?

00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:10,375
I cannot make her a widow,

233
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,375
just as I've made her a wife.

234

I've been recalled
to my regiment.

But that makes no sense!

236
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,935
You've already served
at the front.

237
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,979
Has there been some disaster?

238
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:29,981
Has everyone else
been recalled?

239
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:33,817
I believe the King's eye
has fallen on Christine.

240
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:37,657
True, he noticed her,
but it has nothing to do...

241
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,621
The King is a dog!

242
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:42,295
- Athos!
- And a coward!

243
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:45,181
But I am neither. And so I go.

Does the King have trouble
finding women?

I served his father.

248

Until I retired, I served him.

249
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,460
And now, to seduce a woman

250
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:03,535
who'll mean nothing to him
once he's had her,

251
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:06,057
he would put
my son's life in danger?

to the King personally.

I still have faith

he may become the king
we wish him to be.

259

You don't know what
it's like to have a son.

260
00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:34,861
To have kissed his hair,
watched him grow.

261

Yes, fatherhood is a blessing
I can only imagine.

I have never known
a finer man than you,

264
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:52,533
but if the King harms my son
merely to take a lover,

265
00:20:52,623 --> 00:20:54,932
then this king becomes my enemy!

266
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:58,732
As will any man who stands
between him and me!

267
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,893
Then I must hurry,

268
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,894
for I treasure your son...

00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,219

to distribute is rotten.

You're right, it is rotten.

You have my word.

288
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:03,330
And you will release those men,

289

until she has known
the love of a king.

I'm hungry.

295

I'll have some food brought.

296
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:06,935
I like to eat alone.

By the way,
you're leaving tomorrow.

are meant for my security,

not for you
to startle me to death.

300

It's for your security
that I've come.

301
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:41,328
I know about the rioting.

Rotten food?

00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,734
I'll deal with that decisively.

306
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:57,729
There is another matter

307
00:24:57,816 --> 00:25:00,808
of a more personal nature,
Your Majesty...

308
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,774
You are surrounded
by beautiful women.

309
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:05,733
Do you love any of them?

310

Quite frequently, actually.

311
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:10,011
M-hm. And they love you?

312
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:13,645
How do you know, when a woman
is intimate with you,

313
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:16,853
that it is you
and not the crown she loves?

314
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:19,006
You think my affairs are empty?

315
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,848
I think it is possible

316
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,212
for one man to love
one woman all his life

317
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:26,412
and be the better for it.

318
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:28,566
You may be right.

319
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:33,093
Perhaps I haven't met a woman
with a heart like my own

until recently.

321
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:39,332
Would that be Christine?

322
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:43,409
D'Artagnan, I fear
you watch me too closely.

323
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:46,886
Did you send Raoul to war
so that you could pursue her?

324
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,728
Do you question my honour?

325
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:52,206
No, I do not
question your honour.

326
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:54,446
It is you I care about.

327
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:57,334
Raoul will return soon.

328
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:00,214
You have my word.

00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:14,413
I am a young king...

332
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:17,606
but I am King.

333
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:20,927
Then be a good king,
Your Majesty.

334
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,530
You are the new chief advisor.

335
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:35,050
Execute him for
distributing rotten food.

336
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:41,169
And the next time
there are rioters, shoot them.

337
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:58,179
Please take this
to the royal despatchers.

338
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:10,295
Christi-i-i-ine...

339
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:29,294
I'll get you water
in a moment, Mother.

340
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:41,854
'His Majesty regrets
to inform you

341
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:44,058
'that Raoul, son of Athos,

342
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:46,576
'has been killed in action.'

343
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:42,850
Sir, a casualty report came.

344
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:47,893
Does Athos know of this?

345
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:59,213
Athos, my friend...

346
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:01,657
Stop, you traitor!

347
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:13,698
Athos, listen to me!

348
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:15,693
The cannons killed Raoul!

349
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:19,218
Do not add your own death
to this tragedy.

350
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:20,781
I beg you!

351
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:31,500
Get back! Get back!

352
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,573
YOU'RE the traitor.

353
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:01,178
See to the wounded.

354
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:18,995
Does your new
apartment suit you?

355
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:25,360
Sire, when you sent for me
after the news of Raoul,

356
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,912
I came to ask for your help.

357
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:29,915
I have no way to feed my family.

358
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:31,915
My father is dead, my mother...

359
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,995
..has a sickness of the lungs.

360
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:37,440
And your sister has
signs of the condition.

361
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:40,402
My physician saw them both
and is optimistic.

362
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:43,396
They will recover
at my country estate.

363
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:45,156
Your Majesty...

364
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,838
I know that for you, this day...

365
00:30:47,924 --> 00:30:50,279
the earth has
spun round many times.

366
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:52,958
You must still feel it spinning.

367
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:57,674
Let us sit at a quiet dinner
and bring it to a pause.

368
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,156
Listen to me!

369
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:14,159
You've lost someone
dear to your heart.

370
00:31:14,244 --> 00:31:19,557
And I have no desire for you
to turn that heart to stone.

371
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:23,395
I only ask you this:

372
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,918
that whatever you feel tonight,

373
00:31:26,004 --> 00:31:29,963
you allow yourself
to share it openly with me.

374
00:31:47,724 --> 00:31:49,635
To good health.

375
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:21,600
You are so beautiful.

376
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:33,996
I cannot do this.

377
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:01,195
Christine...

378
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:06,796
I hope you know there is
more of me to love than a crown.

379
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:33,592
Of all the wonders I have seen,

380
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:40,197
I have never seen any
as beautiful as you.

381
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:56,298
[Porthos] Aramis!
ls this the way to hell?

382
00:33:56,386 --> 00:34:01,016
Hell may be our destination,
but not this trip.

383
00:34:14,146 --> 00:34:16,102
[Porthos] A tomb!

384
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:18,495
We're in a tomb?

385
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:36,215
The secrecy is regrettable,
but necessary.

386
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:38,217
[Aramis] Please, sit.

387
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:51,340
When we were young and saw
injustice, we fought it.

388
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:54,099
Some problems cannot
be solved with a sword.

389
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:56,495
Some can't be settled
without one!

390
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:58,656
Here is the problem at hand.

391
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:01,897
The Jesuits oppose Louis' wars

392
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,864
and the starvation that results.

393
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:08,256
So, Louis has ordered me

394
00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:11,941
to discover the identity
of the Jesuits' general.

395
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,937
And to kill him.

396
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:19,935
Let the secret general
worry about that!

397
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:21,982
The problem is...

398
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,545
..that I am he.

399
00:35:27,986 --> 00:35:31,820
I am the General
of the Order of Jesuits.

400
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,624
What do you propose to do?

401
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,458
Replace the King.

402
00:35:42,546 --> 00:35:45,219
- I cannot listen to this.
- It can't be done.

403
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:47,701
It can!

404
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:49,822
I am with you.

405
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,060
So am l.

406
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:54,141
No!

407
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,904
I need you.

408
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:58,022
All for one and one for all.

409
00:35:58,106 --> 00:36:01,735
I cannot betray my king!
I swore an oath!

410
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,580
When a king is dishonourable,
you are removed from your oath.

411
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,215
An oath is an oath
because it cannot be removed!

412
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:10,864
Why do you follow him?

413
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:12,299
Why?

414
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:17,062
What we fought for is greater
than king or rank or reward.

415
00:36:17,146 --> 00:36:18,704
What do you fight for?

416
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:23,302
For the belief that every man
can be better, even Louis.

417
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:27,495
Whatever the plan,
I am with you.

418
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:33,342
The next time we meet,
one of us will die.

419
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,061
Athos, wait!

420
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:39,420
D'Artagnan!

421
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:42,504
Even were I not a priest,

422
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:46,499
I could see that your heart
carries a secret weight

423
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:49,737
and that it is hurting you
to bear it alone.

424
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:55,423
I cannot betray my king.

425
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,016
I will defend him with my life.

426
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:02,859
Then God be with you.

427
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:05,858
For none of us will.

428
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:05,747
I hear there was an incident
at the Musketeers' gate,

429
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:09,745
where a man came
intent on killing me.

430
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:11,982
Is it our policy now

431
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,632
to let would-be assassins
go free, d'Artagnan?

432
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:17,670
He wished to kill his own pain.

433
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:20,585
His son is dead.

434
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,391
I can think of nothing worse.

435
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:28,387
- What about losing your king?
- That depends on the king.

436
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:32,463
When I became a Musketeer,

437
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:35,066
I was told,
each time I drew my sword,

438
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:38,110
I should consider
not what I killed,

439
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,626
but what I allowed to live.

440
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:42,987
You know who told me that?

441
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,142
Athos.

442
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:48,469
If he has become our enemy,

443
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,271
we should ask ourselves why.

444
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,308
Athos is gone.

445
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:56,543
Porthos and Aramis
are missing, too.

446
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:59,544
You know them
better than anyone.

447
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:02,544
Are they a threat to me?

448
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:07,262
If they are a threat,
we need not seek them out.

449
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,468
They will find us.

450
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:18,140
Not if you find them first.

451
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:41,887
Who is that?

452
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,202
Chi è?

453
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:46,809
È malato.

454
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:49,806
Lo rimpiazzo io.

455
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:52,249
[Guard]
He says he's a replacement.

456
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:53,653
Parla francese?

457
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,645
Non lo parlo.

458
00:40:55,734 --> 00:41:00,285
Il prigioniero
ha solo un giorno al mese

459
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,207
per la confessione.

460
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,253
He says the prisoners
gets Confession once a month.

461
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,211
The usual priest is sick.

462
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:19,523
Vai, vai! Avanti!

463
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:28,849
Grazie.

464
00:41:28,934 --> 00:41:30,765
Grazie tanto, signore.

465
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,685
Grazie. Grazie.

466
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:37,332
It is my Confession day.

467
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:48,683
I'm sorry. You've never
seen me before.

468
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,048
I must shock you.

469
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:55,213
I am a friend.

470
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:58,206
I am here to help you.

471
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,566
What are you doing?

472
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:07,805
It is your escape to freedom.

473
00:42:15,174 --> 00:42:16,687
Who is this?

474
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:19,607
He is you.

475
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:27,688
Signore, scusi, scusi!

476
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:29,730
Signore!

477
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,453
Ehi, ehi! Signore, scusi!

478
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:37,846
Cosa c'è?

479
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:42,246
È caduto stecchito
mentre leggevo la messa.

480
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,894
He says he fell stone dead

481
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:47,886
as he was reading him the Mass.

482
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:51,967
[Guard]
How could he just keel over?

483
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:55,524
Ha la peste.
Come I'altro prete.

484
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:59,368
He says the prisoner
had a fever, like the priest.

485
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:02,332
Plague? They brought
plague in here?

486
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,326
Get him out! Get him out now!

487
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:08,053
No last rites! Get away!

488
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:17,163
We could chisel it off
and see who it was.

489
00:43:18,694 --> 00:43:20,650
No one will ever know.

490
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:22,292
Bruciatelo!

491
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:25,286
O la peste ci colpirà tutti!

492
00:43:25,374 --> 00:43:28,571
He says burn it
or we will all get plague.

493
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:30,292
He's right!

494
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,047
Dio! Dio, Dio...

495
00:43:34,414 --> 00:43:37,326
Don't touch me!

496
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,132
Get out!

497
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:44,367
Stay back! He has plague.

498
00:43:44,454 --> 00:43:46,365
Hurry up!

499
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:48,251
Via!

500
00:43:51,654 --> 00:43:54,214
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

501
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,649
Go away! Hurry!

502
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:40,331
My God!

503
00:44:49,694 --> 00:44:52,652
[Horses' hooves]

00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:09,213
Whoah!

505
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,006
[Aramis] Jesuits. They're mine.

[He collapses]

509
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:32,960
Here...

510
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:36,922
Drink.

511
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:43,729
It's all right.

512
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:55,126
I have waited six years

513
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:57,850
to ask this question...

514
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,400
Why was this done to me?

515
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:05,163
You don't know?

516
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:09,281
What do you remember?

517
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:12,044
I lived in a country house.

518
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:14,042
I had guardians.

519
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:17,043
An old woman and a priest.

520
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:19,042
But no friends.

521
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:22,567
They took me to the prison.

522
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:25,768
- Who?
- A man in black.

523
00:48:25,851 --> 00:48:28,319
I never saw his face...

524
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:32,645
but he took me to the prison

525
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:36,485
and he put me into the mask.

526
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:38,368
And you don't know why?

527
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:41,887
For days I shouted,
"What have I done?"

528
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:47,529
Then I realised there was
something about my face

529
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:49,010
which had to be hidden.

530
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:51,969
But I never knew what.

531
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:54,121
What is your name?

532
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:58,329
The old woman called me...

533
00:48:58,411 --> 00:49:00,402
Phillippe.

534
00:49:00,531 --> 00:49:02,647
Phillippe...

535
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:08,883
These men will clean you.
They won't harm you.

536
00:49:12,651 --> 00:49:13,845
Thank you.

537
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:19,320
Thank you for your kindness.

538
00:49:28,124 --> 00:49:28,684
Why are you so glum?

539
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:30,515
Why are you so glum?

540
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:32,322
I expected action.

541
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:35,316
There was no killing,
no fighting.

542
00:49:35,404 --> 00:49:37,076
I was useless.

543
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:42,158
Porthos, I grow tired
of this attitude.

544
00:49:43,204 --> 00:49:48,324
You are surrounded by beauty,
by intrigue, by danger.

545
00:49:48,404 --> 00:49:51,316
What more can a man want?

546
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,872
Look around you.

547
00:49:55,804 --> 00:49:58,443
The robins are singing,
the pigeons cooing...

548
00:49:59,644 --> 00:50:01,236
Can't you listen to their song?

549
00:50:03,364 --> 00:50:04,513
Oh...!

550
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:16,796
There's food here, but Louis
sends it all to the army.

551
00:50:16,884 --> 00:50:18,795
I have no appetite.

552
00:50:18,884 --> 00:50:20,476
I'm wasting away.

553
00:50:20,564 --> 00:50:23,476
Even women don't
interest me any more.

554
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:25,998
Say goodbye to Porthos.

555
00:50:26,084 --> 00:50:28,552
He is gone.

556
00:50:36,764 --> 00:50:38,755
Who is he?

557
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:42,763
Seek the truth, not facts.

558
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:44,755
You are not my priest!

559
00:50:44,844 --> 00:50:47,153
And wouldn't be
even if I had one!

560
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,962
That's bitter.

and d'Artagnan,

562

who you held as a brother
and now you hate.

563
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:01,397
What right have you to judge me?

564
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:04,203
Are you holier
than everyone else?

565
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:08,721
Yes, and I'm more intelligent
than anybody else.

[Porthos yells in pain]

Porthos, what is it?

568
00:51:15,484 --> 00:51:17,202
Kidney stones.

569

It hurts when I piss.

It hurts when I shit.

571
00:51:21,324 --> 00:51:25,442
I'm just a fat old fart
with nothing to live for.

572
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:27,401
I'm going to hang myself

573
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,395
as soon as I'm sober.

574
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:30,883
Come on!

Aramis! He is ready!

576
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:03,266
The greatest mystery of life...

577
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:05,943
is who we truly are.

578
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:08,020
Yes.

579
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:13,948
I will tell you the secret
that was kept from you.

580
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:18,580
[Aramis] It began the night
King Louis was born.

581
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,625
D'Artagnan, Athos
and I were dining.

582
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:22,222
D'Artagnan was drunk -

583
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,743
the only time
I've seen him like that.

584
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:26,865
[Aramis] I was on duty.

585
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:30,180
I was summoned to the
rear door of the palace.

586
00:52:30,269 --> 00:52:34,148
The Queen's priest
handed me a baby.

587
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:36,982
Do you understand this, Athos?

588
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:39,537
The Queen had given
birth to twins.

589
00:52:39,629 --> 00:52:43,986
The child I carried
was the younger of the two.

590
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:45,627
[Baby cries]

591

[Man] Another!

592

[Echo] It's another.

593
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:53,579
[Two babies cry]

594
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:55,864
The King realised
he had two heirs.

595
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:59,225
He'd seen brothers
tear apart enough kingdoms

596
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:03,188
that he decided to make one
disappear. You, Phillippe!

597
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:06,898
He ordered your identity
kept from you.

598
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:09,423
On his deathbed,
he revealed the truth to Louis

599
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:11,101
and your mother.

600
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:14,022
She had been told
you died at birth.

601
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:17,863
She blamed herself
for believing it.

602
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:21,464
She wished to restore
your birthright.

603
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:23,460
But now, Louis was King.

604
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:25,540
He was afraid to kill you,

605
00:53:25,629 --> 00:53:27,938
for his claim to power

606
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:30,862
rested on the sanctity
of royal blood.

607
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,860
So he devised a way

608
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:35,383
to keep you forever hidden.

609
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:41,102
For my country, for my king...

610
00:53:41,189 --> 00:53:45,979
I bought peace with your life

611
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:48,025
and with my soul.

612
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:54,464
One day...l will
ask your forgiveness.

613
00:53:56,709 --> 00:54:01,066
But not until I have
restored you to what is yours.

614
00:54:01,149 --> 00:54:02,582
Restored?

615
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:05,024
We will replace Louis
with Phillippe.

616
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,986
That is your plan?

617
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:09,503
Exchanging one for the other?

618
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:10,863
It's ludicrous!

619
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:13,861
It's brilliant. What did
you think we were up to?

620
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,099
Revolution, open war!

621
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:17,508
Blood in the streets.

622
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:19,307
At least it's a change.

623
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:22,779
Physical resemblance is a start,
but Louis' arrogance...

624
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:24,541
[Aramis] ..can be adopted!

625
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,540
[Athos] And people close to him?

626
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,779
I have considered everything.

627
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:33,306
Have you considered
you not only risk our lives,

628
00:54:33,389 --> 00:54:35,061
you risk Phillippe's as well?

629
00:54:35,149 --> 00:54:38,300
And like us, he has a choice.

630
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:42,344
What about it, Phillippe?

631
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:47,184
All those years in prison,
were they for nothing?

632
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:52,138
Or have they given you strength
unlike ordinary men?

633
00:54:52,229 --> 00:54:55,141
You have the chance to be king,

634
00:54:55,229 --> 00:54:58,665
if you have the heart
to take that chance,

635
00:54:58,749 --> 00:55:01,900
you have the heart.

636
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:03,058
Do you?

637
00:55:03,229 --> 00:55:06,221
I...l...

638
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,465
Do you?

639
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,429
Your Majesty!

640
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,422
A box has arrived

641
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,980
whose contents
are for your eyes only.

642
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,461
Take this to my mother.

643
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,021
[Weeping] My son!

644
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,539
My son!

645
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,786
Please...forgive me.

646
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,226
I can never make it right.

647
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,343
My Lady...

648
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,344
D'Artagnan...

649
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,782
No... No...

650
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,502
If anyone sees...

651
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,785
it is death.

652
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:57,180
If I don't kiss you,
I'll die anyway.

653
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,547
I cannot bear to see you cry.

654
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,942
Please...

655
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,340
Tell me what's wrong.

656
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,104
Anna!

657
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:30,461
I know that to love you
is treason against France.

658
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,463
But not to love you
is treason against my heart.

659
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,667
Then we will both
die traitors, d'Artagnan.

660
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:49,069
[Aramis] More wine!

661
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:50,877
More wine.

662
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,468
How is he?

663
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,679
Exhausted. He's had a long day.

664
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:01,954
- Aramis...
- More wine!

665
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,951
Consider this plan.
Phillippe is like a child.

666
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:07,473
- He cannot be ready...
- You can do it!

667
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:08,708
- No!
- Yes!

668
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,711
- In a year maybe...
- Three weeks!

669
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,471
Three weeks?!

670
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:17,347
The King is having
a masquerade ball.

671
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:20,078
A swirl of people,
their faces covered.

672
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,117
It's a perfect opportunity.
We must act!

673
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:25,997
Phillippe could be
discovered at any time.

674
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,876
More wine! Where is everybody?

675
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,953
[Porthos] No! It's no use.

676
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,394
My sword is bent.

677
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:36,878
It'll be all right.

678
00:59:36,959 --> 00:59:40,872
You're just taking
a while to get started.

679
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:44,269
- I'll make your sword straight.
- No, it's dead.

680
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:47,237
It's dead! I am useless!

681
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:48,718
Useless...

682
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:54,831
Three weeks to learn
all he must know?

683
00:59:54,919 --> 00:59:57,956
For 1 6 years, he was
educated as a gentleman.

684
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:01,588
And for six more,
he lived in that mask!

685
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,592
Now he knows that those
who should have loved him

686
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,115
threw him into
loneliness and pain.

687
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,350
You're fond of him. That's good.

688
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:15,397
Don't play God with me, Aramis!

689
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,470
Nothing can replace Raoul!

690
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:24,592
What is Porthos doing?

691
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:29,116
Walking into the barn naked,
or so it seems.

692
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,155
[Athos] What is he doing?

693
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:33,707
Going to hang himself.

694
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:35,907
Hang himself?!

695
01:00:37,439 --> 01:00:39,350
Oh, mon Dieu!

696
01:00:39,439 --> 01:00:42,112
A sign from God...

697
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:44,269
Oh, my God!

698
01:00:50,759 --> 01:00:55,355
If Porthos is determined
to end his life,

699
01:00:55,439 --> 01:00:57,350
he'll find the opportunity.

700
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,468
Goodbye, cruel world.

701
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,154
Farewell to useless Porthos.

702
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:18,551
- What was that?
- I sawed the beam.

703
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:25,753
I'm a genius,
not an engineer.

704
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:36,709
ARAMIS! You did this!

705
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,871
You knew I'd hang myself
and you sawed the beam!

706
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:42,427
- Admit it!
- Of course I knew.

707
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,510
You've been moping around
for months.

708
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:49,070
Now you can stop boring
everyone and be useful!

709
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,111
- Well...all right.
- Put some clothes on!

710
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:21,384
I've worn this mask so long,

711
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:23,906
I don't feel safe without it.

712
01:02:23,992 --> 01:02:25,948
I will sit with you.

713
01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:28,023
I can't sleep either.

714
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,946
I've been in prison
for six years.

715
01:04:12,032 --> 01:04:14,307
You have freed me.

716
01:04:16,712 --> 01:04:20,671
Now you ask me
to enter another prison.

717
01:04:20,752 --> 01:04:23,425
A palace is hardly a prison.

718
01:04:25,512 --> 01:04:28,549
Do you see
those farm maids?

719
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:31,544
See the one holding the lamb?

720
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:34,465
I would tend lambs with her
the rest of my life.

721
01:04:34,552 --> 01:04:38,591
We're offering you
a chance to be king.

722
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:43,382
No, you offer me a chance
to pretend to be king!

723
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:47,863
A king you hate!

724
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:49,704
Not everyone hates him.

725
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:51,783
Don't you?

726
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:56,423
Why should I become him?

727
01:04:56,512 --> 01:05:01,142
Until you give me
a reason, I won't.

728
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:03,302
I cannot.

729
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:07,021
We're all God's instruments,
like it or not.

730
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:09,182
All we can do is keep faith.

731
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,309
Though I sometimes
find that hard.

732
01:05:12,392 --> 01:05:14,826
We all fail at faith, Aramis.

733
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:19,861
That's why we must eat,
drink, and make love to life.

734
01:05:19,952 --> 01:05:23,422
As king, you can have
a thousand ploughmaids.

735
01:05:23,512 --> 01:05:25,468
Porthos! You miss the point!

736
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:27,031
What point?

737
01:05:27,112 --> 01:05:28,989
Phillippe is right.

738
01:05:29,072 --> 01:05:31,222
We haven't given him a reason

739
01:05:31,312 --> 01:05:33,587
to do what we ask.

740
01:05:33,672 --> 01:05:35,628
I understand
your reason, Athos.

741
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:37,543
You do?

742
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:39,941
Porthos told me about your son.

743
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,746
You think that's why I'm here?

744
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:52,464
Yes, Raoul is my reason,
but not the way you think.

745
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:55,112
Once, all of us believed

746
01:05:55,192 --> 01:05:58,662
in serving something
greater than ourselves.

747
01:05:58,752 --> 01:06:00,629
Aramis had his faith.

748
01:06:00,712 --> 01:06:03,624
Porthos, his lust for life.

749
01:06:03,712 --> 01:06:05,589
D'Artagnan, his devotion.

750
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:07,390
And I had Raoul.

751
01:06:07,472 --> 01:06:10,384
But we all had a common dream -

752
01:06:10,472 --> 01:06:13,908
that one day we would
be able to serve a king

753
01:06:13,992 --> 01:06:16,460
worthy of the throne.

754
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:19,510
It is what we dreamt,

755
01:06:19,592 --> 01:06:22,345
what we bled for,

756
01:06:22,432 --> 01:06:25,981
and what we have waited
a lifetime for.

757
01:06:26,072 --> 01:06:30,463
I taught Raoul
to believe in that dream.

758
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:33,112
And now my son is dead.

759
01:06:35,312 --> 01:06:40,750
So I am here to find out
if his life was in vain.

760
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:45,986
And the only one who can
answer that question is you.

761
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:03,026
Athos...

762
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:05,580
if we fail in this attempt -

763
01:07:05,672 --> 01:07:08,869
and we probably will -

764
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:12,388
I am honoured to die beside you.

765
01:07:16,672 --> 01:07:17,991
And you.

766
01:08:27,207 --> 01:08:29,675
This arrived for you.

767
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:37,077
[Raoul's voice]
'My darling Christine,

768
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,601
'in parting from you

769
01:08:39,687 --> 01:08:42,599
'l have left heaven for hell.

770
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:46,600
'l go because I can love you
only in honour.

771
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:51,602
'You've created in me
the need to be a better man.

772
01:08:51,687 --> 01:08:54,599
'l will love

773
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:58,236
'to love you

774
01:08:58,327 --> 01:09:01,922
'Remember that
and give yourself no blame.

775
01:09:02,007 --> 01:09:05,158
'Yours forever, Raoul.'

776
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,236
What's wrong?

777
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:38,523
What's the matter?

778
01:09:47,087 --> 01:09:48,918
What's wrong?

779
01:09:49,007 --> 01:09:52,204
I received a letter
from Raoul.

780
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:55,484
He sent it to the palace,

781
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:58,001
knowing that he would die

782
01:09:58,087 --> 01:10:00,476
and that I would be here.

783
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:04,603
How would he know that?

784
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:12,645
I...l can't guess
what he was thinking.

785
01:10:12,727 --> 01:10:14,683
He was irrational.

786
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:18,726
I ordered him placed
far from the fighting...

787
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:24,756
but he plunged in
against my wishes.

788
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:29,284
He forgives me for all
that he knew I would do.

789
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,835
But how can I forgive myself?

790
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,326
Forgive?

791
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:36,364
I loved him , Louis.

792
01:10:36,447 --> 01:10:39,166
I love him still.

793
01:10:46,087 --> 01:10:47,566
Still...

794
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:51,401
And in pretending to love you,
I do something awful.

795
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:56,398
You pretend?!

796
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:02,879
I have sinned
against love and God

797
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,719
for the sake of your mercy,

798
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:08,243
which you would not
have given without my sin.

799
01:11:08,327 --> 01:11:12,366
I will burn in hell
and so will you.

800
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:14,404
No. No, no.

801
01:11:15,527 --> 01:11:17,199
No, my love.

802
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,717
You will burn in hell,

803
01:11:20,807 --> 01:11:23,241
but I will not,

804
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:27,764
for I am King, ordained by God.

805
01:11:40,048 --> 01:11:40,648
[Horses hooves]

806
01:11:40,648 --> 01:11:41,967
[Horses hooves]

807
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:46,279
[Aramis]
Come on! We have to get started.

808
01:11:47,648 --> 01:11:49,286
- Get my bag.
- Where do you go?

809
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:52,280
Paris. I'll be gone a few days.

810
01:11:52,368 --> 01:11:55,121
Make sure everything
is ready when I return.

811
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:58,359
You want me to do
the impossible alone?

812
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:02,885
This is the perfect solution -
a revolution without bloodshed.

813
01:12:02,968 --> 01:12:05,846
Or treason -
for he is a king's son.

814
01:12:05,928 --> 01:12:08,362
I can't get him ready in time!

815
01:12:08,448 --> 01:12:10,803
The urgency is not my choice.

816
01:12:10,888 --> 01:12:13,243
Instead of distributing food,

817
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:15,478
Louis has ordered
the rioters shot.

818
01:12:15,568 --> 01:12:17,479
Imagine what will happen

819
01:12:17,568 --> 01:12:21,038
when the starving people
hear about this ball.

820
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,801
This is not for me, Athos.

821
01:12:23,888 --> 01:12:26,482
It's for everything
we once were...

822
01:12:26,568 --> 01:12:28,524
and might be again.

823
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:48,286
Thank you, Father.

824
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,643
The ball is now tomorrow night.

825
01:12:50,728 --> 01:12:53,686
Louis is unhappy
with his mistress

826
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:56,043
and needs revelry.

827
01:12:56,128 --> 01:12:58,517
My tailors must work all night!

828
01:12:58,608 --> 01:12:59,882
Saddle my horse!

829
01:13:09,808 --> 01:13:12,242
The brothel is closed
for the night.

830
01:13:12,328 --> 01:13:15,320
Everyone out,
except the ladies. OUT!

831
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:17,717
Closed? We came here...

832
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:19,958
Go somewhere else.

833
01:13:20,048 --> 01:13:21,640
Out! Out!

834
01:13:21,728 --> 01:13:24,561
You must finish
the clothes you were making.

835
01:13:24,648 --> 01:13:27,082
We'll go, and take
your money with us!

836
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:29,204
Come on, old man!

837
01:13:29,288 --> 01:13:34,078
Old? You try to rob me
because you think me old?

838
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:35,323
Oh...!

839
01:13:43,888 --> 01:13:48,518
See if you can rob someone
with your pistol up there!

840
01:13:48,608 --> 01:13:50,121
Out! Everybody out!

841
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,278
Out! Get out!

842
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:56,327
Porthos,
I finished this for you.

843
01:13:56,408 --> 01:13:59,206
I love Paris! I love life!

844
01:13:59,288 --> 01:14:01,927
And I love you, ladies!

845
01:14:02,008 --> 01:14:04,761
Now get busy - except for you!

846
01:14:04,848 --> 01:14:06,281
Come!

847
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:09,847
No, wait.

848
01:14:09,928 --> 01:14:11,839
With a king, it is so.

849
01:14:11,928 --> 01:14:14,567
Servants have
touched the goblet,

850
01:14:14,648 --> 01:14:17,242
so the king touches
as little as possible.

851
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:18,283
Again...

852
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:24,521
I'm sorry.

853
01:14:24,608 --> 01:14:26,997
No, do not be sorry!

854
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:30,364
There are no mistakes
when you are king.

855
01:14:30,448 --> 01:14:32,325
You never apologise.

856
01:14:32,408 --> 01:14:35,127
The king cares for
nothing and for no one.

857
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:38,166
Is that the king
you wish me to be?

858
01:14:38,248 --> 01:14:42,719
Or do you say this
because your son is dead?

859
01:14:48,888 --> 01:14:51,322
Forgive me. I did not mean...

860
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:54,559
I am not angry with you.
Do you understand?

861
01:14:56,688 --> 01:15:01,045
Good. Of course we wish you
to be a good king,

862
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:05,041
but first you must pass as
Louis, who is cold and cruel.

863
01:15:05,128 --> 01:15:08,564
His eyes say he cares
only for himself.

864
01:15:08,648 --> 01:15:11,208
Your eyes ask too much.

865
01:15:11,488 --> 01:15:14,525
You shouldn't care about me.

866
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,597
You shouldn't care about...

867
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:22,287
You mustn't ask about my son.

868
01:15:31,168 --> 01:15:34,604
[Queen Anne] Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

869
01:15:36,568 --> 01:15:39,002
And so have l.

870
01:15:39,088 --> 01:15:40,487
Aramis!

871
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:42,804
Your Majesty.

872
01:15:42,888 --> 01:15:45,083
Do you believe

873
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:48,717
that just as one can lie
can destroy a life,

874
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:52,278
one truth can put it
together again?

875
01:15:52,368 --> 01:15:55,280
I pray every day
for such a miracle.

876
01:15:55,368 --> 01:15:58,280
I have prayed every day
for forgiveness.

877
01:15:58,368 --> 01:16:00,836
But forgiveness
must come from you

878
01:16:00,928 --> 01:16:03,283
before it can come from God.

879
01:16:03,368 --> 01:16:06,678
It was I who took
your other son from you.

880
01:16:06,768 --> 01:16:11,637
And I was never brave enough
to find the truth.

881
01:16:11,728 --> 01:16:15,038
I have raised a son
who destroys lives

882
01:16:15,128 --> 01:16:17,403
instead of saving them.

883
01:16:17,488 --> 01:16:20,958
And I have failed to save a son

884
01:16:21,048 --> 01:16:23,846
who died within an iron mask.

885
01:16:23,928 --> 01:16:27,204
No! That mask
was Louis' creation.

886
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:30,200
Now we have a chance
to make a miracle -

887
01:16:30,288 --> 01:16:33,360
to strip all masks away forever.

888
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:37,719
These rooms are yours.

889
01:16:37,808 --> 01:16:40,197
Through this corridor
and upstairs,

890
01:16:40,288 --> 01:16:42,802
or through this passage,

891
01:16:42,888 --> 01:16:45,482
are the rooms of your
mistress Christine.

892
01:16:45,568 --> 01:16:46,921
And whose rooms are these?

893
01:16:49,048 --> 01:16:50,367
Your mother's.

894
01:16:53,088 --> 01:16:55,079
My mother's...?

895
01:17:01,168 --> 01:17:03,204
Change the horses!

896
01:17:06,328 --> 01:17:09,559
Clear everything out!

897
01:17:09,648 --> 01:17:10,763
Now!

898
01:17:19,888 --> 01:17:22,800
[Aramis] Remember, Phillippe:
nobility is born in the heart.

899
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:27,803
[Porthos] Make love as if you
don't care. Fart when you wish.

900
01:17:27,888 --> 01:17:31,324
[Athos] Hold your goblet
with two fingers.

901
01:17:31,408 --> 01:17:34,923
If you get stuck,
just say "Continue."

902
01:17:35,008 --> 01:17:36,964
[Aramis] ln the morning,

903
01:17:37,048 --> 01:17:41,405
order that we be brought
to the palace as your advisors.

904
01:18:22,537 --> 01:18:24,050
D'Artagnan watches everything!

905
01:18:24,137 --> 01:18:26,571
We will need luck.

906
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:28,568
We will make our own luck!

907
01:18:28,657 --> 01:18:30,090
If Phillippe holds up.

908
01:18:30,177 --> 01:18:33,249
Relax, Phillippe!
You're doing well.

909
01:18:50,777 --> 01:18:52,415
My brother!

910
01:19:11,897 --> 01:19:13,967
What is wrong, Your Majesty?.

911
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:18,733
Nothing. Carry on.

912
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:34,448
Did you see that?

913
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,653
What, Your Majesty?

914
01:19:37,737 --> 01:19:39,932
A mask! I saw a mask!

915
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:43,453
The ballroom is full
of masks, Your Majesty.

916
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:11,766
[Music stops]

917
01:20:11,857 --> 01:20:13,495
Your Majesty?

918
01:20:15,657 --> 01:20:17,648
Carry on, everyone.

919
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:25,966
To the passageway.

920
01:20:26,097 --> 01:20:27,212
[Panicked breathing]

921
01:20:27,377 --> 01:20:30,528
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

922
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:56,155
It's Judgement Day.

923
01:21:10,807 --> 01:21:13,526
Don't look so shocked,
Phillippe.

924
01:21:13,607 --> 01:21:16,326
Phillippe?
Why do you call me Phillippe?

925
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:18,921
We have a present for you.

926
01:21:20,407 --> 01:21:21,840
No!

927
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:38,043
D'Artagnan guards the hall.

928
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:41,563
Let us go back
the way we came.

929
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:44,525
Time to go, Your Majesty.

930
01:21:58,727 --> 01:21:59,842
Good.

931
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:05,675
- You know the way.
- Hm-hm.

932
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:34,081
You have the heart of a king.

933
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:52,688
[Music stops]

934
01:22:52,688 --> 01:22:54,087
[Music stops]

935
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:48,445
Continue.

936
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:01,604
[Courtier] Your Majesty?

937
01:24:04,688 --> 01:24:06,838
Some refreshments, Your Majesty?

938
01:24:26,968 --> 01:24:29,721
[Stunned silence]

939
01:24:47,368 --> 01:24:49,518
The Queen Mother!

940
01:26:00,528 --> 01:26:02,837
God bless the King
and Queen Mother!

941
01:26:02,928 --> 01:26:05,442
God bless the King
and Queen Mother!

942
01:26:45,168 --> 01:26:47,602
I retire now.

943
01:26:47,688 --> 01:26:49,360
Wait two dances,

944
01:26:49,448 --> 01:26:51,484
then withdraw to your room

945
01:26:51,568 --> 01:26:54,446
and spend the night in safety.

946
01:26:54,528 --> 01:26:56,723
We have much to talk about.

947
01:26:56,808 --> 01:27:00,244
And the rest of
our lives to do it.

948
01:27:00,328 --> 01:27:02,717
Goodnight...

949
01:27:06,008 --> 01:27:07,487
Mother.

950
01:27:09,048 --> 01:27:10,879
Goodnight...

951
01:27:12,848 --> 01:27:14,566
my son.

952
01:27:34,808 --> 01:27:36,685
Anne...

953
01:27:37,328 --> 01:27:39,125
Tomorrow.

954
01:27:56,408 --> 01:27:59,241
How long has the King been back?

955
01:27:59,328 --> 01:28:00,807
Some while, Captain.

956
01:28:14,766 --> 01:28:16,165
[Christine] Murderer.

957
01:28:17,446 --> 01:28:19,038
Murderer!

958
01:28:20,486 --> 01:28:21,601
Christine?

959
01:28:21,686 --> 01:28:25,565
I wrote to the front
under your seal.

960
01:28:25,646 --> 01:28:30,640
I demanded to know why the
general disregarded the order

961
01:28:30,726 --> 01:28:33,320
to keep Raoul out of danger.

962
01:28:33,406 --> 01:28:35,124
He writes back:

963
01:28:35,206 --> 01:28:36,764
'But, Your Majesty!

964
01:28:36,846 --> 01:28:39,758
'Your letter ordered me
to place him

965
01:28:39,846 --> 01:28:41,837
'at the vanguard of the assault

966
01:28:41,926 --> 01:28:44,360
'in front of the cannon.'

967
01:28:44,446 --> 01:28:46,004
You killed Raoul!

968
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:49,203
You killed Raoul!
You killed Raoul!

969
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,436
Let her go! You're hurting her!

970
01:29:03,006 --> 01:29:06,476
However I have wronged you,
I will make amends.

971
01:29:24,686 --> 01:29:27,120
Take her to her room.

972
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:33,958
Deploy the Musketeers!
Guard the passages!

973
01:29:37,286 --> 01:29:38,719
Continue.

974
01:29:47,406 --> 01:29:51,285
We have an emergency
of security, Your Majesty.

975
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:54,324
I must ask you to accompany me.

976
01:29:54,406 --> 01:30:00,595
Not now. The ball...
My guests...

977
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:04,799
I insist...Your Majesty.

978
01:30:07,686 --> 01:30:09,836
Yes, certainly.

979
01:30:42,756 --> 01:30:46,669
- They've raised the alarm!
- They'll try to cut us off.

980
01:31:39,476 --> 01:31:40,909
I am Porthos!

981
01:31:42,476 --> 01:31:44,273
And I fight the King!

982
01:31:55,236 --> 01:31:57,033
Look out!

983
01:31:57,116 --> 01:31:59,550
Come on! Porthos!

984
01:32:02,156 --> 01:32:03,305
Come on!

985
01:32:05,236 --> 01:32:06,715
Everyone pump!

986
01:32:09,236 --> 01:32:12,831
Stop them before
they reach the river!

987
01:33:14,146 --> 01:33:15,943
Pull them back!

988
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:21,580
This man...is an imposter.

989
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:24,783
This is the imposter.

990
01:33:27,306 --> 01:33:28,625
Pull them back.

991
01:33:38,186 --> 01:33:40,541
Get in the boat, Your Majesty.

992
01:33:48,626 --> 01:33:50,059
Open the gate!

993
01:33:52,346 --> 01:33:54,064
Open the gate!

994
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:56,979
Open the gate.

995
01:33:58,586 --> 01:34:00,975
I'm sorry. I failed you.

996
01:34:04,466 --> 01:34:06,900
We failed you.

997
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:20,460
Stop!

998
01:34:28,386 --> 01:34:30,138
You take my king...

999
01:34:30,226 --> 01:34:32,786
I shall take yours.

1000
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:49,577
[Louis] Get him! Get him!

1001
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:52,544
Seize the imposter!

1002
01:34:53,626 --> 01:34:55,537
- Get him!
- Sire!

1003
01:34:55,626 --> 01:34:57,457
Seize him!

1004
01:35:01,226 --> 01:35:02,181
Phillippe!

1005
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:06,783
Seize him! Take him!

1006
01:35:09,786 --> 01:35:12,254
- Hold on to him!
- Athos!

1007
01:35:12,346 --> 01:35:14,257
ATHOS!

1008
01:35:47,352 --> 01:35:50,469
I was told this
imposter was dead.

1009
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,463
You knew?

1010
01:35:53,552 --> 01:35:58,307
You knew there was a man
of such resemblance?

1011
01:35:58,392 --> 01:35:59,825
He is my brother.

1012
01:35:59,912 --> 01:36:02,824
- Brother?
- My twin.

1013
01:36:02,912 --> 01:36:04,982
My blood.

1014
01:36:05,072 --> 01:36:09,190
A fact which has
kept him alive, until now.

1015
01:36:12,232 --> 01:36:13,551
Phillippe!

1016
01:36:16,112 --> 01:36:18,501
Louis! Please!

1017
01:36:18,592 --> 01:36:20,628
You were a part
of this, Mother?

1018
01:36:20,712 --> 01:36:23,180
I love you both!

1019
01:36:23,272 --> 01:36:25,228
That has meant nothing to us!

1020
01:36:25,312 --> 01:36:27,064
It has meant something to me.

1021
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:32,108
Your Majesty, listen to me.

1022
01:36:32,192 --> 01:36:35,582
Never once have I asked
anything for myself.

1023
01:36:37,272 --> 01:36:41,106
I ask you now - spare the life
of this man, your brother.

1024
01:36:41,192 --> 01:36:44,184
You have no right to ask this!

1025
01:36:51,032 --> 01:36:52,431
Your Majesty...

1026
01:36:52,512 --> 01:36:55,310
every day of your life,

1027
01:36:55,392 --> 01:36:57,303
I have watched over you.

1028
01:36:57,392 --> 01:37:00,350
I have bled for you.

1029
01:37:00,432 --> 01:37:02,343
I have prayed every day

1030
01:37:02,432 --> 01:37:07,506
to see you become
greater than your office.

1031
01:37:07,592 --> 01:37:11,267
Show me what my faith
and blood have purchased.

1032
01:37:11,352 --> 01:37:12,626
Show mercy.

1033
01:37:12,712 --> 01:37:15,670
You take the side of traitors?

1034
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:19,791
This one, worst of all -
my own brother!

1035
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:23,103
And what have you done to him?

1036
01:37:25,232 --> 01:37:27,109
For one moment...

1037
01:37:27,192 --> 01:37:29,945
I thought you had
become the king

1038
01:37:30,032 --> 01:37:32,387
I'd hoped you would be.

1039
01:37:35,792 --> 01:37:37,271
Please...

1040
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:40,310
My Lord, may I speak?

1041
01:37:40,392 --> 01:37:42,428
I beg that you kill me.

1042
01:37:42,512 --> 01:37:46,187
I release you from any sin
in taking my life.

1043
01:37:46,272 --> 01:37:51,187
In fact, I pray God
rewards you for your mercy.

1044
01:37:51,272 --> 01:37:54,230
But, please...do not...

1045
01:37:54,312 --> 01:37:56,143
I beg you...

1046
01:37:56,232 --> 01:38:00,942
return me to the prison
where I have lived for so long.

1047
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:07,105
D'Artagnan...

1048
01:38:07,192 --> 01:38:10,582
You will hunt down
Porthos, Athos and Aramis

1049
01:38:10,672 --> 01:38:13,630
and bring me their heads.

1050
01:38:13,712 --> 01:38:16,146
Or I will have yours.

1051
01:38:22,832 --> 01:38:24,311
As for you, my brother,

1052
01:38:24,392 --> 01:38:27,589
back to the prison you shall go,

1053
01:38:27,672 --> 01:38:30,630
and into the mask you hate.

1054
01:38:30,712 --> 01:38:33,624
Wear it until you love it.

1055
01:38:33,712 --> 01:38:35,907
And die in it!

1056
01:38:51,022 --> 01:38:51,977
Anne!

1057
01:38:53,502 --> 01:38:55,413
There were two?

1058
01:38:55,542 --> 01:38:57,373
Not one but two?

1059
01:38:57,462 --> 01:38:59,896
I couldn't tell you.

1060
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:01,893
You had enough to bear.

1061
01:39:01,982 --> 01:39:04,052
Anne...

1062
01:39:04,182 --> 01:39:08,460
I have loved you always,
none but you.

1063
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:11,978
No matter what happens,

1064
01:39:12,062 --> 01:39:15,213
I pray you remember that.

1065
01:39:19,342 --> 01:39:21,139
[Woman screams]

1066
01:39:26,902 --> 01:39:28,460
Christine's room.

1067
01:39:47,622 --> 01:39:49,738
Where is she?

1068
01:40:03,142 --> 01:40:05,019
Get rid of it.

1069
01:40:06,662 --> 01:40:08,573
Where are you taking me?

1070
01:40:08,662 --> 01:40:10,414
No!

1071
01:40:15,182 --> 01:40:19,141
Where are you taking me?!
Where are you taking me?!

1072
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:21,178
Please, no! No!

1073
01:40:21,262 --> 01:40:23,776
No! No! No!

1074
01:40:23,902 --> 01:40:25,893
NO!

1075
01:40:31,862 --> 01:40:32,817
No!

1076
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:33,812
No!

1077
01:40:33,902 --> 01:40:36,336
No-o-o-o-o!

1078
01:40:36,422 --> 01:40:39,175
No! No! No!

1079
01:40:54,702 --> 01:40:57,614
It has been done, Your Majesty.

1080
01:40:57,702 --> 01:41:00,296
When d'Artagnan returns,
watch him.

1081
01:41:00,382 --> 01:41:03,340
When he leaves again, tell me.

1082
01:41:04,502 --> 01:41:05,981
Your Majesty.

1083
01:41:14,012 --> 01:41:15,968
Nothing down here.

1084
01:41:16,052 --> 01:41:17,849
All right, this way.

1085
01:41:40,252 --> 01:41:44,245
[D'Artagnan's voice]
Phillippe is in the lower
dungeon of the Bastille.

1086
01:41:44,332 --> 01:41:48,644
At midnight, I will delay
the new guards for 1 0 minutes.

1087
01:41:48,732 --> 01:41:51,644
One for all and all for one,
d'Artagnan.

1088
01:41:51,732 --> 01:41:55,168
It is a trap,
but we have no choice.

1089
01:41:55,252 --> 01:41:59,165
If Phillippe is in the Bastille,
to the Bastille we will go.

1090
01:41:59,252 --> 01:42:01,641
I'd rather die covered in blood

1091
01:42:01,732 --> 01:42:04,690
than an old man
lying in my piss.

1092
01:42:21,652 --> 01:42:26,772
Our old uniforms,
from our days of glory.

1093
01:42:26,852 --> 01:42:30,162
I was saving them...

1094
01:42:30,252 --> 01:42:33,642
so that we could
wear them in death.

1095
01:42:34,172 --> 01:42:35,969
And so we shall!

1096
01:42:47,730 --> 01:42:49,482
Open up. We have a prisoner.

1097
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:00,924
Take him to level three.

1098
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:04,002
The captain will see
to the document.

1099
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,322
It worked!

1100
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:13,128
It's a prison.

1101
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:16,680
The problems come
when we want to get out.

1102
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:24,529
[Clock strikes]

1103
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:27,522
Midnight. We have 1 0 minutes.

1104
01:44:15,570 --> 01:44:17,481
Down there.

1105
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:31,809
Is this what you're looking for?

1106
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:38,363
The key!

1107
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:39,565
No!

1108
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,686
Remember this?

1109
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:44,920
[Musketeer]Don't be so sad.

1110
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:47,763
There's nothing
left of him anyway.

1111
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:50,410
He's just a snivelling,
drooling...

1112
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:53,004
I knew you'd come!

1113
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:55,206
We feared the mask
would destroy you.

1114
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,520
I wear the mask,
it does not wear me.

1115
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,953
- The courtyard is blocked.
- He lies!

1116
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,396
- He's here to trap us.
- See for yourselves.

1117
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,556
All that you have suffered,

1118
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:44,313
I would gladly
have borne myself

1119
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,073
to keep it from you.

1120
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:51,437
Go to the east gate.

1121
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,114
The courtyard
is filling with soldiers!

1122
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,156
This way!

1123
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:11,280
Go till you reach the river.

1124
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,558
- They'll know you helped us.
- That doesn't matter. Go!

1125
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,112
Fire!

1126
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,833
Get that door!

1127
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,154
The lock!

1128
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,036
We're trapped!

1129
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,829
Charge them!

1130
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,196
Spare their lives if you can.

1131
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,472
Cowards! Twenty men
run from four!

1132
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:47,030
No one has the stomach
to fight the Captain.

1133
01:48:30,342 --> 01:48:32,572
[Louis] D'Artagnan!

1134
01:48:32,662 --> 01:48:35,130
I am not angry with you.

1135
01:48:35,222 --> 01:48:38,180
I knew you'd lead me to them.

1136
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:40,776
Lay down your sword

1137
01:48:40,862 --> 01:48:43,217
and I will not punish you.

1138
01:48:43,302 --> 01:48:46,419
You can retire in peace.

1139
01:48:46,502 --> 01:48:49,380
I'll give your friends
a swift execution

1140
01:48:49,462 --> 01:48:51,453
if you surrender now.

1141
01:48:55,404 --> 01:48:57,281
You should take his offer.

1142
01:49:00,404 --> 01:49:02,395
We're dead anyway.

1143
01:49:02,484 --> 01:49:03,997
He's right, d'Artagnan.

1144
01:49:07,524 --> 01:49:08,798
[Phillippe] Wait!

1145
01:49:08,884 --> 01:49:11,478
Bargain me to Louis
for your lives.

1146
01:49:11,564 --> 01:49:13,794
You've done your best.

1147
01:49:13,884 --> 01:49:15,442
Please, let me go.

1148
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:19,563
No.

1149
01:49:23,684 --> 01:49:25,242
I cannot do it.

1150
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,555
Even if I could give up my king,

1151
01:49:33,244 --> 01:49:35,599
I could not give up...

1152
01:49:35,684 --> 01:49:37,117
my son.

1153
01:49:47,404 --> 01:49:49,759
Your son?

1154
01:49:49,844 --> 01:49:52,039
I loved your mother.

1155
01:49:52,124 --> 01:49:54,433
I love her still.

1156
01:49:56,684 --> 01:49:58,595
You are my son.

1157
01:50:03,924 --> 01:50:06,836
I never knew you existed.

1158
01:50:06,924 --> 01:50:12,362
And I never felt pride
as a father...

1159
01:50:15,364 --> 01:50:17,320
until this moment.

1160
01:50:28,164 --> 01:50:29,802
[Banging]

1161
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:41,008
D'Artagnan...

1162
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:44,479
They're young Musketeers.

1163
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:48,165
They've been weaned
on our legends.

1164
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:51,048
They revere us!

1165
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:55,726
- It is an advantage.
- Yes. Why don't we charge them?

1166
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:58,165
I trained these men.

1167
01:50:58,250 --> 01:51:01,083
They will fight to the death.

1168
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:04,368
But if we must die...

1169
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,281
if we must die,

1170
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:08,759
Iet it be like this.

1171
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:17,719
One for all...

1172
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:19,163
All for one.

1173
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,202
[Yelling]

1174
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:48,046
Shoot!

1175
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:51,206
Magnificent valour!

1176
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:54,848
Shoot them!

1177
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:57,278
Fire!

1178
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:57,881
Get off me!

1179
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:03,129
[D'Artagnan] Phillippe!

1180
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:05,605
Phillippe!

1181
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:08,329
He is...your brother.

1182
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:12,245
Brother?

1183
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:21,083
Outside, all of you!
You are sworn to silence.

1184
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:27,483
Get this off me!

1185
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:39,280
Forgive me.

1186
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,802
All my life...

1187
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:51,009
this...this is the death

1188
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:53,684
I have always wanted.

1189
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:59,086
All for one...

1190
01:54:59,170 --> 01:55:02,560
And one fo...

1191
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:05,727
[Aramis prays quietly]

1192
01:55:09,130 --> 01:55:12,122
YOU were the one in the mask.

1193
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:49,441
All MY life...

1194
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:52,681
all I ever wanted to be

1195
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:55,079
was him.

1196
01:56:03,995 --> 01:56:05,951
We recaptured the prisoner.

1197
01:56:06,035 --> 01:56:08,469
No, I am the Ki...!

1198
01:56:10,035 --> 01:56:11,787
Put this madman

1199
01:56:11,875 --> 01:56:14,628
where no one
can hear his insanity.

1200
01:56:14,715 --> 01:56:17,627
Let him be fed by a deaf mute,

1201
01:56:17,715 --> 01:56:19,433
but feed him well.

1202
01:56:19,515 --> 01:56:21,949
Let him find redemption

1203
01:56:22,035 --> 01:56:24,754
wearing the pains
he caused others.

1204
01:56:24,835 --> 01:56:26,712
Take him!

1205
01:56:26,795 --> 01:56:28,672
I am Louis! I am Louis!

1206
01:56:32,755 --> 01:56:34,711
[Governor] And the others?

1207
01:56:41,555 --> 01:56:45,025
They are my loyal council
and truest friends.

1208
01:57:25,995 --> 01:57:30,386
In nomine patris et filii
et spiritu sancti.

1209
01:57:31,555 --> 01:57:33,307
Amen.

1210
01:57:42,435 --> 01:57:44,903
He was the best of us all.

1211
01:57:58,235 --> 01:57:59,668
[Phillippe] Athos!

1212
01:58:07,195 --> 01:58:09,948
After all you have done,

1213
01:58:10,035 --> 01:58:12,788
I must ask one more service.

1214
01:58:12,875 --> 01:58:15,992
Let me love you
like a son to a father.

1215
01:58:16,075 --> 01:58:19,431
And I pray you live for this:

1216
01:58:19,515 --> 01:58:22,666
to love me like your son.

1217
01:58:41,595 --> 01:58:44,905
Musketeers, salute!

1218
01:58:49,355 --> 01:58:52,506
One for all, all for one!

1219
01:59:03,435 --> 01:59:07,394
[Aramis] The prisoner in
the iron mask was never found.

1220
01:59:07,475 --> 01:59:11,832
It was whispered that
he received a royal pardon

1221
01:59:11,915 --> 01:59:15,032
and lived quietly
in the country,

1222
01:59:15,115 --> 01:59:18,152
visited often by the Queen.

1223
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:20,669
The King known as Louis XIV,

1224
01:59:20,755 --> 01:59:25,146
brought his people food,
prosperity and peace.

1225
01:59:25,235 --> 01:59:28,147
He is remembered
as the greatest ruler

1226
01:59:28,235 --> 01:59:31,989
in the history of his nation.
