"Bulma's House in Metro West"

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,740
<i>- Have some cake too.
- Okay! </i>

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,480
<i>Good for you, Ha-chan! </i>

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,850
Yes!

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,220
You'll come stay with me?

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,720
Yes!

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Congratulations!

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,220
Thanks.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,590
Son Goku, you are really
going to leave this village?

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:39,560
Yeah, I really have to
find my grandpa's memento.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,240
It's already getting late,
so spend the night here.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,370
Thanks!

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,530
Good for you!

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,840
<i>Well, tomorrow morning you'll be
saying goodbye to Goku too, Ha-chan. </i>

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,540
Stay here tonight with him.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,490
Starting tomorrow you'll
be staying at my place.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,960
Okay.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,280
See you later.

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,220
Good night!

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,210
Nope, no good.

21
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,490
What will you do now
that the radar is broken?

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,560
I'll go to Bulma's house
and have her fix it.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,160
Bulma?

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,830
She's the one who gave me this radar.

25
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,470
Where does she live?

26
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,680
I think she said Metro West...

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,610
What direction is that from here?

28
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,320
Metro West...
that would be... let's see...

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,580
That way, maybe?

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,750
It is extremely far away!

31
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,990
How do you plan to go there?

32
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,960
Walk.

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
W-walk?!

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,030
But there's no other choice, is there?

35
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,200
There aren't any cars or
planes in this village.

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,730
Terrible...

37
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,300
I'll give you lots of lunches!

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Really?!

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,870
Good luck, Son Goku!

40
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,080
<i>Well you need to get
lots of sleep! Good night! </i>

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,310
<i>- Good night!
- Good night! </i>

42
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,260
<i>This is the first time
I have slept in a futon... </i>

43
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,660
It feels so nice.

44
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,750
Eh?!

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,660
Y-you say you're going to walk?!

46
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,390
<i>Yeah, what with
Kinto Un  broken and all...</i>

47
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,630
What?!

48
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,500
<i>A Kinto Un,  you say?!</i>

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
<i>Little boy, you rode on a Kinto Un?! </i>

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,340
<i>A kinton? (mashed sweet potato) </i>

51
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,240
Yep, I did.

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,480
<i>You know about Kinto Un,  old man?</i>

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,980
I most certainly do!

54
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,720
When I was a lad there
were quite a few of them.

55
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,950
Isn't that right?

56
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,990
Yes, there were!

57
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,720
But since only those with completely
pure hearts could ride them,

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,060
...people who could ride them
grew less and less, and we
almost never see them anymore.

59
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,000
<i>But being able to ride on a
Kinto Un  certainly is something!</i>

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,730
But it broke and died.

61
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,870
<i>Kinto Uns  don't die!</i>

62
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,640
Did you actually try calling for it?

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,950
Nope. I thought it had died, so...

64
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,440
Try calling it!

65
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,380
<i>Kinto Un! </i>

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,870
Nothing's coming.

67
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,810
That's odd...

68
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,820
You were right! Here it comes!

69
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,070
<i>Kinto Un! </i>

70
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,170
<i>Good for you, Kinto Un! </i>

71
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,170
<i>I really missed you, Kinto Un! </i>

72
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,330
Good for you!

73
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,210
Oh! He really can ride on it!

74
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,820
Okay, I'm going now!
Take care of yourselves!

75
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,490
Son Goku, thank you for everything.

76
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,160
You are my best friend.

77
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,800
Good luck!

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,330
You better not lose to
the Red Ribbon Army!

79
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,800
<i>Bye, Ha-chan!  Bye, everyone!</i>

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,070
Alright, next stop, Metro West!

81
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,610
<i>Let's go, Kinto Un! </i>

82
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,510
Goku!

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,550
West is that way.

84
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,180
Oh, okay.

85
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,590
Later!

86
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,760
<i>T-that's a kinton?

87
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,530
Amazing...

88
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,160
Goodbye!

89
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,470
Be careful!

90
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:20,700
<i>- Bye!
- Take care!

91
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,780
Look, it can fly in the sky too!

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,600
And at a tremendous speed!

<i>She lives in a place like this?! </i>

112
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,820
I'll look for her on
foot from here on out.

113
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,180
This place sure is noisy...

114
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,430
Hey kid! Watch where
you're goin'! Stupid!

115
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,960
Hey, can I ask you something?

116
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,600
Where is Bulma's house?

117
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,770
How the hell would I know?!

118

<i>- What's going on? !
- What're you doing? !</i>

What are they in such a hurry for?

121
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,190
Hey! Where is Bulma's house?

122
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,860
Eh? Bulma?

123
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,460
Yeah.

124
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,560
I have no idea. Go ask somebody else.

125
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:04,740
You live in the same
place but don't know her?

126
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,170
Oh man... I wonder if
she really lives here...

127

H-hey, wait!

128
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,410
Step on in.

129
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,850
Come on in.

130
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,380
Oh, you'll give me a lift? Thank you.

131

I'm saved! You're so
nice to drive me there!

132

Where you headed?

133
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,270
Bulma's house.

134
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,240
Where's that?

135
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,310
I don't know. I'm looking for it.

136

<i>Sir, you do  have money, don't you?</i>

137
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,650
Money? I don't got any.

138
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,320
Don't be stupid!

139
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,590
Getting into taxis
without saying a single word...

140
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,460
Idiot!

141
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,230
So here in the city you need
money to get directions to houses?

142
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,890
So what do I do to get money?

143
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,170
Huh? What is it?

144
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,140
Excuse me... Coming through...

145
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,130
Is something going on?

146
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,220
- Go for it!
- This guy's a pushover!

147

Here I come!

148
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,240
So, is there anybody else?!

<i>If you beat me I'll give you
100,000 Zeni,  so how about it?!</i>

150
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,140
Come on now!

151
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,980
What's the matter? Aren't there
any challengers out there?!

152
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,980
If you fight me and make me say I'm
beaten then you can get a ton of money!

153
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
I can get money?!

154
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,200
<i>It's like the Tenkaichi  Tournament!</i>

155

Hey, you do it.

156
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,900
Don't be stupid, that guy knows
Kenpo, I wouldn't have a chance!

157
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,110
<i>I'll  fight!</i>

158
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,980
Hold on a sec while
I take off my things.

159
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,880
Kid, you're good at jokes!

160
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,620
I'm not joking.

161
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,930
You wanna fight me?

162
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,230
<i>Yeah! I get 100,000
Zeni  if I win, right?</i>

163
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,670
Okay, whatever. Let's fight then.

164
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,210
<i>Normally you'd have to pay
the 10,000 Zeni  match fee</i>

165
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,210
but I'll make it free
just for you, kid!

166
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,180
Thanks! I'll go easy on you then.

167
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,080
Ready.

168
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,920
Then let's get this thing started.

169
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,860
Alright! Here I go!

170
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,920
Be my guest.

171
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,550
C-could you see that?

172
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,140
Not at all...

173
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,420
Are you beaten?

174
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,230
O-of course I'm not beaten!

175
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,860
Oh.

176
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,640
I-it looks like you've studied
a bit of Kenpo somewhere, kid...

177
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,780
Yeah, I trained!

178
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,080
Okay, the match starts again!

179
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,980
Okay, here I go again!

180
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,330
It would be best to hurry
and say you're beaten!

181
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,390
Little punk!

182
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,680
Watch out!

183
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,530
I- I am beaten...

184
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,470
Thanks a lot!

185
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,460
Now I got some money!

186
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,900
Who should I ask who would know?

187
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,670
Hey!

188
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,640
Take a look at that kid's hand!

189
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,910
Whoa, what a load of money!

190
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,740
Hey you, little boy!

191
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,680
Come over here!

192
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,620
Over here, over here!

193
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,860
What is it?

194
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,690
Right this way.

195
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,990
Are you going to give me something?

196
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,370
We're the ones who're
gonna get something!

197
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,980
We'll take that money now.

198
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,950
You'll tell me where Bulma's house is?

199
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,690
Stop yer yackin' and
make with the money!

200
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,550
How come? Bleh!

201
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,720
You're not going to tell
me where Bulma's house is?

202
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,250
You brat! You want me to kill ya?!

203
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,560
Punk kid!

204
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,880
L-let me see...

205
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,450
<i>Bulma-chan's  house? W-wouldn't a
police officer know if you asked one?</i>

206
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,420
A person named
"Police Officer"? Thank you!

207
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,290
N-no, you're welcome.

208
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,970
If you're looking
for a police officer,

209
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,370
that person over there is one.

210
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,880
Thank you!

211
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,580
Here you go!

212
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,610
Hey! "Police Officer"!

213
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,060
A girl by the name of Bulma? You
don't know her citizen number either?

214
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,660
Don't know what to tell you...

215
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,600
Let's see...

216
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,570
She looks like this!

217
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,910
T-that's a little...

218
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,080
You don't know?

219
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,380
Oh well, I'll check
the computer for you.

220
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,450
Normally we aren't allowed to
do this for civilians, though.

221
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,690
B-u-l-m-a...

222
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,760
That's a rare name so it
shouldn't take long to find out!

223
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,860
There are three people,
which one is it?

224
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,800
Is it this person?

225
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,270
No!

226
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,470
Then what about this one?

227
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,840
It's Bulma!

228
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,510
This is amazing!

229
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,050
This is the daughter of the
head of Capsule Corporation!

230
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,420
Hey! So where is Bulma's house?!

231
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,290
It's a little far so
I'll take you there.

232
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,720
Get on.

233
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,090
I don't have any money.

234
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,750
Stupid! You think I charge for money?!

235
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,820
<i>Sorry for repeating myself, but are you
really an acquaintance of Bulma-san? </i>

236
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,180
I told you, I am!

237
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,470
Okay, we're here.

238
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,600
This is it?! What a huge house!

239
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,180
Bulma!

240
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,720
<i>The reunion with Bulma, at last! </i>
