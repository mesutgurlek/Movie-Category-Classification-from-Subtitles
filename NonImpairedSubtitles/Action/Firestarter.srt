25.000

2
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,840
Don't push me.

3
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,120
Stick with him.
Don't let him get too far ahead.

4
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,360
- Daddy, I'm tired. Can't we stop?
- Yeah, honey.

5
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,800
There isn't any people on the side streets.
And they're darker.

6
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,240
- That's just what they'd want, honey.
- Daddy, I'm scared.

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,760
So am I, honey. Hang on.
Be light. Be a feather.

8
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,400
- What's going on?
- Excuse me!

9
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,120
"(man #1 )" He's seen us.
Whatever you do, no eye contact.

10
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,600
- He can make you do what he wants.
- "(man #2)" Got it.

11
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,640
"(man #1 )" See him?
He just got lost in that crowd there.

12
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,920
"(man #2)" That's him, over on the right.
Right there on the right.

13
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,320
<i>(man #3)</i>
Maybe I can cut him off at the corner.

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,600
Let's get him.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
Daddy, they're coming.

16
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,640
Taxi. Taxi.

17
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,000
Drive.

18
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,680
- Stop!
- Stop the car. Hey, cabbie.

19
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,320
Don't pay any attention to them.
Just drive.

20
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,280
Come on, let's get back to the car.
We can chase them down. Let's move it.

21
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,520
- Hey, mister, where are we going?
- The airport.

22
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,360
Wait, wait, I can't go to the airport.
It's too far.

23
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,440
Look...

24
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm gonna give you a $500 bill. I want you
to take my daughter and I to the airport.

25
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,360
Sure. OK, mister.

26
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,360
<i>(distorted voices)</i>

27
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,720
- "(Dad)" Drive.
- I ain't turning down no $500.

28
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,480
We are going to give each one of you ten
young ladies and gentlemen an injection.

29
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,240
Five of these injections will be water.

30
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,040
Five of them will be water mixed with
a tiny amount of a chemical compound

31
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,480
which we call... "lot six".

32
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,440
The exact nature
of this compound is classified

33
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,920
but it is essentially
a hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.

34
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,320
We employ the double-blind method
of administering the compound,

35
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,360
which is to say that neither you nor we
know who has received the clear dose

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,520
and who has not.

37
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,880
Until later, that is.

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,280
You will be under close supervision
for 48 hours after the experiment.

39
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,480
Are there any questions?

40
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,040
Dr Wanless, is this experiment
being done by The Shop?

41
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
No.

42
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,320
Absolutely not.

43
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,320
- Yes?
- When do I get my money?

44
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
- "(all)" Right on, man.
- That is important.

45
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,960
Well, immediately after the experiment,
along with all the other students.

46
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,040
I'm broke too.

47
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,960
So, if we may begin
the injections now, please.

48
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
Andy McGee.

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,400
I'm Vicky Tomlinson. I'm a little nervous
about this, Andy McGee.

50
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,280
- What if I go on a bad trip?
- We'll probably just get distilled water.

51
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,840
"(Wanless)" Feel any pain?

52
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,800
<i>(woman)</i>
I feel a pressure. It's a bad pressure.

53
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,120
"(Wanless)" It will pass.

54
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,320
- How are you feeling?
- When do we start to shrink?

55
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,400
You believe you're going to shrink?

56
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,800
Sh-ri-nk...

57
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,640
You'll be fine.

58
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,680
We'll be fine.

59
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,200
<i>(disturbed voices)</i>

60
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,240
"(woman)" I can't feel my hands.

61
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,040
- Thank you. What a nice compliment.
- I didn't say anything.

62
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,800
You did.

63
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,520
- What'd I say?
- You said my hair is beautiful.

64
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,760
Like copper set on fire.

65
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,840
Yeah.

66
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,160
But I didn't say that. I just thought it.

67
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,920
<i>(Andy thinks) I love you.</i>
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

<i>- I've known you for a thousand years.</i>
<i>- (Vicky thinks) That long?</i>

69
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,280
<i>Yes, I've loved you too.</i>

Hey, buddy, airport.

73
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,920
- You OK?
- "(groans)"

74
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,920
I got a headache. Wake up, babydoll.

75
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,120
We're here. Come on.

76
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Where are we?

77
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,720
Hanover, sweetheart. Airport.

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,760
- Try the airport.
- Roger.

79
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,920
Suppose we catch up with him.
Do you wanna face him down?

80
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,640
What do you call this thing he's got?
How he pushes people.

81
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,560
The Shop figures
he may be running down by now.

82
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,600
He's overdone it before
and wound up in bed.

83
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,760
It's doing something to his brain.

84
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Like what?

85
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,240
Giving himself
pinprick haemorrhages, maybe?

86
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
- It could kill him.
- Good, let's hope.

87
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,520
We don't have any more money
and we don't have anything left to sell.

88
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I can't stay here.

89
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,520
It's not right. It's not right to steal.

90
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,680
Honey, I know, but it's not right
for them to keep coming after us, either.

91
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,280
Now, I explained that to you, Charlie,
at least I tried.

92
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,080
- About the big bad and the little bad?
- That's right. Lesser and greater evil.

93
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,720
- Big bad is what I did to Mommy?
- Oh, darling, please.

94
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,600
Don't. Don't, baby.

95
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,640
I made Mommy scream.

96
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,720
Shh...

97
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,600
Poor Daddy.

99
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,440
Gotta keep a lookout.

100
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,840
OK.

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,120
"(man)" I don't know
what you're doing here.

102
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,960
I don't want to have anything to do with
you. I told you not to follow me here.

103
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,120
Besides, it's not my fault.
I'm not responsible.

104
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,200
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
I'm not the only guy you've been seeing.

105
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm not ready to get married,
so why don't you just get outta here?

106
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,760
- Why don't you just stop bugging me?
- "(Andy)" Come on, Charlie.

107
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,680
"(woman)" You told me you loved me.

108
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,720
You told me if anything
happened you'd take care of me.

109
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,080
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
We've been through this 100 times.

110
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,040
I'm not responsible.
Look, I told you not to follow me here.

111
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,680
"(woman)" But I can't do it on my own.
I don't know where to go.

112
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,320
- I don't have any money.
- I'm not the only guy you've been with.

113
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,360
"(woman)" That's not true.

114
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,000
I swear to God you're the only one.
I've never slept with anyone else.

115
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,760
"(man)" That's not
what my buddy Al told me...

116
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,280
I didn't mean it, Daddy.

117
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,880
- Ow!
- Hey, hey!

118
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,840
- All right, buddy, come outta there.
- Mind waiting till I put my feet out?

119
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,560
I was coming with you and I saw him and
before I could stop it, it just happened.

120
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,640
- I didn't like him and it just got away.
- It's OK, honey.

121
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,480
- But I set him on fire.
- Charlie.

122
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
- I didn't mean it, Daddy.
- Charlie, stop it.

123
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,080
I want you to listen to me.
You said it got away from you and it did.

124
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,160
But not like before.
It just got away a little bit.

125
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,240
Charlie, you might've set
that man's face on fire or his hair.

126
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,520
Now, it always goes out
at somebody you don't like.

127
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,120
- But you didn't really hurt that guy.
- Not like I hurt Mommy in the kitchen.

128
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,880
Baby. Baby, you've got
to stop thinking about that.

129
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,760
It wasn't you that really hurt Mommy.

130
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,240
They killed her.

131
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,400
That's right. That's right.

132
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,680
Now...

133
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
We've got to go on.

134
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,640
Single file. Just like the Indians.

135
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
And keep as far over
to the side of the road as you can, OK?

136
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,120
"(man)" I seen them both.
This guy looked kinda sick, or something.

137
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,120
- Are you OK?
- "(Andy sighs)"

138
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,160
- So far, so good, baby. You getting tired?
- Nope.

139
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,520
Daddy, I feel those bad men
from The Shop around again.

140
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,640
OK. Come on.

141
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,520
OK, sweetheart, come on.

142
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
Head up Route 70.

143
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,880

- I thought you were dead.
- Are you kidding?

150
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,880
Think I'd do that to you?
You're all I've got in this world.

151
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,600
But I'm happy about that
cos I'm crazy about you.

152
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,120
I'm crazy about you too, Daddy.

153
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,040
Come on. We gotta find a place to sleep.

154
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,040
We can afford it now.

155
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,760
- I burned him.
- Rest, sweetheart.

156
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,120
You didn't hurt him. You controlled it.

157
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,200
- "(groans)"
- Shh...

158
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,760
<i>(Andy) OK, Charlie.</i>

159
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,760
Now, let it out. Easy does it.

160
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,800
Let it go.

161
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,160
Attagirl.

162
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,000
Attagirl. OK.

163
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,000
Now pull it back.

164
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,120
Pull it back, Charlie.
Pull it back, Charlie.

165
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,200
Good Lord.

166
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,440
Now, you've got to learn to control that.
You gotta try real hard. OK?

167
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,400
- I couldn't help it.
- Tomorrow. She's tired.

168
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,680
Time for bed.
You can try again at breakfast.

169
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,720
- I wanna do that again.
- No, tomorrow.

170
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I'm not tired. I wanna do it again.

171
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,800
- I said no.
- Again. Now!

172

<i>(screaming)</i>

173
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,320
I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean it.

174
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
Well, you did it. You hurt your mother.

175
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,320
- I'm sorry, Mommy.
- It's all right. Mommy's all right.

176
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,000
Charlie, you have got to control this thing

177
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,040
because it's a bad thing,
you understand me? A bad thing.

178
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
- Leave her alone. It's not her fault.
- "(phone rings)"

179
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,640
- Hello?
- Sorry.

- Whoever it is.

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,800
We know who they are and they wanna
make sure we're staying right here.

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,200
Sweetheart?

186
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,000
Vicky!

Oh...

Oh, no.

Oh, no. Please, please, God.

190
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,280
Please don't be here.

191

Please don't...

Oh, no! Please, no, no!

193
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,160
Oh, no! Babe! Oh, what did they do?

194
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,120
What did they do?
They put this in your mouth.

195

Charlie!

202
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,360
Joan,
by any chance is my daughter with you?

203
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,520
<i>- (Charlie screams)</i>
<i>- (man) Hold her!</i>

204
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,080
OK, that's far enough.

205
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,320
Drop the gun.

206
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,520
Drop it.

207
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,080
Bring her to me.

208
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,680
You're blind.

209
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,640
"(yelling)" My eyes!

210
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,240
You too, you son of a bitch.
You killed my wife. You're blind.

211
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,080
"(screaming)" My eyes!

212
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Oh, my God! Leon!

213
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,360
- Andy!
- "(man)" My eyes!

214
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,880
Joan.

215
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,400
Go back inside the house.
You won't remember any of this.

216
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,400
- Leon!
- Oh, God!

217
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,560
My eyes! Son of a bitch!

218
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,360
Can't see!

219
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,120
- Wake up, baby. It's time to move on.
- Morning.

220
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,520
- Elaine. Morning, Josie.
- Good morning.

221
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,800
Jamieson called in. No word yet
on the McGees. He'll ring later.

222
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,760
Put him right through when he does.

223
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
And Rainbird is in your office.

224
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,240
- When did he get back?
- This morning.

225
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,040
- Morning, Kenny.
- Morning, sir.

226
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,240
Welcome back, Rainbird.

227
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,160
- How was Venice?
- "(he chuckles)"

228
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,120
Sinking.

229
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,440
- Is our problem there solved?
- Our problem there is solved.

230
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,320
- Dr Wanless is here.
- Christ, there goes a beautiful day.

231
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,160
Ah, the good doctor.
What do you want, Joe?

232
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,360
- Have you caught them yet?
- We'll catch them. What do you want?

233
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,000
What do I always want?
Why do I stay alive?

234
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,000
To try to persuade you
to sanction them both,

235
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,280
expunge them,
wipe them from the face of the earth.

236
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
Andrew McGee and his daughter

237
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,120
constitute the greatest threat
that's confronted this nation.

238
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,200
- That's a lot of crap.
- You feel guilt!

239
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,520
Eight out of ten of our young volunteers
have died, committed suicide.

240
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,760
You want to justify your participation.

241
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,480
You were all in favour of it at the time.

242
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,560
I know.

243
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,760
I didn't realise.

244
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,400
None of us did.

245
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,480
Lot Six was nothing more
than a synthetic copy of pituitary extract.

246
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,000
- A powerful painkiller hallucinogen.
- For God's sake, Joe, don't start again.

247
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,040
You see...

248
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,720
You see...

249
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,320
This pituitary extract is responsible
for the occasional flashes of psi ability

250
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,280
which most human beings demonstrate
from time to time.

251
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,760
Precognition, telekinesis,
mental domination,

252
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,160
the kind of domination that this
experiment brought out in Andrew McGee.

253
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,320
What is the point, Doctor?

254
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,040
Since this child was born, her father has
tried to inhibit her use of those powers.

255
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,040
But what if his control
had weakened now?

256
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,960
Why would he lose control now
after all these years?

257
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,160
Ask yourself this question.

258
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,600
How exhausting must it have been
for Victoria and Andrew McGee

259
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,000
when this child was an infant?

260
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,000
The bottle is late. The baby cries.

261
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,320
And at that moment, one of her stuffed
toys right there in the crib beside her

262
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,880
bursts into smoky flame.

263
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,440
Joe, she's just a little girl.
She can light fires, yes,

264
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,320
but you're making her sound
like Armageddon.

265
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,960
That's what it might well be.

266
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,560
Suppose lighting fires
is merely the tip of the iceberg.

267
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

268
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,680
I am talking about a talent
that is directly linked

269
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,640
to this child's pituitary gland,
undeveloped pituitary gland.

270
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,480
What happens when she becomes
adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes

271
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,400
and becomes, for 20 months, the most
powerful force in the human body?

272
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,480
Suppose we have a child here
who some day is capable

273
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,720
of creating a nuclear explosion
simply by the power of her will.

274
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,040
- That's insane.
- Is it? Is it?

275
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,360
Then allow me to progress
from insanity to utter lunacy.

276
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,880
Suppose there is a little girl out there
somewhere today, this morning,

277
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,840
who has within her,
lying dormant at present,

278
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,640
the power some day
to crack the very planet in two,

279
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,840
like a china plate in a shooting gallery.

280
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,080
What if we could train this little girl?
And others as well.

281
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,160
Could we have more powerful weapons?

282
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,640
No! No more experiments.

283
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,000
Don't force me to go above your head
because I will if I have to.

284
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,800
I'll have you and this entire establishment
eliminated.

285
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,480
An excitable man.

286
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,760
Where are we gonna go now?

287
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,760
We have to find some place
to stay for a while.

288
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,760
I don't think anybody'll believe us
but if we send letters to the newspapers

289
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,760
maybe The Shop will have to lay off.

290
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,560
We could go to Granther's.

291
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,200
- What made you think of that?
- I don't know.

292
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,840
Cos I was thinking about your grandfather
not five minutes ago.

293
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,720
We'll check the motel.
I want you to work the road further down.

294
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,800
Well... That's a pretty little miss.

295
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,360
- What's your name, missy?
- Roberta.

296
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,040
Well, Bobby, where are you headed for?

297
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,440
We're headed for Tennessee. Knoxville.
My wife's there visiting her sister.

298
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
- Ran into a little problem.
- Did she?

299
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,080
Yeah, labour. This one's got
a new baby brother. 1 .40 this morning.

300
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,720
- His name's Andy. Isn't that a nice name?
- I think it's a corker.

301
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,320
Mine's Irv Manders. Hop in.
I'll get you ten miles closer to Knoxville.

302
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,320
<i>(car horn)</i>

303
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,920
- Hey, Al, it's them.
- You're joking?

304
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,760
- No, damn it, it's them.
- Did you get the number?

305
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,440
- Did you see which way they went?
- I didn't even see them check out.

306
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,640
Hey, we got them.

307
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,720
Why don't you two come home,
take lunch with me and the wife?

308
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,920
- We couldn't...
- Daddy, I'm starving.

309
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,120
- Are you sure you got enough?
- Always, and I'm glad to have you.

310
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,320
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure, Bobby.

311
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,680
It'll be my wife's too
when she gets a look at you.

312
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Always wanted a little girl herself.

313
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,480
But I guess that wasn't to be.

314
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
"(lrv)" Got a song for you.

315
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,760
Oh, there was an old hen
She had a wooden leg

316
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,000
Finest old hen that ever laid an egg

317
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,880
She laid her eggs all over the farm
Another little drink won't do us any harm

318
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,320
<i>(laughter)</i>

319
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,520
- Who'd you bring home, Irv?
- This little girl is Roberta.

320
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,720
This young fella here's her daddy.

321
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,880
I didn't catch his name yet
so I don't know if we're related.

322
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,440
- Frank Burton, ma'am.
- Hello, I'm Norma Manders.

323
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,360
- Hi.
- Hello.

324
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,800
Your husband invited us back for lunch.
Hope you don't mind.

325
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,120
Why, sure. Come on in.

326
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,200
Come on, Bobby. Feedbag.

327

<i>(belches)</i>

328
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,000
More room out than there is in, button.

329
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,160
If I eat any more, I think I'll split.
That's what my mom used to...

330
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,840
I mean that's what she always says.

331
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,280
Norma, why don't you and Bobby go out
and feed those chickens?

332
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,920
I wanna have a little talk with Frank here.

333
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,360
- Would you like that?
- Do they peck?

334
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,080
Only what they eat, honey.

335
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,680
- Come on.
- OK. Goody.

336
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,520
Want a beer, Frank?

337
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,960
- It isn't Frank, but I guess you know that.
- I guess I did.

338
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,960
- What is your name?
- Andy.

339
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,280
- Well, Andy, what about that beer?
- I guess I could use it.

340
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,360
You got it.

341
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,920
- There you go.
- Thank you.

342
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,200
- Here, let me help.
- No, that's all right. I know this routine.

343
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,440
- Cops after you, Andy?
- Sort of cops, yeah.

344
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,520
You snatch that little girl from her mother?

345
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,680
No, she's my daughter,
but her mother didn't set the cops on us.

346
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,720
Her mother's been dead for a year.

347
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,680
Don't appear like you got her
against her will.

348
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,040
What do they want you for,
anyway, Andy?

349
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,840
- Who are they?
- Government agents.

350
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,560
- FBI?
- No, The Shop.

351
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,880
The Shop?

352
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,520
Yeah, it's really the Department
of Scientific Intelligence. DSI.

353
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,640
My daughter, Charlene and I, Charlie,

354
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,960
we were part of an experiment
that happened a long time ago.

355
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,360
Tell me about it.

356
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,720
OK, now go ahead.

357
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,760
Thank you. Do you eat these chickens?

358
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,840
If I can catch one, I might eat one.
We eat the eggs.

359
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,120
They want to examine her and study her.

360
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,560
So they can figure out just what makes
her able to do what she can do.

361
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,920
I think they want to use her
to reactivate the Lot Six programme.

362
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,120
Andy, I think you ought to call the police.
Turn yourself in.

363
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,600
- Yeah, I know it sounds crazy.
- As crazy as anything I've ever heard.

364
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,840
Daddy, I fed the chic...

365
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,960
You told.

366
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,040
Daddy, why'd you tell?

367
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,360
<i>(gasps)</i>

368
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,400
They're coming. They're coming for us.

369
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,960
They're gonna kill you, Daddy. We have
to run, we have to hide, we have to...

370
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,960
Yes, yes, that's what they wanna do.
They wanna kill you.

371
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,360
Kill you like they did Mommy
and take me away. I won't let it happen.

372
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,200
Holy Jesus Christ. Did she do that?

373
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,640
Charlie, now, watch what you're doing.

374
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,120
Is it too late?

375
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,480
Yes, they're coming up the dirt road now.

376
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,040
Daddy, I'm scared.

377
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,880
Charlie, you can stop them.

378
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,480
If I do something bad,
will you still love me?

379
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,800
Oh, Charlie...

380
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,560
Of course I'll still love you.

381
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,480
I love you more than anything
in the world, no matter what happens.

382
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,160
I got some tall apologising to do.
There's a line of cars coming up the road.

383
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,160
I'll stand with you if you want.
I'll get my deer gun.

384
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,320
You don't need your gun.

385
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,440
Hi, Andy. Hi, Charlie.

386
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,160
- Honey, you don't have to run any more.
- Go away.

387
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,360
Afraid I can't do that, honey.
I have my orders.

388
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,360
No one wants to hurt you or your daddy.

389
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,960
You liar, you're supposed to kill him
and I know it.

390
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,080
I'd advise you do what my daughter says.

391
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,360
You know why she's wanted.
Remember the soldier at the airport?

392
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,160
You men are trespassing.
I want you to get off my property.

393
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
We're government agents, sir.

394
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,800
These two folks are wanted
for questioning. Nothing more.

395
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,880
I don't care if they're wanted
for assassination.

396
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,280
- Show me a warrant or get off my land.
- We don't need a warrant.

397
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,840
You do unless I woke up
in Russia this morning.

398
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,480
If you'll just get in the car,
we can discuss all this.

399
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,640
Honest to gosh,
there's nothing going on here.

400
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,920

- Please, don't make me do anything.

what she's doing? Can't you feel it?

Don't be stupid.

out behind the barn.

No, Irv, don't get involved any deeper.

429
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,000
Those men came here
without any warrants,

430
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,080
tried to take them off our land,
one of them shot me.

431

What do you want me to do?
Turn them over to the secret police?

432

They'll be getting their peckers up enough
to come back. Be a good Nazi?

- I guess not.
- You don't have to do anything else.

No, please, take the Jeep and get away.

We got a lot of cleaning up to do.

Nobody's lived here
since your grandfather died.

I hope that key's still here.

Do you think they'll find us here?

444
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,120
After what you did at the farm,
I think they're gonna stay pretty far away.

If they still wanna capture us,

they're gonna have to figure out
a different way to do it.

Well, anyways, we've got us a new home.

Let's go. Let's go.

Daddy, will things
ever be the same for us again?

Will I be able to go to school,
and things, again?

Sure you can.

- After you write the letters, right?
- That's right.

454
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,200
Tell the newspapers all about it.

Then the running'll be over.

- What?

- Like everybody else?
- Darn tootin' you can.

I wanna be.

- Safe.

462
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,360
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

463

<i>(clears throat)</i>

465
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,640
Do you have a phone here?

466
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,720
Right over here.

467
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,200
<i>- They're here. They mailed some letters.</i>
- All right, good deal.

468
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,160
Get a hold of Bates. He can be there
in an hour and keep me informed.

469
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,200
- Mr McGee?
- And Miss McGee.

470
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,200
- Where are they?
- The summer cottage near Bradford.

471
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,080
- I'll bring them here.
- Oh, just like that?

472
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,520
- You know what that little girl can do.
- I know.

473
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,040
That's why I'll bring her here.
So you can do all your tests.

474
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,640
On the condition that you give her to me
for disposal when you're finished with her.

475
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,840
What?

476
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,320
- I want her when you've finished with her.
- You are mad.

477
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,640
How right you are.
So are you, mad as a hatter.

478
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,080
You sit here making plans for controlling a
force that's beyond your comprehension.

479
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,560
A force that belongs
only to the gods themselves.

480
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,960
What the hell are you talking about?

481
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,920
Things I'm sure
you wouldn't want the world to know.

482
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,640
What's to stop me from
having you erased right here and now?

483
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,720
Hmm!

484
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,720
My word that I've already made certain
provisions that, should I disappear,

485
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,640
The Shop will cease to exist
within six weeks.

486
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,800
And within six months,
you will stand in front of a judge,

487
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,920
awaiting sentence for crimes
serious enough to keep you behind bars

488
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,720
for the rest of your life.

489
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,920
Just... what is it you want?

490
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,640
Your word that my involvement
with this child Charlene

491
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,560
will not end when I bring her here.

492
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,440
That's just the beginning.
We're going to be friends.

493
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,360
- We haven't got her yet.
- We'll have her.

494
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,320
All right.

495
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,640
I guess we've got a deal,
but why do you want her?

496
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,400
She's very beautiful. She's very young.
Yet inside her is the power of the gods.

497
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,440
We're going to be close, she and I.

498
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, yes.
Gonna be very close.

499
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,440
Reel in some of the slack out of the line.
Real slow, come on in, a little more.

500
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,000
OK, now give it a little tug.
Attagirl, now reel.

501
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,120
Yes, sirree! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

502
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,000
- A real whopper.
- Lookee here. How about that?

503
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,560
<i>(she laughs)</i>

504

Here he comes.

505
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,680
Saved by the Postal Department.
Am I glad to see you?

506
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,680
I think we got a dead battery.
Could you give us a jump?

507
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,920
- Let's take a look at it.
- Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.

508
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,800
Where will we go now?

509
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,080
Offices of "The New York Times."

510
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,480
- But you sent them a letter.
- Well, they might not have gotten it.

511
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,880
Do you think they took them?

512
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,960
No!

513
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,680
- I'll get it, baby.
- "(yells)" I can do it!

514
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,320
Baby, baby, come on, now.
It's almost over.

515
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,400
"(crying)" It's never gonna be over.

516
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,280
- It's not over.
- Come on.

517
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,120
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is. Come here.

518
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,200
<i>(she weeps)</i>

519
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,920
- Are you ready to go?
- I guess so.

520
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,720
Daddy, I'm never gonna start
another fire in my life.

521
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,840
Even if they come
before we can get away.

522
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,720
I'm never gonna hurt
another person in my life.

523
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,920
That's OK, Charlie. I can understand that.

524
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,840
OK.

525
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,160
Jump.

526
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,240
That's a big girl.

527
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,400
OK...

528
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,520
Charlie? Charlie! Charlie!

Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God!

530

They shot my daughter! "(echoes)"

531

Come on out where I can see you,
you son of a bitch.

532
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,800
Baby.

533
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,720
Nothing to it.

534
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,880
Charlie!

535
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,600
She's all right, Mr McGee. Take it easy.

536
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,320
Where is she? I wanna see her.

537
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,040
All in good time. First, let's talk.

538
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,560
Let's get acquainted.

539
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,640
Go to hell.

540
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,400
I tell you, she's gonna be all right.

541
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,480
No. No.

542
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,840
- What do you want with us?
- I told you, Mr McGee.

543
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,400
We are going to be spending
considerable time with each other

544
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,360
and I want to introduce myself.

545
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,800
I'm Dr Pynchot.

546
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,920
I'm going to make sure
you're treated well here.

547
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,680
Is this The Shop?

548
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,200

Hi, Charlene.

- I'm Captain Hollister. May I come in?
- Where's my daddy?

552
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,360
I brought you some cocoa.

553
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,760
I don't want anything.

554

There's nothing to be afraid of. Here.

You see? Go on.

556

Well, maybe later.

557
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,600
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

558
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,920
I know you may not believe this
but I've actually begun to think of you

559
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,800
as my own daughter.

560
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,600
- What have you done to my father?
- He's resting and he's fine, just like you.

561
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,080
He knows you're all right
and he sends his love

562
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,120
and he wants you to cooperate with us.

563
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,360
You're a liar.

564
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,240
What kind of talk is that
from a nice little girl like you?

565
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,280
- Go to hell!
- Oh?

566
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,280
A very stubborn nice little girl.
That's all right, I understand.

567
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,120
I know you're tired
and you're not sure where you are.

568
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:18,320
So I just want to ease your mind, Charlie.
Do you mind if I call you Charlie?

569
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,360
All right, Charlene.

570
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,440
You are here because I'm very interested
in this ability that you have.

571
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,440
Pyrokinesis.

572
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,640
Yes.

573
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,440
All of us here are interested in that and
we want to see how far you can take it.

574
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,320
I'll tell you this, Charlie,

575
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,040
you'll be doing this great country of ours
a big favour if you cooperate.

576

I said I would never start another fire
in my life. I wanna see my father.

OK.

Um...

Why don't you drink the cocoa
and get some sleep?

If there's anything you want,
just pick up the phone and let us know.

hard to believe now, Charlie, but...

Did they tell you anything about what
we're supposed to be doing in here?

621
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,920
All they told me was to come talk to you.

You look nervous.
Thirsty? Want some water?

Yeah, I'm thirsty.

624
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,200
You know,
they mentioned something about a test.

625
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,480
- Uh-huh.
- You want some water?

626
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,560
No, I'll pass.

- Goddamn it.
- He's tipped over.

633
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,200
He's been on the run too long.

634
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,400
- All those damn pills haven't helped.
- Just give me time.

635
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,880
Rainbird's right.
He's lost it and time won't help.

636
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,080
Increase his medication.
I'll decide what to do with him later.

637
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,200
- Work on the girl.
- Oh, I am.

638
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,480
With a little luck, before long,
she'll trust me like a brother.

Why do you come here every day?
I'm not messy.

I don't even know where the man is.

This is a big place, Charlie.

650
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:46,880
They say they'll let me see him if I...
if I do something.

- And I don't want to.

what they want you to do?

I mean, if just by doing it,
you can get to see your old man.

when I was captured.

- The Cong.

- Who's the Cong?
- You mean to tell me...?

Oh, no, of course not, you're too young.

679
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,400
It was the war, see. Vietnam.

680
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,760
The Cong were the bad guys.
They wore black pyjamas.

681
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,160
In the jungle we were on patrol.
Walked into an ambush.

682
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,160
Only about six of us got out.

683
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,840
We ran.

684
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,840
Went the wrong way.

685
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,120
They caught me.

686
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,360
Threw me in a hole in the ground.

687
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,360
Like being buried alive.
It was always dark like this.

688
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,480
What did you eat?

689
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,560
They threw down rotted rice.

690
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,720
Sometimes I'd eat spiders.

691
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,480
Live ones. Big spiders. I'd chase them
around in the dark and eat them.

692
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,520
Gross.

693
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,000
They turned me into an animal.

694
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,600
You got it easier than me, kid,
but it all comes down to the same thing.

695
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,000
Like a rat in the trap.

696
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,000
You think maybe they'll get
the lights back on pretty soon?

697
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,200
Doesn't matter. We're together.

698
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:12,920
God, kid. If some day I could help you
the way you're helping me...

699
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:18,080
You could.
You could get a message to my father.

700
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,800
You know, what's it all about? Why do
they have you and your daddy here?

701
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,440
What do they want you to do?

702
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,200
They won't make me take any more pills.

703
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,160
No more pills, you bastard.

704
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,200
How are you gonna help Charlie
if you're a goddamn zombie?

705
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,720
Listen,
maybe I could get in to see your dad?

706
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,840
- You could? You really think you could?
- I could change with Herbie, an orderly.

707
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:54,920
I could see your dad, tell him you're OK...
Maybe not tell him, pass him a note.

708
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:59,280
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Shit.

709
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,280
Maybe you oughta light
the damn fires if you can.

710
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,640
I told you, it's like letting a wild animal
out of a cage.

711
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,920
I promised myself I'd never do it again.

712
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:16,560
That men at the airport, those men at
the farm, I killed them, I burned them up.

713
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,960
Yeah, but the way you told it,
it sounded like self-defence.

714
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,600
Yes, but that's no excuse.

715
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,160
Also sounded like you saved
your dad's life.

716
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:29,280
Look, if you do what they want you to do,

717
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:33,160
only as much as you want to do, it might
be the way for you to get out of here.

718
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,280
I'll help anyway I can.

719
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,080
Oh, my! Light.

720
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,160
Hold on here.

721
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,960
I'm sorry you got stuck with me
in here, John.

722
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,480
But I'm awful glad too.

723
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,960
You look like you could use
a little rest, huh? Come on, let's try.

724
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,080
Attagirl.

725
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,160
There we go.

726
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,920
That's the girl.

727
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,640
You just relax
and you'll be asleep in no time.

728
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,960
And you'll have sweet, sweet dreams.

729
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,320
That's the girl.

730
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,520
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.

731
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,200
Daddy.

732
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,680
Now, Charlie, you know
what you're supposed to do.

733
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,080
I want you to go in the other room. I don't
want to have to look at you while I do this.

734
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,000
Something might happen.

735
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,200
Look at those alphas,
she's really jacked up.

736
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,720
Everything all set? Tape rolling?

737
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,240
- Everything all right with her?
- Yes.

738
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,840
- You all set in there?
- Ready in here.

739
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,040
Are we ready here? Tape rolling?

740
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:56,160
- Rolling.
- All right. Everyone stand by.

741
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,240
Go ahead, Charlene.

742
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,600
Wood chips. They should've given me
something harder.

743
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,880
Something's happening in there.

744
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,360
- Temperature just jumped ten degrees.
- "(bleeping)"

745
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,280
There it goes.

746
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,560
Her alpha patterns
look like the goddamn Andes.

747
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,560
She did it. By God, she did it
and we got it all on tape.

748
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,320
Back off. Just back off.

749
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,240
Back off.

750
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,320
Look at the tub.

751
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,760
Back off.

752
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,280
Did you see the water boil?
And the temperature?

753
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,520
- Jesus, did we get the audio?
- We got it.

754
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,400
Good deal. My God, did you see
what she did? Did you see that?

755
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:57,440
My God, is there anyone here that has
any doubt she didn't make that happen?

756
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,040
Not at all, Chief. None.

757
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,600
I knew something would happen
but I had no idea.

758
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,440
That tray flew and she controlled it.
Then she put her power in the tub.

759
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,440
We got all on tape
and it's good enough to stand up in court.

760
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,720
Right up in the Supreme Court.
What are you looking so miserable about?

761
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,440
You got her to do it by promising
she could see her father again.

762
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,520
- She must never see him.
- We never intended to let her.

763
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,280
She'll never stop asking for it. Suppose by
some strange accident they get together.

764
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,160
- Suppose they do.
- She does whatever he tells her.

765
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:35,000
Suppose he persuades her
to destroy us all.

766
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,720
- No chance.
- There's always a chance.

767
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:44,480
He's right.
They can never see each other again.

768
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,080
Then you better send
somebody along after her.

769
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,200
Huh?

770
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,360
Your technician must've had
an appointment he forgot about.

771
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,880
He went out of here in a hell of a rush.
He also left the door open

772
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
and your firestarter just walked out.

773
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,880
Christ.
One of you men go and get her.

774
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,080
Go on.

775
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,240
Sure.

776
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:18,560
Which of you would like
to go and get the little girl?

777

Here you go, buddy.

779
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,520
Oh, good.

780
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,560
Listen, Andy,

781
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,920
we've determined that your power
has deteriorated since you got here.

782
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,640
In fact, we've had no positive results at all.

783
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,400
What do you expect with all these drugs?

784
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,280
You expect me to do my best
when I'm stoned?

785
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:46,080
I did everything I could. I tried.
I did everything I could.

786
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:50,000
Yes, of course I know that you have
and believe me, I appreciate it very much.

787
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,280
In fact, I think you need a rest.

788
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:57,480
Did you know that The Shop has a small
compound on the island of Maui, Hawaii?

789
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,360
How would it be if I sent you there
for the immediate future?

790
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,600
- I still get my medication?
- Oh, sure, all you need.

791
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,080
- Well, that sounds nice.
- All right, good deal.

792
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,360
Then I'll get things started
in that direction right away.

793
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:20,240
You just take it easy, kid.
We'll take care of everything.

794
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,480

796
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:07,240
She's so beautiful. What's her name?

797
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:11,360
"(laughs)" Actually, she's more of a boy.
His name is Necromancer.

798
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,200
What does necromancer mean?

799
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,720
I think it means something like wizard
or sorcerer. Something like that.

800
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:26,120
They said if I did what they wanted,
they'd let me see my father.

801
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:30,960
How did I know they were gonna be so
damn stubborn? You have to do it again.

802
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,880
- But when will I ever stop?
- Look, baby.

803
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,720
It's like poker.

804
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,640
If you ain't dealing from strength,
you ain't dealing.

805
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,840
Every time you light one of their fires,
make sure you get something in return.

806
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,280
This is your old Uncle John talking,
you understand me?

807
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,760
OK.

808
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,600
What about this power of yours?
You were awful scared about it before.

809
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,000
How'd you feel about it now?

810
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,920
It's different now. It's a lot stronger.

811
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:06,720
Yesterday, when I told it to back off, it did.

812
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,400
It was like I let it out
in a single straight line and then...

813
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,640
- Then you pulled it back into yourself?
- Oh, no. I put it into the water.

814
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,040
If I pulled it back into myself,
I guess I'd burn up.

815
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,520
When am I gonna get to see my father?

816
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,960
Well, Charlie, we'll just have
to give them enough rope.

817
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,160
Next time, there has to be more water.

818
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,360
Everything all set here?

819
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,880
Tape running? All right, stand by.

820
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,960
We're ready when you are, Charlene.

01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,680
Plus or minus five degrees.
It's 40 in there.

824
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,240

I wanna see my father.

01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,960
You better tell her something.

832
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,880
Soon, Charlie.

833
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,480
When you show us a little more.

834
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:06,160
If you don't let me see him now,
I'll make something happen.

01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,040
Do you hear me?
I'll make something happen.

841
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,560
I'm telling you, we're not through
with testing her.

842
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,160
You saw what she's capable of.
She hasn't even reached her potential.

843
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,640
Perhaps Herman would like to see her
blow up a country before he gives in.

844
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,680
I'm scientifically rational enough
not to form an opinion

845
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,040
based on two experiments.

846
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,840
I'm satisfied, yes, but only partially.

847
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:10,480
Have you made the arrangements
regarding her father?

848

851
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,040
Have you considered what might happen

852
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,720
if that girl found out
whose side you're really on?

853
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,240
Oh, yes, I have.

854

out what a steak feels like in a microwave.

No.

857
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,320
No point in lying to you about that.

858
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,200
When we find out
all we need to know from her...

859
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,200
When you give her to me.

860
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,600
What are you gonna do with her?

861
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,000
John the friendly orderly will come in.

862
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:26,120
He will greet her, talk to her,
get her to smile.

863
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,720
John the friendly orderly will make her
happy cos he's the only one who can.

864
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,760
When John feels that she has reached
the moment of her greatest happiness,

865
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:42,480
he will strike her across the bridge
of the nose, breaking it explosively,

866
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,080
and sending bone fragments
into her brain.

867
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:52,400
It'll be quick and he'll be
looking at her face at the time.

868
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,560
He will know her power.

869
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,600
And when he dies,

870
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,560
which I hope is very soon,

871
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:09,120
perhaps he can take that power with him
into the other world.

872
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,160
You are crazy.

873
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,600

for you to go to Hawaii.

- Today.

01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,960
I mean, what's taking me?

878
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,840
You go from here
by helicopter to the base,

879
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,640
then the rest of the way
by army transport plane.

880
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,960
Hmm.

881
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,440
- 8.00?
- 8.00.

882
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,920
You know, that could bite you.

883
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,520
- What?
- That snake you're holding.

884
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,000
Christ, how did that get there?

885
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,360
I guess you just picked it up from a bush.

886
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,160
I want you to contact that helicopter pilot.

887
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,080
No.

888
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,160
- Hey, guard.
- Shut up.

889
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,680
Contact the pilot
and tell him you'll be coming along.

890
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,840
I won't be coming along.

891
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,040
Yes, of course I'm coming along.

892
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,240
- My daughter will be with us.
- Oh, no.

893
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,000
She can't come. She's far too dangerous.

894
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,360
Oh, yeah? Well, who do you think
made her dangerous?

895
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,400
My daughter is coming along.

896
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,560
I don't want you to contradict me again,
do you understand?

897
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,640
Yes, of course.

898
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:43,880
You contact the helicopter and let him
take us as far as the army plane.

899
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,920
There has to be a refuelling stop
between here and Hawaii.

900
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,520
- We'll have to refuel in California.
- Yeah.

901
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,320
OK.

902
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,680
- Do you have paper and a pen?
- Sure.

903
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,960
Here you go.

904
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,320
I'm gonna write something
to my daughter.

I'll tell you in the hall.

01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,080
Better. It's a miracle. I'll take you.

922

No, you'd get in trouble.
I wouldn't do that to you. You're my friend.

01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:13,840
I appreciate that, Charlie,
but I'd do anything for you.

Hi, Charlie.

926
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:26,040
My name's Mike. Captain Hollister has
assigned me to take you to the stables.

927
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,360
- What time?
- Well, let's see.

928
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,920
I'll be back for you
about quarter to eight this evening.

929
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,160
So, what's going on?

930
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,720
- I asked if I could go riding at night-time.
- Oh?

931
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,920
Sure, kid, anything you want.

932
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,320
- Bye.
- See you later.

01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,080
OK, let's check you in here.

Hey!

Anybody here?

938
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:28,480
- You can go now.
- I have the kid with me.

939
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,920
I said you can go now!

- Can't do it, Charlie.

Back off. Back off.

Get out of here, you bastard,
or I'll burn you up, I'll fry you.

John...

948

I'm really glad you're here
but if anybody found out...

949
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:26,520
That doesn't matter any more.
The only thing that matters is you and me.

950
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,920
How'd you get Charlie to cooperate?

951
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,920
- Rainbird got her to do it.
- Who's Rainbird?

952
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:36,720
He's an agent, an exterminator. Charlene
thinks he's an orderly named John.

953
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:40,480
Come on up, Charlie. Come to John.

954
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,640
- My father should be here any minute.
- I know.

Yeah. Oh.

01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:24,120
- Let me look at you.
- Is it true? Are we really going away?

963
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,480
Yes, it's true, we're really going away.

964
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,640
Baby.

965
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:36,080
- You pushed him.
- You're right.

966
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:41,800
- My friend John is here.
- The orderly?

967
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,800
Yeah, he's up there.

968
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,760
Couldn't we take him with us
if he wants to come?

969
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,840
He's the one that shot us, baby.
He's the one that brought us here.

970
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:59,000
Oh, no, Daddy, that's John.
He took care of my room.

971
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,080
No.

972
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,160
He is with them.

973
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,920
- It isn't true, is it?
- Yes, it's true.

974
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:21,400
- Where are you, you son of a bitch?
- You tricked me, you lied to me.

975
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:27,560
No, I just mixed up the truth a little,
Charlie. And I did it to save your life.

976
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:32,000
You come down here before I set
everything on fire, cos I can do it.

977
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,160
I know you can.

978
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:37,240
But if you do, you're gonna burn up
an awful lot of horses.

979
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,200
Can't you hear them?
Necromancer's in one of those stalls.

01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,320
No, I'm not gonna do it.

No, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna burn.

No! Back off.

983
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,040
Please, don't. Back off.

984
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,880
You're not gonna do it.

985
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,840
Don't. Back off. Back off!

986
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:27,960
What more do you want from us?
Why can't you just let us go?

987
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:33,160
You can't just be let go. I don't think
your father even believes that now.

988
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:36,640
- You're dangerous and you know it.
- That's not my fault.

989
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:41,160
I know that. I don't care about that.
I never did. All I care about is you.

990
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,160
Now, come up here!
Don't make me shoot your father.

991
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:49,120
- Don't listen to him, Charlie.
- You promise he'll be all right?

992
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:53,400
- I give you my real word.
- Don't do it, baby.

993
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

994
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,000
Kill him.

995
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,160
Jump.
