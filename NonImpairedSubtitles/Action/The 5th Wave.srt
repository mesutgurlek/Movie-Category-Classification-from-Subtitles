No doubt.

801
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,680
So the guy I replace went Section 8. Why?

802
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,560
Does it matter?

803
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,960

Let me guess.

879

You did good in school, had a bunch of friends.

We've improved it. Made it mobile.

956
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,440
The idea is to allow  our soldiers in the field

957
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,280
to instantly differentiate between friend and foe.

958

01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,600
Listen, Teacup,you just gottatrust me, okay?

1126
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,680
You're gonna run   and don't look back.

1127
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,720
What about Oompa?

1128
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,440
He's dead, man.We gotta leave him.

1129
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,240
Sorry, man. I'm sorry.

1130
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,120
Zombie, now! Run!

1131
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,120
Haul ass!

1132
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,880
Go, go, go!

1133
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,880
Let's move! Move! Move!

1134
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,680
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1135
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,560
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1136
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,200
Stairs.

1137
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,200
Got it.

1138
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,280
Clear!

1139
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,280
Clear!

1140
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,920
Clear!

1141
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,400
Are we still alive?

1142
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,720
I think so.

1143
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,440
Watch out!

1144
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,800
Don't shoot! It's Ringer!

1145
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,360
That was badass, Ringer.

1146
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,720
I'd hug you if I didn't think

1147
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,480
you'd punch me in   the nuts for it.

1148
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,600
Okay, so what do we do now?

1149
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,360
None of this makes sense.

1150
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,360
They knock planes out of the sky and cause earthquakes,

1151
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,800
but they're afraid of  an army of children?

1152
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,720
There's somethingVosch isn't telling us.

1153
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,680
Okay, I'm not  risking my life for this.

1154
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,960
DUMBO: Ringer, what are you doing?

1155
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,800
I'm unenlisting.

1156
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,760
I'm better out   there on my own.

1157
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,400
If you know   what's best for you,   you'll do the same.

1158
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,640
Holy shit! What the hell is this?

1159
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,640
Zombie, you see this?

1160
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,400
She's green!

1161
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,400
What the hell, you guys?

1162
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,160
Put your guns down.

1163
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,800
You're one of them! You're an alien!

1164
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,760
What are you talking about?I just saved your asses!

1165
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,160
If she's one of them,  we have to take  her out now.

1166
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,320
Poundcake, just calm down, all right?

1167
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,920
We have to.

1168
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,920
I can see it!

1169
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,640
I can see it inside of her!

1170
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,720
There's nothing inside me!

1171
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,800
Shut up!

1172
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,880
Zombie, what do we do? Do we shoot her?

1173
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,640
It's your call, Zombie.

1174
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:26,960
Zombie,what are you doing?

1175
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,480
What's up, man?

1176
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,240
Oh, my God!  What's going on, man?

1177
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,240
Come on, man.

1178
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,680
Hey. Put your guns down.Put your guns down.

1179
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,400
Don't shoot. Calm down.She's not an Other.Neither am I.

1180
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,080
I'm glowing green, right?

1181
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,080
Yeah.

1182
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,920
Yeah. Yeah, listen.

1183
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,320
You know me.

1184
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,800
Come on, Dumbo. You know who I am.

1185
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,760
Put the guns down.

1186
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,880
Just put 'em down! I'm not an Other.

1187
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,000
I don't even thinkany of those people

1188
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:01,720
out there shooting at us are Others.

1189
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,800
Reznik, Vosch...

1190
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,680
They lied to us.

1191
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,760
They lied to us, man.

1192
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,680
Green doesn't mean alien. Green means human.

1193
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,040
Just, without one of these.

1194
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,080
What are you talking about?

1195
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,400
Don't you guys see?

1196
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,080
Those lenses, these trackers, it's all fake, man.

1197
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,200
It's an illusion. It's a trick.

1198
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,160
They weren't testing these.They were testing us.

1199
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,840
They were seeing   how we would do,

1200
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,760
how we would hold up   under pressure.

1201
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,400
All right? If we would do what we were trained to do.

1202
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,480
To kill Others!

1203
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,240
No,to kill the survivors, man!

1204
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,560
To kill survivors.

1205
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,240
Yeah, well, what about the guys outside,

1206
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,000
the ones that  were shooting at us?

1207
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,280
They're human.

1208
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,960
Why would the Army want us to kill other humans?

1209
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,040
Because the Army,  Reznik, Vosch,

1210
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,920
they're the Others.

1211
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,640
And because we're kids,

1212
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,640
they thought they   could manipulate us   into doing their dirty work.

1213
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,360
We're not fighting the 5th Wave.

1214
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,280
We are the 5th Wave.

1215
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,000
Oh, God.

1216
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,200
So...

1217
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,000
What do we do?

1218
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:08,840
Take out your trackers.

1219
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,160
We go AWOL.

1220
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,680
This means we can't go back. You know that, right?

1221
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,600
Nugget.

1222
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,720
I left him back at the base.

1223
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,560
I was tryingto protect him.

1224
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,320
Jeez.

1225
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,120
I gotta go back.

1226
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,120
That's suicide, dude.

1227
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,320
No, man. I gotta go back.

1228
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,400
You can't just wander back in there.

1229
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,880
They'll know.

1230
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,880
I can't leave him there!

1231
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,120
I'll put the tracker   back in. They'll   pick me up.

1232
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,080
You guys go ahead. I will meet up with you later.

1233
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,520
Dumbo, where can I take a bullet in the torso and not die?

1234
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,880
Are you serious?

1235
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,880
I'm not kidding, man.

1236
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,320
Where can I take a bullet in the torso? I gotta make it look real.

1237
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,560
It's the only way I'm getting back in alive.

1238
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,080
It's impossible, man. There's too many organs.

1239
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,360
There's gotta be  somewhere, man.

1240
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,880
Ringer, she can make   the shot, all right?   I know she can.

1241
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,240
You want me to shoot you?

1242
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,160
Don't pretend like you haven't thought about it.

1243
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,720
Where do you want me to shoot him?

1244
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,720
Uh...

1245
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,680

If I was gonna  kill you, Cassie,

I would've done it a long time ago.

1266

What are you?

1267
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,040
You're one of them. You're a fucking Other.

1268
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,920
I'm human.

1269
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,080
But I'm Other, too.

1270
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:57,560
I'm both.

1271
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,280
This isn't the first time the Others have been here.

1272
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,680
They came before   and created   sleeper agents, like me.

1273
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,560
I always felt different.

1274
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,680
Growing up, there was this voice in my head.

1275
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,560
It was quiet,  but it was there.

1276
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,560
And when the ship arrived,

1277
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,120
it was like a switch was flipped inside me,

1278
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,320
and the sleeper woke up.

1279
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,040
How many people have you killed?

1280
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,680
Did you kill your family?

1281
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,520
No.

The disease that the Others created.

1284

The disease that you created.

1285
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,600
Your family loved you.

01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,800
An instinct.

1288
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,840
A way to protect   your genetic future.

1289
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,720
Do you really believe that?

1290
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:00,960
I did.

1291
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,680
But then I saw you.

1295
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,840
It was like you   flipped the switch back.

You made me  wanna be human again.

1297
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,880
Did you shoot me?

1298
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,520
No.

1299
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:51,720

I don't wanna hear any more.

For what?

To kill the last humans.

1319
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,200
They'll search you.

You can't be armed.

1321

01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,400
I told you not to follow me.

1448
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,280
Well, I decided to ignore you.

1449
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,560
I've been planting bombs.

1450
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,400
In about 10 minutes, when the last plane full of kids takes off,

1451
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,440
I'm taking this place down, for good.

1452
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,960
I'm sorry I lied to you, Cassie.

1453
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:50,040
I was wrong when I said I was both one of you and one of them.

1454
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,480
You can't be both. You have to choose.

1455
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,600
I choose you.

1456
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,400
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1457
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:08,840
Go.

1458
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,680
Get out of here.

1459
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,720
I'll find you.

1460
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,760
Who was that?

1461
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,520
Evan Walker.

1462
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,480
We gotta go find Sam.

1463
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,520
I think Evan Walker's about to blow this place up.

1464
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,480
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1465
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,080
Next floor up.

1466
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,680
SOLDIER 4: Head tothe northeast corridor,number 22, now!

1467
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,800
Which way?

1468
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,600
This way.

1469
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,200
SOLDIER: (OVER MICROPHONE)  &lt;i&gt; Stay with your group leader.&lt;/i&gt;

1470
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:58,640
&lt;i&gt; Proceed to the transport vehicles in a calm and orderly fashion.&lt;/i&gt;

1471
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,680
&lt;i&gt; Stay with your group leader.&lt;/i&gt;

1472
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,640
&lt;i&gt; Proceed to the transport vehicles.&lt;/i&gt;

1473
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,880
SOLDIER 2: Come on.  Move along, people.

1474
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,280
Straight ahead.

1475
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,480
&lt;i&gt; Stay with your group leader.&lt;/i&gt;

1476
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,200
Keep it moving.

1477
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,480
Don't fall behind, everyone.

1478
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,200
Where do they think they're going?

1479
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,360
&lt;i&gt; Once you are on the plane,&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; you will receive&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; further instructions.&lt;/i&gt;

1480
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,400
Keep moving. Straight ahead.

1481
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,680
&lt;i&gt; Stay with your group leader.&lt;/i&gt;

1482
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,520
What's her problem?

1483
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,400
Sam! Sam!

1484
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,720
Sam! Sam! Sam.

1485
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,560
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1486
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,680
Hi.

1487
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,840
Cassie!

1488
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,840
Don't, don't.

1489
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,440
We gotta go, all right?

1490
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,280
Let's go.

1491
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:02,000
&lt;i&gt; Once you are on the plane,&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; you will receive&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; further instructions.&lt;/i&gt;

1492
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,040
Come on.

1493
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,160
Hi!

1494
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,640
I missed you so much, Sam.

1495
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,080
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1496
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,560
I missed you, Cassie.

1497
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,760
Look what I  brought back for you.

1498
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,720
It's Bear.

1499
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,120
I love you.

1500
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,200
I love you, too, Sam.

1501
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:30,880
Hey. Um...

1502
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,880
I gotta take his tracker out.

1503
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,120
All right? It's not gonna hurt, okay?

1504
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,280
(EXPLOSION)

1505
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,920
Is it back up?

1506
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,080
All the recruits  accounted for?

1507
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,600
Yes, sir. Six barracks left.

1508
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,000
Good.

1509
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,920
Power up my bird.   Last plane's in the air,   evacuate the base.

1510
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,480
Come on!

1511
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,280
Shit! It's Vosch!

1512
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,560
Run! Run! Go for the truck!

1513
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,400
Go!

1514
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,640
Sam, run faster!

1515
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,040
Go! Go!

1516
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,480
Come on, Sam!

1517
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,360
Run!

1518
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,360
Cassie!

1519
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,280
Oh, shit!

1520
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:05,080
Who is that?

1521
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,760
Come on!

1522
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,760
Come on! Get in!

1523
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,080
Come on!

1524
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,640
Quick, Sammy. Get in!

1525
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,520
All right, come on! Get in! Get in!

1526
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,680
Drive!

1527
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,280
Thanks for coming back.

1528
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,440
(EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE)

1529
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,200
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1530
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,600
DUMBO: Feel better?

1531
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,600
ZOMBIE: Yeah, thanks, Dumbo.

1532
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,720
Make sure you give her the food first.

1533
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,320
DUMBO: Let me know if it starts hurting or anything like that.

1534
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,800
Okay.

1535
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,800
All right.

1536
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,520
Teacup,   how you feeling?

1537
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:09,960
Pretty good.

1538
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,080
RINGER: All right.

1539
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,960
How much longer for food?

1540
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,080
DUMBO: I don't know. Not long.

1541
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,240
What are you looking at?

1542
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,680
Trying to find the stars.

1543
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,360
It's a little early,   isn't it?

1544
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,360
(CHUCKLES)

1545
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,520
You were named after a star, right?

1546
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,360
Cassiopeia.

1547
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,280
Cassiopeia.

1548
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,040
Yeah. A cluster of stars.

1549
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,200
I was named   after Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's.

1550
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,760
The truth. Yeah.

1551
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,160
Nothing made my dad happier than ice cream.

1552
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,400
I'm sure  you made him happier.

1553
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,640
Yeah.

1554
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,400
So, uh...

1555
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,680
What do we do now?

1556
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,440
We have to save  those other kids.

1557
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,080
Yeah.

1558
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:26,680
How are we gonna do that?

1559
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:29,000
Dinner's ready.

1560
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,880
I don't know yet.

1561
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,280
Well...

1562
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,600
Let's worry  about that tomorrow

1563
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,800
and just go get   something to eat.

1564
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,520
All right.

1565
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,520
Hey, Sam.

1566
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,560
Here, wake up, buddy.

1567
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,000
Hey, there he is.

1568
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,880
Come on.

1569
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,840
Come on, lazy bones.   Put your bear down,   would you?

1570
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,200
CASSIE: &lt;i&gt; The Others see our hope as a weakness,&lt;/i&gt;

1571
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,080
&lt;i&gt; as a delusion.&lt;/i&gt;

1572
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,280
&lt;i&gt; But they're wrong.&lt;/i&gt;

1573
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,920
&lt;i&gt; It's our hope&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; that lets us survive.&lt;/i&gt;

1574
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,240
&lt;i&gt; That lets us bend,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; but remain unbroken.&lt;/i&gt;

1575
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,200
You two knew each other?

1576
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,480
ZOMBIE: Yeah,we went to highschool together.

1577
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,480
CASSIE:&lt;i&gt; It's our hope that will let us win one day.&lt;/i&gt;

1578
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,480
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1579
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,960
&lt;i&gt; It's our hope&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; that makes us human.&lt;/i&gt;

1580
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:50,080
&lt;i&gt; ? I was born in a thunderstorm&lt;/i&gt;

1581
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:54,560
&lt;i&gt; ? I grew up overnight&lt;/i&gt;

1582
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,640
&lt;i&gt; ? I played alone&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; I'm playing on my own&lt;/i&gt;

1583
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,400
&lt;i&gt; ? I survived&lt;/i&gt;

1584
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,200
&lt;i&gt; ? Hey, I wanted everything&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; I never had&lt;/i&gt;

1585
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:13,600
&lt;i&gt; ? Like the love&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; that comes with light&lt;/i&gt;

1586
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:17,880
&lt;i&gt; ? I wore envy and I hated that But I survived&lt;/i&gt;

1587
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:26,280
&lt;i&gt; ? I had a one-way ticket&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; to a place where&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; all the demons go&lt;/i&gt;

1588
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:30,960
&lt;i&gt; ? Where the wind don't change&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; and nothing in the ground&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; can ever grow&lt;/i&gt;

1589
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,200
&lt;i&gt; ? No hope, just lies&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; And you're taught to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; cry in your pillow&lt;/i&gt;

1590
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,960
&lt;i&gt; ? But I'll survive&lt;/i&gt;

1591
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:42,480
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1592
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,720
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1593
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,120
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1594
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:53,520
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1595
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:58,000
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1596
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:02,520
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1597
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,760
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1598
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:12,680
&lt;i&gt; ? I found solace&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; in the strangest place&lt;/i&gt;

1599
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:16,160
&lt;i&gt; ? Way in the back of my mind&lt;/i&gt;

1600
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,680
&lt;i&gt; ? I saw my life&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; in a stranger's face&lt;/i&gt;

1601
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,600
&lt;i&gt; ? And it was mine&lt;/i&gt;

1602
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:30,880
&lt;i&gt; ? I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go&lt;/i&gt;

1603
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:35,400
&lt;i&gt; ? Where the wind don't change&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; and nothing in the ground&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; can ever grow&lt;/i&gt;

1604
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:39,600
&lt;i&gt; ? No hope, just lies&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; And you're taught to&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; cry in your pillow&lt;/i&gt;

1605
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:44,080
&lt;i&gt; ? But I'll survive&lt;/i&gt;

1606
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,960
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1607
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,080
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1608
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:57,680
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1609
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:02,400
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1610
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,080
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1611
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,040
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all, but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1612
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:17,360
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all, but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1613
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,520
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all, but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1614
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,760
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all, but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1615
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:24,240
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all, but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1616
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,480
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all, but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1617
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,880
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all, but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1618
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,280
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all, but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1619
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,760
&lt;i&gt; ? I had made every single&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; mistake that you could&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; ever possibly make&lt;/i&gt;

1620
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,840
&lt;i&gt; ? I took and I took and I took what you gave, but you never noticed that I was in pain&lt;/i&gt;

1621
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,720
&lt;i&gt; ? I knew what I wanted I went in and got it&lt;/i&gt;

1622
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:44,520
&lt;i&gt; ? Did all the things that&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; you said that I wouldn't&lt;/i&gt;

1623
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,120
&lt;i&gt; ? I told you that&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; I would never be forgotten&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; And all in spite of you&lt;/i&gt;

1624
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:58,080
&lt;i&gt; ? And I'm still breathing I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1625
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:02,000
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1626
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,520
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1627
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,520
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all,&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1628
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:11,560
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1629
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:11,560
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all,&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1630
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:16,240
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1631
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:16,240
&lt;i&gt; ? You took it all,&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; but I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1632
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:20,960
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1633
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,240
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1634
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:29,680
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1635
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:34,480
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1636
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,520
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive ?&lt;/i&gt;
