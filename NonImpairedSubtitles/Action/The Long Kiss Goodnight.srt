1
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,056
Mrs. Claus is hot!

2
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,429
My name is Samantha Caine.

3
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,427
At least, I think it is.

4
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,932
You might not believe it,
but I was born only eight years ago...

5
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,094
on a beach in New Jersey.

6
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:46,675
I entered the world fully grown,
wearing clothes I don't remember buying.

7
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:50,006
In the back pocket,
a single key filed blank and faceless.

8
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,173
Fitting metaphor,
but otherwise no help whatsoever.

9
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,680
None.

10
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:58,515
Sometimes I stand naked in the mirror.
Try to guess my age.

11
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,122
Maybe 35?

12
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,350
I have lots of scars.

13
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:07,453
They call my condition
"focal retrograde amnesia."

14
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:11,159
It's no picnic,
but I've learned to live with it.

15
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,702
Got a job I love.
Been seeing someone.

16
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,164
Nice guy.
Good sense of humor.

17
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,468
-Hound of the Baskervilles.
-Mad dogs.

18
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,203
-Hal?
-Yes, Sam.

19
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:24,642
Of all the Christmas pageants
I've ever seen...

20
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,975
this is by far
the most recent.

21
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:31,852
For God's sake, Sam, I have
teenage girls playing the wise men.

22
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,412
-What did you expect?
-Teenage boys?

23
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,181
I thought they did fine.

24
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:40,895
It was the first Nativity where
Joseph stares at the wise men's tits.

25
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,497
Her name is Caitlin.

26
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:48,501
When I woke up on that long-ago day,
I was two-months pregnant with her.

27
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:52,300
I don't know who her father is.
I may never. I just know she's mine.

28
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,936
His name is Mr. Perkins.
My mom named him for me.

29
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:59,004
Caitlin, come help in the kitchen!

30
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,174
That's her.

31
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,080
-That's who?
-Her mom.

32
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,778
She's got amnesia.

33
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,818
Swear?

34
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,911
Swear.

35
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:07,916
Too weird.

36
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,290
Hello, girls.

37
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:13,452
Caitlin, come help me
in the kitchen.

38
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,790
Hurry up,
I forget where it is.

39
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,043
Raymond!

40
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,782
Catch you smoking, they'll never
find the body. Understand?

41
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:43,484
Yes, Ms. Caine.

42
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,648
Have a cookie.

43
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,830
As the year draws to a close...

44
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,936
I would like to share with you
just a few things about myself.

45
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:57,165
Things of which
I am especially proud.

46
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,239
First, I'm proud to say that...

47
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,173
I don't smoke...

48
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:03,505
I don't drink...

49
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,237
and I don't swear.

50
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:08,239
Oh, shit,
I do smoke and drink.

51
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,185
To our dear friends.

52
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:18,690
May the best of your past
be the worst of your future.

53
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,351
I'll drink to that.

54
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,194
Take a bow, my dear. Take a bow.
We got the mistletoe.

55
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,701
Eight years.

56
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:40,605
Except for my name,
all traces are lost.

57
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,946
I used to hire expensive detectives.
Now I use the cheap ones.

58
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,645
Doesn't seem to matter.
The woman I was...

59
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,986
the one I used to be,
she's gone.

60
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:50,719
I've kissed her goodnight.

61
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,693
Police! Don't move!

62
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,554
What the hell is this?

63
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,427
Don't give me attitude, sir.

64
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,266
You're assuming I won't shoot
your sorry ass.

65
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:07,071
When you make an assumption,
you make an "ass" of you and "umption."

66
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:11,604
I'm Sgt. Madigan, Vice,
and if you do cop a 'tude...

67
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:15,273
I will see to it you spend the next
10 years in prison getting ass-fucked.

68
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:18,215
If the case is thrown out
because my arrest was violent...

69
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:21,788
I will hire men to ass-fuck you
for the next ten years.

70
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:23,481
So if you're an ass-fucking fan...

71
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,752
go ahead and mouth off.

72
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:29,261
Meanwhile, you're under arrest
for the crime of prostitution.

73
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:30,621
Officer Dunleavy...

74
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,495
read him his rights.

75
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,559
-What?
-His rights.

76
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,436
You have the "remight"--

77
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,632
You have the right
to remain silent.

78
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,777
Anything you say and do...

79
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:43,641
will be held against you--

80
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,678
Please, listen, I got a wife.

81
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,179
I never.
This is the first time...

82
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,114
I've ever done this.
I swear!

83
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,778
Sir! Listen to me.

84
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:55,290
I can see from your choice here,
you're not a wealthy man.

85
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,258
Because of the damage
this arrest could do to you...

86
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,691
I think we might be able
to make an arrangement.

87
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:04,927
Oh, God!

88
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,867
Gotta stop using bums.

89
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,299
Forget that.

90
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:12,635
They looked like cops.
We pulled it off, didn't we?

91
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,365
It was embarrassing.

92
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:16,273
You want me to hire actors?

93
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:19,208
These guys are cheap.
They work for food.

94
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,441
When they puke,
is that a like a refund?

95
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:27,716
I'm pissing myself
you're so funny.

96
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:32,994
-What's this?
-I got movement on Samantha Caine.

97
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,057
Really?

98
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,722
No, I may have a lead on someone...

99
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,994
who rented Amnesia Chick
an apartment back in 1987.

100
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,400
They may still have
some of her stuff.

101
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,562
Get outta here.

102
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,900
Where'd that come from?

103
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,235
Lucky break.

104
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,574
Old lady died, and one of her
asshole grandkids found a credit card...

105
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:53,510
with the name Samantha Caine on it.

106
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,844
Tried to use it at Nordstroms.

107
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,848
Okay, here's what we do.

108
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,025
Get on the phone to Amnesia Chick.
Tell her we need more cash.

109
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,269
That was a really swell party.

110
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,031
Thanks again for the ride.

111
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:23,542
You and Hal have been together,
what, a couple of years?

112
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,776
How often do you two...

113
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:31,277
Stick our fingers in our hands and
pull them out? Every chance we get.

114
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:35,254
Earl, do me a favor? Every few words
blow bubbles and say "hic."

115
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:38,220
Goddamn it, I'm not drunk!

116
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,252
I'll prove it to you.

117
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,630
Come on.

118
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,529
Stop that!

119
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:47,930
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:48,489
And so much for the skydiving Santa
of Hutchinson County.

121
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:50,557
Meanwhile, WICC news...

122
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,822
journeyed to Honesdale, where Santa's
own Mrs. Kringle turned out...

123
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:57,329
to celebrate her hubby's
worldwide tour.

124
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,730
And after one look at her,
I'm thinking...

125
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,735
Santa got what he really wanted
this Christmas.

126
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:06,306
The parade included floats
and participants from four counties.

127
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,037
Everyone enjoyed themselves,
especially the young...

128
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,102
and the young at heart.

129
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:14,076
Gotta be fucking kidding!

130
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,305
No!

131
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:19,618
No fucking way!

132
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:21,689
It's impossible!

133
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,437
You rest up...

134
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,365
and I'll see you in the morning.

135
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,543
Sweet dreams.

136
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,307
I want a cigarette.

137
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:15,373
I don't smoke.

138
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,804
You used to.

139
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:25,150
See how easy it comes back?

140
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,255
I'm coming back.

141
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,914
You know that, don't you?

142
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,320
Name's Charly by the way.

143
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,422
You're going to love me.

144
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,872
This is the intergalactic slammer.
It's a jail.

145
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:50,034
This is the Borian dude.
Kind of like a dinosaur.

146
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:54,945
This is his escape chute. He's mean,
quick, and he don't take no shit.

147
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,276
He can shoot at the guards
with his arrow.

148
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,246
-Cool, huh?
-Todd.

149
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,557
Time for dinner.

150
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,857
Now.

151
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,562
Guess you better go in.

152
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,567
Hope you like the toy.

153
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:17,395
It's awesome.

154
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:22,741
Dad, Mom...
she gets weird.

155
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:26,406
Like on my birthday when you gave me
that Schwinn.

156
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:32,144
She called the bicycle store to see
if there'd been any robberies.

157
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:37,248
Tell her I don't steal
them locally, all right?

158
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,092
Sorry, but,
I can't take this.

159
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,394
You know how Mom will get.

160
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,439
Guess I'll see ya.

161
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:53,702
All right.

162
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:00,680
How do you like that?

163
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:10,285
-Yo, Trin, me. What's up?
-Ready to be happy?

164
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:13,525
Remember the landlady
I told you about?

165
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:15,857
The Caine woman was
her favorite tenant.

166
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,192
Then one day,
the tenant never comes home.

167
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:22,201
Old lady very sad. So sad she can't
throw away Amnesia Chick's shit.

168
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:25,363
It's pay dirt, Mitch.
Got an old postcard never mailed.

169
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,203
Woman telling everyone
she just got engaged.

170
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:30,268
Samantha's handwriting.
Perfect match.

171
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,713
She was engaged to some guy in Jersey.
No phone number, just an address.

172
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:35,816
Holy shit! Score!

173
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:37,976
That's worth time and a half.

174
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:41,054
Double. I made us look good.
Her other P.I.s couldn't find dick.

175
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:43,817
Course not.
Took a true dickhound like yourself.

176
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,484
Tell Ms. Caine
I'm coming to see her tonight.

177
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:01,705
Honey, you have an ETA
on that carrot?

178
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:03,569
Stow it.

179
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,375
Maybe you should just take it
with you to school.

180
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,841
You're killing me.
You're so funny.

181
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,086
Here.
Give me the knife.

182
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:15,348
No!

183
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:19,292
I'm going to cut this carrot,
and you're going to eat it and like it.

184
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,328
Piss off.

185
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:37,768
Hon?

186
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:40,545
Look, will you?

187
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,756
How the hell?

188
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,225
I used to do this.

189
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:55,886
I'm a chef.

190
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,398
Look what she's doing.

191
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:01,566
Give me something else.

192
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,398
Quick, anything!

193
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:05,637
-Tomato.
-Tomato.

194
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:09,733
Look.

195
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:12,881
-Look at this woman go. All right.
-More!

196
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:15,973
Pepper. Pepper!

197
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,118
Celery!

198
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:19,982
Look at this!

199
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,417
More!

200
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,989
Scallions!

201
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:27,386
One more tomato.

202
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,025
Look at this woman.
She's amazing!

203
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,008
Chefs do that.

204
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,944
Timothy, I know
you're gonna kill me.

205
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:55,283
Please use the gun,
not the knife

206
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,687
As a favor to me
I'm begging you.

207
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:03,792
Goddamn it, how can I tell the Feds
about the fucking "Honeymoon" thing?

208
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,259
I don't know
a fucking thing about it.

209
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,807
No, you don't.

210
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,709
I don't know a fucking thing.

211
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:23,184
You know, I can tell
when someone's lying to me.

212
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:29,046
What's so fucking important?

213
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,816
Remember your old colleague...

214
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,153
One-Eyed Jack?

215
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,817
He's doing 7-10 upstate.

216
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,396
Not anymore. He broke out.
Two days after seeing...

217
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:39,329
something on TV that "disturbed" him.

218
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:43,062
Yeah, "Baywatch Nights."
You want to get to the fucking point?

219
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:46,207
Under sedation, he said
Charly Baltimore's alive, sir.

220
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:51,744
Daedalus is concerned. He thought
you disposed of her eight years ago.

221
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:55,577
I know it's highly unlikely, but if she
were alive, she might be in contact...

222
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:57,241
with the old man
in Massachusetts.

223
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:59,076
Tap his phone.

224
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:03,422
Tell Daedalus I'm on my way.
Timothy, out.

225
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,605
I can't see Mr. Perkins.

226
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:25,874
He's there.
He's on the sled, see him?

227
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,538
He's watching you.

228
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,116
He's very excited.

229
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:32,083
That's better.

230
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:34,019
Ready to try it alone?

231
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,680
I want you to hold my hand.

232
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,059
Just pretend I am.

233
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,291
You can do it.
Piece of cake.

234
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:42,555
Here we go.

235
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,720
Ready?

236
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:46,732
-Mom, it won't work. Swear.
-Sure it will.

237
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:50,394
You're one of the X-men.
You're tough. Ready? Let go.

238
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:53,905
-3, 2, 1, go!
-Wait! I'm not ready!

239
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:55,065
Go!

240
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,212
Keep going!

241
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,318
I can't do it.

242
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,251
I want to go home.

243
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,983
I know you're afraid.
That's the whole point.

244
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,421
Can't you see that?

245
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:18,255
Stop being a little baby
and get up.

246
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,467
I can't skate anymore.
My wrist hurts.

247
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:32,503
Life is pain.

248
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,012
Get used to it.

249
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:38,783
You will skate
all the way to the shore, princess.

250
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:40,945
And you will not fall again.

251
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,458
Am I understood?

252
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:12,644
I'm just guessing, but...

253
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:16,318
this is a tree house.
I think you wanted a doghouse.

254
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:20,993
Little joke.

255
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:25,430
She said that her wrist hurt.

256
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:28,994
I didn't know it was fractured.

257
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,773
I don't remember...

258
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:44,012
what I said to her.

259
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:46,686
I can't remember.

260
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:55,694
No!

261
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:57,456
I'm not going to hurt you.

262
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,193
It's not me I'm worried about.

263
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:35,067
Evening, Charly.

264
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:36,462
Long time.

265
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:42,565
Get out!

266
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:46,069
I want my eye back, bitch!

267
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,165
Chefs do that.

268
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,284
Caitlin! Oh, my God!
We have to find Caitlin.

269
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,856
Slow down!
Your kid's okay.

270
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:38,151
She's in my car.

271
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:41,861
Jesus!
What the hell's going on here?

272
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,362
Freeze!

273
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,298
Don't hurt him!

274
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:46,627
Don't shoot!

275
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,792
Yeah, don't shoot!
Like she said!

276
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:51,138
Call an ambulance!

277
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:55,970
This man?
He's gonna...

278
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,613
help me find out some things.

279
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:00,537
So we'll be safe.

280
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:01,773
You understand?

281
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,211
When will you be back home?

282
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:08,319
Before you know it.
I swear.

283
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:10,813
Here.

284
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:14,325
I want you to keep a candle
burning in the window...

285
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:15,885
for me.

286
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,493
That's called "keeping a vigil."

287
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:24,171
That's to light my way home.

288
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:27,897
Here.

289
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,672
This is to my portable phone.

290
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:33,571
I keep it with me.

291
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:36,073
You call me anytime.

292
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:46,393
Why don't you keep this?

293
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:50,359
For luck.

294
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:53,359
Let's have Mr. Perkins wear it.

295
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:55,358
There.

296
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:58,094
See?

297
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,782
You do what you have to.

298
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,948
But, Sam...

299
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:19,889
the person you used to be...

300
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:22,287
whatever you find...

301
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:23,726
I'm not scared.

302
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,624
I never will be.
Not ever.

303
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:29,233
Thank you.

304
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:54,427
Mr. Perkins...

305
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:57,791
you lost one of your agents...

306
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,333
whose training included,
among other things...

307
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:03,596
counterassassination.

308
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:08,133
Now she turns up as belle
of the Christmas parade.

309
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:11,412
That information is two weeks old,
Mr. President.

310
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,940
To my knowledge...

311
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:14,945
Charlene Baltimore died...

312
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:18,517
in my employ.
Relic of the Cold War.

313
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:22,783
The kind of violent operative that has
since been eliminated from our ranks.

314
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:24,449
You recruited this woman?

315
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:27,819
For Chapter, sir.

316
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:29,524
Her father was...

317
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:30,926
a friend of mine.

318
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,499
Stop, I don't want
to hear that stuff.

319
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:35,693
The "intelligence" community.

320
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,360
You people are unbelievable.

321
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,530
You dump a mess like this
in my lap...

322
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:43,041
and then you come whining to me,
"Where's our funding?"

323
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:45,202
I'll tell you where it is.

324
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,644
Can you say, "health care"?

325
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,617
I'm not talking 'bout moving in

326
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,309
And I don't want

327
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,546
To change your life

328
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:56,980
But there's a warm wind

329
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,819
Blowing the stars around

330
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:02,394
And I'd really love to see you tonight

331
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:06,657
I'm not talking 'bout the linen

332
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:09,998
-And I don't want to change your life
-"Moving in."

333
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,160
What?

334
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,071
It's, uh--

335
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:17,670
The song's not about linen.

336
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,338
Yeah, whatever.

337
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:20,676
So, you cold?

338
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:23,409
-Yeah, freezing.
-Turn on the heat.

339
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:26,082
It doesn't work,
but it makes a very annoying noise.

340
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:29,280
-Distracts from the cold.
-I'll pass, thanks.

341
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:35,491
Who knew I had an old fiancé?

342
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:40,799
And now we're just going
to pay a surprise visit?

343
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:47,033
There are no bells or whistles
because I don't remember any of this.

344
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,609
That's too bad. That's the cream
of the crop, believe me.

345
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,271
I forgot to ask.

346
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:55,279
Why is it that you got so far?

347
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,778
Say what?

348
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:58,944
Well, I mean...

349
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:02,121
you seem kind of low-rent.

350
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:03,617
No offense.

351
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:06,791
None taken.
Really, I was about to--

352
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,389
Shit!

353
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:17,733
Are you okay?

354
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,567
Is your neck all right?
You don't have whiplash?

355
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:21,731
What?

356
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:23,802
I'm just...

357
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:29,149
Since you almost ran us off the road,
I'm wondering what it is...

358
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:32,081
that you get
from an experience like that?

359
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:35,313
Don't get me wrong.
I'm sure it's enriching in some way...

360
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,291
and I know she was probably moved by
some asshole screaming out the window.

361
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:44,556
I didn't hang out the window and yell.
I checked out her form, okay?

362
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:49,099
If it's any consolation,
you got her beat hands down.

363
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:50,668
Really?

364
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,329
Yeah, from the neck up.

365
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:54,935
This is exciting.

366
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:57,600
You saw her tits.
It's so neat.

367
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,940
Look, it's a guy thing,
all right?

368
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,944
Now you got a nice body
and all...

369
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:05,279
but those, you could see them
coming around the corner.

370
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:07,648
You got time
to comb your hair. Shit.

371
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:12,521
What's that?

372
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:15,486
Charly was my name in the dream.

373
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:18,765
"To Charly.
Love, Nathan"

374
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,792
"Nathan J. Waldman, Ph.D."

375
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:22,869
All right, let's find a phone.

376
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:24,035
Found one.

377
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:25,765
Find his number.

378
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,908
-Take the stand.
-I got it. Now what'll I do with it?

379
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,245
Sit down!

380
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,092
Alice, please.

381
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,755
Your dog, Alice.

382
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,663
It and my appetite
are mutually exclusive.

383
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,669
-What's wrong with the dog?
-It's simple.

384
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,933
He's been licking his asshole
for the last three hours.

385
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,169
I submit that there's nothing there
worth more than an hour's attention.

386
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:07,439
And I think that whatever
he's attempting to dislodge...

387
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,446
is either gone for good...

388
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,346
or there to stay.

389
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:13,786
Wouldn't you agree?

390
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,126
Mr. Waldman...

391
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:28,699
I got your number from a realtor...

392
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,964
in Massachusetts,
and I'd just like to speak to you.

393
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,471
Who is this?

394
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,942
You tell me, Mr. Waldman.

395
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,776
My full name, please?

396
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,545
God!

397
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:45,644
It's really you.

398
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,649
"Chapter"...

399
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:51,851
they think you're dead.

400
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:54,451
-My full name, please!
-You don't know your name?

401
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:58,054
Your full name...

402
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:01,326
is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.

403
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:06,199
Don't talk, just listen.
You could be in danger, understand?

404
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:07,669
We must meet.

405
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,310
We must meet straightaway.
Where are you now?

406
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:13,179
In Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

407
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,747
We'll meet halfway.

408
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:18,082
There's a town in New Jersey,
Chesterman.

409
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,511
Tomorrow.

410
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,348
Central train station...

411
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,921
at 11 a.m.

412
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:24,349
Meet me.

413
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,689
I'll tell you everything.

414
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,028
Signal Daedalus.

415
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,328
We got her.

416
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:42,042
-Curry Brand cat food.
-Could you spell that, please?

417
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,438
Curry Brand.

418
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:45,340
All this shit is the same anyway.

419
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,404
Yeah? You don't happen
to have a cat?

420
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:49,473
What do I need a cat for?
I got a girl.

421
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:51,608
Yeah, pussy's pussy.

422
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:05,960
-Mom, can I stay up for "Rugrats"?
-What, sweetie?

423
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,291
"Rugrats."
I want to stay up.

424
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:10,968
Yes, you can stay up for "Rugrats."

425
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,971
I'm gonna go now.

426
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:14,400
All right.

427
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,800
-Mommy loves you.
-I love you too.

428
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:18,240
Big kiss.

429
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,903
-Bye, Mommy.
-Good night.

430
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:24,750
Put my glasses in my pocket

431
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:29,316
Put the jacket on the chair

432
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:40,423
I sing the things I do,
so I won't forget.

433
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:41,893
Like...

434
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,004
Turning off the downstairs' light

435
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,000
Before I go to bed at night

436
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:55,440
Shit.

437
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:57,344
I can't take this...

438
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,452
fucking waiting.

439
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,181
Excuse me.

440
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,515
Do you normally curse this much?

441
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,787
What are you, a Mormon?

442
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:12,298
Yes, that's why I just smoked
a pack of Newports...

443
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,628
and drank three vodka tonics.
What I'm saying is...

444
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,794
back when we first met
you were all like...

445
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,270
"Oh, phooey!
I burned the darn muffins."

446
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:21,974
Now, you go into a bar...

447
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:26,204
ten minutes later sailors come
running out. What up with that?

448
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,304
Thanks for sharing.

449
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,348
Mind your own damn business.

450
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:33,819
While you're at it,
if you're going to smoke inside...

451
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,478
close the damn door.

452
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,981
I heard you scream--

453
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,342
Shit!

454
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:52,514
Henessey...

455
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:56,959
I didn't know about the gun.
I wasn't hiding things. I swear.

456
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,359
-Goddamn it, stop walking!
-I'm going home!

457
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:00,966
And so are you!

458
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,633
I paid you!

459
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,868
Well, here!
Take your money!

460
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,131
Take it!

461
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,871
I can't go home.

462
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:13,343
Until I know why that man tried
to kill me, I'm trapped.

463
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:17,381
It's like I'm in a goddamn prison!
Do you know how that feels?

464
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,382
Yeah, I know exactly
what that's like!

465
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:23,045
Four years inside.
Marion, Illinois.

466
00:37:23,224 --> 00:37:24,816
A real shithole!

467
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,790
And I'm not going back!

468
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,753
Seven years ago
I was an Atlanta cop.

469
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,751
Me and my partner handled
a lot of impounded shit.

470
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:02,528
That motherfucker hated me.

471
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,927
I forget why, but he did.

472
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,761
On one weekend...

473
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,925
when he was conveniently away...

474
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:12,038
some bonds disappeared
from his office.

475
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:17,202
Lo and behold, when my brothers in blue
responded to an anonymous tip...

476
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,711
you'll never guess what they found
sitting in my closet.

477
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:22,946
The bonds.

478
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,411
Your partner put them there.

479
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:26,385
No, I did.

480
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,454
I stole the damn things.

481
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:41,231
I never did one thing right
in my life. You know that?

482
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,731
Not one.

483
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:45,302
That takes skill.

484
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:00,415
You just missed our exit.

485
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,485
Give me back my money.

486
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:05,090
Oh, so you're--

487
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,284
I'm taking you
to the train station, yes.

488
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,153
To meet Mr. Waldman.

489
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,661
Here you go.
Merry Christmas.

490
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:13,163
Bah humbug.

491
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:15,427
Look out the window.
Shut up.

492
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:38,788
You know we're about
ten minutes early.

493
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:46,859
I've got a bad feeling about this.

494
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,881
Put my keys in my left pocket

495
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,052
-Gun in the right-hand side
-It makes a bulge you can see.

496
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:09,681
I should stick it in my pants
and shoot my damn dick off?

497
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:11,247
Now you're a sharpshooter?

498
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:21,034
Going to shake hands with the man

499
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,335
-How you doing?
-Hi.

500
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,402
It's for you.

501
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,505
Another in a long line of...

502
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,909
bad personal investments.

503
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:38,347
-Excuse me?
-Just saw the ring on your finger.

504
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,194
Do I know you from somewhere?

505
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,254
Back up.
Total pickup line.

506
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:53,232
Forget I said it.
I take it back.

507
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,595
Thank you for the beer, but...

508
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:57,202
I don't know you, no.

509
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,939
No, you don't.

510
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:05,177
I can tell when someone's...

511
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:09,605
lying to me.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

512
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,211
Yours?

513
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:15,116
Who's your boyfriend?

514
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,381
Some guy.

515
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,726
Okay, people,
I got what I need.

516
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,624
Move in. Do them both.

517
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,531
That man walking this way.

518
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:27,726
Is that him?

519
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:29,525
I think so.

520
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:45,747
Gun!

521
00:41:58,132 --> 00:41:59,429
Jesus wept!

522
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,256
Let's go!

523
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,596
We got to get to the car.
This way!

524
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,829
Come on!

525
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:08,335
Go! Go!
No! Come on!

526
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:14,073
No, this way!

527
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:39,868
Move it!

528
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,606
Come on, Ms. Caine!
Come on!

529
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,640
Oh, shit!

530
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,380
Take this! I got three shots left
in this revolver.

531
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:57,387
You got a full clip.
Just point...

532
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,458
and spray. Okay?

533
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,355
Ready?
And...

534
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:04,621
Fuck it!
Run for your life!

535
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,896
There's no way out!

536
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,840
-Jump!
-That's a three-story drop!

537
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,342
Are you crazy?

538
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,471
-What happened?
-I saved your ass. It was great!

539
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,443
We've got to get to the car!

540
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:53,545
This way.
Come on!

541
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,011
Get down!

542
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:56,943
Get down!

543
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,121
Get in, both of you!

544
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:08,226
Now!

545
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:09,760
I said now!

546
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,232
We jumped out of a building!

547
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,137
Yes, it was very exciting.
Tomorrow we go to the zoo.

548
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,572
You're Waldman.

549
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:28,046
No, I'm the Hill Brothers bean buyer.
Who else would I be? Hang on.

550
00:44:30,484 --> 00:44:32,748
If you want me to talk
in front of him, you may be asked...

551
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,251
to kill him later.

552
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,913
It works for me. Your call.
Fire out the back if you have to.

553
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:41,253
-Old man, how many of those you got?
-Three.

554
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,157
One shoulder, one hip and one here...

555
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,763
right next to Mr. Wally.

556
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,662
Most patdowns never reveal it as
an agent's often reluctant to feel up...

557
00:44:47,835 --> 00:44:48,927
another man's groin.

558
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,297
Other questions?

559
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:52,271
What's the weather like
on your planet?

560
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,430
Charlene, my darling.

561
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,599
My name is Samantha,
Samantha Caine.

562
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,837
No, forget all that.
The schoolteacher business...

563
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:02,777
was your cover.
Do you hear me, Charly?

564
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,113
Your memory was gone.
You bought your own cover.

565
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,947
It was a fantasy for Christ's sake!

566
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,851
Samantha Caine never existed.

567
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:11,786
You wrote the bloody thing!

568
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,621
No, it's not a fantasy.
I'm in the goddamn P.T.A.!

569
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,023
Then quit!

570
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:18,957
You're an assassin working
for the United States Government.

571
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,131
I ought to know.

572
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:22,699
I trained you.

573
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:27,437
Get the fuck out of here!

574
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,701
Assassin!

575
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:33,674
Your father was...

576
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:37,007
in the Royal Irish Rangers,
assigned to Belfast.

577
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,643
After he was murdered there
in 1975...

578
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:44,018
his friend, Perkins, adopted you,
or perhaps I should say...

579
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,321
recruited you,
to work for Chapter...

580
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:50,159
a blackbag operation working
from the U.S. State Department.

581
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,661
You getting this?

582
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,731
October, 1988, you were assigned...

583
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:56,597
to take out a munitions dealer
named Daedalus...

584
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,604
and his hired enforcer, Timothy.

585
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,037
You failed
to complete your mission...

586
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:03,565
electing instead to die, of all things,
despite clear orders to the contrary.

587
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:07,339
Dead you remain.
Until without preamble...

588
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:11,177
you reemerge eight years later
and a good deal frumpier.

589
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:17,746
Anyhow, I think we can
safely assume...

590
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,683
that Daedalus is aware
of your resurrection...

591
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,026
and attempting to reverse it.

592
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:27,531
He'll be watching the police, hospitals.
We must stay away, understand?

593
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,225
Mr. Henessey, can I help you?

594
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:31,098
Henessey, what is it?

595
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:33,501
-It's a setup. It's got to be.
-Put that down.

596
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:36,439
This is not an episode of television.

597
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,544
Those guys
back at the train station.

598
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:43,445
How'd they know we'd be there?
lmpossible! Unless Waldman told them.

599
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,777
-I did nothing of the kind.
-They tapped your phone.

600
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:47,544
I know it sounds preposterous.

601
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,279
Just happen to know we'd be calling?

602
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:51,586
-Get in the car.
-All right.

603
00:46:51,658 --> 00:46:53,216
See here, my friend.

604
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:55,517
Oh, shit!

605
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:02,362
Get in the car, now!

606
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,240
How about it? You believe
any of the crap that guy said?

607
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,313
Well... no.

608
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:17,313
That guy was a lunatic.

609
00:47:17,484 --> 00:47:19,418
We got to talk to someone else.

610
00:47:19,486 --> 00:47:21,351
You thinking what I'm thinking?

611
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,254
I hope not because I'm thinking
how much my balls hurt.

612
00:47:24,491 --> 00:47:26,254
But if you're talking
about the postcard...

613
00:47:26,326 --> 00:47:28,851
I don't think I want to meet
any more of your old friends.

614
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,692
We have no choice.

615
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,164
We need some answers,
or we're gonna die.

616
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,859
I saw you from the road.

617
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,967
I think your name is Luke...

618
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,837
and I think
I was going to marry you.

619
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:27,717
Oh, baby!

620
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:30,220
Oh, man.

621
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:32,881
Luke.

622
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,728
She's my only daughter...

623
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:38,694
and I don't quite trust you yet.

624
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:43,664
So what about it?

625
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:47,068
-You and Mr. Outdoors bump pelvises?
-It's possible.

626
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,573
And how about your daughter?
What's her name, Cathead?

627
00:48:50,744 --> 00:48:53,907
-Caitlin.
-You think he might be the father?

628
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:58,848
I don't know. But all these little
details about him are coming back.

629
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,681
-I'm remembering things.
-Like what?

630
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,756
Is this "America's Funniest
Practical Videos" or something?

631
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:07,917
Keep your fucking hands
where I can see them!

632
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,561
I had an itch.

633
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,530
Charly, this is crazy.

634
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,531
You and me, we were like...

635
00:49:19,773 --> 00:49:22,401
Don't you remember?
Hell, you pursued me.

636
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,706
I know that he has a pin in his leg.
Car accident.

637
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,609
I know he cuts his own hair.

638
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:30,047
He doesn't own a TV.

639
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,708
He sits down when he pees.

640
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,615
That's enough.
I'm getting a boner.

641
00:49:34,788 --> 00:49:38,781
I know this man.
I must have been seeing him.

642
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:40,426
Let me talk to him.

643
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:41,526
Alone.

644
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:46,894
I'm sorry.

645
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,557
Do you want to take a walk?

646
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,566
Got me a handgun

647
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,308
Got a rifle too

648
00:50:03,316 --> 00:50:05,409
Anybody fuck with Mitch

649
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,076
He know just what to do

650
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:09,811
'Cause I'm a

651
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,581
Bad motherfucker

652
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,154
Stay quiet
and drop the rifle.

653
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,497
How'd you find us?

654
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,661
There may be many reasons
not to kill you...

655
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:28,105
but among them is not that
you'll be missed by NASA.

656
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,667
I found the address
in your coat.

657
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,842
Here. Between the address
of a topless bar...

658
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:37,677
and a picture of what looks
like a man's penis.

659
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:39,944
That's a duck, not a dick.

660
00:50:41,188 --> 00:50:43,349
The man she's with.
Who is he?

661
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:46,014
Her former fiancé.
His name's Luke.

662
00:50:46,193 --> 00:50:49,356
Former fiancé? That's ridiculous.
She was never engaged.

663
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:54,262
I just went through this with her.
She knows how the man pees.

664
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,299
Look at him.
He's cool.

665
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,464
Former fiancé.

666
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,539
-Why on earth would she think that?
-We found a note.

667
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,039
It's in her handwriting.

668
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,041
-She saw a note?
-Who are you, William Shatner?

669
00:51:05,178 --> 00:51:06,509
Calm down.

670
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,775
-Yeah, a note to her uncle.
-Max?

671
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:11,942
Uncle Max!

672
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,313
That's the agency,
you blithering idiot!

673
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:17,652
And the word "engaged" means
she's locked on to target. Fuck!

674
00:51:17,724 --> 00:51:19,715
-Not a former lover but a target?
-Her target, yes!

675
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:22,555
She knows things because she studied
the bastard to assassinate him.

676
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:23,694
Shit!

677
00:51:23,764 --> 00:51:26,289
-Sam!
-Charly!

678
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:27,697
He's Daedalus!

679
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:30,931
Get out of there!
It's him!

680
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:06,636
Well, howdy there.

681
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:09,671
If it isn't the forgetful spy.
How you feeling?

682
00:52:11,011 --> 00:52:12,740
You're the man from the bar.

683
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:15,145
Will you look at her.
She's not faking it.

684
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,376
She doesn't know me from Adam.

685
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,079
It's not that I don't trust
my compadre here, Major Baltimore.

686
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:24,823
In fact, I had every confidence
that your amnesia was genuine.

687
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:27,015
Until you showed up here.

688
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,588
You follow?

689
00:52:29,362 --> 00:52:33,924
I'm trying to pull off
the biggest job of my career...

690
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:35,857
so, darling,
I have to know...

691
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:39,033
how much about me
you really remember.

692
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:41,430
And who you've told.

693
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:45,041
I haven't told a soul.
I swear.

694
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:47,202
We'll soon know.

695
00:52:50,217 --> 00:52:52,708
What is this?
Some kind of torture thing?

696
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:54,117
Torture, yes.

697
00:52:54,855 --> 00:52:57,289
A woman's face never looks...

698
00:52:57,457 --> 00:53:00,051
quite so beautiful
as when it's distended in pain.

699
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:01,555
Witness...

700
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:03,389
the beauty of childbirth.

701
00:53:03,563 --> 00:53:05,360
Untie me,
and I'll make any face you want.

702
00:53:05,532 --> 00:53:06,794
Let's not and say we did.

703
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,401
Take a deep breath.

704
00:53:09,636 --> 00:53:11,103
We're gonna do the torture thing.

705
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:50,107
Operation Honeymoon
is on schedule.

706
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:52,006
I've secured the tanker.

707
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:54,170
Now I just got to make the soup.

708
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:56,679
I'll follow as soon as
I'm done here.

709
00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:01,943
Ten minutes in this cold water,
she'll be insane or dead.

710
00:54:02,122 --> 00:54:04,613
Five minutes.
She'll tell me everything I need.

711
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,473
That's right.
Take in all the air you can.

712
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:30,146
If you need to vomit,
do it now.

713
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:31,543
So you...

714
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,843
don't remember anything...

715
00:54:34,154 --> 00:54:35,382
at all?

716
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:38,116
Best night of your fucking life.

717
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:41,387
I say drown the wench.

718
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:44,696
Talk to me, Major.

719
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:46,659
Is my identity safe?

720
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,165
My name is Samantha Caine.

721
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:53,671
Answer the question.

722
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:56,072
Who knows about me?

723
00:54:56,242 --> 00:54:57,231
Nobody!

724
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,672
Fuck you!

725
00:55:00,013 --> 00:55:01,310
Fuck you!

726
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,909
I hate to see you like this, Charly.

727
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,656
I heard you were
a hell of a spy once.

728
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:15,022
Watch your back.

729
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:17,491
I'm not done yet.

730
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:18,653
Goodnight.

731
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:50,452
Okay, I'll signal Daedalus.
Your money will be waiting.

732
00:55:51,898 --> 00:55:53,024
Jack...

733
00:55:56,469 --> 00:55:58,061
do yourself a favor, man.

734
00:55:58,238 --> 00:55:59,899
Don't let her looks fool you.

735
00:56:00,073 --> 00:56:02,132
She's the fucking Energizer Bunny.

736
00:56:02,308 --> 00:56:04,299
Just do her and dump her.

737
00:56:04,477 --> 00:56:08,641
Don't get cute and play doctor first.
I made that mistake.

738
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:10,043
Nearly killed me.

739
00:56:35,175 --> 00:56:36,608
Little fucker.

740
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:03,533
Daedalus...

741
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:06,271
I'll make you a deal.

742
00:57:06,973 --> 00:57:08,702
Let me go now...

743
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:11,637
and I'll leave you
the use of your legs.

744
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,141
Why have you resurfaced?

745
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:19,878
Is it Operation Honeymoon?
Is that it?

746
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:21,876
Who sent you?

747
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,149
Why are you here?

748
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,816
I let you touch me, cowboy.

749
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:32,055
I think I need a bath.

750
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:13,763
Samantha, please.

751
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:15,492
Who's Samantha?

752
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:19,495
Where's Henessey?

753
01:01:43,883 --> 01:01:45,441
Hey, Mitch!

754
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:49,882
You're awake.

755
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,926
You're seeping.

756
01:01:58,398 --> 01:01:59,296
Here...

757
01:01:59,732 --> 01:02:00,960
Iook at this.

758
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:04,564
Oh, shit!

759
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:07,903
That hurt like shit.

760
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:11,236
I know.
That's why I distracted you first.

761
01:02:11,411 --> 01:02:13,436
Same principle
as deflowering virgins.

762
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,278
What?
Virgins? What?

763
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:19,577
I read it in this Harold Robbins' book.
The guy bites her on the ear.

764
01:02:19,752 --> 01:02:21,913
Distracts from the pain.
Ever try that?

765
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:26,091
No, I sock them in the jaw and yell,
"Pop goes the weasel."

766
01:02:26,426 --> 01:02:27,757
Who the fuck are you?

767
01:02:27,927 --> 01:02:30,487
Name's Charly, the spy.

768
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,263
Nice to meet you.

769
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,228
Drink?

770
01:02:38,905 --> 01:02:43,137
As you can see, things are still crazy,
but the sheriff has told me this:

771
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:45,300
There have been gunshots--

772
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,145
Okay, let's say I buy it.

773
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:52,009
You are a trained killer.

774
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:58,113
I can't even say that
with a straight face.

775
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,016
So, Samantha, she...

776
01:03:00,092 --> 01:03:01,957
Never really existed.

777
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,622
Like Nathan said.
She was a total fabrication.

778
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:06,287
I made her up.

779
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:10,397
So now she's just gone?

780
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,665
-Forever and ever?
-Thank God!

781
01:03:12,972 --> 01:03:15,304
Look at my inordinately large ass.

782
01:03:15,475 --> 01:03:17,204
Look what she did to me.

783
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,704
Pretty convincing act.

784
01:03:20,012 --> 01:03:21,343
I guess.

785
01:03:21,647 --> 01:03:22,614
You know...

786
01:03:22,815 --> 01:03:25,477
her personality had to come
from somewhere.

787
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:26,845
Change the subject.

788
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,447
Better yet.
Bring me that bottle.

789
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,360
Here you go.
Drink up.

790
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,592
So what's next?

791
01:03:39,665 --> 01:03:42,225
-What do we do now?
-I contact Chapter.

792
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,664
I come in for debriefing.
Bury the last eight years.

793
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:48,329
Get back to work.

794
01:03:48,508 --> 01:03:49,839
Cheers!

795
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:54,676
Would you believe it, Harry?

796
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,710
We got an appropriations review
in three weeks...

797
01:03:58,784 --> 01:04:01,617
and now the President wants to know
how I managed to lose an agent.

798
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:04,418
Yes, sir, you have a call
on line three, sir.

799
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,852
You going to tell me who it is?

800
01:04:06,025 --> 01:04:07,583
Charly Baltimore, sir.

801
01:04:10,363 --> 01:04:11,694
Run a trace.

802
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,096
This is Mr. Perkins.

803
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,729
Turn on the TV.
Farm in New Jersey. Seven dead.

804
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,275
Good Lord, girl, we've been
looking all over for you.

805
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,777
I got a photo of you
in a Christmas parade.

806
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,381
What the hell is happening?

807
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:31,881
Don't be stupid.

808
01:04:32,385 --> 01:04:34,216
I completed my assignment.

809
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,778
You mean Daedalus?

810
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,117
I shot him.
He's pretty much dead.

811
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,227
Actually I would have
done it earlier, say in '92...

812
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:44,761
but I was baking.
Don't ask.

813
01:04:45,064 --> 01:04:46,429
I want to come in.

814
01:04:46,899 --> 01:04:48,059
Sure.

815
01:04:48,234 --> 01:04:49,565
Of course.

816
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,437
Let me direct you
to a safe house.

817
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:53,961
Forget it.

818
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,732
We play it my way.

819
01:04:55,908 --> 01:04:58,308
You want me back, then you stay away.
I'll call you.

820
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,308
Those are the rules, understand?

821
01:05:02,582 --> 01:05:03,947
Shit!

822
01:05:09,755 --> 01:05:11,313
Did you hear that?

823
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,253
If she got to Daedalus...

824
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:15,621
she could know
about Honeymoon.

825
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:19,723
She might know that old targets
are now your new best friends.

826
01:05:19,899 --> 01:05:21,457
That could be trouble.

827
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:22,926
Goddamn you.

828
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:25,935
There were weapons on that farm.
She's armed.

829
01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:27,595
Stop having kittens.

830
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:32,506
You're the head of a major spy network,
and you have a tendency to whine.

831
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:35,613
She could compromise
this entire operation.

832
01:05:35,781 --> 01:05:37,681
We have 24 hours.

833
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,784
We find her...

834
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,150
and we kill her.

835
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:44,582
Do whatever it takes
but be careful.

836
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,456
If it gets out
you're working for me...

837
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,926
I'll be grabbing my ankles
on the White House lawn.

838
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:53,626
The lady's wacked. She's lost it.
I gotta get out of here.

839
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,189
I need you to meet me.

840
01:05:55,334 --> 01:05:59,737
I'll sneak out to this phone and
call you at midnight with the details.

841
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,808
All right, Sam,
what did that accomplish?

842
01:06:03,976 --> 01:06:06,877
I'm testing our boy Perkins.
Got a light?

843
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:10,306
I don't really trust him.

844
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:11,878
Come again?

845
01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:15,647
Little experiment.

846
01:06:16,155 --> 01:06:19,318
If he was looking for me
in Pennsylvania, he tapped your office.

847
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:21,653
You mean
he just traced that call?

848
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,953
Come midnight,
you hang by the phone.

849
01:06:23,996 --> 01:06:25,987
If he wants to erase me...

850
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:29,057
he'll send someone to kidnap
and torture you for my whereabouts.

851
01:06:29,168 --> 01:06:31,659
In which case, hey,
I don't trust him.

852
01:06:31,937 --> 01:06:33,871
No. Time out.

853
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:50,914
I haven't had a date
in eight years, Mitch.

854
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,156
Is this a fun date?
