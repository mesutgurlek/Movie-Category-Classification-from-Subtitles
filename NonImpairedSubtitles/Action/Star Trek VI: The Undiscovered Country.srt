1
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,939
Stardate 9521.6.

2
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:41,143
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.

3
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,181
After three years I've concluded my first
assignment as master of this vessel -

4
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,194
- cataloguing gaseous planetary
anomalies in Beta Quadrant.

5
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,428
We're heading home
under full impulse power.

6
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,298
I'm pleased to report that ship and
crew have functioned well.

7
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,840
According to this, we've completed
our survey of the entire sector.

8
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,214
I have an energy wave at
240 degrees mark six port.

9
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,291
Visual!

10
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,826
My... God!

11
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,357
Shields. Shields!

12
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,410
She's not answering her helm.

13
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,515
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.

14
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,214
Go to impulse power.

15
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,556
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.

16
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,232
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.

17
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,109
The sub-space shock-wave
originated at bearing 323.75.

18
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:19,581
Location... It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.

19
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,779
Praxis is their
key energy production facility.

20
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:30,457
Send to Klingon High Command. "This
is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."

21
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,259
"We have monitored
a large explosion in your sector."

22
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,801
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.

23
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,805
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...

24
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,772
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.

25
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,378
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.

26
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,216
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.

27
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,881
Captain, I'm getting a message
from Praxis.

28
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,220
Let's have it.

29
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,302
This is Brigadier Kerla,
speaking for the High Command.

30
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,970
There has been an incident on Praxis.

31
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:27,916
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.

32
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:34,515
Obey treaty stipulations
and remain outside the Neutral Zone.

33
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,527
This transmission ends now.

34
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,334
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?

35
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,097
Are you kidding?

36
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:55,344
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.

37
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,415
That suits me. I just bought a boat.

38
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,417
I'm supposed to be chairing
a seminar at the Academy.

39
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,648
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?

40
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:10,023
Captain Sulu?
On assignment. Where's Spock?

41
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,098
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.

42
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,042
As you were.

43
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,945
I'll break
this information down succinctly.

44
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,559
The Klingon empire
has 50 years of life left.

45
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:47,262
For full details, I'm turning this briefing
over to the Federation Special Envoy.

46
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,241
Good morning.

47
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:07,546
Two months ago a Federation Starship
monitored an explosion on Praxis.

48
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,487
We believe it was caused by over-mining
and insufficient safety precautions.

49
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,458
The moon's decimation means
a deadly pollution of their ozone.

50
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,692
They will have depleted
their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.

51
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,769
Due to their enormous military budget -

52
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:30,603
- the Klingon economy doesn't have the
resources to combat this catastrophe.

53
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,371
Last month, at the behest of
the Vulcan Ambassador, -

54
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:40,508
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon,
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.

55
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,452
He proposes to
commence negotiations at once.

56
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,491
Negotiations for what?

57
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,460
The dismantling of our space stations
and bases along the Neutral Zone.

58
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:57,797
An end to 70 years of hostility,
which the Klingons can no longer afford.

59
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,601
Bill, are we talking about
mothballing the Starfleet?

60
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,303
Our exploration and scientific programs
would be unaffected, but...

61
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,845
I must protest!

62
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:13,281
To offer Klingons safe haven
within Federation space is suicide.

63
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,319
Klingons would become
the alien trash of the galaxy.

64
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,252
If we dismantle the fleet, -

65
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:22,588
- we'd be defenceless before
an aggressive species on our territory.

66
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,493
The opportunity here is
to bring them to their knees.

67
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,497
Then we'll be in a better position
to dictate terms.

68
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,437
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?

69
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,704
The Klingons
have never been trustworthy.

70
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,111
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.

71
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,617
It is imperative that we act now
to support the Gorkon initiative, -

72
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,053
- lest more conservative elements
persuade his empire -

73
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,716
- that it's better to attempt
a military solution and die fighting.

74
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,228
You, Captain Kirk,
are to be our first olive branch.

75
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,033
We are to rendezvous with the vessel
which is bringing Gorkon to Earth -

76
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,072
- and to escort him safely through
Federation space.

77
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,970
Me?

78
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:16,911
There are Klingons who feel the same
about the peace treaty as yourself, -

79
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,712
- but they'll think twice about attacking
the Enterprise under your command.

80
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,219
I have personally vouched for you
in this matter.

81
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,055
You have personally vouched...?

82
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:33,797
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon
full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.

83
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:38,062
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business...

84
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:42,674
...I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

85
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,606
I remind you this meeting is classified.

86
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:56,512
I don't know whether to
congratulate you or not, Jim.

87
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,816
I wouldn't.

88
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,019
We volunteered?

89
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:09,190
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."

90
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,201
How could you vouch for me?

91
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:18,275
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...

92
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:23,882
I know your father is the Vulcan
Ambassador, but you know how I feel.

93
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,179
- They're animals.
- Jim...

94
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:33,491
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them! Don't trust them.

95
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,856
- They're dying.
- Let them die.

96
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:45,201
Has it occurred to you that this crew is
due to stand down in three months?

97
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,033
We've done our bit for king and country.

98
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,965
You should have trusted me.

99
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,985
Control, this is S-D 103,
approach to Space dock. Over.

100
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:08,753
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk
and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.

101
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,360
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were. Lieutenant...?

102
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:22,235
Val'eris, sir. We were told you needed
a helmsman, so I volunteered.

103
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,172
It is agreeable to see you again.

104
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,872
She was the first Vulcan to graduate
at the top of her class at the Academy.

105
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,382
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.

106
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,076
She's a Vulcan, alright.

107
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,247
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.

108
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,589
- Scotty? Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.

109
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,596
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.

110
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,461
Control tower reading, sir.

111
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:53,435
Control, this is Enterprise
requesting permission to depart.

112
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:58,475
This is Control. Permission to depart
granted. 30 seconds for port gates.

113
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:03,104
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.

114
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,149
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.

115
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,685
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.

116
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:16,556
Captain, regulations specify
thrusters only while in space dock.

117
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,090
Jim...

118
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,632
You heard the order, Lieutenant.

119
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,598
Aye, sir.

120
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:05,007
Captain's log. Stardate 9522.6.

121
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,876
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

122
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,480
I can never forgive them for
the death of my boy.

123
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:26,427
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon
High Council to a peace summit -

124
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,159
- is problematic, at best.

125
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:37,341
Spock says this could be an historic
occasion. I'd like to believe him.

126
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:42,105
But how on Earth can history get past
people like me?

127
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,510
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.

128
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:53,056
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.

129
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:01,893
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.

130
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,636
You piloted well out of space dock,
Lieutenant.

131
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,438
I've always wanted to try that.

132
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,256
You've done well, Val'eris.

133
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:32,489
As your sponsor at the Academy I've
followed your career with satisfaction.

134
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,193
And as a Vulcan,
you have exceeded my expectations.

135
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,332
I do not understand this representation.

136
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,171
It's a depiction
from ancient Earth mythology.

137
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,813
"The expulsion from Paradise."

138
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:55,250
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.

139
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,728
It is of endings that I wish to speak.

140
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,325
Sir, I address you
as a kindred intellect.

141
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,203
Do you not recognise...

142
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,172
...that a turning point has been reached
in the affairs of the Federation?

143
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:25,079
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.

144
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,448
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.

145
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:36,420
- Is that logical? Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.

146
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:43,398
Logic is the beginning of wisdom,
Val'eris. Not the end.

147
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:50,273
This will be my final voyage on board
this vessel as a member of her crew.

148
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,474
Nature abhors a vacuum.

149
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,276
I intend you to replace me.

150
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,556
I could only succeed you, sir.

151
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,100
Now hear this.
All officers to the bridge.

152
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,570
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.

153
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,319
Captain on the bridge!

154
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,665
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?

155
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,712
I've never been this close.

156
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,111
The Chancellor is undoubtedly
awaiting our signal.

157
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,292
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.

158
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,763
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.

159
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,869
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.

160
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,835
Channel is open, Captain.

161
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:32,306
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.

162
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:38,644
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.

163
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:48,191
We've been ordered to escort you
to your meeting on Earth.

164
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,918
Thank you.

165
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:56,262
Would you and your party care to dine
this evening aboard the Enterprise -

166
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,562
- as guests of
the United Federation of Planets?

167
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:02,605
We would be delighted to accept
your gracious invitation.

168
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,512
We'll make arrangements to have you
beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.

169
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,081
I shall look forward to that.

170
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,584
I hope you're happy.

171
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,526
Captain! There is a supply of
Romulan ale aboard.

172
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,962
It might make
the evening pass more... smoothly.

173
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,830
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.

174
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,198
Guess who's coming to dinner.

175
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,984
Energize.

176
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,716
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.

177
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,485
May I present Captain Spock,
whom I believe you know.

178
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,326
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.

179
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,660
Chancellor.

180
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,030
Gentlemen.

181
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,231
This is my daughter, Azetbur...

182
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:52,106
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...

183
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:56,118
...and this is General Chang,
my chief of staff.

184
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,519
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.

185
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:06,260
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.

186
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,628
From one warrior to another.

187
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,900
Right...

188
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:19,741
This way. You might enjoy a brief tour.

189
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,625
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?

190
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,700
You know only top of the line models
can even talk...

191
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,269
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.

192
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,468
Then snap to it.

193
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,951
I offer a toast.

194
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,780
The undiscovered country.

195
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,395
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.

196
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,793
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1.

197
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:53,165
You have not experienced Shake-
speare until you've read him in Klingon.

198
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:06,243
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.

199
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,377
An advantage of being 1,000 light
years from Federation headquarters.

200
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:15,487
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.

201
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,150
Chancellor!

202
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:24,831
Perhaps we are looking at
something of that future here.

203
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:33,102
Tell me, Captain Kirk. Would you
be willing to give up Starfleet?

204
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:43,453
The Captain feels that Starfleet's
mission has always been one of peace.

205
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:51,025
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...

206
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:56,099
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.

207
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:03,739
General,
are you fond of... Shakespeare?

208
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:09,379
We believe all planets have a sovereign
claim to inalienable human rights.

209
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,279
"Inalien..."
If you could only hear yourselves.

210
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:20,224
"Human rights."
Why, the very name is racist.

211
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:24,260
The Federation is
a "homo sapiens only" club.

212
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,761
Present company excepted, of course.

213
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:32,995
We know where this is leading -
the annihilation of our culture.

214
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,629
That's not true. No!

215
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:42,610
"To be or not to be"...That is the
question which preoccupies our people.

216
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:46,182
- We need breathing room.
- Earth. Hitler, 1938.

217
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,280
I beg your pardon?

218
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,291
Well...

219
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,490
I see we have a long way to go.

220
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,362
We must do this again sometime.

221
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,344
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.

222
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,577
If there is to be a brave new world, -

223
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,744
- our generation is going to have
the hardest time living in it.

224
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,986
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor. Madam.

225
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,188
Captain.

226
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,960
Well, most kind.

227
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:42,698
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?

228
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,537
"Have we not heard
the chimes at midnight?"

229
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,832
Thank God!

230
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:19,637
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.

231
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:24,009
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish
us in the annals of diplomacy.

232
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:28,846
I'm going to sleep this off. Is there any
other way we can screw up tonight?

233
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,820
I'm going to go find
a pot of black coffee.

234
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:54,034
The Enterprise hosted
Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.

235
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:58,808
Our manners
weren't exactly Emily Post.

236
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:05,048
To the galley - Romulan ale no longer
to be served at diplomatic functions.

237
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:12,123
Captain Kirk, will you please
join me on the bridge? Captain Kirk?

238
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,499
- Captain.
- What is it?

239
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,539
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.

240
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:28,611
We are reading an enormous amount of
neutron radiation.

241
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,944
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.

242
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,245
The Enterprise?

243
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:42,857
Val'eris, do you know anything about
a radiation surge? Chekov?

244
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,758
Only the size of my head.

245
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,330
I know what you mean.

246
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,739
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.

247
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,183
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?

248
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,885
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.

249
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:18,621
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.

250
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,385
This is the bridge. Do you read me?

251
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:57,058
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative. We're still fully loaded.

252
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,159
Unable to confirm or deny
firing the torpedoes.

253
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,893
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.

254
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,561
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?

255
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:47,134
It's very hard to make out. There's been
weapons firing and a lot of shouting.

256
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:51,874
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.

257
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,683
Have you not
a shred of decency in you, Kirk?

258
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,721
We come in peace,
and you blatantly defy that peace.

259
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,517
For that,
I shall blow you out of the stars.

260
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:44,099
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...

261
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,966
According to our data banks,
we have. Twice...

262
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,039
Captain, they're coming about.

263
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,748
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?

264
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,445
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?

265
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,182
Signal our surrender.

266
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,792
We surrender!

267
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:15,624
- This is Enterprise. We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...

268
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,203
...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.

269
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,442
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.

270
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:32,015
- I'm going aboard. Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.

271
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:38,418
No, I'll go. We'll not be the instigators
of war on the eve of universal peace.

272
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,490
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.

273
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:46,255
Uhura, tell them we're coming,
and tell them we're unarmed.

274
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,894
- Have you lost your mind?!
- I don't understand what's happened.

275
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,007
We're here to help.

276
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,808
Follow me.

277
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:30,036
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God! What has happened here?

278
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,769
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?

279
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:38,507
With a direct torpedo hit,
you crippled our gravitational field -

280
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:43,711
- and two of your Starfleet crew beamed
aboard wearing magnetic boots.

281
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:47,221
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.

282
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,883
Then for God's sake, let me help.

283
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:06,333
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light. Put him on the table.

284
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,586
Hold him! Hold him while I stabilize him.

285
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,287
I said hold him!

286
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,760
Sweet Jesus.

287
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,065
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.

288
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,112
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!

289
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,481
He's gone into
some kind of damned arrest.

290
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,688
Come on, dammit! Come on!

291
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,694
He's not responding.

292
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:28,390
Don't let it end this way, Captain.

293
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:10,560
Under article 184 of your
Interstellar Law...

294
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,135
...I'm placing you under arrest.

295
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:18,833
You're charged with assassinating
the Chancellor of the High Council.

296
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,035
He tried to save him.

297
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,950
They've been arrested.

298
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,958
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.

299
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,357
I assume command of this ship
as of 02:30 hours.

300
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:44,866
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet
headquarters and request instructions.

301
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,402
We cannot allow them
to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.

302
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:54,034
Opening fire will not retrieve them,
and we must avoid an armed conflict.

303
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,646
We will be able to follow
the Captain's movements.

304
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:00,045
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.

305
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,585
We must piece together
what happened here tonight.

306
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:07,383
According to our data bank,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

307
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:12,257
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.

308
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,557
Please accompany me.

309
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,128
And if we cannot piece together
what happened? What then, sir?

310
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:24,764
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in
the purview of the diplomats.

311
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:30,644
The Chancellor of
the High Council is dead!

312
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,545
The result of an unprovoked attack -

313
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:39,816
- while he travelled to see you under
a flag of truce on a mission of peace!

314
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:43,324
Captain Kirk
was legally arrested for the crime.

315
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:48,625
He and Dr. McCoy boarded
Kronos One of their own free will.

316
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:54,066
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.

317
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,202
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime...

318
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:03,905
...we expect the Federation to abide by
the articles of Interstellar Law.

319
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:09,041
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for
the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.

320
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,919
Out of the question. Ambassador
Sarek, can we get them extradited?

321
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:19,529
Mr President, I share a measure of
personal responsibility in this matter, -

322
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:24,134
- but I am obliged to confirm my
esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.

323
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,794
What is the position of
the Romulan government?

324
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,606
I must concur with my colleagues.

325
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:37,305
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated
the Chancellor of the High Council.

326
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,009
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.

327
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,153
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.

328
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,590
This President is not above the law.

329
00:38:55,833 --> 00:39:00,133
Mr President, Starfleet command
is here from San Francisco.

330
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,867
- Mr President.
- Mr President.

331
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,772
Bill, Admiral Cartwright,
please sit down.

332
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:15,011
Mr President, we cannot allow
Federation citizens to be abducted.

333
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,711
I'm constrained to observe
Interstellar Law.

334
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,881
Sir, would you please
take a look at this.

335
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,822
We prepared Operation Retrieve
based on the danger of terrorism -

336
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,960
- between the Klingon empire
and the Federation.

337
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,699
We can go in, rescue the hostages -

338
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:42,972
- and get out in 24 hours
with acceptable losses.

339
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,707
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.

340
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,908
But suppose you precipitate
a full-scale war?

341
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,850
Then, quite frankly,
we can clean their chronometers.

342
00:39:54,125 --> 00:40:00,030
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.

343
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:04,429
The longer we wait, the less accessible
the hostages will be.

344
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:09,062
I'll bear that in mind. Thank you,
gentlemen, that's all for now.

345
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,669
Mr President.

346
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,152
Sir...

347
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,923
Those men have literally
saved this planet.

348
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:34,929
I know that.
And now they're going to save it again.

349
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,398
By standing trial.

350
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:46,134
Enterprise, report back
on the double. Do you read?

351
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:51,907
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.

352
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:57,577
400 years ago, on Earth, workers
who felt their livelihood threatened -

353
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:03,318
- flung their wooden shoes called
"sabots" into the machines to stop them.

354
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:09,263
Hence the word "sabotage".

355
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:16,968
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.

356
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,577
Excellent. I mean... too bad.

357
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:27,876
Mr President, I have been named
chancellor in my father's place.

358
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:32,284
Madam Chancellor,
you have my condolences on your loss.

359
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:36,483
I assure you
that this shameful deed will not...

360
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,962
Let us come to the point. You want
this conference to go forward.

361
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,533
I will attend in one week,
on one condition.

362
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:52,199
We will not extradite the prisoners,
and you will not attempt to rescue them.

363
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:56,472
We would consider any such attempt
an act of war.

364
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,774
We hope you'll be our guest
here on Earth.

365
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:04,012
After recent events, you will
understand if I prefer a neutral site.

366
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:09,524
And in the interests of security, let us
keep the location secret for now.

367
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:14,029
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.

368
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,894
Your father was killed
for what he wanted.

369
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,265
The peace process will go forward.

370
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,602
Kirk...

371
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:08,684
Kirk will pay for my father's death.

372
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:16,616
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.

373
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,354
Yet the data banks insist we fired.

374
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,226
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!

375
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:26,335
Precisely. Therefore we must inspect
each torpedo visually.

376
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,870
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?

377
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,498
Then someone forged an entry
in the data banks.

378
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,408
Gorkon's daughter has been named
Chancellor. It was on the news.

379
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,643
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.

380
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,347
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.

381
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:51,517
They don't place the same value on life
as we do, you know that.

382
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:55,290
Take my word,
she did not shed one bloody tear.

383
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,993
Hardly conclusive,
since Klingons have no tear-ducts.

384
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:03,071
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet
since our dispatch?

385
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,901
Yes, sir.

386
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,534
And?

387
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:11,238
Commander Uhura is experiencing
technical difficulties, sir.

388
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,613
Curious. Very well.

389
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:21,952
For 24 hours, we will agree
this conversation didn't take place.

390
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,957
- A lie?
- An omission.

391
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:27,529
In 24 hours we won't have a clue
where Captain Kirk is.

392
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:32,567
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do? Where?

393
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:38,404
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...

394
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,789
It's a damn show trial.

395
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:18,545
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One
without provocation.

396
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,581
The Chancellor and his advisors...

397
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,481
...having been lulled into
a false sense of security -

398
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:27,249
- by an invitation to a dinner
aboard Captain Kirk's vessel -

399
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:31,588
- at precisely 19:30 hours
that same evening.

400
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:34,287
Call your first witness.

401
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,992
After the first shot
we lost our gravitational field.

402
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,466
I was weightless and couldn't function.

403
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,606
Then two Starfleet crewmen
came towards me.

404
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,436
Or perhaps
they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.

405
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,773
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.

406
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:54,008
We're interested in facts, not theories.

407
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:59,921
If the gravitational unit was not
functioning, how could they walk?

408
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,456
They appeared to be wearing
magnetic boots.

409
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:09,692
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.

410
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:13,701
Would you be so good as to tell me -

411
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,898
- what is your current medical status?

412
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,839
Aside from a touch of arthritis,
I'd say pretty good.

413
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,143
You have a singular wit, Doctor.

414
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:35,917
For 27 years I've been surgeon
aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.

415
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,993
In three months I stand down.

416
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,296
You know...

417
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:48,564
I believe that you consumed rather
a generous amount of Romulan ale -

418
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,173
- in the officers mess
on the night in question.

419
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,400
- Objection.
- Sustained.

420
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:57,138
We all did. All of us.
That doesn't mean...

421
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:03,014
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive
when you first examined him?

422
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,552
Barely.

423
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:08,555
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past -

424
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:12,991
- saved patients as barely alive as he?

425
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,326
I didn't have the medical knowledge
I needed for Klingon anatomy.

426
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,799
- I see.
- You where there.

427
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:25,272
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?

428
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,501
- Objection!
- I was nervous.

429
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,844
No. You were incompetent.

430
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,817
You were incompetent!

431
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:42,186
Whether deliberately or as a result of
age combined with drink.

432
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:48,195
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man. I tried to save him!

433
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,390
I tried to save him.

434
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,933
I was desperate to save him.

435
00:47:56,106 --> 00:48:00,600
He was the last best hope
in the Universe for peace.

436
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,610
The witness is excused.

437
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:12,652
There we have it, citizens. We have
established the particulars of the crime.

438
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:17,556
And now we come to the architect of
this tragic affair.

439
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:23,132
James Tiberius Kirk.

440
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,664
What would your favourite author say,
Captain?

441
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:33,299
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell
sad stories of the death of kings."

442
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,810
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.

443
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:42,077
Tell us that you planned to take
revenge for the death of your son.

444
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,345
- That's not true.
- Objection!

445
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:49,424
Captain Kirk has not been identified
as the assassin.

446
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:55,828
I offer into the record this excerpt
from the Captain's personal log.

447
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,804
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

448
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:05,373
I've never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.

449
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:15,374
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

450
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:20,149
I've never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.

451
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,557
Are those your words?

452
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,226
Those words were spoken by me.

453
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:39,203
Objection! My client's political views
are not on trial.

454
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:45,246
On the contrary. Captain Kirk's views
are at the very heart of the matter.

455
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:51,684
His record shows him to be an
insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist -

456
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,222
- with a history of violating the chain of
command whenever it suited him.

457
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,757
Continue.

458
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:01,296
The record shows that Captain Kirk
once held the rank of Admiral -

459
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:06,402
- and he was broken for taking matters
into his own hands.

460
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:11,439
Do you deny being demoted for
these charges. Answer me now!

461
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:14,270
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?

462
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:18,676
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.

463
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,841
Were you obeying
or disobeying orders -

464
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,920
- when you arranged the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon?

465
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,818
I didn't know about it
until we boarded the ship.

466
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:32,792
You still deny the Enterprise
fired on Kronos One?

467
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:37,229
And you still deny your men beamed
aboard and shot the Chancellor?

468
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,097
I cannot confirm or deny
actions which I didn't witness.

469
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:45,435
Are you aware
that as the captain of a ship, -

470
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:49,739
- you are responsible for
the actions of your men?

471
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,612
I am.

472
00:50:53,784 --> 00:51:00,189
If it's proved that members of your
crew carried out the assassination...

473
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,292
- They're setting us up. Your Honours!
- Do not answer.

474
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,954
Captain Kirk,
you will answer the question.

475
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,365
As Captain...

476
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:22,076
...I'm responsible for
the crew under my command.

477
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,584
Your Honours, the state rests.

478
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,788
Send to Commander Enterprise.

479
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:38,018
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."

480
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:45,864
It is the determination of this court that
the prisoners are guilty as charged.

481
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:02,743
I wish to note for the record that
all the evidence is circumstantial.

482
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,685
I beg the court to consider this
when pronouncing its sentence.

483
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,415
So noted.

484
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:12,653
Captain James T. Kirk,
Dr. Leonard McCoy.

485
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,890
In the interest of fostering amity -

486
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:23,302
- for the forthcoming peace talks,
the sentence of death is commuted.

487
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:35,180
It is the judgement of this court -

488
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:39,049
- that, without possibility
of reprieve or parole, -

489
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:45,161
- you be taken from this place
to the dilithium mines -

490
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:49,662
- on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.

491
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:55,271
There to spend the rest of
your natural lives.

492
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,277
Rura Penthe!

493
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:11,751
Known throughout the galaxy as
the alien's graveyard.

494
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:15,289
Better to kill them now
and get it over with.

495
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:40,882
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.

496
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,814
Hold.

497
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:52,486
It is Enterprise. We fired.

498
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:58,328
That is not possible! All weapons
visually accounted for, sir.

499
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,332
An ancestor of mine maintained -

500
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:07,409
- that if you eliminate the impossible,
whatever remains must be the truth.

501
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,772
What does that mean?

502
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:15,111
That if we cannot have fired
those torpedoes, someone else did.

503
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:19,244
They didn't fire on themselves
and there are no other ships present.

504
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:23,222
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.

505
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:28,330
A neutron surge that big
could only be produced by another ship.

506
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,763
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.

507
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,338
Very near us. Possibly beneath us.

508
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:41,773
If there were a ship beneath us,
the Klingons would have seen it.

509
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,309
Would they?

510
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:52,553
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.

511
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,456
- Cloaked?
- They can't fire when they're cloaked.

512
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,155
All things being equal, I would agree.

513
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:06,462
However, things are not equal.
This one can.

514
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:10,138
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?

515
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:15,006
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.

516
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:19,945
They'll say we'll say anything
to exonerate the Captain.

517
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:23,347
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.

518
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,751
Only a theory
which happens to fit the facts.

519
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:31,826
Assuming you're right. Why would they
fire on their own President?

520
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,895
Indeed.

521
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:38,194
This ship will be searched
from bow to stern.

522
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:42,566
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us -

523
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:47,039
- surely the assassins beamed aboard
from that vessel, not Enterprise.

524
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,543
You're forgetting something,
Mr Chekov.

525
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:54,775
According to our data banks,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

526
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,146
If we did, the killers are here.

527
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,814
If we did not,
whoever altered the data banks is here.

528
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:06,621
In either case,
what we are looking for is here.

529
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:11,358
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.

530
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:15,166
Two pairs of gravity boots.

531
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,631
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.

532
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:32,112
There is no stockades,
no guard tower, no electronic frontier.

533
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,713
Only a magnetic shield
prevents beaming.

534
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:42,222
Punishment means exile
from prison to the surface.

535
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:47,996
On the surface, nothing can survive.

536
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,195
Work well, and you will be treated well.

537
00:57:56,272 --> 00:58:01,141
Work badly, and you will die.

538
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,822
Oh, my God!

539
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:37,339
The universal translator
has been confiscated.

540
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,573
I'm sorry...?

541
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,077
He's definitely on about something, Jim.

542
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,724
If this is your spot, we'll move on.

543
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,725
He wants your obedience to
the Brotherhood of Aliens.

544
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,159
- He's got it.
- And your coat.

545
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,356
I'm afraid not. It wouldn't fit.

546
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:23,248
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.

547
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:30,517
- I'm Martia. You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?

548
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,025
We don't get many
presidential assassins.

549
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:36,962
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.

550
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,398
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.

551
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:43,069
We've been set up.

552
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,538
Somebody up there
wants you out of the way.

553
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,609
- Any progress?
- None.

554
01:00:55,785 --> 01:01:01,087
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere,
but the killers may still be among them.

555
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:04,715
Surely they have disposed of
these boots by now.

556
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,829
Would it not have been logical
to leave them on Gorkon's ship?

557
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:13,196
Logic must give way to physics. Gravity
wasn't restored when they escaped.

558
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:17,806
Without the boots, they would have
floated off the transporter pads.

559
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,408
Why not simply vaporize them?

560
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,414
Like this?

561
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:38,182
As you know, no one can fire an
unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.

562
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,693
Suppose, when they returned,
they threw the boots into the refuse.

563
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,460
I'm having the refuse searched.

564
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:52,700
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to
the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.

565
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:57,812
They couldn't escape without them
nor throw them out the window.

566
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,948
Those boots are here. Somewhere.

567
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:06,521
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright. It's nothing.

568
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:11,092
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us
to return to port.

569
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,491
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.

570
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:19,158
I hear you have difficulty with the warp
drive. How long do you need for repair?

571
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,236
There's nothing wrong
with the bloody thing.

572
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:28,674
If we return to space dock, the killers
can dispose of their footwear -

573
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:32,941
- and we will never see the Captain
or Dr. McCoy alive again.

574
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,516
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.

575
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:39,746
Val'eris, inform Starfleet
our warp drive is inoperative.

576
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,891
- A lie?
- An error.

577
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:47,862
We have lost all contact
with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.

578
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:52,057
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded
by a magnetic shield.

579
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:58,003
But if I know the Captain,
he is deep into planning his escape.

580
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,265
You've got him
where you want him, Jim!

581
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,378
- Are you alright?
- I think so.

582
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:22,684
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.

583
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,349
That was not his knee.

584
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:29,629
Not everybody keep their genitals
in the same place, Captain.

585
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,357
Anything you want to tell me?

586
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:38,300
See what you can do for him. Let him
know we're not holding a grudge.

587
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:42,342
Suppose he's holding a grudge?

588
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:49,144
When whoever it is makes their move,
you won't be here to ask if he's the one.

589
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:56,155
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.

590
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:20,347
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.

591
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:24,680
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.

592
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:28,449
One day, one night... Kobayashi Maru!

593
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:34,085
Bones! Are you afraid of the future?

594
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:39,064
I believe that was the general idea
that I was trying to convey.

595
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:44,730
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?

596
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:50,368
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.

597
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:56,715
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?

598
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,358
No more Neutral Zone.

599
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:10,064
I was used to hating Klingons.

600
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:17,137
It never even occurred to me
to take Gorkon at his word.

601
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:25,810
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.

602
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:30,078
No. Somebody felt a lot worse.

603
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,816
I'm beginning to understand why.

604
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,392
If you've got any bright ideas,
now is the time.

605
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:43,123
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.

606
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,733
You heard the judge -
the peace conference is on again.

607
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:50,099
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to
attempt another assassination.

608
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,839
Unless we can get out of here.

609
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:11,825
It's me - Martia. Listen. No one has ever
escaped from Rura Penthe.

610
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:15,395
- Except us.
- It is possible.

611
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,759
I know how to get outside the shield.

612
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:21,767
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.

613
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:26,340
After that, you have to get us off the
surface before we freeze. Can you?

614
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:32,309
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.

615
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:36,212
You're the likeliest candidate
to come here for months.

616
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:39,017
Candidate for what?

617
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:57,934
Go to lift 7 in the morning
for mining duty. I'll see you there.

618
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,803
Don't disappoint me.

619
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:06,374
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?

620
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,608
More than ever.

621
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,252
Sorry to wake you, sir.

622
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:21,226
Starfleet requests any data we have on
the whereabouts of Enterprise.

623
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,599
What?

624
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:29,170
They're refusing to acknowledge
signal to return to space dock, sir.

625
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:38,175
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea
location Enterprise.

626
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:42,784
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?

627
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,182
No, sir.

628
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,590
Klingon blood.

629
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:35,760
They must have walked through it when
it was floating and tracked it back here.

630
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:39,101
This is the first evidence
which corroborates our theory.

631
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,436
Now we go to Starfleet?

632
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:45,137
We expand our search
to include uniforms.

633
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,782
All uniforms?

634
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:09,467
Clear, sir. Make a hole.

635
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,334
Coming through. Coming through.

636
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,880
Sir! Sir!

637
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:01,553
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.

638
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:05,660
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.

639
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,388
They don't take girls.

640
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:24,304
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes. What is the problem?

641
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:30,009
Perhaps you know
the Russian epic of Cinderella?

642
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:35,353
If shoe fits - wear it.

643
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,020
Mr Chekov...

644
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,844
Watch me.

645
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:02,545
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...

646
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:06,979
Get in.

647
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,226
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.

648
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,777
Hurry!

649
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,479
Up there.

650
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,090
Come on - climb!

651
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:02,729
Here, you'll need these. Quickly!

652
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,286
Stay close.

653
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:45,539
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.

654
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:51,339
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.

655
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:55,540
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside
the Klingon frontier.

656
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,185
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.

657
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:02,813
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain
and intrepidity -

658
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:05,687
- before the Captain and Dr. McCoy
freeze to death.

659
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:16,764
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!

660
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:21,069
Bones, I'm wearing
a viridium patch on my back.

661
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:25,339
Spock slapped it there
before we went on Gorkon's ship.

662
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:28,142
That cunning little Vulcan.

663
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:31,480
Come on! We're in the clear.

664
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:37,151
Now that we're outside the shield,
they can locate us two sectors away.

665
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:39,385
If they're even looking for us.

666
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:31,038
We must respond. A universal
translator would be recognised.

667
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:07,014
"What is your destination, over?"

668
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:02,661
Would you mind explaining
that little trick you do?

669
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:07,707
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.

670
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:12,245
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.

671
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,076
Give a girl a chance, Captain.

672
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,312
It takes a lot of effort.

673
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:21,914
I don't doubt it.

674
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,684
Stop me if I'm wrong, -

675
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,489
- but do we have any way of knowing
whether this is the real you?

676
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:32,724
I thought I would assume
a pleasing shape.

677
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:43,235
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.

678
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,208
If you say so.

679
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,376
Are you crazy?!

680
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:51,781
She didn't need our help. Where did you
get these convenient clothes?

681
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,150
Don't tell me that flare
is standard prison issue.

682
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:59,020
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.

683
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:03,790
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.

684
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,059
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.

685
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:12,036
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.

686
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:17,645
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.

687
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,212
Surprise!

688
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:38,227
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.

689
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:44,761
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.

690
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:03,386
Isn't it time you became
something else?

691
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,287
I like it here.

692
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:17,799
Well, well, well...

693
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,044
What took you so long?

694
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,707
Kill him, he's the one.

695
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,786
Not me, you idiot - him!

696
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:38,719
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.

697
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,487
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.

698
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:46,623
- That's what he wanted.
- Who? Who wanted us killed?

699
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:50,999
Since you're all going to die anyway,
why not tell you?

700
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,197
His name is...

701
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:05,710
Damn it! What the hell! Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?

702
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:07,855
He was about to explain
the whole thing.

703
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:10,753
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!

704
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:16,086
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.

705
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:22,863
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.

706
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:35,699
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey
that can fire while cloaked.

707
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:39,108
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.

708
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,649
We believe that Gorkon's murderers
are aboard this ship.

709
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:47,049
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows? The location is secret.

710
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:50,248
- There's always something.
- Captain! Mr Spock!

711
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:53,792
I found the uniforms
with the Klingon blood on them.

712
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:14,882
But the uniforms belong to
these two men. Burke and Samno.

713
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:19,148
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.

714
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,983
First rule of assassination -
kill the assassins.

715
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:28,118
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?

716
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:34,664
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.

717
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:44,034
It's possible.

718
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:48,080
Now hear this. Now hear this.

719
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:52,413
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.

720
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:56,421
Statements to be taken at once
from Yeomen Burke and Samno.

721
01:24:56,591 --> 01:25:00,994
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.

722
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,392
Statements to be taken.

723
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:08,696
Repeat, statements to be taken from
Yeomen Burke and Samno.

724
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:48,365
You have to shoot.

725
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:56,682
If you are logical, you have to shoot.

726
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,822
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.

727
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:07,155
What you've chosen is at hand.

728
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,125
I'd just as soon you didn't.

729
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:19,396
The operation is over.

730
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:28,441
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.

731
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:33,747
Yes, I can. At my trial my personal log
was used against me.

732
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:37,983
How long did you wait outside
my quarters before I noticed you?

733
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:42,327
You knew?

734
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:45,928
I tried to tell you,
but you would not listen.

735
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:50,161
Neither of us was hearing very well
that night.

736
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:53,865
There were things I tried to tell you,
about having faith.

737
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:58,945
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.

738
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:02,446
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.

739
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:09,455
Klingons cannot be trusted. Sir...
You said so yourself.

740
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:13,651
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?

741
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:18,458
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?

742
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,294
And you were right.

743
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:26,497
They conspired with us to assassinate
their own Chancellor.

744
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:29,040
How trustworthy can they be?

745
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:33,044
Klingons and Federation members
conspiring together.

746
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:37,548
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.

747
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,311
Names, Lieutenant.

748
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:44,948
My comrades will make certain
all your transmissions are jammed.

749
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:50,530
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.

750
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,635
A lie?

751
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,964
A choice.

752
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:04,311
Spock.

753
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:51,381
Admiral Cartwright.

754
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,084
From Starfleet?

755
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,694
Who else?

756
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:11,340
General... Chang.

757
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:25,050
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.

758
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:31,421
Where is the peace conference?

759
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:35,769
Where is the peace conference?

760
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:12,005
She does not know.

761
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:15,006
Then we're dead.

762
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:30,781
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.

763
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:35,054
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.

764
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:38,164
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.

765
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:42,928
You realize that by even talking to us,
you're violating regulations.

766
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:45,834
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.

767
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:49,773
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?

768
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,571
They'll attempt another assassination.

769
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:56,774
It's at Camp Khitomer,
near the Romulan border.

770
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,681
I'm sending the co-ordinates on
a coded frequency.

771
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:02,152
We'll need more than that.

772
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:06,225
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out
for us that can fire while cloaked.

773
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:08,760
Surely not.

774
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:13,697
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.

775
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:16,837
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?

776
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:20,565
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.

777
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:23,733
The chances of our reaching
the conference in time are slim.

778
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:28,939
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.

779
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:33,911
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.

780
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:42,892
Spock?

781
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:45,294
I prefer it dark.

782
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:56,567
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.

783
01:31:56,744 --> 01:32:03,809
It was arrogant presumption on my part
that got us into this situation.

784
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:07,421
You and the Doctor
might have been killed.

785
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:10,113
The night is young.

786
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:15,024
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.

787
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:20,829
You're a great one for logic.

788
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:26,030
I'm a great one for rushing in
where angels fear to tread.

789
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:32,874
We're both extremists. Reality is
probably somewhere in between.

790
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:39,449
I couldn't get past the death of my son.

791
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:44,353
I was prejudiced by her
accomplishments as a Vulcan.

792
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:48,291
Gorkon had to die before I understood
how prejudiced I was.

793
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,401
Is it possible...

794
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:06,979
...that we two, you and I,
have grown so old and inflexible -

795
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:11,676
- that we have outlived our usefulness?

796
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:14,844
Would that constitute a joke?

797
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:20,526
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.

798
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:26,697
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.

799
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:29,165
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...

800
01:33:29,337 --> 01:33:32,738
We both know that I am not human.

801
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:36,570
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.

802
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:41,337
I find that remark... insulting.

803
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:43,210
Come, I need you.

804
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:52,419
Madam Chancellor,
members of the diplomatic corps...

805
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:56,419
...honoured guests.

806
01:33:56,597 --> 01:33:59,964
The United Federation of Planets
welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.

807
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,612
She's out here somewhere.

808
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:24,690
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.

809
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:29,387
By the time we're close enough
to record it, we're ashes.

810
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:34,664
2.06...

811
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:40,007
2.03...

812
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:45,669
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet. In two minutes. 1.58.

813
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:50,176
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.

814
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:04,095
Let us redefine progress to mean that
just because we can do a thing -

815
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:09,168
- it does not necessarily follow
that we must do that thing.

816
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:15,169
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.

817
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:18,505
If she's here,
she's rigged for silent running.

818
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:29,183
Coming up on transporter range
in 57 seconds.

819
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:32,883
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.

820
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:37,357
53...

821
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:43,568
48 seconds.

822
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:50,306
44...

823
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:55,705
I can see you, Kirk.

824
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:57,908
Chang.

825
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:00,576
Can you see me?

826
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:05,522
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.

827
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:09,652
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.

828
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,161
No peace in our time.

829
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:18,601
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."

830
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:37,285
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines. All astern.

831
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,688
One and a half impulse power. Back off!

832
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:50,062
What's she waiting for?

833
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:54,037
Probably attempting to ascertain
why we are reversing.

834
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:57,473
Wondering whether we detect her.

835
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:03,445
Incoming!

836
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:09,955
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.

837
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:11,648
Come on!

838
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:13,726
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!

839
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:19,560
Many speculated about
my father's motives.

840
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:24,932
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.

841
01:37:25,105 --> 01:37:30,737
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism
wouldn't have found expression.

842
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:34,343
We are a proud race.

843
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:39,248
We are here because we intend
to go on being proud.

844
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:53,859
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.

845
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:03,306
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"

846
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:08,542
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"

847
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,206
Gas.

848
01:38:11,952 --> 01:38:16,753
Gas, Captain. Under impulse power
she expands fuel, like all vessels.

849
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:22,453
We call it "plasma",
but it is merely ionised gas.

850
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:27,533
What about our equipment
to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

851
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:31,833
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.

852
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:36,375
Doctor, would you assist me
in performing surgery on a torpedo?

853
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:37,840
Fascinating.

854
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:42,508
Hard to starboard.

855
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:47,944
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos -

856
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:51,580
- has been calculated
within the 50 Earth year time span.

857
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:54,387
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...

858
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:09,875
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.

859
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:21,515
Shields up! Alright, now we're giving
them something else to shoot at.

860
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:30,997
The game's afoot.

861
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:43,141
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.

862
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:57,115
"Cry havoc,
and let slip the dogs of war."

863
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:01,227
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.

864
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:06,463
Shields collapsing!

865
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,761
The key, please. Time is short.

866
01:40:18,278 --> 01:40:20,974
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.

867
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:22,740
Connect echo-bars.

868
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:25,316
...discuss the report on phase 2.

869
01:40:25,486 --> 01:40:28,978
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.

870
01:40:29,156 --> 01:40:31,784
...we commence
within minutes of the preparation.

871
01:40:31,959 --> 01:40:36,692
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.

872
01:40:37,364 --> 01:40:38,695
Plate, please.

873
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,527
...and assimilation will consume...

874
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,760
We've got a heart beat.

875
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:45,837
...with the Klingon Empire...

876
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:47,769
Key, please.

877
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:50,307
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.

878
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:52,707
Lock and load!

879
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:55,946
Fire!

880
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:10,630
"To be... or not"...

881
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:13,863
..."to be."

882
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:17,228
Target that explosion and fire.

883
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,665
Fire!

884
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:35,087
This work will occupy us
throughout most of the week.

885
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:36,882
I hope that the delegation -

886
01:41:37,057 --> 01:41:44,156
- can implement the provisions
of Phase 1 by the first of next month.

887
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:48,199
As you know, time is of the essence.

888
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:49,995
Out of the way!

889
01:41:55,008 --> 01:41:56,999
Mr President!

890
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:00,041
Mr President!

891
01:42:01,815 --> 01:42:03,749
Kirk, Enterprise.

892
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:17,858
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!

893
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:24,261
We've got a full confession.

894
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:44,257
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright. Just a minute.

895
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:54,567
It's Colonel West!

896
01:42:58,071 --> 01:43:01,666
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?

897
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:03,867
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.

898
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:10,375
Some people think
the future means the end of history.

899
01:43:10,551 --> 01:43:13,179
We haven't run out of history quite yet.

900
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:17,886
Your father called the future...

901
01:43:19,059 --> 01:43:21,857
..."the undiscovered country".

902
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:26,958
People can be
very frightened of change.

903
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:34,403
You've restored my father's faith.

904
01:43:35,576 --> 01:43:38,704
And you've restored my son's.

905
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,358
Once again, we've saved civilization
as we know it.

906
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:32,191
And they're not going to prosecute.

907
01:44:32,366 --> 01:44:35,824
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.

908
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:38,870
They don't arrest people
for having feelings.

909
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:45,444
And it's a good thing, too. If they did,
we'd all have to turn ourselves in.

910
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:49,776
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.

911
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:53,818
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,
I owe you my thanks.

912
01:44:53,987 --> 01:45:00,290
Nice to see you in action one more
time, Captain Kirk. Take care.

913
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:16,908
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.

914
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:20,843
So... This is goodbye?

915
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:24,951
It's about time
we got underway ourselves.

916
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:28,246
Captain, I have orders
from Starfleet Command.

917
01:45:28,422 --> 01:45:33,951
We're to put back to space dock
immediately... to be decommissioned.

918
01:45:48,308 --> 01:45:53,871
If I were human,
I believe my response would be:

919
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:56,038
"Go to hell."

920
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:01,216
If I were human.

921
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:06,986
Course heading, Captain?

922
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,262
Second star to the right.

923
01:46:17,437 --> 01:46:19,530
And straight on 'til morning.

924
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:40,949
Captain's log, stardate 9529.1.

925
01:46:41,128 --> 01:46:45,326
This is the final cruise of the Starship
Enterprise under my command.

926
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:47,524
This ship, and her history -

927
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:50,636
- will shortly become
the care of another crew.

928
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:54,706
To them and their posterity
will we commit our future.

929
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:57,309
They'll continue the voyages
we have begun -

930
01:46:57,477 --> 01:46:59,877
- and journey
to all the undiscovered countries -

931
01:47:00,046 --> 01:47:05,074
- boldly going where no man,
where no one...

932
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:07,777
...has gone before.

933
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:21,000
