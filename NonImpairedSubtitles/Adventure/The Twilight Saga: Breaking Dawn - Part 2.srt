I mean shield someone other than yourself.

668
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,131
Is that possible?

669
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,243
Gifts can be developed. Over time.

670
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,140
At first, mine was just in my palms.

671
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,603
Now I can radiate it all over my body.

672
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,715
- How do you do it?
- (SlGHS)

673
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,618
- Tell me.
- Ow.

674
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,353
You need to visualize it.

675
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,122
See how it moves.

676
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,321
What color it is.

677
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,458
Now picture it expanding.

678
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,526
Will it to go beyond you.

679
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,829
(RUSHlNG)

680
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,715
I think she needs something to motivate her.

681
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,882
- No.
- It's all right, I can take it.

682
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,320
He says that now.

683
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,050
Focus, Bella, or he's gonna be hurting.

684
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,328
- Edward, I'm not ready to do this yet.
- (CRACKLlNG)

685
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,227
(GRUNTS)

686
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:39,835
I'm sorry. I said that I wasn't ready.

687
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,804
Dude, you're not motivating her.

688
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:42,872
You want to try?

689
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,575
- (CRACKLlNG)
- (GROANlNG)

690
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,251
Kate!

691
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,376
KATE: You seem to lack incentive.

692
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,215
Shall I go see if Renesmee's awake?

693
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:00,712
Are you crazy?

694
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,225
All right.

695
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:04,951
This one's on full power.

696
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,011
(CRACKLlNG)

697
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:27,983
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

698
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,553
It's painful, but it's bearable.

699
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:49,095
Okay, we should go again.

700
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,207
Emmett.

701
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,542
I'm good.

702
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,011
BELLA: "There's sweet music here that

703
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:00,515
"softer falls
than petals from blown roses on the grass.

704
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,844
"Or night dews on still waters between walls

705
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,189
"of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass.

706
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,760
"Music that brings
sweet sleep down from the blissful skies."

707
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:29,903
Mom.

708
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,414
Hmm?

709
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,616
Did Aunt Alice and Uncle Jasper run away

710
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,745
because we're gonna die?

711
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,247
No.

712
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,394
I think they left to keep us safer.

713
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,464
That's what all these
other people are here for, too.

714
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,967
I'll never let anybody hurt you.

715
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,775
Come here. Go to sleep.

716
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,333
It's strange.

717
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,435
Physically, I feel like I could demolish a tank.

718
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,608
Mentally, I just feel drained.

719
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,541
How about a bath?

720
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,467
I do remember how to undress myself.

721
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,240
Yeah, I just do it so much better.

722
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,407
Bella,

723
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,886
I've had a bad habit of underestimating you.

724
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,721
Every obstacle you've faced,

725
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:26,993
I'd think you couldn't overcome it.

726
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,761
And you just did.

727
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,732
You're the reason
they have something to fight for.

728
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:38,070
My family.

729
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,491
I'm gonna get the water running.

730
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,684
BELLA: Alice made sure
only I would get the message.

731
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,861
Because only my mind
would be safe from Aro.

732
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,800
JACOB: I'm surprised
you took a break from Jedi training.

733
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,678
If I don't take Renesmee to my dad,
he'll come to us.

734
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,345
27 vampires, one human.

735
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,411
Not so great.

736
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,319
I know that's what you told Edward.

737
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,218
- (EXHALES)
- Whatever.

738
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:08,393
I'm just glad to get away from
all those reeking bloodsuckers.

739
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,000
(SCOFFS)

740
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:12,501
I'm sorry.

741
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,194
I know.

742
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,196
They're the good guys.

743
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:18,941
But come on,

744
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,367
Dracula One and Two are

745
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,406
- creepy.
- (BOTH LAUGHlNG)

746
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,354
CHARLlE: There she is. Come here.

747
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:42,824
Oh!

748
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,392
Wow! Look at you.

749
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,928
You've grown half a foot!

750
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:48,737
Seriously.

751
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,632
Like 6 inches.

752
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,703
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

753
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,141
We got a tree to decorate, huh?

754
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:58,141
I've actually got a few errands to run, guys.

755
01:01:58,247 --> 01:01:59,544
I'll be back soon, okay?

756
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,548
- CHARLlE: Come on. Let's go.
- (RENESMEE LAUGHS)

757
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:05,821
(ENGlNE STARTS)

758
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,453
BELLA: Alice's note
gave me a new sense of hope.

759
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,455
Maybe she had a plan for us after all.

760
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,567
And maybe J. Jenks was the key.
