1
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,227
Well?

2
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,541
- I'm sending you the code.
- Yes, I see that. Thank you.

3
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,944
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

4
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,704
I just sent it. You should have it.

5
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,066
- Yes. Thank you.
- Hey, are you sure this is Iegal?

6
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,506
(woman) We're just running a test
on our security system, sir. It's fine.

7
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,946
You've got a sexy voice.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

8
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,986
- To you?
- We have all we need.

9
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,385
We're ready.

10
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,304
(gunfire/screaming)

11
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,826
Yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.

12
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,146
- What'd you do to my drive?
- I didn't touch it.

13
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,063
This isn't cool.
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

14
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,902
(machines powering down)

15
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,227
Diagnostics show no damage,
but this was an intentional breach.

16
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,108
- We were hacked?
- It wasn't "Denial of Service" level,

17
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,863
but they definitely cracked our door.

18
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,141
OK. Open the Black Hat files.

19
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,064
I want every hacker in the country
who could have done this interviewed now.

20
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,019
Sir, that's close to 1,000 names. This
holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.

21
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,944
We're the ones supposed to keep this from
happening, and it happened to us. Do it.

22
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,498
Sir, it's night.
They're all over the country.

23
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,387
Get local law enforcement help.

24
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,464
Somebody out there thinks they can
screw with us. I wanna find out who.

25
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,539
( "Rock & Roll Queen" by The Subways
on car stereo)

26
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,619
- Jim! I said no.
- Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?

27
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,698
- Get out!
- What?!

28
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,906
- Get out of the car now!
- Don't touch me.

29
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,787
- No means no.
- What are you doin'?

30
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,180
- John, stop it!
- Don't call me that. I hate it when you do.

31
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,784
- You know this guy?
- Just shut your mouth right now.

32
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,464
Dad! Stop it. I mean it.

33
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,462
- "Dad"? You said your dad was dead.
- What?

34
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,182
You told this jerk-off I was dead?
You actually said that?

35
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,023
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

36
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,260
And this guy's what? Your boyfriend?

37
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,386
- No.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,062
I don't know, OK?
I'm sorry. We'll see.

39
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,908
What are you doing here?

40
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,665
- You don't answer your phone, return calls.
- Because I'm not talking to you.

41
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,266
- Why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?
- Why not? What? You want a list?

42
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,901
How about stuff like this: you spy on me,
you drag my boyfriend out of the car...

43
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,901
- You said he's not your boyfriend.
- He's not!

44
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,868
- I thought you said I just was.
- Shut up.

45
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,059
You are such an asshole.

46
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,419
OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend"
out of the car, OK?

47
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,984
- Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.
- No, no.

48
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,345
- Will both of you go away?
- Just talk to me.

49
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,024
I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.

50
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,500
- Damn right you're going to bed alone.
- (sighs)

51
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,420
Lucy, honey, wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you. Just wait.

52
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,308
Dad, when I wanna talk to you -

53
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,621
ifl wanna talk to you -

54
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,101
I'll call you.

55
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,341
Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy!

56
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,979
- Lucy McClane.
- It's not McClane. It's Gennero.

57
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,421
Chicks, right?

58
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,866
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

59
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,261
(sighs wearily)

60
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,062
(beeping)

61
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,220
(man) John?

62
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,619
John? It's Sclavino.

63
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,945
- Go for McClane.
- What are you doing at Rutgers?

64
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,340
- How do you know where I am?
- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.

65
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,628
- I'm staring at exactly where you are.
- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.

66
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,827
Yeah, we did that.
John, we turned them on.

67
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,185
Listen, the feds have called in a favour.

68
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,502
They're doing a sweep. They want us to
pick up some computer hacker in Camden.

69
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,582
Last name: Farrell.
First name: Matthew.

70
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,423
Whoa, whoa. Camden?
What are you telling me this for?

71
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,786
- Just came in.
- Vino, it's 3am. I was on my way home.

72
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,703
Send a jughead from the Academy.
They'd be happy to do it.

73
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,102
I can't just send in a uniform.
The feds demanded a senior detective.

74
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,579
The kid's a high-value subject -
I don't know.

75
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,185
Just pick him up, escort him
to the Hoover Building in DC.

76
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,979
They had some kind of a computer breach
there this morning.

77
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,947
Great!

78
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,979
All right, give me that information.
Give me that name again. What is it?

79
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,788
You owe me one, Jack.

00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,467
Aw, come on.

83
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,028
Goddammit.

- Who is it?
- (McCIane) NYPD. Open the door, please.

89
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,459
- Hi.
- NYPD?

90
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,146
OK. Oh, I get it. Don't worry, everyone
gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...

91
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,859
Hey, I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?

92
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,101
No. He, uh... actually
does not live here any more.

93
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,660
- Course not. Who are you?
- My name is Daisy Duke.

94
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,029
Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.
Please don't add to it.

95
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,785
- Can I see some identification, please?
- Yeah, sure.

96
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,221
Oh, "Detective"!

97
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,859
Yeah, that looks real!
You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.

98
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,466
- Then of course...
- Yeah. That... actually looks pretty good.

99
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,306
Mmm.

100
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,622
Farrell! Sully PDL-ed the new copy of
the Kill Zone Nine. Wanna check it out?

101
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,988
No! Thanks, though, man.
And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.

102
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,065
Open the door.

103
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,503
Shit.

104
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,979
Can I get you something?
Coffee? A warrant?

105
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,187
- What's this about?
- I don't know. Some computer thing.

106
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,148
DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.

107

- Yeah. The feds.

I've been White Hat for four years,
but once you're on that goddamn list...

109
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,988
Such a pain in the ass.

110
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,379
- You play with dolls?
- Huh?

111
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,745
- Could you not touch that?
- Like a Gl Joe?

112
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,105
No, it's not. It's a limited edition...

113
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,623
- Ooh.
-..and...

114
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,225
- That supposed to come off?
- No, but it's more valuable broken,

115
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,064
- so thanks for that.
- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.

116
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,300
I got some other cool shit you can break.

117
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,065
- Let's go, OK? Come on.
- I gotta power down my gear, OK?

118
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,060
More dolls. Not spending
a whole lot of time with the girls, huh?

119
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,180
Hey! Are you really trying to escape?

120
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,103
- (gunshot)
- Ow! Jesus, don't shoot!

121
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,543
Get down!

122
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,945
- Jesus Christ.
- Stay right there.

123
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,705
(Matt whimpers)

124
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,020
Go!

125
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,182
Let's go. Come on.
Low, low! Stay down!

126
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,386
- Agh!
- Come on.

127
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,585
(whispers) It's all right.
Stay low, all right? Stay down.

128
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,946
- You stay with me, all right? Here we go.
- OK.

129
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,348
OK.

130
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,501
That'll wake the neighbours.

131
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,467
Get down! Get inside!

132
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,148
They're back in the room!
They're back in the room!

133
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,701
Are you nuts? Get outta there right now!

134
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,348
- I'm trying to...
- Now!

135
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,869
Get back in there!

136
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,185
Aaargh! Argh!

137
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,821
Get ready to run.

138
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,180

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,945
(Matt splutters and groans)

140
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,867
- What the hell was that?
- What?

141
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,828
- Did you do that?
- No.

142
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,743
- Shit.
- I didn't do that. Come on.

143
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:58,187
- Shit.
- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.

144
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,067
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go, goddammit!

145
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,466
Come on.

146
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,461
Watch it. Slow it down.

147
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,145
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

148
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,460
Hey, let's go. Come on.

149
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,100
Come on, come on. Stay close.

150
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,630
Stay with me. Stay with me.

151
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,706
Come on, let's go. Stay close.

152
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,258
Get in the car. Go, go.

153
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,780
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

154
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,065
- Can you reload a gun?!
- l...

155
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,147
Open the glove box
and get a magazine out right now!

156
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,979
Grab the gun from the back seat!

157
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,463
You OK?

158
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,305
Get your head down.

159
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,985
Jesus! Is the circus in town?

160
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,664
Whoa!

161
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,905
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.

162
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,866
Camden base, 10077. Come back.
Camden base, 10077.

163
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,303
Go ahead.

164
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,099
I need to speak to your chief of your
detectives. Police emergency, asap.

165
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,623
Stand by.

166
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,942
- (man) This is Chief Detective Wiesman.
- This is Detective John McClane, NYPD.

167
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,228
Police emergency. I wanna report
a police shooting in your jurisdiction.

168
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,141
(phone rings)

169
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,299
(in French)

170
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,020
- Yeah?
- (woman) What's the status?

171
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,863
(in French)

172
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,983
Wait one.

173
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,190
Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell's still alive.

174
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,779
- So he got away.
- Yeah.

175
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,100
I did send five of you, is that right?

176
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,828
(in French)

177
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,620
I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll
track 'em down. Think you can handle that?

178
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,187
- (Matt) Oh, my God.
- Just breathe.

179
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,546
I am breathing! I'm-I'm...
I can't stop shaking.

180
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,383
It's the adrenaline.
You're just scared. It'll pass.

181
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,463
Yeah, I'm scared!
Weren't you scared, back there?

182
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,622
Yeah. I was scared.

183
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,226
Really? This is you being scared?
I don't know, cos you seem really calm.

184
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,460
Have you done stuff like that before?

185
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,065
- Stuff like what?
- Like killing people.

186
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,100
Yeah. But not for a long time.

187
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,142
So who were those guys, huh?
Why were they trying to kill you?

188
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,506
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?!

189
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,423
They were there to kill you.

190
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,459
- Why would they want to kill me?
- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.

191
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,739
We got seven dead hackers so far,
none of whom were high on our list.

192
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,379
- Get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,907
Trey. Matthew Farrell - find him for me.

194
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,742
On it.

195
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,065
What's with all the guns?

196
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,745
Operational prudence.

197
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,189
Think of them as hardware to your software.

198
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,986
(DJ) Good morning, DC! It's shaping up
to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.

199
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,700
Ifyou've got any big plans, get started
early, cos the traffic is ramping up.

200
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,305
So here 's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

201
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,301
( "Fortunate Son "
by Creedence CIearwater Revival)

202
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,984
What? What... What...

203
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,265
What are you doing? What is that?

204
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,227
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?

205
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,303
Creedence. Creedence Clearwater
Revival? Classic rock?

206
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,507
I know who it is. It's old rock.
Doesn't make it classic.

207
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,423
- What sucked then sucks now.
- You don't like Creedence?

208
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,547
This is like having a pine cone
shoved in my ass.

209
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,305
- (turns up volume)
- OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.

210
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,267
Come on. I'm cooperating with you.

211
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,947
(man) We're at a heading of 060.
Making another pass.

212
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,829
Listen up, everyone.
Are we ready?

213
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,468
Transportation hubs are prepped and set.

214
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,506
Begin stage one.

215
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,819
(general consternation)

216
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,822
What? Nothing.

217
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,468
(snatches of radio talk shows)

218
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,628
When'd you last turn on the radio and listen
to popular music? Just give me a decade.

219
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,623
The '70s? I'm guessing.
Was Michael Jackson still black?

220
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,543
Pearl Jam.
I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.

221
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,461
20 years. The Cure? Nothin'?

222
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,670
It's called news radio. I want to see if your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

223
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,025
Hold on. You listen to the news?

224
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,068
You got a problem with the news now?

225
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,062
Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem
with the news.

226
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,699
Ready for this?
The news is completely manipulated.

227
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,862
Everything you hear, every single day,

228
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,899
is designed by corporate media to do
one thing only: to keep you living in fear.

229
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,787
- Oh, fear?
- Total fear.

230
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,829
So you'll go out and spend money
on things you probably don't even need,

231
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,549
so advertisers
keep buying ads on their stations.

232
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,509
I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this
all day. I got days of data at home...

233
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,228
- Hey.
- I'll drop a bomb on you...

234
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,299
- Hey!
- What?

235
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,668
- Shut up.
- That's good. Be dismissive instead of...

236
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,748
(car horns and tyres screeching)

237
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,226
(sirens)

238
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,864
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right!

239
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,388
Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.

240
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,546
Hey, man. Hey.

241
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,148
You all right? Don't move.
Just call 911, all right?

242
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,141
OK.

243
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,863
Jesus Christ.

244
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,464
(sirens and alarms)

245
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,664
- All the lights are green.
- Huh?

246
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,310
All the lights are green.
Let's go. Right now.

247
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,382
- We gotta go?
- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.

248
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,069
- Let's go.
- I've never been in a car accident.

249
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,380
Well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.

250
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,222
- You been in a car accident?
- Yeah.

251
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,459
What are we doing?

252
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,987
It's a little thing they invented in the '60s
called jogging. You're gonna love it.

253
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,909
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a systems crash on the el train network.

254
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,460
(beeping)

255
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,542
Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash
in their com system.

256
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,703
FAA just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC net just went down.

257
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,701
We're under attack.

258
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,989
OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.

259
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,904
(alarm sounds)

260
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,746
That's the anthrax alarm.

261
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,348
All right, everyone out. Now! Now!

262
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,902
Taylor, move! Go! Move!

263
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,784
(alarm continues to sound)

264
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,144
(PA) AII personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

265
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,141
This is not a drill.

266
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:44,987
AII personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

267
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,943
We need you inside, sir.

268
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,429
(siren)

269
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:15,341
Take your team. I want men
on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

270
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,023
We gotta know what's there.

271
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,386
Run a trunk search on these data crashes,
try to lD the point of origin.

272
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,261
Begin stage two.

273
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,102
Hey, what's going on?

274
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,260
(shouts of "Sell! Sell!")

275
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,418
They're already starting to panic.

276
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,386
Of course they are.

277
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,904
They think that someone's
taking their money.

278
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,585
All those nickels and dimes they saved
had meaning.

279
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,582
"Useful idiots", as Lenin would say.

280
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,466
Prep the video package.

281
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,459
DC transportation system's crashing and
they just hit the financial sector. All of it.

282
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,146
Get me the secretary for trans and treasury
on the line and the chairman of the SEC.

283
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,462
Let's go, people. Somewhere
somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.

284
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,221
- Deputy Director Bowman in here?
- Not now. It'll have to wait.

285
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,269
Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.
I brought him here on orders from Bowman.

286
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,342
If you don't know what's goin' on,
find somebody that does.

287
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,579
I'm Bowman.

288
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,983
Video package is ready for upload.

289
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,545
John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell,

290
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,508
but we are neck-deep
in damage control right now.

291
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,583
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have
anything to eat, any snacks around?

292
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,059
I'd love...
I've got really low blood sugar...

293
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,345
- Sir?
- No?

294
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,585
As if the transportation breakdown and
anthrax scares weren't enough for one day,

295
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,628
the stock market
found itself in a selling frenzy.

296
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,508
The FTC believes this panic
might have been triggered

297
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,821
by a computer malfunction
in the stock exchange.

298
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,902
Oh, man, that is all bad.

299
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,983
It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills
to prepare for things like this.

300
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,627
- These your suspects?
- Were.

301
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,224
All seven were killed in the last 24 hours.

302
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,459
Recognise any of these people?

303
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,184
No.

304
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,988
Not one?

305
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,868
Sir, we got a system error.

306
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,903
( "Hail to the Chief" plays,
then breaks down)

307
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,345
- My fellow Americans...
-..it is time to...

308
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,422
strike... fear... into...
the hearts of... citizenry.

309
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,819
- Ask not...
- That's an unauthorised broadcast.

310
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,788
..what your country can do...
to avert... this... crisis.

311
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,543
- The answer is...
-..nothing whatsoever.

312
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,986
Our military... strength...
is... in this case...

313
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,298
..useless.

314
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,788
Read my Iips.

315
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,025
The... great... confident... roar...
of... American... progress... and... growth...

316
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,670
has come to... an end.

317
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,743
AII the... vital... technology...
that... this nation... holds dear...

318
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,789
all... communications... transportation...
the internet... connectivity...

319
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,782
electrical... power...
critical... utilities...

320
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,508
their... fate... now... rests...
in... our... hands.

321
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,946
We will not tire, we will not falter,

322
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,748
and we will not fail.

323
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,469
I don't know how they're getting in.

324
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,380
Thank you.

325
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,143
And a... happy Independence Day...
to everyone.

326
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,502
That was creepy.

327
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,387
I tried to find more Nixon.

328
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,987
Think they bought it?

329
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,026
Absolutely.

330
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,662
OK, I want telecom, transportation...

331
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,423
- Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.
- What?

332
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,022
It's a fire sale.

333
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,385
Hey. We don't know that yet.

334
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,587
- It's a myth, anyway. It can't be done.
- It's a myth? Really?

335
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,104
Please tell me
she's not in charge of anything.

336
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,067
What's a fire sale?

337
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,428
It's a three-step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

338
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,708
Step one: take out transportation.
Step two: the financial base and telecoms.

339
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,544
Step three: get rid of all the utilities -
gas, water, electric, nuclear...

340
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,908
Anything that's run by computers,
which today is almost everything.

341
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,948
That's why they call it a fire sale -
everything must go.

342
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,419
Hey, listen... What's your name? Farrell?

343
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:55,503
Keep your voice down, OK?
No one here's talking about a fire sale.

344
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,469
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

345
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,780
No, man. I'm just saying...

346
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,384
Appreciate your concern.
We're on it. Thank you.

347
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,303
- You've done a bang-up job so far.
- What? What?

348
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,188
Nothing. I said I understand.

349
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,307
Hey. They didn't send the girl scouts out
to get this kid.

350
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,224
They sent professional guys, full
tactical gear. They blew the whole joint up.

351
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,906
Now, I don't know this kid,
and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence -

352
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,140
but somebody wants this kid dead,

353
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,269
and obviously it's got something to do
with whatever's going on here.

354
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,660
OK. Homeland's interrogating
the hackers we're bringing in.

355
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,548
I'll get you an escort over there. All right?

356
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:39,784
Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.
I wanna know what he knows.

357
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,828
If he knew half the shit I know,
his head would explode.

358
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,739
Special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.

359
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,300
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right. Right this way.

360
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,702
Great. So is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

361
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:58,147
Is it possible? Look, you take out
any one thing, the system can recover.

362
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:03,429
If you take it all down at once, the system
crashes and... Look around, man.

363
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,981
Come on. Government's gotta have dozens
of departments dedicated to that shit.

364
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,143
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

365
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,784
How long till we get to DHS?

366
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,466
Laughlin, get on the DC police band
and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.

367
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,348
DC Metro, this is the FBl
requesting you to clear a route...

368
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,024
(scrambled noise)

369
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,186
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

370
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,225
- Feds are taking him to Homeland.
- Good.

371
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,983
- Close that loop, now.
- lsolate the frequency.

372
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:00,382
Get us a location on the vehicles
and pull me up a file on this John McClane.

373
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,462
Rand, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for a Iocation.

374
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,304
I don't mean to harp, but we just passed
another Arby's, and I'm starving.

375
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,460
- I could eat a wrapper.
- Shut up.

376
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,622
- I could just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

377
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,383
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me.

378
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,745
Lied to you? What are you talking about?

379
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,105
The pictures on the wall -
you knew those guys.

380
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,704
- I don't...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

381
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,862
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.
Who were they?

382
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,184
OK. OK, OK.

383
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,342
They were my competition.

384
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,019
Make the next right onto Concord.

385
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,307
They said they'd developed
a mutating encryption algorithm

386
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,699
and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.

387
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,100
That's what I do. I do math-based security.

388
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,701
Here's the thing. To pull off something
as massive and crazy as a fire sale,

389
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,703
you need tons of guys to write programs,
but only a few Black Hats to implement it.

390
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,227
At that point the start-up guys, who haven't
really done anything wrong, like me...

391
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,665
Would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.

392
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,949
I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you
I had no idea I was gonna be...

393
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,899
an accessory to Armageddon.

394
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,381
Take the next left at Lexington.

395
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:28,463
And that's a sexy voice.
What's she taking us this way for?

396
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,142
- Unit 510.
- Oh, my God.

397
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,222
Clear a route for two FBl vehicles
approaching on Concord.

398
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,538
Copy, dispatch.

399
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,029
That's her.

400
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,066
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

401
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,305
- It's them.
- You're saying it's them them?

402
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:46,144
I swear to you I know her.
I would know her voice anywhere.

403
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,502
- No, don't say anything...
- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.

404
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,058
Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?

405
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,382
Gotta be pretty crazy over there,
what with all those 587s, huh?

406
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,348
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.

407
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,429
You had to dispatch all units
for all the naked people walking around?

408
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,820
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

409
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,181
Laughlin, we're getting off this route.
Turn left on 14th Street.

410
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,464
- Officer McClane.
- It's Detective McClane, asshole.

411
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,544
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get
to know each other when I visit you in prison.

412
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,827
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

413
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,946
Your address in Brooklyn,

414
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,501
the payments on your mortgage, how long
you've been a member of the NYPD.

415
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,262
And how's Holly?

416
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,423
Oh, that's sad. You're divorced.
Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?

417
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:55,470
Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought
you'd have a better pension plan annuity.

418
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,303
Oh, and it gets worse.

419
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,468
Your 401k no longer exists.

420
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:07,782
- Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.
- Box them in at that intersection.

421
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,828
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head
and drive away,

422
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,504
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block

423
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:18,948
all your debts will be wiped clean
and your children will be set for life.

424
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,466
Now, that really is tempting,
especially that last part,

425
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,542
but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.

426
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:30,662
John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.

427
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,502
You're gonna Iose.

428
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,299
Yeah, well, the other thing that could
happen is I could come and find you,

429
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,826
kick your ass and throw you out of
your own party. What about that?

430
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,105
Hold your position.

431
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,262
- He's not responding.
- (helicopter engine)

432
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,664
Get down! Get right down!

433
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,988
Just stay down!

434
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,225
Officers down at the corner of
Main and Constitution. Officers down!

435
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,785
Come on, come on, get out! Let's go!

436
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,782
Goddammit! Just stay down!

437
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,265
Get down! Just hang on!

438
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,784
Base, we've got a squad car under fire!
We need backup!

439
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,430
This is base. We're sending backup.

440
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,945
(McCIane) Just brace yourself.

441
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,619
Hang on.

442
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,189
Hang on.

443
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,108
Oh, yeah!

444
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,942
- (pilot) We Iost the tail.
- Stay with them.

445
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,702
- They're back.
- I know.

446
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,263
Take the tunnel. Left!

447
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,028
God, what are you... Oh, God!

448
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,546
Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.

449
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,109
The tunnel!

450
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,580
Open the gates on the north side entrance.

451
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,702
(cars honking)

452
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,341
Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.

453
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,384
- Now open the other side.
- What?

454
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,698
Move!

455
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,109
Hang onto something.

456
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,541
(cars honking)

457
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,781
Hey! Don't get out of the car!
Hey! Don't...

458
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,420
Just stay there! Stand still!

459
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,305
Run. Run!

460
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,105
Oh, God!

461
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,142
Don't hesitate like that again.

462
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,982
(man) Can you help me get my wife...

463
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,425
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

464
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,389
- (man #2) You OK?
- (man #3) I can't move my arms!

465
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,542
- Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.
- What?!

466
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,190
"lt can't be a uniform, John. No."

467
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,619
Get over to the wall, sir!
"Feds called in a favour."

468
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:52,627
"All you gotta do is go pick up a kid
down in Jersey, drive him down to DC."

469
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,146
"How hard can that be, huh?
It can't be that hard, can it?"

470
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:00,621
- (siren wails, then dies)
- "No, gotta be a senior detective."

471
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,663
Think a traffic jam, throwing a car
at me's gonna stop me? Huh?

472
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,786
Rand, get in there and get it done.

473
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,781
(in French)

474
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,540
This is not a good idea.

475
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,942
(chuckles)

476
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,021
(groans with pain)

477
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,949
(chuckles)

478
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,903
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- OK, sorry, sorry.

479
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,106
Are you OK? Oh, my God!

480
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,750
(explosions continue)

481
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,379
- Pretty lucky shot, huh?
- Oh, yeah, lucky. That was...

482
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,620
You just killed a helicopter with a car.

483
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,701
I was out of bullets.

484
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,429
(both chuckle)

485
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,344
- How you doin'?
- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...

486
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,749
(Iaughs)

487
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:32,063
- Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.

488
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,261
(Thomas) Rand, check in.

489
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,659
(in French)

490
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,344
What about Farrell and McClane?

491
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,384
(in French)

492
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,779
Come back in.

493
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,906
OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.

494
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,300
I just spoke to Emerson.
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

495
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,588
Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.

496
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,146
ID, sir.

497
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,900
Park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.

498
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,265
Man the gate. You're with me.

499
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,341
(alarms sound)

500
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,421
Anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.
Below that you'll need DOD clearance.

501
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,503
I don't know why you'd need to go further.
There's nothin' down there but servers.

502
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,708
(groans)

503
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,819
(man) Go again. Rodriguez! I didn't copy.

504
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,748
- Gate secured.
- Copy.

505
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,145
OK, we are in.

506
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,739
This is insane.

507
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,663
Hey! Hey, this is absurd.

508
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:49,870
Man, there's tough and there's stupid.
You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.

509
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,381
I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.

510
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,381
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No!

511
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,698
Come on.

512
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,224
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

513
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,705
He's in.

514
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,463
Get outta the way!
Make a hole, please. Come on.

515
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:34,907
Watch out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Come on.

516
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,948
NYPD. All right? I got this kid.
Come on. Let's go, kid.

517
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,181
(panicked voices)

518
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,988
Excuse me. Thanks.

519
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,379
NYPD. NYPD.

520
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,461
Coming through.

521
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,699
Sergeant?

522
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,668
Sergeant! I need to speak to you.

523
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:58,460
- The medic's in the back.
- I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.

524
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,825
Just give me a minute.

525
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,105
Sergeant!

526
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,421
(confusion of voices)

527
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,421
Oh, my God.

528
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,538
Let's get outta here.

529
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,348
Perfetto.
La sequenza due. Pronto...

530
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,466
(phone rings)

531
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,500
Siamo pronti.

532
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,461
We're a go.

533
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,541
Launch the downloads.

534
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,469
- Nothing's happening.
- Be patient.

535
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,786
- I don't know. It's not responding.
- Wait for it.

536
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:57,985
See? There you go.

537
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,508
- Tell me when the download reaches 20%.
- OK.

538
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,908
- I need you to please remain calm.
- (commotion/sirens)

539
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,421
Excuse me.

540
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,423
- Excuse me! Thank you.
- Holy shit.

541
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,660
- Kid? Kid, hey!
- Yeah, yeah.

542
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,184
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

543
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,181
Come on. Let's go.

544
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:30,582
And here you go, Agent... Tovarek.
Guess that's you.

545
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,507
- Download's at 20%.
- Time to move.

546
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,548
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

547
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:16,545
(TV reporter) Due to recent activity, Iaw
enforcement agencies are being cautious.

548
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,908
They are telling drivers to abandon
their vehicles until they are searched.

549
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,824
And, as you can see,
canine units are checking each vehicle.

550
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:28,220
Whether this is connected to
the anthrax reports we heard earlier

551
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,585
or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...

552
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,979
- FAA just grounded all flights.
- Good.

553
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:38,383
We have complete access over networks -
phones, power grids, water, nuclear.

554
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,586
- Hey, excuse me.
- Jack Parry, NSA.

555
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,265
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.
White House made the call.

556
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,104
- Anything you need, we're here to help.
- Help? Wow, that's great.

557
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:52,741
We're gonna need some work space
for our people. What can you do for us?

558
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:57,858
As you can see, we're using the space, so
you guys can stand in the corner and... Iiaise.

559
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,022
If I need something, I'll just wave to you.

560
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,423
- Wait! No, don't call.
- What are you talkin' about?

561
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,059
They probably cracked that hours ago.
They could trace us. Put it away.

562
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,868
- You sure?
- Yes.

563
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,067
Or... smash it.
You didn't have to smash it.

564
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,789
- Excuse me. It's a police emergency.
- Hey!

565
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,782
He'll call you right back.

566
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,509
Here, right in here. Come here.

567
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:44,308
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

568
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:45,789
(ringing)

569
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,907
- Yeah.
- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.

570
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,185
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

571
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,620
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to DHS.

572
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,383
They came after the kid again.
All your men are down.

573
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,623
- What about Farrell?
- I got him with me right now.

574
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,701
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

575
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,781
Yeah, I'll hold on.

576
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,748
Another day in paradise.

577
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:17,779
They just swarmed into everything - the
telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.

578
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:21,101
( "America the Beautiful"
starts up on TV)

579
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,821
(same song on all channels)

580
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:32,143
-  Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies...
- They're blanketing every station.

581
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:37,543
For amber waves of grain

582
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:43,662
For purple mountain majesties

583
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:49,461
Above the fruited plain!

584
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:55,307
America! America!

585
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,381
God shed His grace...

586
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:01,429
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news. It's on every channel.

587
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:06,868
- Been this way for a few minutes now.
-  And crown thy good with brotherhood

588
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:12,263
From sea to shining sea...

589
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,946
(shocked gasps)

590
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,067
Oh, my God.

591
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,308
McClane!

592
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,259
Look out.

593
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,863
Look out!

594
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,549
Look out.

595
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,180
Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?

596
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,500
Bowman, it's a fake.

597
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:49,062
I see it.

598
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,821
Thank God.

599
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,982
Oh, shit.

600
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,788
- McClane?
- Bowman!

601
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,701
(call cuts off)

602
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,540
Satellite's down. Get me a land line.

603
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,387
(sirens blaring)

604
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:24,463
I wrote one little piece of code and the
world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.

605
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,586
- What?
- You know, it's crazy.

606
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,264
The first time I heard of the concept
of a fire sale

607
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:33,184
I actually thought it would be cool
if anyone ever really did it.

608
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:38,822
Just hit the reset button
and melt the system just for fun.

609
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,186
Hey, it's not a system. It's a country.

610
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,421
You're talkin' about people,
a whole country full of people,

611
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,900
sitting at home alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

612
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:54,986
So finish your nostalgic moment and think
a little bit and help me catch these guys.

613
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:58,904
Just help me.
Just put yourself in their shoes.

614
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,585
Come on. If this were yourfire sale,
what would be your next move?

615
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:09,222
OK, uh, well, the whole point of a fire sale
is that it's mostly done by remote, right?

616
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:14,100
But not everything is run completely online.
Major utilities aren't.

617
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,899
They're run by closed circuits,
so you could breach the security,

618
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:21,983
but to shut it down you'd have to
physically go there. You'd have to show up.

619
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,822
And, uh...

620
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,144
- Give me that guy's PDA.
- Phones are all dead.

621
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:32,588
No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta
reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.

622
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:37,061
Hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what
these guys are using to talk to each other.

623
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,822
How do you know all this stuff?

624
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:43,062
Dude, I don't know. There's a lot
rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.

625
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,789
OK. National power grid.

626
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:49,260
Gas and electric is divided into three zones -
Eastern, Central, Western -

627
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,784
each with a primary hub.

628
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,861
Here it is.

629
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,663
- What are we looking at?
- That is the Eastern hub.

630
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:03,029
Now, they take this out, wipes out all
the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.

631
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,465
But, again, you'd have to do it manually.

632
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,305
- OK. Come on. Let's go.
- What? To West Virginia?

633
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,224
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me. McClane!

634
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,505
- You get used to it.
- McClane. Oh, shit.

635
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:21,027
Sir, wireless networks are down
and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.

636
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,102
I don't care how, you find me a line.

637
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,341
- Come on, what you got?
- We swept the building. Seems clean.

638
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:31,901
- We can sweep it again...
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

639
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:35,187
It's a fake. This guy's playin' us.

640
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,830
OK, get everyone back inside
the crisis centre now.

641
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,548
OK, let's open it up!

642
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,830
- Come on, get in.
- Door's locked.

643
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:49,265
Unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

644
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,742
Hey. Hey, don't do that!
You're gonna disable it.

645
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:56,349
Jesus Christ!

646
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,587
That was crazy. Did you see that?

647
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:03,743
Sorry about that, man.
I didn't know it'd come out so fast.

648
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,186
Man, this is a pain in the ass.
How'd you do yours?

649
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:14,188
You all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?

650
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,101
Sorry.

651
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:23,102
No, please don't touch those, OK?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

652
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,909
I mean, I've read about it.

653
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,902
RoadAssist. We've detected
an air-bag deployment.

654
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:33,347
Yes... Please, we just hit a tree
and my... my dad is having a heart attack.

655
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,785
I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.

656
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:38,543
Hold while we contact emergency services.

657
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:43,499
No, no! He's dying! I can get him
to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.

658
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:48,425
But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta
start the car for us, OK? Please, Dad...

659
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:51,024
- Your name, please?
- I'm...

660
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,822
My name is... Frank,

661
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:59,426
and my dad's name is, um... is...

662
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,827
(hesitant) Dvorak... Tsajanski.

663
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,785
Please... Please, just help us.
We need your help. Please.

664
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,986
Emergency services are on their way.

665
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:13,743
No, no, listen to me.
Ma'am, what is your name?

666
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,468
- Dolores.
- Dolores?

667
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,667
OK, Dolores, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

668
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,980
and I wanna be able to say that
a year from now.

669
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,904
Because my dad is my hero,
and right now he is in my arms dying,

670
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:29,063
and his only hope is to get to a hospital
right now. We can't wait.

671
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,345
So please start the goddamn car!

672
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,898
(engine starts)

673
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,388
Thank you, Dolores.

674
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,825
(Matt) Pass the PDA.
I gotta call the Warlock.

675
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:43,346
- The what?
- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.

676
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:04,065
-Ma'am, you're not authorised to be here.
- FBl. We suspect a security breach.

677
00:58:04,156 --> 00:58:06,829
You can't land here without authorisa...

678
00:58:25,556 --> 00:58:28,195
That was pretty good back there, kid.

679
00:58:28,276 --> 00:58:29,755
Thanks.

680
00:58:29,836 --> 00:58:33,385
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

681
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,865
No. I'm just...

682
00:58:35,956 --> 00:58:40,472
- Well, what? What's the matter you?
- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.

683
00:58:40,556 --> 00:58:42,990
What's that mean? Like what?

684
00:58:43,076 --> 00:58:47,627
I'm not, like, heroic and everything.
I'm not brave like you are.

685
00:58:47,716 --> 00:58:50,310
- I'm not that guy.
- I'm nobody's hero, kid.

686
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:52,910
You've saved my life, like,
ten times in six hours.

687
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:56,068
Just doing my job, that's all.

688
00:58:57,556 --> 00:59:02,232
Know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing. You get shot at.

689
00:59:02,316 --> 00:59:06,229
You get a little pat on the back,
blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.

690
00:59:08,756 --> 00:59:10,906
You get divorced.

691
00:59:10,996 --> 00:59:13,954
A wife that can't remember your last name.

692
00:59:14,036 --> 00:59:16,345
Your kids don't wanna talk to you.

693
00:59:17,556 --> 00:59:20,593
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

694
00:59:20,676 --> 00:59:24,112
Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.

695
00:59:24,636 --> 00:59:28,424
- Then why are you doin' this?
- Cos there's nobody else to do it right now.

696
00:59:28,516 --> 00:59:31,474
If there was somebody else to do it,
I would let them do it.

697
00:59:31,556 --> 00:59:34,389
But there's not. So we're doin' it.

698
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:36,151
Ah.

699
00:59:36,236 --> 00:59:38,431
And that's what makes you that guy.

700
00:59:46,956 --> 00:59:48,867
Thing's flying now.

701
00:59:48,956 --> 00:59:51,754
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

702
00:59:58,156 --> 01:00:01,705
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted acc...

703
01:00:25,316 --> 01:00:27,750
Stay here.

704
01:00:55,476 --> 01:00:57,467
All right, come on.

705
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:18,069
- We're in.
- Good. Shut it down.

706
01:01:28,156 --> 01:01:30,272
Guess you were right, kid.

707
01:01:30,356 --> 01:01:33,473
OK, that's... awful.

708
01:01:35,116 --> 01:01:36,834
We got company.

709
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:47,665
- How would they shut down a power grid?
- What?

710
01:01:47,756 --> 01:01:51,715
- Come on.
- Uh... Central control room. OK...

711
01:01:53,196 --> 01:01:56,268
- Uh, fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Come on.

712
01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:01,070
You take the right.

713
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:06,669
- (door opens and closes)
- Oh, shit.

714
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,314
Shh.

715
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:11,107
- Can we stop for...
- Try to keep up.

716
01:02:11,196 --> 01:02:14,233
I am! I just wanna stop for two seconds
to catch our breath.

717
01:02:14,316 --> 01:02:17,592
You know, they have these things
called gymnasiums.

718
01:02:37,596 --> 01:02:40,110
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

719
01:02:51,876 --> 01:02:54,470
Intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.

720
01:02:54,556 --> 01:02:57,309
It's the only way
to avoid signal triangulation.

721
01:02:57,396 --> 01:02:59,705
With the amount of hardware they're running,

722
01:02:59,796 --> 01:03:04,267
we're probably looking for a large vehicle,
most likely a semitrailer rig.

723
01:03:04,356 --> 01:03:06,950
All right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security

724
01:03:07,036 --> 01:03:10,790
we need every agent, satellite
and functioning network they got. Now.

725
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:31,074
Play time's over, sweetheart.

726
01:03:31,156 --> 01:03:32,271
Don't.

727
01:03:32,356 --> 01:03:34,745
Take your hand off the gun. Hands up.

728
01:03:35,476 --> 01:03:37,467
Stand up.

729
01:03:43,356 --> 01:03:45,665
Go on. Now!

730
01:03:45,756 --> 01:03:48,395
Let's go, kid. You're up.

731
01:03:48,476 --> 01:03:50,068
OK...

732
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:53,154
As fast as you can.

733
01:03:56,076 --> 01:03:57,145
Jesus!

734
01:04:13,276 --> 01:04:15,267
That's enough of this kung fu shit.

735
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:19,588
I've known some bitches in my day,
but you are maybe the...

736
01:04:24,516 --> 01:04:26,427
Still awake, huh?

737
01:04:26,516 --> 01:04:28,666
- Just keep doin' what you're doin'.
- OK.

738
01:04:28,756 --> 01:04:31,190
- How much time do you need?
- Um... Not much.

739
01:04:39,516 --> 01:04:40,995
Whoo.

740
01:04:44,036 --> 01:04:46,504
- Are you done?
- l, uh...

741
01:04:46,596 --> 01:04:48,427
- Are you done?
- No, not quite.

742
01:04:48,516 --> 01:04:51,394
- What?
- I'm not exactly checking my email here.

743
01:04:52,676 --> 01:04:55,986
They used VM mode, so I'm isolating
their APl and booting the host.

744
01:04:56,076 --> 01:04:59,307
- What?!
- It means about 30 seconds, OK?

745
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,671
Not the easiest thing to do when...

746
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,508
OK...

747
01:05:16,396 --> 01:05:18,512
Undo everything you just did. Now!

748
01:05:18,596 --> 01:05:20,712
OK. OK, OK.

749
01:05:21,436 --> 01:05:25,475
I'm a righty, I'm a righty.
I need my other hand, I really do.

750
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:27,755
I'm a righty.

751
01:05:59,796 --> 01:06:02,549
One last door to open.

752
01:06:02,636 --> 01:06:06,470
Do you know what you're doing? Do you
realise what this'll do to the country?

753
01:06:06,556 --> 01:06:10,469
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

754
01:06:10,556 --> 01:06:13,946
OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.

755
01:06:20,156 --> 01:06:22,909
You do? I'm glad you know.

756
01:06:38,116 --> 01:06:39,993
How you doin'?

757
01:06:48,636 --> 01:06:50,228
Hang on.

758
01:06:57,876 --> 01:06:59,468
(screams)

759
01:08:00,516 --> 01:08:03,474
Listen, let's just talk about this
for one second.

760
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,788
How you doin'?
That's not too tight, is it?

761
01:08:13,676 --> 01:08:15,553
Damn it!

762
01:08:17,436 --> 01:08:19,392
Smile pretty!

763
01:08:23,956 --> 01:08:26,231
(creaking)

764
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:52,865
McClane!

765
01:08:55,076 --> 01:08:56,794
Shit.

766
01:08:57,396 --> 01:08:59,864
McClane, get out of there!

767
01:09:00,996 --> 01:09:03,146
Come on, man! Come on!

768
01:09:06,436 --> 01:09:09,030
Come on, man.

769
01:09:28,356 --> 01:09:29,914
Did you see that?

770
01:09:29,996 --> 01:09:33,033
(triumphant Iaugh and yell)

771
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:35,627
(McCIane) So you stopped it, right?

772
01:09:35,716 --> 01:09:38,947
You know, a gun to your head
makes it harder to do this kind of work.

773
01:09:39,036 --> 01:09:42,312
- What?
- I know that comes as a surprise.

774
01:09:45,076 --> 01:09:48,352
- Can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?
- I'm not sure.

775
01:09:50,596 --> 01:09:53,269
I might be able to slow 'em down, though.

776
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:59,154
Western and Central hubs are ours.
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

777
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:02,785
Hang on. Something's up.
All the security's reactivating.

778
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:08,751
I think someone might be in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

779
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:13,432
Now your girlfriend's dead,
why don't you check out our sexy singles?

780
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:15,874
It's an e-bomb.

781
01:10:17,396 --> 01:10:19,705
(phone rings)

782
01:10:22,236 --> 01:10:23,954
Hey...

783
01:10:27,636 --> 01:10:29,069
All right, wait, wait.

784
01:10:32,716 --> 01:10:35,150
- Mai, talk to me. What's going on?
- Mai?

785
01:10:36,076 --> 01:10:39,955
Oh, yeah - little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

786
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:43,745
I don't think she's gonna be talking
to anybody for a really long time.

787
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:49,035
Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom
of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.

788
01:10:49,876 --> 01:10:52,788
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

789
01:10:52,876 --> 01:10:56,266
Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.

790
01:10:58,036 --> 01:11:02,314
Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna
come and I'm gonna kick your ass.

791
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:08,266
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

792
01:11:08,356 --> 01:11:10,916
When I'm finished here -
and I promise it'll be soon -

793
01:11:10,996 --> 01:11:14,625
I will focus all my attention... on you.

794
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:18,549
You wanna make things personal, fine.

795
01:11:37,796 --> 01:11:43,029
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

796
01:11:43,596 --> 01:11:48,033
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure. I can get anyone on it.

797
01:11:48,116 --> 01:11:49,231
Do it.

798
01:11:49,316 --> 01:11:51,113
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

799
01:11:54,596 --> 01:11:56,473
Please, no.

800
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,273
- It's Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit.

801
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:04,033
- (McCIane) You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

802
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:07,506
He was DOD's chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

803
01:12:07,596 --> 01:12:11,475
After 9/11, he's the guy that told
Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.

804
01:12:11,556 --> 01:12:15,515
He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't
listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.

805
01:12:15,596 --> 01:12:17,154
You think so?

806
01:12:17,236 --> 01:12:20,308
When he tried to go public,
they crucified him.

807
01:12:20,396 --> 01:12:24,435
Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.
After that he disappeared.

808
01:12:24,516 --> 01:12:26,825
- (beeping)
- We got a pretty serious problem.

809
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:28,986
Hold on one minute.
What?

810
01:12:29,076 --> 01:12:32,955
I think we need to get out of here right now.

811
01:12:33,036 --> 01:12:36,426
- They're sending the gas lines here.
- Gas lines? What gas lines?

812
01:12:36,516 --> 01:12:38,108
Christ.

813
01:12:38,196 --> 01:12:43,111
Oh... all of them. See that,
those flashing arrows? That's not good.

814
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:46,586
- All that's coming here?
- Yeah. I think we gotta go.

815
01:12:46,676 --> 01:12:49,952
Listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.

816
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:52,345
McClane? McClane?

817
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:54,666
Let's go. Finish this up.

818
01:12:56,356 --> 01:12:57,869
(rumbling)

819
01:13:00,036 --> 01:13:03,267
Right now. Finish it up, come on! Let's go!

820
01:13:21,676 --> 01:13:23,109
Get in there!

821
01:14:07,236 --> 01:14:09,955
You OK?

822
01:14:10,036 --> 01:14:13,392
(coughing and spluttering)

823
01:14:13,476 --> 01:14:17,435
- Let's go. We gotta get outta here.
- What is the point? Man, what is the point?

824
01:14:17,516 --> 01:14:19,711
Hey, knock that off, come on.

825
01:14:19,796 --> 01:14:25,154
This has something to do with that code you
wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.

826
01:14:25,236 --> 01:14:28,831
Win? When do we start winning? Huh?

827
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:33,068
Look around. Are you out of your mind?
Does it look like we're close to winning?

828
01:14:33,156 --> 01:14:35,545
We just got the shit kicked out of us!

829
01:14:35,636 --> 01:14:37,627
You think I'm holding out on you?

830
01:14:37,716 --> 01:14:41,550
If I knew what they wanted, I would tell you!
I would happily tell you!

831
01:14:42,196 --> 01:14:43,914
Jesus.

832
01:15:18,676 --> 01:15:21,554
The Warlock. The Warlock.

833
01:15:21,636 --> 01:15:24,548
Oh, great. Ah! There goes the cellphone.

834
01:15:24,636 --> 01:15:28,106
- They knocked satellites out of the skies?
- No, your battery ran out.

835
01:15:28,196 --> 01:15:29,914
- We should go see him.
- Who?

836
01:15:29,996 --> 01:15:32,669
The Warlock. We should drive
to his house in Baltimore.

837
01:15:32,756 --> 01:15:36,385
- Can't go to the Warlock's house now.
- Hey! This is me helping you.

838
01:15:36,476 --> 01:15:41,630
OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.
That's our only hope.

839
01:15:45,796 --> 01:15:49,675
- How do you feel about flying?
- Uh, about what? Like, with a pilot?

840
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:59,555
- Just stick it in the round thing.
- What brown thing?

841
01:15:59,636 --> 01:16:02,309
Here, put these on.

842
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:04,864
Just stick it in there. That'll work.

843
01:16:04,956 --> 01:16:08,790
- You OK?
- Uh, yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.

844
01:16:08,876 --> 01:16:11,231
- I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

845
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:14,626
Yeah. I took some lessons.
Face your fears, that kind of thing.

846
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:17,549
- Yeah? Did it help?
- Not really.

847
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:22,155
(engine starts up)

848
01:16:22,236 --> 01:16:25,069
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yeah.

849
01:16:26,636 --> 01:16:30,948
- Maybe we should just drive.
- Take it easy. Taking off's the hardest part.

850
01:16:31,036 --> 01:16:32,515
Really? I heard...

851
01:16:32,596 --> 01:16:36,908
- To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.
- Ha, ha, ha! You did? Really?

852
01:16:36,996 --> 01:16:41,228
But you have your licence, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these things?

853
01:16:41,316 --> 01:16:44,752
- Oh, God.
- Hey-hey, here we go! We're up.

854
01:16:44,836 --> 01:16:46,633
Oh, God.

855
01:16:50,756 --> 01:16:53,509
That's good. That's pretty good.

856
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:57,714
Jesus, look at that.
This whole area's blacked out.

857
01:16:59,756 --> 01:17:01,951
How we gonna find Warlock's house?

858
01:17:02,036 --> 01:17:05,108
Um, it's probably gonna be
the one with the lights still on.

859
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:17,790
Power outage keeps spreading. About half
the East Coast has already gone down.

860
01:17:17,876 --> 01:17:21,232
All right. Put everything
on emergency generators.

861
01:17:21,316 --> 01:17:23,705
How the hell are they getting past us?

862
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:29,312
OK. Down there, down there. I see it.

863
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:31,034
- Down there?
- Left. Down.

864
01:17:34,756 --> 01:17:37,634
What? Are we gonna land down there?

865
01:17:39,356 --> 01:17:42,314
- All right, hang on.
- OK, OK. Ohhh!

866
01:17:44,276 --> 01:17:46,028
Fence. Fence. Fence!

867
01:17:48,396 --> 01:17:49,988
- Fence. Fence!
- I see it.

868
01:17:50,636 --> 01:17:51,989
Watch...

869
01:17:53,156 --> 01:17:55,033
Ow! Ohhh!

870
01:17:57,876 --> 01:18:00,515
(Matt whoops with relief)

871
01:18:03,516 --> 01:18:05,347
- Oh, Jesus.
- Come on.

872
01:18:05,436 --> 01:18:08,746
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
"Taking off's the hardest part."

873
01:18:08,836 --> 01:18:09,746
Let's go.

874
01:18:12,796 --> 01:18:17,506
Now, there's something you need to know
about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?

875
01:18:17,596 --> 01:18:20,747
So just let me do all the talking, OK?

876
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:29,106
(clears throat)

877
01:18:29,196 --> 01:18:31,027
Shit.

878
01:18:31,116 --> 01:18:33,311
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.

879
01:18:33,396 --> 01:18:34,988
Um, is Freddy home?

880
01:18:36,876 --> 01:18:39,788
I'm Matt Farrell and this is, uh...

881
01:18:39,876 --> 01:18:41,594
Billy.

882
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:46,386
We're friends from... Space Camp.
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.

883
01:18:47,836 --> 01:18:49,713
Freddy!

884
01:18:49,796 --> 01:18:52,356
- Freddy?
- You got company!

885
01:18:58,556 --> 01:19:01,593
Frederick! Didn't you hear me?

886
01:19:01,676 --> 01:19:03,632
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

887
01:19:03,716 --> 01:19:06,788
- Your friends are here.
- Friends? What the...?

888
01:19:07,396 --> 01:19:11,275
Come on, Ma! How many times I gotta
tell you, don't bring people down here?

889
01:19:11,356 --> 01:19:16,111
I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded
Han Solo? You've lost so much weight!

890
01:19:16,196 --> 01:19:19,313
No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?
Know what? Doesn't matter.

891
01:19:19,396 --> 01:19:23,867
Dude, what are you doin' here? Cos of you,
I'm rocking five generators to stay online.

892
01:19:23,956 --> 01:19:30,065
And since you're being hunted by assassins,
this visit is not a healthy use of my time.

893
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:32,954
And hey, don't touch that, all right?

894
01:19:33,036 --> 01:19:36,711
CB radio?
A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?

895
01:19:36,796 --> 01:19:40,266
That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, OK?

896
01:19:40,356 --> 01:19:43,712
So when the last microchip goes down,
I can contact whoever's there,

897
01:19:43,796 --> 01:19:45,912
whether they be zombies or not.

898
01:19:45,996 --> 01:19:50,069
- What'd you bring your dad here for?
- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.

899
01:19:50,156 --> 01:19:52,226
Nice poster.

900
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:58,428
- Oh, what? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?
- No. I was always more of a Star Wars guy.

901
01:19:59,116 --> 01:20:01,710
- Star Wars guy. Who is this man?
- He's my...

902
01:20:01,796 --> 01:20:04,105
Hey, dump truck. I'm not his dad.

903
01:20:04,196 --> 01:20:08,075
- I'm a cop. How 'bout that?
- Oh. A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.

904
01:20:08,156 --> 01:20:10,386
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command centre?

905
01:20:10,476 --> 01:20:13,513
(Iaughs) Command centre! It's a basement.

906
01:20:13,596 --> 01:20:15,905
- It's a command centre!
- I can explain.

907
01:20:15,996 --> 01:20:19,705
Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
That's why we came here.

908
01:20:19,796 --> 01:20:21,787
Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.

909
01:20:21,876 --> 01:20:24,106
Get out! I want you outta here, right now.

910
01:20:24,196 --> 01:20:27,313
Hey, calm down. Just calm down, big boy!

911
01:20:27,396 --> 01:20:29,705
You calm down! It's my house!

912
01:20:29,796 --> 01:20:34,312
You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,
or I'll beat you to death in your own house.

913
01:20:48,156 --> 01:20:52,354
Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas
Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?

914
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,472
First day on the job, tells his bosses

915
01:20:54,556 --> 01:20:57,992
this nation's security infrastructure
is open to compromise.

916
01:20:58,076 --> 01:21:03,070
They say, "We'll take it under advisement."
But he don't ease up cos he is committed.

917
01:21:03,156 --> 01:21:05,954
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

918
01:21:06,036 --> 01:21:10,746
and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD
and shuts down our defence network.

919
01:21:10,836 --> 01:21:14,033
So they put a gun to the man's head
and forced him to stop the hack.

920
01:21:14,116 --> 01:21:18,109
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.

921
01:21:18,196 --> 01:21:20,835
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Tell us how to find him.

922
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:23,953
How do I know? He's a ghost, man.
He just fell off the grid.

923
01:21:24,036 --> 01:21:26,152
- Another dead end. Come on.
- Wait.

924
01:21:26,236 --> 01:21:29,512
Listen, Warlock,
a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...

925
01:21:29,596 --> 01:21:34,989
A mutating algorithmic security code, that's
probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.

926
01:21:35,076 --> 01:21:38,273
No, we know that. Yes.
Can you tell us what he's using it for?

927
01:21:38,356 --> 01:21:41,985
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure that out. Here, look.

928
01:21:42,076 --> 01:21:45,113
The only security system in the country
that I can find

929
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:49,474
currently employing that template
is the Social Security Administration.

930
01:21:49,556 --> 01:21:54,710
But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.
They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.

931
01:21:54,796 --> 01:21:57,788
- Whoa. What the hell? God!
- I know, right?

932
01:21:57,876 --> 01:22:01,425
- What are you talkin' about?
- The power consumption's off the charts.

933
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:05,065
- It's hot. It's on fire.
- (Matt) Why are there chilling towers?

934
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:06,475
Hello.

935
01:22:06,556 --> 01:22:08,945
What's a chilling tower?

936
01:22:09,036 --> 01:22:11,345
See what I've been dealing with?

937
01:22:11,436 --> 01:22:14,872
Large server farms generate a lot of heat
and need to be cooled.

938
01:22:14,956 --> 01:22:16,309
But why there?

939
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:21,026
I don't know what's in that building,
but it's not Social Security numbers.

940
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:31,265
I got a red flag over here!
Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.

941
01:22:32,076 --> 01:22:35,148
Honing in on the host server right now.

942
01:22:35,836 --> 01:22:37,906
"Frederick Kaludis."

943
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:40,066
- Let's have a look at him.
- Fat bastard.

944
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:46,195
McClane.

945
01:22:46,276 --> 01:22:50,508
- Where is his daughter?
- We just got a trace on her cell.

946
01:22:50,596 --> 01:22:52,109
You'll love this.

947
01:22:56,196 --> 01:22:58,710
All right. Let's get a better look at you.

948
01:23:00,836 --> 01:23:03,225
(powering up)

949
01:23:10,356 --> 01:23:12,153
- (Gabriel) Freddy?
- What?

950
01:23:12,236 --> 01:23:15,672
What the hell are you doing
dickin' around inside my network?

951
01:23:19,876 --> 01:23:21,594
McCIane?

952
01:23:21,676 --> 01:23:23,507
I thought I killed you already.

953
01:23:23,596 --> 01:23:25,507
I get that sometimes.

954
01:23:28,516 --> 01:23:31,906
- You think you can try to track where he is?
- Dude, yeah.

955
01:23:31,996 --> 01:23:36,831
Detective, covering the camera with your
hand does not turn off the microphone.

956
01:23:38,076 --> 01:23:43,992
Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys
with all this computer shit,

957
01:23:44,076 --> 01:23:47,591
but, hey, I'm still alive, ain't l?

958
01:23:48,436 --> 01:23:53,749
I mean, you got to be runnin' out
of bad guys by now, right? Huh?

959
01:23:56,316 --> 01:23:58,227
Gabriel?

960
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:02,987
Honestly, you can tell me.
How does that work?

961
01:24:03,076 --> 01:24:07,672
You got some kind of service?
Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?

962
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:10,031
And I bet you're still on hold with,

963
01:24:10,116 --> 01:24:15,429
"Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch
over here right away?" Huh?

964
01:24:15,516 --> 01:24:21,273
But seriously, all that kicking aside, that
skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.

965
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:24,507
One of those gotta be real hard
to come by, right?

966
01:24:24,596 --> 01:24:28,111
- You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

967
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,948
Yeah?

968
01:24:31,716 --> 01:24:33,547
Is this one of them?

969
01:24:37,836 --> 01:24:40,589
- (Lucy) Hello?
- Yes, this is Emergency Services.

970
01:24:40,676 --> 01:24:42,428
- Thank God.
- Can she hear me?

971
01:24:42,516 --> 01:24:46,065
My name is Lucy Gennero.
I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.

972
01:24:46,156 --> 01:24:48,875
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone!

973
01:24:48,956 --> 01:24:52,949
Yes, calm down, miss.
We know exactly where you are.

974
01:24:53,036 --> 01:24:54,833
Everything is gonna be all right.

975
01:24:54,916 --> 01:24:59,387
- Lucy, hang up the phone!
- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.

976
01:25:02,036 --> 01:25:04,914
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

977
01:25:04,996 --> 01:25:07,430
but I assure you
we're gonna get you out of there.

978
01:25:07,516 --> 01:25:11,668
- Even if I have to come down there myself.
- Thank you.

979
01:25:11,756 --> 01:25:15,192
In the meantime, is there anyone
we can contact for you?

980
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,914
Yeah.

981
01:25:17,676 --> 01:25:19,826
My dad.

982
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:23,465
His name is John McClane.
He's a New York City cop.

983
01:25:24,116 --> 01:25:30,066
We'II find him. Just hang in there, miss,
and we'II get to you... very soon.

984
01:25:31,596 --> 01:25:33,507
Thank you.

985
01:25:34,516 --> 01:25:39,146
Wow. That's a great girl you got there.
Can't wait to meet her.

986
01:25:39,596 --> 01:25:42,064
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

987
01:25:42,156 --> 01:25:44,147
Come on, John.

988
01:25:45,316 --> 01:25:47,750
Make a joke.

989
01:25:47,836 --> 01:25:50,748
Say somethin' funny.

990
01:25:51,156 --> 01:25:52,271
(Iow whistle)

991
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:58,786
Where...?
(whispers) Where you goin'?

992
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:03,587
Hey! McClane! Hold on.
Where you goin'? What are you gonna do?

993
01:26:03,676 --> 01:26:07,715
What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go kill this guy and get my daughter.

994
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:11,709
- But she can be anywhere...
- Listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.

995
01:26:11,796 --> 01:26:15,232
- I think l...
- Hey, I'm doing you a favour.

996
01:26:15,316 --> 01:26:17,625
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

997
01:26:17,716 --> 01:26:19,627
I'll take it from here.

998
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:22,025
Thanks for your help.

999
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:32,350
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

1000
01:26:34,076 --> 01:26:36,067
Buckle up.

1001
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:03,111
FBl, ma'am. Jersey field office.

1002
01:27:03,196 --> 01:27:05,107
Mind if I see your lD?

1003
01:27:05,196 --> 01:27:07,187
Not at all.

1004
01:27:15,876 --> 01:27:18,151
My dad's a cop. Force of habit.

1005
01:27:18,796 --> 01:27:22,106
Your father sounds like a very smart man.

1006
01:27:26,396 --> 01:27:28,626
Kid, can you get Bowman?

1007
01:27:28,716 --> 01:27:30,707
Uh, yeah.

1008
01:27:39,956 --> 01:27:41,867
It's completely dead.

1009
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:45,426
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links. Shit.

1010
01:27:50,476 --> 01:27:52,865
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

1011
01:27:55,316 --> 01:27:57,466
About all of it.

1012
01:27:57,556 --> 01:28:00,275
It was my fault you got into this.
This wasn't your fight.

1013
01:28:00,356 --> 01:28:01,994
You got nothin' to be sorry about.

1014
01:28:03,996 --> 01:28:05,907
(bell)

1015
01:28:06,876 --> 01:28:09,754
- Let go of me, you bastard!
- This bitch is a handful.

1016
01:28:15,516 --> 01:28:17,791
Are you gonna be all right?

1017
01:28:19,316 --> 01:28:22,228
Hey! Behave or I will hurt you.

1018
01:28:22,316 --> 01:28:27,185
Oh, yeah? Let's step outside,
just you and me. We'll see who hurts who.

1019
01:28:28,996 --> 01:28:31,226
You really are his daughter.

1020
01:28:31,316 --> 01:28:32,908
Tie her wrists.

1021
01:28:39,796 --> 01:28:42,026
Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.

1022
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:44,550
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

1023
01:28:45,796 --> 01:28:47,115
OK.

1024
01:28:48,036 --> 01:28:50,675
I'll be back in a second.

1025
01:28:55,316 --> 01:28:57,147
No, no, no, please!

1026
01:29:39,396 --> 01:29:43,230
- (alarm)
- We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.

1027
01:29:47,316 --> 01:29:49,625
Go take a look.

1028
01:29:50,156 --> 01:29:52,306
Don't be long. We're packing up soon.

1029
01:30:03,476 --> 01:30:07,025
Hey, McClane, do we have anything
resembling a plan?

1030
01:30:07,116 --> 01:30:09,072
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

1031
01:30:09,156 --> 01:30:12,865
No, I mean more like a plan.
Like, a way to do that.

1032
01:30:14,996 --> 01:30:16,907
Come on.

1033
01:30:17,916 --> 01:30:23,912
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

1034
01:30:28,196 --> 01:30:30,187
I think mine's locked.

1035
01:30:33,716 --> 01:30:37,425
OK. Now it looks like
we're gettin' somewhere.

1036
01:30:43,716 --> 01:30:45,627
Uh...

1037
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:53,030
OK, this looks like it controls the cooling
system for the mainframe, which should be...

1038
01:30:53,956 --> 01:30:55,867
If I can just hack in...

1039
01:30:57,516 --> 01:31:00,235
and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.

1040
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:05,907
(alarm)

1041
01:31:08,356 --> 01:31:10,074
Someone set off the alarms.

1042
01:31:10,156 --> 01:31:14,115
Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.
Find a way to turn it off.

1043
01:31:18,116 --> 01:31:20,072
What have you got?

1044
01:31:21,076 --> 01:31:24,432
We got a problem.
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

1045
01:31:25,676 --> 01:31:27,507
It's gotta be him.

1046
01:31:27,596 --> 01:31:29,712
And what's Woodlawn?

1047
01:31:33,676 --> 01:31:37,589
It's NSA - a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

1048
01:31:37,676 --> 01:31:42,227
It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11
to back up all financial information.

1049
01:31:42,316 --> 01:31:47,106
The moment networks were hit, all financial
data began downloading to those servers.

1050
01:31:47,196 --> 01:31:52,065
Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,
government funds - all of it.

1051
01:31:52,156 --> 01:31:55,831
Basically, a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

1052
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:58,225
All in one location?

1053
01:31:59,316 --> 01:32:00,908
What could Gabriel do with it?

1054
01:32:00,996 --> 01:32:04,784
If he could get in, he might try to transfer
the data to a portable hard drive.

1055
01:32:04,876 --> 01:32:10,508
Then he'd have access to those accounts from
anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.

1056
01:32:10,596 --> 01:32:12,109
We couldn't trace it.

1057
01:32:12,196 --> 01:32:17,873
Or, knowing him, he could erase it all
and send us all back to the Stone Age.

1058
01:32:17,956 --> 01:32:23,110
- Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.

1059
01:32:23,196 --> 01:32:25,187
My pay grade?

1060
01:32:27,436 --> 01:32:32,794
How the hell did Gabriel find out about this
when even I didn't know about it?

1061
01:32:34,756 --> 01:32:36,792
He designed it.

1062
01:32:38,276 --> 01:32:39,994
It was his program.

1063
01:32:40,076 --> 01:32:45,150
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

1064
01:32:45,236 --> 01:32:46,749
That's brilliant.

1065
01:32:46,836 --> 01:32:50,545
You two geniuses, stay out of my way.

1066
01:32:52,196 --> 01:32:54,187
(alarm sounds)

1067
01:32:55,596 --> 01:32:59,191
Let me see if I can get a floor plan
of this place.

1068
01:32:59,716 --> 01:33:01,593
Don't move!

1069
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:04,110
You, get away from the bag. Now!

1070
01:33:04,196 --> 01:33:05,754
OK, OK.

1071
01:33:05,836 --> 01:33:07,986
We've been waiting for you.

1072
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:11,947
Yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.

1073
01:33:33,876 --> 01:33:36,344
(Ioud whirr of machinery)

1074
01:33:38,156 --> 01:33:39,908
McClane!

1075
01:33:41,196 --> 01:33:42,629
McClane!

1076
01:33:45,156 --> 01:33:46,475
Kid?

1077
01:33:46,876 --> 01:33:47,945
Matt?

1078
01:33:48,036 --> 01:33:49,105
Kid!

1079
01:34:01,956 --> 01:34:04,072
(Gabriel) Emerson.

1080
01:34:04,956 --> 01:34:07,265
We have a problem in
one of the cooling towers.

1081
01:34:07,356 --> 01:34:08,675
- Tower seven.
- Tower seven.

1082
01:34:08,756 --> 01:34:10,030
Find out what's going on.

1083
01:34:10,116 --> 01:34:12,266
Arrivo subito. OK.

1084
01:34:19,836 --> 01:34:20,825
Sir?

1085
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:23,510
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get to Woodlawn.

1086
01:34:23,596 --> 01:34:26,269
The roads out are blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

1087
01:34:26,356 --> 01:34:28,108
Then get us some helicopters.

1088
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:31,029
They were all pulled by the Pentagon
for search and rescue.

1089
01:34:31,116 --> 01:34:34,950
Molina, find me
some goddamn helicopters immediately.

1090
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:38,394
Look, the Pentagon
has jets flying CAP over DC.

1091
01:34:38,476 --> 01:34:41,309
Have them send one to Woodlawn
and keep an eye on things.

1092
01:34:41,396 --> 01:34:43,387
Let's go.

1093
01:34:50,156 --> 01:34:52,272
(man grunts)

1094
01:34:54,076 --> 01:34:56,067
Where's my daughter?

1095
01:34:56,156 --> 01:34:58,465
(Gabriel) Russo, check in.

1096
01:35:01,316 --> 01:35:06,231
Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1097
01:35:06,316 --> 01:35:09,547
Hold on a minute.
Looks like he's coming around.

1098
01:35:09,876 --> 01:35:12,629
- It's McClane! He's on the third floor!
- (gunshot)

1099
01:35:16,116 --> 01:35:19,233
Get all that? That's right.

1100
01:35:19,316 --> 01:35:22,786
I'm on the third floor.
But I'm coming to get you.

1101
01:35:30,956 --> 01:35:33,345
Don't move now. I'll send a doctor.

1102
01:35:36,396 --> 01:35:38,864
Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.

1103
01:35:40,476 --> 01:35:42,148
Je vous rejoins.

1104
01:36:23,316 --> 01:36:25,113
My algorithm.

1105
01:36:26,476 --> 01:36:27,955
(footsteps)

1106
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,350
OK, please, God.

1107
01:36:33,796 --> 01:36:35,752
Oh, please, God...

1108
01:37:10,396 --> 01:37:13,786
Oh, Jesus, they're going after the money.

1109
01:37:35,356 --> 01:37:38,154
You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?

1110
01:37:38,236 --> 01:37:40,352
Yep, that's my plan.

1111
01:37:40,436 --> 01:37:43,667
What makes you think I won't put a bullet
in your daughter's head?

1112
01:37:43,756 --> 01:37:46,907
- Cos you're scared of me.
- You think I'm afraid of you?

1113
01:37:47,596 --> 01:37:50,747
Otherwise she'd be dead already.
You need a bargaining chip.

1114
01:37:57,436 --> 01:38:00,075
Stop there! Hands up.

1115
01:38:00,156 --> 01:38:02,511
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

1116
01:38:02,596 --> 01:38:05,235
Eccoti qui, piccolo stronzo.

1117
01:38:05,316 --> 01:38:07,466
Move away. Move!

1118
01:38:14,396 --> 01:38:18,309
You know, John, I feel like
we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

1119
01:38:18,396 --> 01:38:21,832
And because of that,
you think I'm the bad guy.

1120
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:24,589
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I'm the good guy.

1121
01:38:24,676 --> 01:38:28,032
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1122
01:38:28,116 --> 01:38:31,552
Did I get a thank-you?
No, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.

1123
01:38:31,636 --> 01:38:35,311
- You got their attention now, don't you?
- That's right.

1124
01:38:35,396 --> 01:38:39,867
- I am doing the country a favour.
- (chuckles) By tearing it apart.

1125
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:44,871
Better me than some outsider.
Some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.

1126
01:38:44,956 --> 01:38:47,516
Nobody wants to see that happen.

1127
01:38:47,596 --> 01:38:53,592
Everything I've broken can be fixed
if the country is willing to pay for it.

1128
01:38:53,676 --> 01:38:56,827
Ah, bullshit.
It's always been about the money.

1129
01:38:56,916 --> 01:39:00,955
What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?
I'm working my ass off here, John.

1130
01:39:01,036 --> 01:39:04,551
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a cheque for you.

1131
01:39:07,516 --> 01:39:12,112
I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,
see if you can get him to focus.

1132
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:13,185
Dad?

1133
01:39:16,076 --> 01:39:18,032
Hi, baby.

1134
01:39:18,116 --> 01:39:21,267
Now there are only five of them.

1135
01:39:22,756 --> 01:39:25,224
Hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'.

1136
01:39:27,076 --> 01:39:28,987
(sighs)

1137
01:39:35,036 --> 01:39:38,506
Would somebody
please kill this son of a bitch?

1138
01:39:39,956 --> 01:39:41,833
We have a problem.

1139
01:39:42,556 --> 01:39:46,390
There's actually no problem.
I just got off on the wrong floor.

1140
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,907
This is a mess.

1141
01:39:52,756 --> 01:39:56,795
Wow. I'm truly impressed, man.
Hacking every byte of financial data

1142
01:39:56,876 --> 01:40:00,949
for the entire country'd take weeks
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1143
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:04,073
That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?

1144
01:40:04,156 --> 01:40:07,228
- That's brilliant.
- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.

1145
01:40:07,316 --> 01:40:09,705
- Asshole.
- Who are you?

1146
01:40:10,316 --> 01:40:11,795
Matt Farrell.

1147
01:40:12,596 --> 01:40:14,826
Lucy McClane.

1148
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:18,226
I thought your name was Gennero.
Lucy Gennero.

1149
01:40:18,316 --> 01:40:20,034
Not today.

1150
01:40:20,116 --> 01:40:23,904
- Can you crack the code?
- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.

1151
01:40:23,996 --> 01:40:26,146
That's encouraging.

1152
01:40:27,756 --> 01:40:29,951
Take them with us.

1153
01:40:30,036 --> 01:40:32,072
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1154
01:40:34,556 --> 01:40:37,195
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1155
01:40:37,276 --> 01:40:39,267
Keep an eye on it.

1156
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:43,988
Pulling down the "go" codes now.

1157
01:40:58,876 --> 01:41:02,425
You might wanna think about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

1158
01:41:08,756 --> 01:41:11,350
Christ. Goddamn hamster!

1159
01:41:11,996 --> 01:41:13,349
There you go.

1160
01:41:13,436 --> 01:41:15,791
Stay still, spider-boy!

1161
01:41:19,636 --> 01:41:21,354
That's right.

1162
01:41:49,236 --> 01:41:50,988
Goddammit!

1163
01:41:59,796 --> 01:42:00,911
Oh, no!

1164
01:42:03,276 --> 01:42:07,554
You probably shouldn't antagonise them,
since they have all the loaded guns.

1165
01:42:07,636 --> 01:42:11,868
Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger
set of balls, cos you're gonna need 'em.

1166
01:42:11,956 --> 01:42:16,825
Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird
hearing it from someone... with hair.

1167
01:42:51,876 --> 01:42:52,991
Sir.

1168
01:42:53,076 --> 01:42:54,873
ETA 15 minutes.

1169
01:43:18,556 --> 01:43:20,945
There we go.

1170
01:43:46,996 --> 01:43:48,668
Fix it.

1171
01:43:48,756 --> 01:43:51,953
Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.
I know that.

1172
01:43:58,396 --> 01:43:59,988
Oh, shit.

1173
01:44:03,476 --> 01:44:05,785
I'm not gonna do it.

1174
01:44:09,396 --> 01:44:12,991
- Oh, no, no, no! Shit!
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.

1175
01:44:13,076 --> 01:44:15,146
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something's wrong.

1176
01:44:15,236 --> 01:44:17,192
Robinson is coming too fast.

1177
01:44:21,396 --> 01:44:23,273
It's not Robinson.

1178
01:44:23,356 --> 01:44:25,267
That would be my dad.

1179
01:44:36,156 --> 01:44:38,192
Freddy?

1180
01:44:39,076 --> 01:44:40,794
Freddy?

1181
01:44:41,636 --> 01:44:43,354
It's John McCIane.

1182
01:44:43,436 --> 01:44:46,826
Look, I know you can hear me.
This is your frequency, right? 666.

1183
01:44:46,916 --> 01:44:49,555
Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.

1184
01:44:52,116 --> 01:44:54,346
Nobody here by that name. Sorry.

1185
01:44:54,436 --> 01:44:56,427
Hacker jerk-off!

1186
01:45:00,316 --> 01:45:02,272
Warlock...

1187
01:45:02,356 --> 01:45:07,384
I need you to do whatever it is you do
to patch me through to the FBl.

1188
01:45:07,476 --> 01:45:09,387
To Deputy Director Bowman.

1189
01:45:09,476 --> 01:45:11,944
- You hear me?
- Are you serious?

1190
01:45:12,036 --> 01:45:14,470
You want me to intentionally
open up a com Iine

1191
01:45:14,556 --> 01:45:18,185
to the head of the FBI's cyber division?
I don't think so.

1192
01:45:18,516 --> 01:45:20,825
Freddy, goddammit,
they have my daughter!

1193
01:45:25,956 --> 01:45:28,231
I can do that. Hold on.

1194
01:45:29,396 --> 01:45:31,387
Thank you.

1195
01:45:37,316 --> 01:45:40,547
(woman) This is Central.
We have a patch for Director Bowman.

1196
01:45:40,996 --> 01:45:43,874
Sir. Central's trying to reach you.

1197
01:45:45,156 --> 01:45:46,111
Go.

1198
01:45:46,196 --> 01:45:48,551
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

1199
01:45:48,636 --> 01:45:52,345
Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695
headed north in a Hazmat truck.

1200
01:45:52,436 --> 01:45:56,224
Wait, Gabriel's Ieft Woodlawn?
We're headed there right now.

1201
01:45:56,316 --> 01:45:59,388
Bowman. He's got my daughter.

1202
01:45:59,996 --> 01:46:04,467
Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government
vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?

1203
01:46:04,556 --> 01:46:06,672
Track that down, it should take you to him.

1204
01:46:06,756 --> 01:46:10,146
- Give me the tag number.
- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.

1205
01:46:10,236 --> 01:46:12,272
Golf... Tango...

1206
01:46:13,756 --> 01:46:17,715
five... niner... two... November.

1207
01:46:17,796 --> 01:46:20,310
Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?

1208
01:46:20,396 --> 01:46:21,875
He's with them.

1209
01:46:22,716 --> 01:46:24,149
Listen to me.

1210
01:46:24,236 --> 01:46:28,514
I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,
but if something happens to me,

1211
01:46:28,596 --> 01:46:32,953
you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?
I mean everybody.

1212
01:46:33,036 --> 01:46:35,106
Don't let that maniac get my daughter.

1213
01:46:35,196 --> 01:46:38,472
- John, don't worry.
- I want your word, Bowman.

1214
01:46:40,716 --> 01:46:42,991
Yeah, you have it.

1215
01:46:43,076 --> 01:46:44,794
McClane out.

1216
01:46:51,796 --> 01:46:52,911
There's the F-35.

1217
01:46:55,436 --> 01:46:57,631
Did you get the "go" codes?

1218
01:46:57,716 --> 01:47:00,025
- Trey. Did you get the "go" codes?
- Yes.

1219
01:47:00,116 --> 01:47:02,630
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1220
01:47:03,716 --> 01:47:05,513
Uh...

1221
01:47:18,596 --> 01:47:20,985
Isolating his radio.

1222
01:47:25,676 --> 01:47:28,270
Sending him the "go" codes.

1223
01:47:34,196 --> 01:47:35,390
AV-81.

1224
01:47:35,476 --> 01:47:40,596
- AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.
- Go for AV-81.

1225
01:47:40,676 --> 01:47:44,191
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
located in your sector. A big rig truck.

1226
01:47:45,596 --> 01:47:48,394
- Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.
- I see them.

1227
01:47:48,476 --> 01:47:51,115
You are authorised to engage and destroy.

1228
01:47:51,196 --> 01:47:53,551
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

1229
01:48:01,436 --> 01:48:02,585
What?

1230
01:48:10,156 --> 01:48:13,193
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!

1231
01:48:16,196 --> 01:48:17,993
You're shooting at the wrong guy!

1232
01:48:25,676 --> 01:48:27,906
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.

1233
01:48:39,876 --> 01:48:42,026
Hey! Jackass!

1234
01:49:27,916 --> 01:49:30,146
Is that it? Huh?

1235
01:49:32,996 --> 01:49:35,715
Is that your best shot?

1236
01:50:15,876 --> 01:50:17,355
Come on!

1237
01:50:25,556 --> 01:50:26,784
Damn!

1238
01:50:42,516 --> 01:50:44,234
Come on!

1239
01:50:51,156 --> 01:50:52,111
(beeping)

1240
01:51:07,276 --> 01:51:09,187
Yaaarrhh...

1241
01:51:41,956 --> 01:51:43,674
Whoo!

1242
01:52:13,876 --> 01:52:15,753
Let's go. Come on!

1243
01:52:15,836 --> 01:52:17,827
That way. It's that way. Go!

1244
01:52:26,476 --> 01:52:29,036
We are leaving in three minutes.

1245
01:52:32,156 --> 01:52:34,386
You have one.

1246
01:52:34,476 --> 01:52:37,832
The rules haven't changed.
You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.

1247
01:52:38,396 --> 01:52:40,546
- Aaargh! Aaargh!
- (Lucy squeals)

1248
01:52:41,516 --> 01:52:43,984
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Matthew?

1249
01:52:44,076 --> 01:52:45,270
Matthew!

1250
01:52:45,356 --> 01:52:48,075
I really need you to pay attention.

1251
01:52:48,156 --> 01:52:51,751
- The rules can always change.
- OK, wait.

1252
01:52:51,836 --> 01:52:54,111
- I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.
- Wait.

1253
01:52:54,196 --> 01:52:55,993
Nine.

1254
01:52:56,076 --> 01:52:57,589
I can't.

1255
01:52:57,676 --> 01:52:59,587
Eight.

1256
01:52:59,676 --> 01:53:01,394
I can't.

1257
01:53:02,156 --> 01:53:03,509
Oh, God.

1258
01:53:05,036 --> 01:53:06,230
(shot fired)

1259
01:53:06,316 --> 01:53:09,228
- OK!
- (Lucy cries)

1260
01:53:09,316 --> 01:53:10,715
OK, OK, OK!

1261
01:53:10,796 --> 01:53:12,309
Six.

1262
01:53:12,396 --> 01:53:16,150
OK, stop! Stop, stop!
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

1263
01:53:16,236 --> 01:53:18,750
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1264
01:53:22,236 --> 01:53:24,227
(tyres screeching)

1265
01:53:31,716 --> 01:53:33,991
(Trey) Feds are headed this way.

1266
01:53:34,076 --> 01:53:36,590
- Get everything on the plane.
- Yep.

1267
01:53:45,356 --> 01:53:47,233
- Dad!
- (Gabriel) Careful.

1268
01:53:47,316 --> 01:53:50,672
Don't worry, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1269
01:53:52,596 --> 01:53:54,552
Daddy!

1270
01:53:54,636 --> 01:53:57,025
(Lucy sobbing)

1271
01:53:59,116 --> 01:54:01,072
- (groans)
- No!

1272
01:54:01,156 --> 01:54:03,386
Hold this.

1273
01:54:18,436 --> 01:54:19,710
Aaargh!

1274
01:54:24,516 --> 01:54:26,268
No!

1275
01:54:27,516 --> 01:54:29,586
Jesus Christ.

1276
01:54:29,676 --> 01:54:31,792
You got her?

1277
01:54:32,156 --> 01:54:33,987
You're sure?

1278
01:54:35,996 --> 01:54:37,554
Nice effort, though.

1279
01:54:38,156 --> 01:54:41,114
- Matthew!
- Oh, shit! All right, OK!

1280
01:54:41,196 --> 01:54:42,948
OK! I'm doin' it. I know.

1281
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:52,427
McClane.

1282
01:54:52,516 --> 01:54:55,314
Would you do me a favour?

1283
01:54:56,596 --> 01:55:01,351
I know the lights are beginning to dim,
but if you could just hang on for a second,

1284
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:04,508
when Matt's finished,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,

1285
01:55:04,596 --> 01:55:07,349
and I would love for you to see that.

1286
01:55:08,876 --> 01:55:11,231
Goddammit. Matthew?

1287
01:55:11,316 --> 01:55:13,705
Ten seconds, OK?
You'll have all your money.

1288
01:55:13,796 --> 01:55:17,709
- You just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK?
- A few seconds. Stay with me.

1289
01:55:17,796 --> 01:55:19,787
McClane!

1290
01:55:19,876 --> 01:55:22,265
- Ohh!
- Stay with me.

1291
01:55:22,356 --> 01:55:23,835
Dad?

1292
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:28,944
On your tombstone it should read, "Always
in the wrong place at the wrong time."

1293
01:55:29,716 --> 01:55:33,504
How 'bout,
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf... (bleep)!"

1294
01:55:46,676 --> 01:55:49,270
(sobbing) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...

1295
01:55:49,356 --> 01:55:52,393
- Are you OK?
- Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1296
01:55:54,356 --> 01:55:55,835
I knew you'd come for me.

1297
01:55:55,916 --> 01:56:00,432
Of course I'd come for you, honey.
Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.

1298
01:56:07,996 --> 01:56:09,588
Move, move.

1299
01:56:14,436 --> 01:56:15,994
(man) Freeze!

1300
01:56:16,076 --> 01:56:18,829
Hold, hold! He's OK.

1301
01:56:20,756 --> 01:56:23,316
- Get that vehicle.
- Come around!

1302
01:56:23,396 --> 01:56:25,432
- Here, help Daddy up.
- OK.

1303
01:56:25,516 --> 01:56:30,032
Oooh! Wait, wait.
I think I'll just stay here for a minute.

1304
01:56:30,116 --> 01:56:34,075
- OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind.
- What are you talkin' about?

1305
01:56:34,156 --> 01:56:38,786
- You shot yourself!
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1306
01:56:38,876 --> 01:56:41,868
Don't tell these guys that I did that.

1307
01:56:52,756 --> 01:56:55,429
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thank you.

1308
01:56:57,316 --> 01:56:59,193
Is he OK?

1309
01:57:00,196 --> 01:57:02,915
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

1310
01:57:02,996 --> 01:57:05,226
Put 'em down further?

1311
01:57:05,316 --> 01:57:09,468
Might die of shock on the way to the hospital.

1312
01:57:12,076 --> 01:57:13,714
All right.

1313
01:57:13,796 --> 01:57:15,707
(groans)

1314
01:57:15,796 --> 01:57:17,627
I'll be right back.

1315
01:57:19,276 --> 01:57:21,346
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1316
01:57:21,436 --> 01:57:23,950
- How's it feel to be shot?
- It actually feels great.

1317
01:57:24,036 --> 01:57:27,312
He gave me some...
What's it called? Mor...? Morphine.

1318
01:57:27,396 --> 01:57:32,834
- Well, you got your merit badge now.
- Yeah. I don't know what that means.

1319
01:57:32,916 --> 01:57:36,750
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really? Hm.

1320
01:57:38,196 --> 01:57:40,107
Not that one.

1321
01:57:40,196 --> 01:57:41,914
- What?
- Don't even think about it.

1322
01:57:41,996 --> 01:57:45,591
How did you know what I was thinking?
Did she say something to you?

1323
01:57:45,676 --> 01:57:50,033
- I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
- Easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.

1324
01:57:50,116 --> 01:57:51,469
Yeah.

1325
01:57:51,556 --> 01:57:56,425
Besides, after all we've been through,
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.

1326
01:57:58,116 --> 01:58:00,027
That would suck.

1327
01:58:01,556 --> 01:58:03,308
- Good to go?
- Yeah, all set.

1328
01:58:03,396 --> 01:58:06,945
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you at the hospital.

1329
01:58:10,676 --> 01:58:12,428
Hey.

1330
01:58:13,316 --> 01:58:17,548
- Thanks for saving my daughter's life.
- Hey...

1331
01:58:17,636 --> 01:58:19,911
What was I gonna do?

1332
01:58:21,316 --> 01:58:23,386
That's what makes you that guy.

1333
01:58:26,276 --> 01:58:28,471
Yeah.

1334
01:58:33,716 --> 01:58:36,469
So, um, did he say anything about me?

1335
01:58:38,316 --> 01:58:40,272
Jesus, Lucy.

1336
01:58:40,356 --> 01:58:42,472
What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

1337
01:58:43,916 --> 01:58:46,225
I'm in enough pain already.

1338
01:58:46,316 --> 01:58:48,113
Hospital.

1339
01:58:48,196 --> 01:58:53,395
( "Fortunate Son"
by Creedence CIearwater Revival)

1340
01:59:03,196 --> 01:59:06,586
Some folks are born
made to wave the flag

1341
01:59:06,676 --> 01:59:09,110
Ooh, they're red, white and blue

1342
01:59:10,196 --> 01:59:13,472
And when the band plays
"Hail to the Chief"

1343
01:59:13,556 --> 01:59:16,946
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

1344
01:59:17,036 --> 01:59:20,426

I ain 't no fortunate one, no

1348

Some folks are born
silver spoon in hand

1349
01:59:34,356 --> 01:59:37,746
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh!

1350
01:59:37,836 --> 01:59:41,146

Ooh, they send you down to war, no!

1358
02:00:19,596 --> 02:00:22,986
And when you ask 'em
how much should we give

1359
02:00:23,076 --> 02:00:25,988
Ooh, they only answer
more, more, more!
