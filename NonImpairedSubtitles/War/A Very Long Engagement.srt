2
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,000
On 6Th January 1917

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Five soldiers condemned to death were lead to
the sector of Bullavent,

4
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,100
near the river of the Somme.

5
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,300
The first one

6
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,000
He has been a keen adventurer a long time ago
He wore on his neck the number 2124

7
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
He came from a recruitment center of La Seine

8
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,200
He was wearing boots

9
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,400
He took them from a German soldier.

10
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,700
Before The soldier 2124,

11
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,800
His name was Bastoche

12
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,000
was with a beautiful redhead girl

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,100
called Véronique Passavant.

14
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,200
He was carpenter in the " La Bastille"

15
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,300
Sometimes between two furnitures

16
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,200
They went to drink a beer
in the pub of Petit Louis
on the street "The Golden Hand"

17
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
He took the boots from an enemy
who didn't need them no more.

18
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,000
in order to replace them,

19
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,300
once filled up with straw and newspaper paper,
They remplaced his former boots.

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,600
he went in a military tribunal for voluntary
mutilation.

21
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,400
They had found rest of powder in the wound of his
hand, then he was condemned to death.

22
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,800
The second soldier was the number 4077
from another recruitment center of La Seine.

23
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,500
He worked on the Steel for the state railroads in
Manille.

24
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
His name was Francis Ganière, We called him "Six Soux"

25
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,200
He knew that the poor
were building the canons
which will kill them

26
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,701
and that the wealthy people sold them.

27
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,300
He tried to explain it during
the barrackings, but he didn't explain well.

28
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,300
In addition, the cheap wine : their friend in the
misery, made the soldiers so pissed,

29
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,700
that he didn't even know how
to interrupt them.

30
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,500
1818 was without any doubt the bravest soldier,

31
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
And the most dangerous one.

32
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,600
He once killed the officer of his team.

33
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,800
An officer who hit the dead.

34
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,799
Get up ! Get up !

35
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,800
You, go away !

36
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,900
No one knew it.

37
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,500
Benoît Notre Dame was a farmer.

38
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:49,101
On one morning in the month of August,
they went to take him away from his farm.

39
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,000
and they forced him to go on the train.

40
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,100
Be aware of the cables !

41
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,500
The phone cables were
the only way to connect to the world of the living.

42
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,900
by that fine thread, they were hoping for
the grace of the president Raymond Poincare
to spare their life.

43
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,400
Even if the only one here beliefing in that was him...

44
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:20,401
Number 7328 recruited from
the island Corsica.

45
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,100
Ange Bassignano

46
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,200
According to all people who knew him,
no one ever had a name that unsuitable 

47
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,800
'The Angel' was a liar, a cheater, a fake.

48
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,900
an informer and agitator.

49
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,700
Before, he has been the procurer (pimp) of Tina Lombardi

50
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,200
Because of her,
He has been condemned to jail for five year
for a honor or love business.

51
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,500
it depended on the fact if they
were a woman or a man.

52
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:04,500
Actually... it was a settle between
the procurers (pimps) of the village.

53
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,900
During the summer of 1916 they recruited
delinquents

54
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,100
in order to be able to replace losses within the
massacred regiments

55
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,101
in Berdun hell. It was up to them.

56
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,500
For whom are Those tombs ?

57
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,300
Well Actually... well... as tomorrow they are
going to attack...

58
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,600
So we anticipate.

59
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,100
Be aware of the cable.

60
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,700
The fifth soldier was a kid who belonged of the section of 17

61
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,700
He just needed 5 months to be 20 years old.

62
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,500
And now, he was afraid of everything.

63
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,599
of the French canons which were shotting so much.

64
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,400
of the wind that spread
the gas of the hunters of robbery, of the executions

65
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,400
Before the war he was not like this, he was all the
opposite...

66
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,100
He defied storms to help keeping lighthouses working
when the tide raised.

67
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,600
Charge !!

68
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Then a detail will change everything.

69
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,100
There you go kid, you will return to see your
fiancee, you just got your way out.

70
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
yep, you got your way right to the court-martial

71
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,100
My sergeant, close your eyes for a change,
he already suffered enough, don't you think?

72
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
Sergeant they may condemn him to death

73
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:14,001
Be understanding for a change!

74
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:15,000
Shut your mouth!

75
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,001
Come on Sergeant..

76
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,500
Shut the fuck up !

77
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,600
When Mathilde and Manech made love for the
first time

78
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Manech fell asleep with his hand left over her breast.

79
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,200
Whenever he felt his wound on his hand beating,

80
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:56,301
it was like feeling the
Mathilde heart beating

81
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,900
And each beat will make him closer to her.

82
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,500
If Manech were dead, Mathilde would know.

83
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,800
After the news of his death,
she desperately clung

84
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,500
to her intuition like a fine thread.

85
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,800
Still, she never gets discouraged.

86
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,900
Mathilde has a cheerful disposition.

87
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:24,901
she knows that if ever her thread
doesn't connect her to her lover

88
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,200
Well that's not too bad,
she still can hang herself up with.

89
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,300
In June of 1920
Mathilde received
a letter from a nun.

90
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,300
A sick man from the "Le Reim"
hospital wanted to meet her.

91
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,600
He was with Manech
in January 1917, on the front
of the Somme

92
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,400
In August 1912, he was a good
looking man, wasn't he ?

93
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,900
It is of lemon, with direct gear box.

94
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,100
please tell me what happened to Manech

95
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,000
In January 1917 they ordered me to
escort five

96
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:12,000
condemned men to the front.

97
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Was He among them ?

98
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,300
Yeah.

99
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,800
I had to take them to the first line of
the trench.

100
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:33,100
Gendarmes waited for us with the prisoners next to
a small cemetery in ruins.

101
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
What the fuck are you doing with those German boots?

102
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:44,901
I am waiting.

103
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:50,000
Waiting for what ?
To be spared by Poincare?
You can dream on Dude !

104
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:53,800
He already signed it.
Normally I should not have been
condemned.

105
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,299
I am from Corsica, you know, not French!

106
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,800
Let him be. He loses a wee bit his head for

107
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:10,101
Lucky him.

108
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,300
Are you done my lieutenant?

109
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,100
That soldier, He doesn't have long time before
he dies, the cold will kill him.

110
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,700
What about Manech? ...Does his wound on his hand make
him suffer badly??

111
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,100
We had to amputate
his two fingers, but apparently he was
doing okay.

112
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,100
They took them to a trench called "the
bingo twilight".

113
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Fucking hell. Could you not make sure to kick out of the
truck these useless people on your way ??

114
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
To kick their ass so as to come along faster?

115
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,400
My orders were to deliver you
the five condemned men, I don't care about
the rest.

116
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,400
Then I will tell them what are my orders...
to throw these guys to the trench

117
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,000
and to let them die like dogs between the two
firing lines.

118
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,500
Those are my fucking orders
Sergeant!

119
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,600
You understand Sergeant,
with the Germans we have a species in
tactical agreement.

120
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:32,801
The sector is wee bit sleepy, a kick in the
ass and all the shit will explode on our faces !

121
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,600
The soup guys, You are lucky it is warm.

122
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,200
And what would you like to get kiddo?

123
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:53,001
A chocolate cup and a piece of bread with honey.

124
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,700
Unless I have to kill my parents: I will get that to you.

125
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,901
Do you mind lieutenant?

126
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,900
Don't worry, he is an orphan,
but he will no doubt get you what
you want.

127
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:08,201
He is the chief of the kitchens.

128
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,900
15 minutes later, he brought everything.

129
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:15,500
Bread with salt, honey of lavagne and...

130
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,900
Cacao of Nigeria.

131
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Happiness

132
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:28,301
There you go kid, do you have anyone to write to?

133
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
do you have a girlfriend?

134
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,000
Mathilde

135
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,600
His girlfriends's name is Mathilde.

136
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,700
Mathilde

137
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,400
I feel like her heart beats in me with Morse code.

138
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,300
We are about to get married.

139
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,500
They condemned us and We don't have to wait for the
end of war anymore.

140
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,400
I will go Home when the
execution is over.

141
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,500
Maybe it is better that I don't tell you the
end.

142
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,600
I am lame, not stupid

143
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,500
Tell me what happens.

144
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,999
We opened a breach in the wire fences

145
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,500
and we helped the five soldiers to fight against the cold.

146
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,000
Célestin Poux gave your boyfriend one of his red wool
gloves, so that the hand was protected.

147
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
Is it far away ??

148
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:40,201
Less than 100 meters. Far for the grenades and
close for the artillery.

149
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,200
And not to mention the gas.

150
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,101
Do you Think that they will be allright?

151
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,900
If They don't fly in the air,
they will very likely die of hunger and cold.

152
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,300
In any case the Germans will shut up for a while.

153
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,400
Bastoche the carpenter has been embraced
by a corporal.

154
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,100
It was obvious they knew each other before the war.

155
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,200
Soon... we took them outside the trench.

156
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,300
- Assholes.

157
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,400
- Shit!
- Shut up!

158
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In September 1914, I could easily lift 70 Kilos

159
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:35,499
Moreover I was already not in great shape like
in the past.

160
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,900
But that morning, in january 1917
was Manech still alive?

161
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,900
At the dawn, Favart shout out their names.

162
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,700
All, except the farmer from Dordogne, responded.

163
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,100
- Bassignano?
- Present.

164
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:54,201
- Bouquette?
- what the hell do you want?

165
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,900
- Langonnet?
- Yeah, I am here.

166
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,901
Dude you should hide in a better spot.

167
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,100
Notre Dame? Notre Dame?

168
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,800
I know nothing else.

169
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,600
I retired to write my report
young lady.

170
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,000
At last Soldier, the English come to take our place,
we can go.

171
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:25,001
And the subject bingo?

172
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,200
What is that?

173
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:29,000
The list of the condemned signed by
Favourier captain

174
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,201
- Do I leave It there?
- Nope give it to me.

175
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,000
Don't stay there like an idiot,
what are you waiting for?

176
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:48,000
You are promoted sergeant first thing in the
morning and leave for the Bosbos.

177
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,400
Even so my commander, this mission is
going away to be stuck in my throat.

178
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,100
Good news, there are balsamic caramels for the
throat there.

179
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,400
The caramels of the Bosbos.
We are done.

180
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,000
Some months later, I have been
hurt in the Somme.

181
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,900
I found myself in the same ambulance as
Chardolot

182
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,000
one of the officials in "the bingo twilight".

183
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,600
But He just had few days to live.

184
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,300
Eh oh, It is me Esperanza.

185
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,700
Bingo twilight you remember?

186
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
Oh sorry I didn't recognize you.

187
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,800
Tell me, my no man's land boys...

188
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,700
How did the story finish ?

189
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:30,701
What do you think ?

190
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,600
No survivor ??

191
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:36,200
Do you feel remorse?

192
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,001
You should have stayed with us in Bingo.

193
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,000
I saw the capital Ms written down

194
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,400
... underpants, an albatross.

195
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,700
You are delirious. You got the flue.

196
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,300
We threw between two lines five boys alive,
then we recovered five cold meat.

197
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,100
so...

198
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,500
I lost my vision sergeant, but
I imagine your face.
That makes my day.

199
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,600
He really spoke of capital Ms and an albatross?

200
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,100
yep ... and of underpants.

201
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,500
There you go Young lady,
everything the condemned men
in Bingo ever possessed.

202
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:20,500
They asked me to send everything to their families.

203
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,400
My health didn't allow me to do it.

204
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,000
It is a copy of the letter of the farmer Benoît
Notre Dame to his wife.

205
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,700
I sent the original one to her when I left
Bingo.

206
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,200
His health is due to the gas in the lungs right?

207
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,200
Nope, it is because he got the spanish flue.

208
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,800
You can notice, the death is lurking and catches
us totally by surprise.

209
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,700
Mathilde You don't have to be pissed off,
you can talk to me,

210
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,000
If you can't talk, just stay quiet.

211
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But sometimes when we start speaking, it's
when we start crying.

212
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,100
and when crying
we talk about what you didn't want to

213
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,900
you know what I mean.

214
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,300
I will not have to bear anymore that silly face

215
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,400
Petit Louis tell to Vero
that I will always think about her
and that it is too bad she doesn't want to

216
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,000
talk to me, I met again Biscotte
and we made up. Good bye
my friend. Bastoche

217
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,900
Benoît Notre Dame Numero 1818
I will not be able to write again
for a while.

218
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:01,900
Tell Berney I will pay everything by the month of Mars.

219
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:03,700
he sells his installment too expensive

220
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:05,800
You have to be careful.

221
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:10,900
tell my Bagtistan that I hope nothing bad will happen to him

222
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,600
I have never known such a nice person.
I love you. Benoît

223
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,900
For Tina Lombardi from Ange Bassignano.

224
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,700
If The dog enters the room before they call me
for the dinner, Manech must be still alive.

225
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,600
I am not hungry.

226
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,800
The dinner is ready.
Come Malthide, let's go to eat.

227
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,100
I'm coming.

228
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,799
Mathilde was born on the first of January 1900

229
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,400
That's very easy to determinate one's age.

230
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,599
In 1903 hers parents passed away in the accident
of the bus 44.

231
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,900
Since then Mathilde kept telling

232
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Late parents... late parents...

233
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,600
Her uncle Sylvain and her aunt Bénédicte
took care of her,

234
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,900
thanks to the life insurance managed by the
lawyer of her parents; Pierre Marie Rouvières.

235
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,700
At five years old, Mathilde caught the polio virus.

236
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,500
She stayed several months in the bed in spite of
the mustard cataplasms,

237
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,100
the pendulums,

238
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,900
and the infusions of shamrock with four leaves.

239
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,900
Today Mathilde is 20 years old, she plays tuba,

240
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,700
because it is the only instrument that seems to
give the distress signal.

241
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,900
The dog always farts when it sleeps

242
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Whenever Bénédicte hears the dog, she says

243
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,100
The farty dog betrayed.

244
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:34,200
Mathilde needs to get daily massages for
her legs.

245
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:38,901
Georges Cornu the champion of Britain in free
style swimming gives her massage.

246
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:41,602
At the beginning she was anxious.

247
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,600
but she got used to it.

248
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,200
When Mathilde was in the mood, she imagined that
Georges Cornu admired the shape of her body.

249
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,901
and he couldn't repress his desire.

250
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,900
As a matter of fact, one day he dared to remark :

251
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,600
You have very beautiful curves young lady,
and I can assure you that I have touched lot of women.

252
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,200
So Mathilde didn't know anymore
if she could call him :

253
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:02,601
My dear Gorge...

254
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
My loved Gorge...

255
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:08,801
Gogo

256
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,700
Sometimes, before sleeping she imagined herself in
hot situations

257
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Mathilde never had to use

258
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:24,500
all her imagination to succumb to the pleasure.

259
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,900
But since he disappeared, she cannot think
about her fiance when she seeks pleasure.

260
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,600
If I was you I would forget everything Mathilde, it is of no use to
look for nothing,

261
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Moreover if he were alive why did he not give any sign huh?

262
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:51,101
Because he had been made a prisoner

263
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
He stayed with a german girl
with two blond tresses with big tits.

264
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:59,001
A Breton eating sauerkraut every single day. ..impossible.

265
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,000
Are you sure you don't want me to help you??

266
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:04,400
Oh no but I prefer you to keep your feet on the ground.

267
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:06,000
Well I will need to feel my legs for that!

268
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,001
What did you say??

269
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
Nothing

270
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:08,901
I did hear you.

271
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:13,000
what you just said doesnt make any sense.

272
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,500
Manech cannot be a prisoner in Bingo, because

273
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,600
It is where we find the enemy lines.

274
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,900
Generally winners can take the prisoners.

275
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,300
Maybe he lost his direction, or he hides somewhere
so as not to go to jail

276
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,400
My sweet Mathilde you read
too many novels.
You have to go back to reality.

277
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,400
You are young and beautiful,
you could easily find a husband
in spite of....

278
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,000
In all that story there is something
that does not add up.

279
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:42,001
I must find back

280
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,000
the plunderer of kitchens... Célestin Poux

281
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,100
What would you want kiddo?

282
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:50,700
Or maybe the prostitute from Corsica, maybe
she knows things more I do.

283
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:52,700
Tomorrow I go away to Paris.

284
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,500
what ?
What's for??

285
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,600
To look for a survivor of Bingo twilight.

286
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,500
... I have archives all the way up to the ceiling,

287
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,500
You can't imagine the number
of cases which never saw the day.

288
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:21,299
if Germain Pire did not come in hand.

289
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,500
Have a look at this,

290
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,800
A big case, an extremely delicate one. In 1917 a train
with soldiers derails

291
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
427 deads.

292
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,000
thanks to the investigation we discovered that
the official

293
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:38,600
gave the order to leave although the brakes
did not work.

294
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:41,200
It was a concealment maneuver

295
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:42,201
from the government of Poincare

296
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:45,200
The only option for the victim families
to find back

297
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:48,800
the official... Germain Pire.

298
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,500
The spy that chirps.

299
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:53,799
Oh way worse, young lady. And I found the official

300
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,400
For the sorrow of the high military spheres.

301
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,000
Allright, in the cemetery of Craon.

302
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:06,000
As soon as I made my suitcases I left go after them,
Poux Célestin and his lover from Corsica.

303
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,200
And what about the fees ?

304
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,100
Look my lady, The spy that chirps
knows to whom he should pluck.

305
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,000
For you It would be 20 francs per day

306
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,700
Without the expenses of course.

307
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,300
And why would you do me that favour?

308
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,800
Hélène come on to say hello !

309
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,500
About the expenses of Germain Pire Don't worry
He eats little, does not drink

310
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
and he is very sparing in gratuities.

311
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,500
- Good morning
- Good morning

312
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,901
Notre Dame de Paris?

313
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,800
no, not Notre Dame de Paris, I call you from
Paris about Notre Dame, Benoît

314
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Ah Benoît Notre Dame yes, a strong farmer and of
great heart.

315
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,300
He died for the mother country, we say that the
mother country has cleared me of good people.

316
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,300
His wife and her small Bagtistan
still live there?

317
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:01,101
Madame Minne I can't hear nothing!

318
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,400
No, a day she sold everything and they went
away without leaving direction.

319
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,500
is it a choir that I hear behind your back?

320
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,900
it's a choir indeed dear lady, I am in the church.

321
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:15,400
However that is not an excuse
for not hearing you well.

322
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,300
- Thanks Father, Good bye.
- welcome.

323
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,200
Bingo twilight.

324
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,000
That does not have feet nor head. this is a scandal.

325
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,300
I thought that your vocation was to defend lost
causes.

326
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:31,299
when you were 10 years old your Your insolence had grace,
not when you are 20 years old.

327
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,700
As a matter of fact, it would be
time to take me seriously.

328
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Mathilde, Mathilde, you squander your inheritance
in an absurd chimera.

329
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Bingo twilight, and why not Yupi Tralalala...

330
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,100
I want to consult military files.

331
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,800
Mathilde let's say
there were any truth in there

332
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,600
and if one of the condemned
men ever survived he would face
forced works. And you know it!

333
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,300
Your investigations would cause him
very dangerous problems.

334
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,300
Be sensible, they trusted the interests to me...

335
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:02,000
... your parents

336
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:03,001
Late parents

337
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,300
Actually, my happiness was one of their interests.

338
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,500
Good bye, and thanks.

339
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,000
My sweet Mathilde
do not be like that please.

340
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,700
I think about your future,
it hurts me much to see you got
worse despise your massages.

341
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,700
All right all right I will see
what I can do.

342
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,900
I can't put that though in Lourdes..

343
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,600
Good morning lady I look for Tina
Lombardi I know her since she was a kid and..

344
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:32,900
Pardon ladies I am a political uncle of Tina
Lombardi and I would like to erm....

345
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,700
Please, I am in charge of the interests of the
Lombardi family in the continent,

346
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,200
and I look for Tina. It is about a small heritage...

347
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,000
Are you the man who is looking for Tina
Lombardi?

348
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,001
No, in fact no

349
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,500
Don't you know Corsica ? It is very pretty place

350
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,400
very colorful.

351
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:16,500
But Tina
Lombardi went away after
bad business

352
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Luckily a member of the police
found her whereabouts in the bar leville.

353
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,500
Valentin Emilia Maria Lombardi, called tina,
has been registered

354
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,100
in 1916 near the quarter of regiment 23 of
Marseilles.

355
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,800
After that she flew away.

356
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,800
I lost her tracks in Lyon, and trust me I didn't
stop working.

357
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,000
She has disappeared in the
district of the Croix Rousse.

358
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,001
What you mean is you give up

359
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,400
Not at all, Pire never lets it go.

360
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,600
Pire is obstinate, a detective who gives up,
he doesn't exist young lady.

361
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:07,101
Perfect, thanks.

362
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,600
Not the eyes, no

363
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,000
What do you drink ?

364
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,300
This is my fiance, and there it is the
carpenter

365
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,500
I believe that you know him.

366
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,200
No. I am suddenly thirsty, do you mind a wine
glass?

367
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
It gives force and it cheers the way.

368
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,000
My great aunt told me the same thing.

369
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:37,000
she died in Besançon in 1911 at the age of 99 years old.

370
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
and she had never been ill.

371
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,800
Good luck.

372
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:44,801
I touch wood.

373
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,000
The war.

374
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,900
No, a hyena in the botanical garden

375
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,000
I wanted to stroke it to be a smart ass.
Bastoche and his friend did this for me.

376
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,500
Biscotte?

377
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,600
His best friend. They met in 1910
by saving a woman from drowning in the flood.

378
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,100
Bastoche was skillful, but Biscotte...

379
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,400
He was an artist, the king of firmer chisel.

380
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,100
He did all the joints.

381
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:21,300
It is a wonder!

382
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
It is for you.

383
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,300
Petit Louis tell to Vero
that I will always think about her
and that it is too bad she doesn't want to

384
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,700
talk to me, I met again Biscotte
and we made up. Good bye
my friend.

385
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,900
Bastoche

386
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,900
If they made up, they must have had a fall out.
Do you know the reason ?

387
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,700
A mystery.

388
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:46,501
But to tell you the truth, they went through so much together,

389
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,200
And out of the blue, they can't bear each other.

390
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,700
Biscotte went away to another army.

391
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,000
and he died in the bombing of one
military hospital where he was injured.

392
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:07,800
Anyway, I am glad they made up before.

393
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,400
It seems that it will not be
very busy here today.

394
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,600
Do you serve a drink?

395
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:19,001
It seems you are again thirsty huh?

396
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,200
Maybe he has a wooden hand
but he still has a big heart.

397
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:24,100
Let's drink to love. The true one!

398
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,701
Do you know who is that Véro?

399
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,900
Véronique Passavant. His girlfriend, his lover.

400
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,100
He often came here with her.

401
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,500
What could have happened as
she didn't want to talk to him anymore ?

402
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,800
I suppose he has been unfaithful
and she never forgave him.

403
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,600
Voila, here is the place for the year 1917.

404
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,700
what are the red files about ??

405
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,200
Top Secret Defense

406
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:53,399
We need higher clearance for them.

407
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,000
This way please,
upstairs.

408
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,001
Go to help him

409
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh right.

410
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:01,301
Suppose that the highest person is yourself

411
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,300
... then Mr. Rouvières and I would have
clearance right ?

412
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:06,101
If I had that kind of mind

413
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,100
I would not be an Official.

414
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:11,201
Mathilde please consider yourself lucky
to have been able to come here.

415
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,200
Normally it usually takes months.

416
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,500
Like I told you, they say everything is in order
but actually it is totally a chaos

417
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:20,501
To see... in front of the Somme

418
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:22,900
Sector of Bullavent, trench 108.

419
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,500
You know what I mean. This is a chaos!

420
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:27,400
It is a real mess.

421
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,600
Can I help you?

422
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:33,700
I thank you for the management

423
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,700
... with the General, I say.

424
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:35,701
Good, he is a great friend mine.

425
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,000
I know the sector very well  two
friends of mine died there.

426
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:42,499
Then it has been a very bloody war...

427
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,900
I don't think that things will get better
It is very difficult to find a maid nowadays.

428
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It seems like a lie.

429
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:51,900
We would like to know that passage in trench 108.

430
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,300
... 104, trench 105, 107, where is the 106 one ??

431
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:58,301
See? A mess.

432
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,100
Trench 108... this is a bloody mess.

433
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,400
Good 108, here these...

434
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,199
... Taken by us in October of 1916

435
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,600
and renamed Bingo twilight.

436
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:15,100
And why not trooi Tralala?

437
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:16,800
on 6 January there is nothing

438
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
on 7 january great confrontation with numerous losses...

439
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,600
Favourier captain, the professor of history die
in combat...

440
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,300
The lieutenant... An adviser of insurances!

441
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:27,100
The caporal.... Good that but it gives...

442
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,400
That is weird, a part of the losses are classified confidential.

443
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,100
Confidential? It means...

444
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,000
I am sorry

445
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,100
And we can do nothing about it?

446
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:40,101
No nothing

447
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,102
Up to here we can arrive.

448
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:42,103
I am sorry

449
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,100
Not even the general himself could do
nothing about it

450
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,200
Even so, I thank you for your time

451
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,200
I am sorry, there is nothing which can be of any interest for you.
really ordinary files.

452
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,200
It was one possibility.

453
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:11,500
everything is a chaos!

454
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,900
you are incorrigible Mathilde...!

455
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:20,800
... no lady, that is totally impossible

456
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:23,500
no, without the seal of the ministry it is
impossible.

457
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,700
I hope that this leaf is not secret of defense.

458
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Pierre Marie, if it is important You must tell me.

459
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,800
nope that is nothing. only one permission.

460
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:42,100
Of the president ?

461
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,000
So what, every so often the president can give
it to the soldiers but who deserve it.

462
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,600
That is it.

463
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:52,601
I take both of you out

464
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:17,700
Corporal Bouquette Clevert, Ganière Francis

465
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,700
Soldier Notre Dame Benoît, soldier Bassignano
Ange

466
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,400
Soldier Langonnet Manech

467
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,500
By voluntary mutilation the sentence to capital
punishment.

468
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,400
I count up to 7 and if the train doesn't enter a tunnel

469
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,900
Or the conductor does not come. Manech is dead

470
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,500
One, two, three,

471
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,700
four, five, six

472
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,900
Tickets please.

473
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,601
April fool !

474
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,300
As soon as you finish eating your meal, we will
pay your announcement.

475
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,800
It compensates all information referring to
Bingo twilight. is that okay for you??

476
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,800
Yes, try to encourage her, it would
give her appetite.

477
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,100
you would have taken her to the
camperre festival.

478
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
What for?

479
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:27,000
To  distract you a wee bit.

480
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,500
Not to mention you
could find a nice boyfriend.

481
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
But what's for ??

482
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:34,378
So you can marry and raise a family !
Tell her !

483
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:36,200
Can I have some too?

484
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,900
Do you drink wine now?

485
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:40,300
A wine glass gives force and cheers the way.

486
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,900
Where did you get that from ??

487
00:43:42,001 --> 00:43:44,500
On the street "the gold hand", the owner of the
bar, with his died hand, He has a wooden hand,

488
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:48,100
His great aunt said that before
dying, at the age of 99 years old
in Besançon in 1911.

489
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,100
Can you say that again?

490
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,600
In Besançon, in 1911

491
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,300
... one old lady lived until 99 years, who died leaving
behind a little nephew who has a wood hand

492
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,500
He is the owner of the died hand,
a bar on the street  the gold hand.

493
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,300
You see it? Already pissed off.

494
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,300
Look !

495
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,600
This is the Albatros.

496
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
It knows that it can use the wind at will.

497
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,900
Oh my gravel! my gravel!

498
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,000
Véronique Passavant on July 17th 1920

499
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,300
Lady, I write you from the bar of Petit Louis who
told me about you.

500
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,200
I have to tell about about a meeting I have had
which gave me a fright.

501
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,300
I was coming to the factory of Bastoche because
I was melancholic.

502
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,000
I would like to speak with Bastoche

503
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:01,001
Bastoche but he died...

504
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,100
... in the front of the Somme, you didn't know?

505
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,300
But I am looking for something else.

506
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:08,301
What exactly??

507
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,100
In the hospital where I help the patients, there
are terminal syphilitics.

508
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,100
One of them has given this to me for you.

509
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,200
if you don't want to die covered by
purulent abscesses, you would do better
answering me !

510
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,500
The companion with whom Bastoche hides

511
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,000
Tell me, tell me who is he?

512
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,500
Well well I would not let myself be upset by
some young lady

513
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,900
Tina Lombardi knows something we don't

514
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,300
What did you say??

515
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,170
Tina Lombardi knows something which
eludes us.

516
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,500
Something that would prove
that Bastoche is still alive.

517
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,700
And the other condemned men.

518
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:50,801
it is obvious she believes I am his angels.

519
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,500
But if Bastoche has been saved, Then I am sure
that he protected Manech.

520
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,000
If he ever survived it is.
Wait.

521
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,900
It can, but if not outside for that reason,
single I would have left to hang to me.

522
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,200
Are you winding me up you smart ass ?
Whenever you come here I must fix
the gravel.

523
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,700
As for the gravel, it is a question about style.
A letter for the young lady.

524
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,399
Ironworks R. Leprince, Paris 1920 July 25.

525
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,500
Young lady, I take advantage of Sunday today to
write to you with respect to your announcement

526
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:30,000
where it says that you are looking
for Célestin Poux and
other survivors

527
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:32,000
of Bingo twilight.

528
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:35,100
I knew that guy very well,
he was the best go-getter that
I ever met.

529
00:47:35,101 --> 00:47:38,000
Thanks to him
I never starved myself.

530
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,800
Olivier Nergeton mechanical
toys manufacturer.

531
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,500
Célestin Poux was our provider, we called
the terror of the kitchens

532
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:55,100
He falsified the numbers of losses, so as to multiply
the money in order to get the soldiers more foods.

533
00:47:55,001 --> 00:48:00,500
If you ever meet him, Tell him that the veterans
of Fontenau will never forget him.

534
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,400
Etienne Mauriaux, Professor, August 3 of 1920

535
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:11,400
He made us laugh ours heads off,
to get us food, he would even
tame the mascot of the company.

536
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,700
Good morning Madam, Germain Pire private
detective.

537
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Oh yeah, Mathilde told us about you.

538
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,800
Sylvain Tell Mathilde to go downstairs,
the detective wants to see her.

539
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:36,000
The great Pire moves like hell, he can spend a
day in each site.

540
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,900
In any case we will need luck and patience to
get him.

541
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,200
A shame.

542
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:46,301
Mathilde I got you some salty cakes.

543
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,500
You will see if you like them.

544
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:52,001
You won't be better in the kitchen?

545
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,500
Thank you Bénédicte.

546
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:58,700
Allright, I leave you alone.

547
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,500
Poux is a mystery, whereas Tina Lombardi
that is another story

548
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,700
She misleads us with dead end leads.

549
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:08,201
And to make matters
worse she changes identities.

550
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,200
Anything new about Biscotte ?
Wait !

551
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Look at this, this is Benjamín Gordes

552
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:20,201
it is the day where they got the carpentry
prize,

553
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,500
for sixth consecutive year.

554
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:25,201
But!

555
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,100
And yes, young lady.

556
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:36,100
Biscotte, the best friend of Bastoche, is no
one else but Benjamín Gordes

557
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,100
and a soldier of the company told me

558
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,000
that they were close-knit before
they fought.

559
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,600
Leave me alone.

560
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,800
I do not want to fight with you.

561
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,100
Leave me alone.
Calm down!

562
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,900
Bastard, Asshole .
Who got that idea ??
Me??

563
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,500
It was your idea.

564
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:05,499
It was just for a skirt matter.

565
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,200
Véronique Passavant broke up with
Bastoche in June 1916

566
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,400
and immediately afterwards, Bastoche fight with
Benjamín Gordes.

567
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,600
You don't have to be a lynx for that huh?

568
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:19,101
So they didn't see each other till
in Bingo twilight?

569
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,600
Bingo twilight is where
everything finishes.

570
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,500
No, it is where everything started, Mr. Pire

571
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,600
Where everything starts.

572
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,700
Tina Lombardi is sure Bastoche
is still alive.

573
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:35,180
What made Bastoche different from the
others in Bingo twilight?

574
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,800
That he was the only carpenter, no?

575
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,600
There is a thing that differentiates Bastoche
from the others...

576
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,400
... the German boots.

577
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,500
He was the only one to
wear German boots!

578
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,700
But of course !
You are right !

579
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:51,000
Tina Lombardi just knew that her man

580
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:52,901
by wearing German boots
he could have got away with it.

581
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,900
It would suffice that they
had seen him with some companion.

582
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,901
I met two Frenchmen

583
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,500
they looked like  tramp

584
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:01,600
... One of them got boots.
He got them from a german soldier

585
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,100
In addition to the german boots, we know that Bastoche
made up with his best friend.

586
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,750
Exactly! who knows if it doesn't
make any change during that night.

587
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,300
If I can peel that apple without breaking
the skin then

588
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,630
Gordes found a way to help out
and save Bastoche,
and Manech.

589
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,500
At that rate I won't put the cake in the oven
before the next year !

590
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,600
I must return to Paris

591
00:51:31,601 --> 00:51:32,601
What ??

592
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:34,401
I have to return to Paris.

593
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,400
Again? The inheritance
of your parents will go away like smoke.

594
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,700
Late parents.

595
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,400
Excuse me,
where is Elodie Gordes?

596
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:23,180
That's the woman with the carrots.

597
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:26,101
Ah, thanks Sir.

598
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,100
Elodie Gordes?

599
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:33,800
Here for you.

600
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,000
I do not know him.

601
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,510
Which person don't you know??

602
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:45,200
Would it be that one by any chance?
Because Bastoche and
Biscotte had a fall out?

603
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,700
Was it because
of you??

604
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:47,701
You exagerate,
I do not have anything
to tell him.

605
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,580
No, I just need to know.
Leave me alone!

606
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,100
They saw each other for the
very last time in the
bingo twilight

607
00:52:57,101 --> 00:53:01,001
My fiance was there too with Bastoche

608
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,300
in that excrement trench.

609
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,300
I need to understand.

610
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,800
I need to understand!

611
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,500
It is not what you think.
I can tell you everything.

612
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,200
Give me your address,
although I have misspelling,

613
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:29,350
I will put everything in a letter.
I promise you.

614
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:53,101
No letter for me ?

615
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,300
What did you say ?

616
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:56,301
There is no letter for me ?

617
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,000
Only the newspaper...
It talks about the all world but
not about Elodie Gordes.

618
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,700
Very funny.

619
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:04,701
You are wrong.

620
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,000
You can learn a lot of interresting things.

621
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:11,101
The president has opened an investigation on
the condemned men of Bingo twilight?

622
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
A man fell out of the train in the middle of the night

623
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:19,001
and in pajamas

624
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,100
At least him, he sleeps with pajamas.

625
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,300
Eh?

626
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,301
He sleeps with pyjamas!

627
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,000
... and we recovered five cold cuts

628
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,500
You are already a thief, and now
you are pyromaniac.

629
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,300
- Did you hurt yourself ??
- No I am fine.

630
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:19,545
For a change I don't have to gather the gravel, but
to collect the mailman.

631
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,800
You took away the gravel!
A good war!

632
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,000
There is no good war.

633
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:27,900
Do you want to drink something?
Yes please.

634
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,700
Miss, please keep secret my little secrets

635
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,900
When I met my husband,
he had four children from
a first marriage.

636
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,700
No one kid was his.

637
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:39,900
By generosity he married with a
young tuberculosa widow

638
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:42,100
of Polish nationality, like me.

639
00:55:42,101 --> 00:55:44,500
He considered the children as his
before she died.

640
00:55:44,501 --> 00:55:46,400
Myself,I was unmarried mother
of a girl of 3 years.

641
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,900
So we found ourself with a family
with 5 children,

642
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,200
We had four years of happiness.

643
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,000
We had many plans. We dreamed to be able to
see the sea once in life.

644
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,300
But then the war started.

645
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,600
At first I thought that his Bastoche friend would
take care of him because they were together,

646
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,200
but when he came back for the first time, in
September of 1915

647
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,200
Right after the campaign of Artois,

648
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:25,200
I understood right away nothing would
be like before.

649
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,700
This gives us the force to get on in life.

650
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,500
A day in a battlefield in flames I saw my
companions

651
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:57,770
exploding like if they
were firecrackers.

652
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,000
One time we even used the body
of a companion,

653
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,700
to make of him a shield.

654
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,100
He had been thinking about something
for a long time

655
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,600
it was in the second night that it started

656
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,400
You will understand that if I desert
they will arrest me

657
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,300
The only way of getting away is to have
a sixth child.

658
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,367
When we have 6 children, they send
the soldiers back home.

659
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,300
As I already told him, He can't have children.

660
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,600
I could not imagine what to think.

661
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:51,900
But voila, he brought up again the subject.

662
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,100
But it is me who asks you, Elodie, that is not
adultery.

663
00:57:55,201 --> 00:57:58,501
And even less
if it is with Bastoche.

664
00:57:58,502 --> 00:57:59,502
Don't touch !

665
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,300
No of the five children is mine,
who cares about another one??

666
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,500
Although it embarrasses me,
we would have wait 9 months

667
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:10,000
... by then the war would already be over.

668
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:11,501
But no It will never be over!

669
00:58:11,502 --> 00:58:12,700
Those nine months will represent
a hope for me.

670
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,800
Don't you have more compassion??

671
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:17,301
Then some day I found

672
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,200
a letter of Clevert Bouquette,
AKA Bastoche in the letterbox.

673
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,200
I put something colorful at the window
so he knows where to show up.

674
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

675
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,700
- I made some coffee, do you want one?
- Oh yes it would be nice thank you.

676
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,900
- Come in
- No, You first.

677
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,600
Thank you very much.

678
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,400
-  Do you want sugar ?
- No, thanks.

679
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,600
- It is of nacre?
-  yes Benjamín made it.

680
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,750
- It is curious we never met
- Yes, before.

681
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,500
Are the children not home?

682
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:28,720
Yes, they are playing in the backyard.

683
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,900
- A digestive with the coffee ?
- Yes please.

684
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:40,800
In fact not... I am sorry.
I don't need it

685
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,200
I don't need it too.

686
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,500
Elodie look, we tell him we did it.

687
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:53,100
So we are on peace for a while.
That is for the best.

688
00:59:53,101 --> 00:59:56,000
For you, for me, for everybody.

689
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,800
It is funny, when you smile it looks like
a bracket.

690
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,000
It will close but the possible thing late.

691
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:17,000
The day after tomorrow, in the station.

692
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,000
Time to go, a very last smile okay?

693
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,400
In order to close the bracket.

694
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,201
I never have been pregnant.

695
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,500
But soon after, it was not the fear
which were tormenting my husband,

696
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,100
but the jealousy.

697
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Where? When? Whichever times?
In which positions? Did you enjoy yourself?

698
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,600
It became an utter torture for him and me.

699
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,600
Now Bastoche died...

700
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,500
And my husband died in the hospital bombing.

701
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,700
It made me good to be honest with
you Miss.

702
01:02:10,801 --> 01:02:13,201
Sometimes I am scared to become crazy.

703
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,800
Elodie Gordes.

704
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:20,101
Mathilde hurry up, This Mr. Rouvières on
the phone waiting for you.

705
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,700
Move, Move.

706
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,800
- Hello.
- Mathilde, It's me Pierre Marie.

707
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,200
Erm, I have bad news for you,

708
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,200
Good or bad news, You were expecting for them,

709
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:52,101
... and that from now on, you will not be able to
continue ignoring.

710
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,000
The bottom line is, you
were right about one thing

711
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:01,800
Manech and his 4 companions
were indeed in that trench.
