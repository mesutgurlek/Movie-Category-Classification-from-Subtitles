1
00:00:57,347 --> 00:01:02,296
November 10th, 1938
The Palace of Dolmabahçe

2
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:31,061
Sir!

3
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,386
Mr. Salih!

4
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,378
Mr. Salih!

5
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,659
What is it? What do you want?

6
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:45,784
Sir, you asked us to bring your son.
He's here, sir.

7
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:48,100
Wait a minute.

8
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:49,580
Yes, sir!

9
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:01,655
Come in.

10
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:08,901
Come here, Muzaffer.

11
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:12,261
Sit down.

12
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:18,143
I asked for you in such a rush, but...

13
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:19,905
I'm going to tell you
something important.

14
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:21,222
I'm listening, papa.

15
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:25,382
How is the school, is it going well?

16
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,984
Very well, papa.

17
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:30,306
Well done.

18
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:33,705
Son, I'm going to tell you a secret...

19
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,200
on the condition that
it remains between us.

20
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:37,856
Of course, papa.

21
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:39,785
You're supposed to tell nobody,
promise?

22
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:40,663
Promise!

23
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,225
Unfortunately,
Atatürk is in a coma, my son.

24
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:48,657
And I want you to know that...

25
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,497
if something happens to him...

26
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:54,179
I will also end my life.

27
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:57,585
Papa, how can you say that?

28
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,659
I've been thinking a lot.

29
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:03,665
After his death,
a life for me is no more possible.

30
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,136
This is...

31
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,145
how should I say...

32
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:14,387
it's like living without oxygen!

33
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:20,663
Don't cry.

34
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:23,826
Don't you cry!

35
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,737
You know, I don't like men who cry.

36
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:28,906
Come here.

37
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:36,463
You're a big boy now.

38
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:41,260
You will be the man who
takes care of our family.

39
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,661
Look at me.

40
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:49,264
I entrust your mother and your sisters
to your care.

41
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,825
Take care of our family.

42
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:55,705
Go to school, and serve your country.

43
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,142
But papa...

44
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:08,698
Farewell, my son.

45
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:14,536
Come on now.

46
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:18,216
Come on.

47
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:36,983
Papa...

48
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:55,622
My God, give me strength.

49
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:27,982
My general...

50
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:31,942
My general...

51
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:37,136
You succeeded in everything
they said impossible.

52
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:41,025
You overcame everything
through your will power.

53
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,938
You can overcome this as well.

54
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,505
Come on, my general.

55
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,219
Make an effort.

56
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,185
I'm sure you're hearing me,
my general.

57
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:58,781
Listen to me.

58
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:01,699
If something befalls to you...

59
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:06,183
just know that I will follow you.

60
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:12,940
The general cannot go anywhere
without his aide-de-camp.

61
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,181
Muzaffer?

62
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:54,345
What are you doing here?

63
00:07:56,587 --> 00:07:57,906
What are you doing, I said.

64
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,024
Why aren't you in the class?

65
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:04,344
Why are you crying,
is there anything wrong?

66
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:07,455
No, sir.

67
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:12,022
Then what is this state of yours, son?
Come here.

68
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,182
Son, you know that
I'm a friend of your father.

69
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,580
Come on, tell me.

70
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:29,659
My son, Muzaffer...

71
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:34,422
Unfortunately, words are not enough...

72
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:37,903
to describe the pain and the pangs
of conscience I lived through...

73
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,305
after you left.

74
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:48,543
I must have hurt you deeply...

75
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:52,576
by doing what none of the fathers
in the world does to his son.

76
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:56,745
I presume you have thought that...

77
00:08:56,987 --> 00:09:01,742
a man cannot do such an evil to his
family even for the sake of Atatürk.

78
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:05,496
For this reason...

79
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:15,263
Our story began in Thessaloniki,
my son.

80
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:18,463
We were both six years old.

81
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:22,541
My brave son!

82
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,105
You will be such a student one day.

83
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,656
What? You didn't like it?

84
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:34,417
But they're so strange looking,
maybe I should go to another school?

85
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:35,900
Sure you can, but...

86
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:38,940
your mother wants you to get enrolled
to the religious school.

87
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:39,943
But papa...

88
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:40,823
My son!

89
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,584
Your mother wants you to be a preacher.

90
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:47,742
She wants you to be accompanied
by prayers.

91
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,344
Let us comply with her wish.

92
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:53,423
Don't be so sorry, young man.

93
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,940
First, let's get you enrolled
to the school your mother prefers.

94
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,301
Then we'll see about it.

95
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:01,423
Come on.

96
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,341
Let God accept your prayers.

97
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,458
Your mother raised you very well,
my son.

98
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:15,179
Let Him accept yours, too.

99
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,100
Now, put on your shoes.

100
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,578
Mustafa used to adore his father.

101
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:25,821
That stroll on Ramadhan day with
his father left a mark in his mind.

102
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:33,024
In the city of Thessaloniki of the era,
Muslims, Orthodox, Jews...

103
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:38,455
all the subjects of the Ottoman empire
were living in peace.

104
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:48,097
Papa, it's like daytime!

105
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:50,657
Sure my son,
now we have gas in Thessaloniki.

106
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:53,507
In a few years, our houses
will also be illuminated like this.

107
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:54,583
Papa?

108
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:56,106
Does God light those lamps?

109
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,417
No, my son, God is a great power.

110
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:02,661
He's too busy to see to our lamps.
Lamps are lit by the gas!

111
00:11:04,147 --> 00:11:05,660
The goose?
The goose in our garden?

112
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:06,896
Such a buffoon!

113
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:09,178
Not the goose, it's the gas!

114
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:10,626
Does fire burn his mouth?

115
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,862
No, my son. Come!

116
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:16,255
Oh, Hacivat!

117
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,422
Come sit and watch a little while.

118
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,537
Oh dear!

119
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,586
It suits so well to my son!

120
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,459
Just like a little Hodja!

121
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,342
My son will memorize the Coran!

122
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:46,803
He will become a Hodja.

123
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,341
He will teach Coran.

124
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:51,383
Right, my love?

125
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,017
Do you like it?

126
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,621
Mustafa?

127
00:11:59,187 --> 00:12:00,779
It's a pity, Zübeyde!

128
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,378
Why this insistence
on the religious school?

129
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:05,863
We should have sent him
to a modern school.

130
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,580
He could become an army officer.

131
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,458
He does not want it either.

132
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:13,226
Modern schools are not for me,
Ali Rıza!

133
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,537
We discussed it so many times.

134
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:17,579
Mustafa will be a preacher.

135
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,021
Come on.

136
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,021
Zübeyde?

137
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:28,784
My garden of Eden...

138
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:30,263
Allright.

139
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,662
Whatever you want.

140
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,298
I will send Mustafa off.

141
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:46,021
It was our first day in the school.

142
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,944
Right when I wanted to catch Mustafa...

143
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:51,899
I knocked over the preacher's lectern.

144
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:55,736
Here comes the preacher!
Here comes the preacher!

145
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,535
Here comes the preacher!
Here comes the preacher!

146
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,861
Quick! Here comes the preacher!

147
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:17,343
Who did this?

148
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:31,059
Who did this, I said!

149
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,101
Is it you?

150
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,255
Is it you?

151
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:39,976
Is it you?

152
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,539
Since you're not talking...

153
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,339
everybody will be punished
by bastinado.

154
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:52,101
We begin by the first raw.
Get up!

155
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:03,577
Was it you?

156
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:04,423
Yes.

157
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:05,343
How did it happen?

158
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:06,936
I was running.

159
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,825
Were you hustling somebody?

160
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:09,703
No.

161
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:12,895
Tell me whoever your accomplice was.

162
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:14,686
Then you'll share the beating with him.

163
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:16,265
Or else you alone will get it.

164
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,502
Who was with you?

165
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:22,746
I'm a preacher for forty years!

166
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,977
It doesn't get knocked down
by itself.

167
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,018
This boy was obviously fighting
with somebody.

168
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:30,295
Whoever was with him
should get up now.

169
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,463
What is your name?

170
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:33,503
Mustafa.

171
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:34,946
Mustafa, I wash my hands of it.

172
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:36,182
Come here.

173
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:58,220
I'll prepare an ointment for your foot,
you're going to be allright.

174
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:01,975
Okay, just tell me.

175
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,896
What did you do to deserve
such a hard beating from the Hodja?

176
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,660
My poor child...

177
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:12,544
Come on, sleep a little.

178
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,022
I will prepare your ointment.

179
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:17,822
Cruel man!

180
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,425
He has tortured such a small child.

181
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,381
Sleep now, my baby.

182
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:28,581
Come in, Salih.

183
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:30,504
Don't exhaust Mustafa too much.

184
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:31,617
Hi.

185
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:36,583
Ouch!

186
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:37,816
Does it hurt so much?

187
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:38,817
Well, a little.

188
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:42,144
It definitely hurts very much,
but you don't tell.

189
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:44,222
Were you afraid today?

190
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,582
Yes, but you weren't afraid at all.

191
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:48,385
I was, but pretended not to be.

192
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:53,224
Here, I picked hawthorn berries for you
from the garden.

193
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:57,902
That day, he had saved me
from getting beaten, but...

194
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:01,737
I had felt deep in my heart
every blow on his feet.

195
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:08,019
We were spending every day together.

196
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:13,506
That day we were so happy
until his uncle called him.

197
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:21,741
In the middle of Manastir...

198
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:23,383
Boys!

199
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,016
Quick! Come here!

200
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,176
Come on!

201
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:33,899
My son...

202
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:38,097
I'm leaving this world.

203
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:45,382
Take this sword.

204
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,662
When you grow up
to be an honorable soldier...

205
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:01,185
you're going to wear this sword.

206
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:04,821
My dear son.

207
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:09,903
My brave son.

208
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:13,942
My brave Mustafa...

209
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:04,867
Death prayer is heard in Thessaloniki

210
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:30,507
Now I'm going to tell my Mustafa
a tale...

211
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:31,946
so that he sleeps well.

212
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:35,782
Once upon a time,
there were a mother and a son.

213
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,617
One day, the mother...

214
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,937
washed his son thoroughly
in the public bath.

215
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:45,664
Then they packed their things
and off they went.

216
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:49,659
Some horsemen wanted to kidnap his son.

217
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:52,423
When they saw them going...

218
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,898
they began to follow them.

219
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,537
As the mother and the son escaped...

220
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,099
the horsemen chased them.

221
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:04,335
As the mother and the son escaped,
the horsemen chased them.

222
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,747
Finally, the mother got angry.

223
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,860
She unpacked her bundle...

224
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:13,782
took the bowl of bath...

225
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,420
and threw it to the horsemen.

226
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:18,741
Guess what?

227
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:25,660
A wide sea gushed out right there.

228
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:41,305
Years passed by.

229
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,376
Zübeyde Mum...

230
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:46,266
had acceded to the will of Ali Rıza.

231
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,418
We were both boarding students...

232
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:50,776
in the military grammar school.

233
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:54,063
Zübeyde Mum was in great distress.

234
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:58,621
They were barely surviving, but...

235
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:02,697
as she saw Mustafa
in his dark blue uniform of felt...

236
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:06,301
she was thinking
that it was worth all this suffering.

237
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:09,383
And we were...

238
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:12,302
proud of our uniform.

239
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:15,696
Do you hear the voices?

240
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:33,345
Mustafa, come on, let's play!

241
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:34,983
Not me!

242
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:36,353
Come on, make no bones about it!

243
00:21:36,354 --> 00:21:37,673
I said I won't play!

244
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:40,295
You're so fussy! All the children play.

245
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:41,975
It's an absurd play.

246
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,342
What is the sense
jumping on each other?

247
00:21:44,707 --> 00:21:45,981
It's so stupid!

248
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,098
I swear I won't ever talk to you!

249
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:49,741
Come on, let's play a little!

250
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,136
Can we play as well?

251
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:01,462
Allright, come on!

252
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:25,743
Come on, bow!

253
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,386
If you can, jump like this.

254
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,181
But how can I?

255
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:32,260
Mustafa! Don't be a killjoy!
Look, everybody's bowing!

256
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:33,660
I told you.

257
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:34,617
I won't bow.

258
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:36,618
Let him jump like this if he can.

259
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:37,817
Bow, I say!

260
00:22:38,587 --> 00:22:42,182
Look! You pissed us so much,
you will have a nice beating!

261
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,778
Are you the son of the sultan or what?

262
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,062
Why won't you bow?

263
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,296
Are you a prince?

264
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:49,383
Was it okay
when you were jumping on us?

265
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:50,695
What are you doing, Mustafa?

266
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:55,266
I can't play, because this childish
play doesn't suit young men like you.

267
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,986
Let's try another play.

268
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:58,376
What sort of a play?

269
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,896
The play of war.
The war becomes men.

270
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,097
What is the sense of us
jumping on each other?

271
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:04,237
Are we donkeys or what?

272
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:05,905
So how will we do it?

273
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:07,502
We'll break down into two teams.

274
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:11,137
One team will try to take this place,
and the other one will defend it.

275
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,779
How will we be divided into two teams?

276
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:14,017
I'm gonna take care of it.

277
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,945
And I'll assign you the duties,
I'm the commander, allright?

278
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:18,581
Why would you be the commander?

279
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,238
Because it's just the way it is,
I'm the commander!

280
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:22,779
Now, you go there.

281
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:25,043
Salih, I appoint you
the commander of the other team.

282
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:27,742
You're so bright, Mustafa,
that's what you are!

283
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:31,539
He was really bright.

284
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,266
He was the commander.

285
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:39,380
He managed to tip the balance
in favor of us through his wit.

286
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:45,544
From that day on, I began to see
Mustafa under another light.

287
00:23:56,587 --> 00:23:57,425
Hand grenade!

288
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:58,223
Allright!

289
00:23:58,387 --> 00:23:59,297
Shrapnel!

290
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:01,776
We're withdrawing!

291
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:02,903
What?

292
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:04,824
Follow me!

293
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,220
That's cheating, Mustafa.

294
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:40,543
That's not cheating,
it's the play of war.

295
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,541
A weekend, we were on home leave.

296
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:51,903
Mustafa didn't know, that day was
one of the turning points of his life.

297
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,901
None of us knew about it.

298
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:05,822
Welcome! You're Mustafa, right?

299
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:10,506
Master Ragıp, the dinner is ready,
come please.

300
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,895
Mustafa...

301
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:18,781
Welcome!

302
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,626
You're on leave?

303
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:29,259
Well, Master Ragıp is...

304
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:32,219
now your father, my son.

305
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:41,462
Mustafa...

306
00:25:43,227 --> 00:25:44,546
I wasn't capable to tell you.

307
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:48,302
It's so bad that you came to know in
this way, but I didn't dare to tell you.

308
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,542
Look at me.

309
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:52,344
You'll understand me when you grow up.

310
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:56,536
It's hard in these times for a widow
with children to survive all alone.

311
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,896
It's been a long time
that our neighbors were pushing me.

312
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:02,457
Finally, they found a right person.

313
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,784
You'll like Master Ragıp.

314
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:08,418
I know, he can't replace your father.

315
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,698
But Master Ragıp is a nice person.

316
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,664
Where are you going?

317
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:16,536
I'm such an unfortunate woman!

318
00:26:16,987 --> 00:26:19,103
I buried my three children!

319
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:23,096
I buried my husband! If you go as well,
what am I supposed to do?

320
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:25,579
Tell me, my son!

321
00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:31,941
Mustafa went to his auntie's
that night...

322
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:34,743
and stayed there for months.

323
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,658
In the meantime,
Zübeyde Mum grieved deeply.

324
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,781
She was looking for a way
to see her son...

325
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:44,497
but Mustafa was insistent
on his decision.

326
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:47,302
My Mustafa!

327
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:49,096
How are you?

328
00:26:51,227 --> 00:26:52,626
My son.

329
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:56,738
Come back to your mommy, son.

330
00:26:57,107 --> 00:26:57,903
Mustafa?

331
00:26:58,947 --> 00:26:59,982
Mustafa?

332
00:27:12,827 --> 00:27:14,977
Zübeyde Mum was so much worried
about you...

333
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:18,985
that I felt forced to tell her
that you were hiding at your auntie's.

334
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:23,340
You did not forgive me.

335
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:26,377
You were cross with me for days.

336
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:30,057
Then we made it up
at Manastir High School.

337
00:27:30,627 --> 00:27:32,140
Do you remember?

338
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:38,060
I betrayed you thrice in my life,
my general.

339
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,545
This was the first one.

340
00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:43,216
My second betrayal...

341
00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:47,857
was my leaving Thessaloniki
without taking Zübeyde Mum.

342
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,498
And the third one...

343
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:56,262
you don't know it yet.

344
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:14,943
When we were graduated
from the high school in Manastir...

345
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,939
and returned to Thessaloniki,
Mustafa was ready for mercy.

346
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:31,019
Hence, as soon as he came back,
he first visited his mother.

347
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,819
Mom, an officer is here!

348
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,296
Brother?

349
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:44,384
We were graduated from the military
school and became officers...

350
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:50,224
and we found ourselves fighting
for an agonizing, collapsing empire.

351
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:55,819
I will never forget
that night of farewell in Thessaloniki.

352
00:29:57,787 --> 00:29:58,583
Come on!

353
00:29:58,627 --> 00:30:00,724
Let's make a toast to our departure
to Tripolitania.

354
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:02,936
Hopefully, we'll liberate our land
from the Italians.

355
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:04,866
Let's hope so!

356
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:13,736
They assigned us this mission, but...

357
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:16,256
I would have preferred to stay
in Thessaloniki.

358
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:17,703
Why?

359
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:20,615
In order to protect Thessaloniki!

360
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:22,480
We risk losing Thessaloniki as well.

361
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,418
God preserve, Mustafa,
what are you saying?

362
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:26,298
Friends, can't you see?

363
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:28,782
Every day,
they're confiscating one of our pieces.

364
00:30:31,227 --> 00:30:33,900
I fear I won't see Thessaloniki again.

365
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:40,860
If anything happens to me, I entrust
my mother and sister to your care.

366
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,941
Don't you worry for them.

367
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:45,377
I hold Zübeyde Mum
superior to my own mother.

368
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:47,056
Yes, I know.

369
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:00,586
It's such a strange place!

370
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,740
You find it strange, but is it not
a piece of our fatherland, Nuri?

371
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,641
Right, but is it worth to shed blood
to keep this place, Fethi?

372
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:08,797
I wish I was in Thessaloniki now!

373
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:10,136
Oh, Thessaloniki!

374
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:12,303
It just reminds me of the poem
of Ziya Pasha!

375
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:16,736
"I visited the land of the non-muslims,
and I saw palaces and prosperity

376
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:18,585
I roamed about in the Muslim country

377
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,863
And I just saw ruins and misery!"

378
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:22,940
Well, it's so true, Mustafa!

379
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:27,026
That's why the future of our empire
lies in the occidental civilization.

380
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,722
That ought to be our destination.

381
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:30,822
Everybody agrees with this,
but how to do this?

382
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:34,582
A solution is definitely to be found.

383
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:36,425
There's no doubt about it, Nuri.

384
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:43,057
You will become a Sultan.

385
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:52,104
You will rule for 15 years

386
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:55,185
And you will die while you're
still on the throne.

387
00:33:55,427 --> 00:33:58,464
Ruling for 15 years is enough for me!

388
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:02,137
Would our powerful sultan be so kind
as to eat with us?

389
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,422
Having fun with me?

390
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,187
Come on my sultan,
don't say that you don't like it!

391
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:07,860
And what about the concubines?

392
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:09,625
Your harem is in Istanbul anyhow.

393
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,544
No, it's in Thessaloniki!

394
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,623
Here you are, his majesty!

395
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:22,056
While they were in Tripolitania, the
empire was fighting on seven fronts.

396
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:25,106
Thessaloniki was lost.

397
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:28,739
Imperialists were dividing
the Ottoman Empire.

398
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:38,302
When the Greek army entered the city...

399
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:41,545
Turks rushed to leave Thessaloniki
in great masses.

400
00:34:41,907 --> 00:34:43,863
Makbule! Makbule!

401
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,022
Get ready!

402
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:51,576
Makbule!

403
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:25,342
Mustafa?

404
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,546
How are you?

405
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:45,145
I'm fine. Come.

406
00:35:55,147 --> 00:35:56,705
I heard that you were at the front.

407
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:58,176
Yes, I am.

408
00:35:58,467 --> 00:36:00,298
But thanks God, I'm alive.

409
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:03,499
In these days,
one should be content with this.

410
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:05,895
Salih...

411
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:08,019
Do you have any news about my mother?

412
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:09,819
Do you know where she is?

413
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:12,586
Oh Mustafa, I don't know.

414
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:16,024
Thousands of people
set off from the Balkans.

415
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:17,899
They're coming to Istanbul by walking.

416
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:19,580
Some have already arrived.

417
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:22,162
They're running from the massacres
of the bands of brigands.

418
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,225
I just hope that Zübeyde Mum
is among the survivors who came here.

419
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:28,705
Weren't you able to take care of
my mother and my sister?

420
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:31,741
Unfortunately not, Mustafa.

421
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:35,624
When Thessaloniki fell, we brought
the sultan here by an urgent journey.

422
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,059
Such a woe, Salih!

423
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:49,022
Our beautiful Thessaloniki
is already lost?

424
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,219
The seaside promenade...

425
00:36:54,387 --> 00:36:55,979
the white tower...

426
00:36:57,027 --> 00:36:58,938
So many memories!

427
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:05,104
I told you we wouldn't be able to see
again our pretty city.

428
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:07,261
Don't tell me!

429
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:09,937
I see it in my dreams every night.

430
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:13,697
The way things are going,
not only Thessaloniki...

431
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:16,217
but all of the empire will be lost.

432
00:37:16,747 --> 00:37:18,305
Look at the state we're in!

433
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:21,146
Salih...

434
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:25,105
I have to find urgently
my poor mother.

435
00:37:25,747 --> 00:37:29,103
Who knows where she is,
in what state she's in?

436
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,899
I go every day to the place
where immigrants are gathered...

437
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:38,380
but to no avail!

438
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:43,857
I hope that she came to Istanbul
safe and sound.

439
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:45,660
I hope so!

440
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,737
Were you able to bring your own family?

441
00:37:58,227 --> 00:37:59,546
Yes, I was.

442
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,346
I'm glad, my brother.

443
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:32,907
In the court of the mosque...

444
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:39,704
it is call to prayer

445
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:47,587
Mom, it's the lament of my beloved...

446
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:53,462
not the prayer

447
00:38:54,227 --> 00:39:00,826
Strangers won't mourn...

448
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:07,380
or cry for me ever

449
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:14,987
No one but my beloved
and my mother...

450
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:20,817
My heart won't recover

451
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:30,340
Mother?

452
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:56,144
Mustafa!

453
00:42:12,987 --> 00:42:16,457
They settled in the house
of a relative in Istanbul.

454
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:21,895
Mrs. Zübeyde has left her second
husband Mr. Ragıp in Thessaloniki.

455
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:27,177
But his niece Fikriye
was living in that house.

456
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:31,459
Brother Mustafa, I made you coffee.

457
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,180
Thank you, Fikriye.

458
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:34,746
You shouldn't have bothered.

459
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:38,457
You're so tired, brother Mustafa,
coffee can be a relief.

460
00:42:43,587 --> 00:42:46,101
Where did you find the delights
in this scarcity?

461
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,938
I had kept a few.

462
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,301
They're somewhat stale, but...

463
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:52,059
And you offer them to me?

464
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:54,377
No.

465
00:42:54,787 --> 00:42:57,904
I offer them to a commander,
the hero of my dreams.

466
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:04,102
Fikriye...

467
00:43:04,427 --> 00:43:05,542
You go to the kitchen.

468
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:08,622
Make some coffee for me as well,
my girl.

469
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,703
Did you get over your exhaustion,
mommy?

470
00:43:25,107 --> 00:43:26,142
Yes, I did.

471
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:30,742
The moment I saw you,
I forgot everything.

472
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:36,340
Doctor, if you permit me,
I want to ask a question.

473
00:43:36,787 --> 00:43:38,698
Of course, Mr. Salih, go ahead.

474
00:43:38,987 --> 00:43:41,342
- If it's about Atatürk...
- No, no.

475
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:44,984
In the war, I saw many soldiers
shot in the head.

476
00:43:45,947 --> 00:43:49,098
Some died,
and some survived, but became blind.

477
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:50,899
Is such a thing possible?

478
00:43:51,107 --> 00:43:52,222
Sure it is.

479
00:43:52,587 --> 00:43:55,147
When some parts of the brain
are damaged...

480
00:43:55,507 --> 00:44:01,457
though not always lethal, they can cause
blindness or other impairments.

481
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:05,584
Then are all the bullets
penetrating heart lethal?

482
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,658
Yes, they are lethal.

483
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:13,777
Because at Gallipoli, a piece
of shrapnel had hit Atatürk's heart...

484
00:44:13,907 --> 00:44:15,943
and thanks God,
nothing had happened to him.

485
00:44:16,507 --> 00:44:20,466
That's why I ask: a bullet penetrating
heart from where is definitely lethal?

486
00:44:22,547 --> 00:44:26,222
If it penetrates from here,
it is definitely lethal.

487
00:44:56,987 --> 00:45:00,343
My son, it's hard for you now
to understand this, but...

488
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:16,104
We fought against the foreigners
who occupied our country.

489
00:45:16,707 --> 00:45:23,707
Powerful states provoked internal
strikes in order to destroy us.

490
00:45:25,547 --> 00:45:28,857
They made brothers kill each other.

491
00:45:51,387 --> 00:45:54,584
British and ANZAC soldiers
are behind the hill.

492
00:45:55,227 --> 00:45:56,706
We must take the hill.

493
00:45:58,267 --> 00:46:00,019
It could change our fate, Nuri.

494
00:46:00,747 --> 00:46:02,817
I have a feeling
that the enemy is close.

495
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:04,416
But it's very quiet.

496
00:46:04,507 --> 00:46:06,384
I can't see anything.

497
00:46:12,747 --> 00:46:16,057
If they landed the troops in the night,
it may be an ambush.

498
00:46:18,547 --> 00:46:21,107
There's only one way
to understand this.

499
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:23,701
Mustafa, what are you doing?

500
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:30,426
My brave men!

501
00:46:32,947 --> 00:46:34,699
God be with us!

502
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:36,500
March!

503
00:49:29,027 --> 00:49:32,178
The nation is waiting worriedly
to hear about Atatürk's health.

504
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,478
There are thousands of people
in front of the palace.

505
00:49:34,627 --> 00:49:38,222
I say on the next report, let's write
that he's in a coma, what do you say?

506
00:49:38,427 --> 00:49:41,021
But it would trigger a great reaction!

507
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:42,661
The people can't bear this pain.

508
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:43,577
Right, but...

509
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:45,540
they will hear about this in any case.

510
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:46,377
We're losing him.

511
00:49:46,947 --> 00:49:48,380
You're making a mistake, gentlemen.

512
00:49:49,067 --> 00:49:51,297
A very big mistake!

513
00:49:58,547 --> 00:49:59,582
I am a witness of this.

514
00:49:59,987 --> 00:50:01,215
He has such a will power...

515
00:50:01,987 --> 00:50:04,820
that you will see, he will be
much better than he used to be.

516
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:07,183
It's allright Mr. Salih,
don't get upset.

517
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:11,063
If not for this watch, that shrapnel
would have ended my life, Nuri.

518
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:13,177
God spared your life.

519
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:14,863
It hurts, right?

520
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:15,943
Yes.

521
00:50:15,987 --> 00:50:17,022
It's a hematoma.

522
00:50:17,107 --> 00:50:18,256
Let's put some meat on it.

523
00:50:18,587 --> 00:50:19,736
This will cure you.

524
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:21,162
And now we'll bandage it.

525
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,826
We took this hill
of strategic importance...

526
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:28,542
but unfortunately,
we lost a great part of the troop.

527
00:50:28,627 --> 00:50:31,061
We also could have been
among those martyrs.

528
00:50:31,387 --> 00:50:32,786
Well, such is the war.

529
00:50:33,507 --> 00:50:38,217
This was Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa
Kemal's first step on the stage.

530
00:50:39,187 --> 00:50:43,226
He first exposed his military genius
in the combat of Gallipoli.

531
00:50:44,547 --> 00:50:47,300
He had been right in all his decisions
and anticipations...

532
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:49,698
so he has drawn attention
of the commanders.

533
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:52,902
Today, you changed
our fate in the war, Mustafa.

534
00:50:53,147 --> 00:50:54,466
You're exaggerating, my brother.

535
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,464
It's not such a big deal.

536
00:50:59,227 --> 00:51:00,296
Yes?

537
00:51:03,947 --> 00:51:06,859
They're calling from the headquarters
of Liman von Sanders.

538
00:51:06,947 --> 00:51:09,222
Seemingly, the commander wants
to congratulate you.

539
00:51:14,347 --> 00:51:17,384
When he became a general,
he wanted me as his aide-de-camp.

540
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:21,419
Overjoyed, I accepted his offer.

541
00:51:22,187 --> 00:51:26,578
To be his aide-de-camp meant
to be by his side all the time.

542
00:51:29,707 --> 00:51:31,060
Don't do this, my son.

543
00:51:31,347 --> 00:51:33,224
It's the same thing
as killing yourself!

544
00:51:33,387 --> 00:51:37,062
Mom, if somebody doesn't do it,
we're all condemned to death.

545
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,418
Istanbul is already under occupation.

546
00:51:39,547 --> 00:51:41,617
You'll run away from here as well?

547
00:51:42,827 --> 00:51:44,658
The British...

548
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,095
the Italian...

549
00:51:46,307 --> 00:51:48,343
the French did not recognize
our right to live.

550
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:50,298
They already shared Anatolia!

551
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:53,296
Yesterday the Greek army entered Izmir.

552
00:51:53,587 --> 00:51:55,418
Even our beautiful Izmir is lost!

553
00:51:56,227 --> 00:51:57,899
Where are we supposed to live
from now on?

554
00:51:57,987 --> 00:51:59,864
Where are we supposed to run?

555
00:51:59,987 --> 00:52:01,978
There's nowhere left to run.

556
00:52:02,187 --> 00:52:03,825
That's why we're going to Anatolia.

557
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,262
We'll incite an insurrection!

558
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:09,135
Mustafa?

559
00:52:09,987 --> 00:52:11,818
Is it not the sultan
who sends you there?

560
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:13,585
Seemingly, yes...

561
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:15,505
but he also collaborates
with enemies.

562
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:17,265
He left our country in their hands.

563
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,343
Never! How can you say that, my son?

564
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,418
Our great sultan, his majesty...

565
00:52:21,627 --> 00:52:24,300
Forget about it, mom,
I know who does what.

566
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:26,260
Mustafa...

567
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:28,344
Don't do this, my son!

568
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:30,777
Don't rebel against our sultan.

569
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:32,466
They would hang you!

570
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:34,299
Mom, don't you worry!

571
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:36,941
All your life has been spent
by worrying about me.

572
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:39,583
Everything will be allright.

573
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:42,063
I just want your blessing, mommy.

574
00:52:42,267 --> 00:52:44,258
Just your blessing.

575
00:52:46,107 --> 00:52:47,779
You have my blessing.

576
00:52:48,947 --> 00:52:50,585
You have my blessing.

577
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,099
We stopped again.

578
00:53:06,187 --> 00:53:08,576
Could this really take us to Erzurum?

579
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:10,618
I'm sorry, my general,
this junk is very old.

580
00:53:10,747 --> 00:53:13,181
But while you rest,
I'll tend to it immediately.

581
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:30,216
Salamun Alaykum.

582
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:32,264
Alaykum Salam.

583
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:34,458
The enemy is about to enter Samsun.

584
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,545
But I see that you're tilling the soil
all quietly here.

585
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,783
What are you saying, my general?

586
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:41,665
We were three brothers.

587
00:53:41,747 --> 00:53:43,066
And I had two sons.

588
00:53:43,107 --> 00:53:46,656
I lost all of them at Yemen,
at Caucasian front or at Gallipoli.

589
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:48,664
I am left all alone.

590
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:51,825
Now there are three widows
and eight orphans at home.

591
00:53:52,027 --> 00:53:53,301
They all depend...

592
00:53:53,427 --> 00:53:54,576
on this plough.

593
00:53:54,747 --> 00:53:56,783
They need to be taken care of.

594
00:53:56,987 --> 00:54:00,662
From now on, this piece of land
is my country and my home!

595
00:54:00,787 --> 00:54:03,938
I won't be of any use to you
unless the enemy comes right here!

596
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:08,943
The words of the peasant
moved Mustafa Kemal immensely...

597
00:54:09,107 --> 00:54:10,938
because he was right.

598
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:14,502
The Anatolian people were tired...

599
00:54:14,707 --> 00:54:18,222
of fighting simultaneously
on nine fronts for the last ten years.

600
00:54:20,787 --> 00:54:23,779
The war means grievance, my son.

601
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:31,059
It means famine, thirst,
diseases, dysentery...

602
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:33,899
and madness.

603
00:54:35,787 --> 00:54:39,496
It means to be pested for years...

604
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,463
by the smell of death penetrating
your nostrils day and night.

605
00:55:20,507 --> 00:55:22,657
Look at this, Nuri.

606
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:25,223
It's a human tragedy!

607
00:55:27,027 --> 00:55:30,463
The death of all those young people
is a tragedy.

608
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:33,101
Unless it is necessary
for the defense of the country...

609
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,897
all war is a crime.

610
00:55:39,187 --> 00:55:40,859
I don't mind.

611
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:45,466
This still does not change the fact
that all war aiming attack is a crime.

612
00:55:54,227 --> 00:55:55,296
God be with you.

613
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:57,418
Good luck, my general.

614
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:01,863
This is the situation
that all Anatolia is in.

615
00:56:08,347 --> 00:56:11,259
And we'll resist
against the invader enemies.

616
00:56:12,147 --> 00:56:14,183
We have no other way out.

617
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:19,641
I brought some hot tiles, my general.

618
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:21,056
Come here, Cevat.

619
00:56:29,187 --> 00:56:30,779
God dammit!

620
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:34,905
God dammit!

621
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:38,585
That's all we lacked!

622
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:40,219
You have so much pain, my general?

623
00:56:40,307 --> 00:56:42,741
Very much! You can't even imagine.

624
00:56:43,427 --> 00:56:45,987
I know, they say that
pain in kidneys is unbearable.

625
00:56:46,587 --> 00:56:48,782
It makes one tear the quilt to pieces,
they say.

626
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:53,020
We borrowed even this quilt, child,
how can I tear it to pieces?

627
00:56:53,907 --> 00:56:57,820
You need a thorough treatment, my
general, what if you go to a hospital?

628
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:00,583
Don't make me laugh Cevat,
for God's sake!

629
00:57:00,787 --> 00:57:03,859
I'm exhausted,
what hospital are you talking about?

630
00:57:06,787 --> 00:57:09,162
You have to go urgently
to the telegraph office, my general.

631
00:57:09,247 --> 00:57:11,741
The minister of war wants
to talk to you in person.

632
00:57:22,427 --> 00:57:24,463
The minister of war announced
to Mustafa Kemal...

633
00:57:24,547 --> 00:57:28,142
the sultan's command that
he returns immediately to Istanbul.

634
00:57:29,187 --> 00:57:32,577
But he did not obey this command...

635
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:35,102
that he knew the British
occupation forces dictated...

636
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:38,060
and he resigned
from all his positions in the army...

637
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:41,139
in order to continue
the national liberation fight.

638
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:43,900
He now became a rebel.

639
00:57:44,387 --> 00:57:49,142
The expected decision of death penalty
was issued on May 11th, 1920...

640
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:52,263
and announced
to all the military troops.

641
00:57:53,587 --> 00:57:56,340
I apologize if I go too far,
but this means suicide, my general!

642
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:57,997
The corps will have the news...

643
00:57:58,067 --> 00:58:00,023
and General Kazım will execute you,
God forbids.

644
00:58:00,187 --> 00:58:02,621
General Kazım is the one who invited me
to this city.

645
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:03,877
He wouldn't do such a thing!

646
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,665
But you had
the title of a general, then.

647
00:58:05,907 --> 00:58:08,865
Now you have it no more,
you rebelled against the sultan.

648
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,383
Cevat, sometimes
even though you risk your life...

649
00:58:12,507 --> 00:58:15,180
you have to do what you believe!

650
00:58:15,347 --> 00:58:17,099
There's no way back from now on!

651
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:24,106
I am already in great pain,
don't make a fuss!

652
00:58:58,787 --> 00:59:00,106
Where did you find these?

653
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:02,775
I asked from the clerks, my general.

654
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,006
We don't have any money to buy them.

655
00:59:05,467 --> 00:59:08,539
Mr. governor gave his frock.

656
00:59:08,747 --> 00:59:10,738
I'm grateful to them.

657
00:59:15,267 --> 00:59:17,064
Cevat...

658
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:18,575
Now listen to me.

659
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:20,100
Yes, sir.

660
00:59:20,187 --> 00:59:24,066
If something happens to me in this
perilous life, find immediately Salih.

661
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,063
He is supposed to take care
of my mother and my sister.

662
00:59:27,627 --> 00:59:28,776
And Fikriye as well.

663
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:30,743
Yes, sir.

664
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,864
The Caucasian Army Corps commander
General Kazım is here.

665
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,145
Let him come.

666
01:00:16,227 --> 01:00:18,457
I warn you beforehand, my friends.

667
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:20,902
You won't believe in
what you will shortly hear...

668
01:00:23,627 --> 01:00:27,063
but you shouldn't show anybody
even one page of this notebook.

669
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:30,864
It will remain secret until the end.

670
01:00:30,987 --> 01:00:32,943
We alone will know of its content.

671
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:36,297
Yes, sir!

672
01:00:38,227 --> 01:00:39,580
Then put the date.

673
01:00:41,307 --> 01:00:42,581
Write.

674
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:52,065
After the victory...

675
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:54,343
the form of government...

676
01:00:54,587 --> 01:00:56,896
will be a republic.

677
01:01:06,347 --> 01:01:07,621
This was the second point.

678
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:14,019
Thirdly...

679
01:01:14,707 --> 01:01:18,097
the women won't wear chadors anymore.

680
01:01:20,787 --> 01:01:22,664
Fourthly...

681
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:27,421
the fez will be prohibited.

682
01:01:28,707 --> 01:01:30,982
Instead, hats will be used...

683
01:01:31,427 --> 01:01:33,577
as in civilized countries.

684
01:01:35,587 --> 01:01:37,418
Fifth...

685
01:01:38,067 --> 01:01:40,376
Latin alphabet will be adopted.

686
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:44,179
Enough, my general!

687
01:01:44,427 --> 01:01:47,737
If I write more of this,
I may die out of heart failure.

688
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:49,535
My general...

689
01:01:50,267 --> 01:01:54,306
Do you really believe
that all this will become true?

690
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,106
Don't you have any doubts!

691
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:57,502
What counts...

692
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:00,579
is to familiarize people
with new ideas.

693
01:02:00,987 --> 01:02:03,820
I'd prefer that you had stayed
as a general, sir.

694
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:05,380
That's better, Mazhar.

695
01:02:05,747 --> 01:02:08,864
I don't intend to establish
a military dictatorship.

696
01:02:08,987 --> 01:02:12,866
The National Assembly
will be above us all.

697
01:02:19,227 --> 01:02:21,218
We agree with you...

698
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:26,340
but I don't believe that all this
will be accomplished so quickly.

699
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:29,341
This rush of yours astonishes me.

700
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:30,623
Not at all!

701
01:02:31,307 --> 01:02:34,982
You know me, I'm extremely realistic.

702
01:02:35,827 --> 01:02:38,295
I don't have insubstantial dreams.

703
01:02:38,347 --> 01:02:40,144
My firm belief depends on what,
do you think?

704
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:41,821
I don't know, sir.

705
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:43,336
On the state of the world.

706
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:47,099
Our ideas conform
to the course of the world.

707
01:02:47,507 --> 01:02:52,183
Look, all the monarchies collapse
one by one to be replaced by republics.

708
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:56,502
My comrades...

709
01:02:58,227 --> 01:03:02,505
Timely ideas are never out of place.

710
01:03:04,067 --> 01:03:08,060
Mustafa Kemal established
a civilian assembly at Ankara.

711
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:12,501
The Greek army that invaded Anatolia
by the support of the British...

712
01:03:12,587 --> 01:03:16,421
approached so near that the sound
of the cannons could be heard.

713
01:03:17,147 --> 01:03:21,823
Fikriye announced that she
wanted to come from Istanbul to Ankara.

714
01:03:22,587 --> 01:03:26,182
She was intending to do the
housekeeping chores for Mustafa Kemal.

715
01:03:27,027 --> 01:03:29,905
Finally, he gave her permission.

716
01:03:45,467 --> 01:03:46,377
Welcome!

717
01:03:46,427 --> 01:03:47,701
Have a nice evening.

718
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:53,416
Fikriye! What did you do?

719
01:03:53,587 --> 01:03:55,418
It's just a miracle!

720
01:03:56,027 --> 01:03:59,417
To comfort you even a little bit
is the most holy duty.

721
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:01,578
If I can ever accomplish this,
it's my pleasure.

722
01:04:02,307 --> 01:04:03,456
Thank you, Fikriye.

723
01:04:04,547 --> 01:04:05,696
Please, my friends.

724
01:04:11,987 --> 01:04:12,942
Fikriye...

725
01:04:13,427 --> 01:04:14,906
I have a request from you.

726
01:04:15,307 --> 01:04:16,945
Tell me, brother Mustafa.

727
01:04:17,507 --> 01:04:19,543
Could you uncover your head
for my sake?

728
01:04:20,947 --> 01:04:24,622
But we have men
who are not of the family.

729
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:26,816
Fikriye...

730
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:29,103
Here, there is nobody
to misjudge your reputation.

731
01:04:30,027 --> 01:04:34,020
If we are to make a revolution,
we have to begin by our own house.

732
01:04:34,987 --> 01:04:36,022
Please.

733
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:48,261
Thank you.

734
01:04:50,307 --> 01:04:53,777
Tonight sit in our company
at the table.

735
01:04:56,147 --> 01:04:57,466
Allright, brother Mustafa.

736
01:05:02,547 --> 01:05:04,344
Let's get to the table, friends.

737
01:05:15,107 --> 01:05:16,335
Please take some.

738
01:05:19,027 --> 01:05:19,857
Please.

739
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,181
Thanks.

740
01:05:24,907 --> 01:05:28,422
To the angel who descended from heavens
to our harsh and difficult life...

741
01:05:28,587 --> 01:05:30,145
to Miss Fikriye!

742
01:05:34,627 --> 01:05:35,946
Thank you.

743
01:05:36,907 --> 01:05:38,386
To Miss Fikriye!

744
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,344
To Miss Fikriye!

745
01:05:54,987 --> 01:05:57,455
I'm really curious about
that Greek commander-in-chief.

746
01:05:57,747 --> 01:05:59,578
I wonder whether
he is a soldier of worth...

747
01:06:00,187 --> 01:06:01,984
whether he can anticipate our plans.

748
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:04,700
I don't think
that he can anticipate your plans.

749
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:08,543
Poor man!
He invaded almost half of Anatolia...

750
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,738
but he is unaware that
you're his opponent.

751
01:06:11,027 --> 01:06:13,143
Come on, my general!
You embarrass me.

752
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,066
The general also
is a soldier of your rank.

753
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:18,697
If he says so, there must be a reason.

754
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:20,579
Allright, come on.

755
01:06:20,747 --> 01:06:25,218
Let's make a toast to the greatest
commander of the world, Mustafa Kemal!

756
01:06:27,627 --> 01:06:28,616
Sergeant Bekir?

757
01:06:28,707 --> 01:06:29,742
Yes, sir.

758
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,461
Play a nice record on the gramophone.

759
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:51,217
This record is scratched,
it's no good.

760
01:07:08,027 --> 01:07:09,460
To your health!

761
01:07:10,147 --> 01:07:11,580
To your health!

762
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:33,103
Fikriye...

763
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,623
You made me so proud tonight,
I thank you very much.

764
01:07:36,707 --> 01:07:40,063
The cause of my life is to make you
happy, brother Mustafa.

765
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:43,218
I will ask you something.

766
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:45,902
Why did you remove that record?

767
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,342
That was a folksong from Thessaloniki.

768
01:07:49,507 --> 01:07:52,260
We, the people of Thessaloniki,
bear a wound.

769
01:07:52,827 --> 01:07:55,421
I was afraid
that you would become over sensitive.

770
01:07:56,147 --> 01:07:57,546
Well thought.

771
01:07:58,147 --> 01:08:00,900
It wouldn't be right beside my friends.

772
01:08:03,907 --> 01:08:06,660
But now we, two people
from Thessaloniki, are alone.

773
01:08:08,307 --> 01:08:10,138
Come on, play that record.

774
01:08:25,427 --> 01:08:28,180
What if I myself play it to you
instead, brother Mustafa?

775
01:08:45,947 --> 01:08:52,947
A storm took us...

776
01:08:53,987 --> 01:09:00,987
in the sea we are swept away

777
01:09:03,387 --> 01:09:10,387
We'll be reunited, my love...

778
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:17,827
only on the Judgment Day

779
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:51,741
After that day, Fikriye never said
"brother" to Mustafa Kemal.

780
01:09:52,267 --> 01:09:55,304
She always addressed
him as "my pasha".

781
01:10:09,427 --> 01:10:10,780
Was having all the victories.

782
01:10:20,947 --> 01:10:22,824
The enemy is encircled.

783
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:25,823
Let the attack begin!

784
01:11:10,987 --> 01:11:14,184
The war is a disaster, my son.

785
01:11:15,387 --> 01:11:18,265
It forces innocent people
to leave their home, their country.

786
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:23,343
Similar to the Turks who ran away
from Thessaloniki ten years ago...

787
01:11:24,267 --> 01:11:27,737
this time the Greeks
were running away from Izmir.

788
01:11:35,947 --> 01:11:42,056
It means leaving the tombs
of your ancestors, your memories...

789
01:11:42,587 --> 01:11:45,181
the streets of your childhood,
your first loves.

790
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:51,056
You are left only with folksongs
that make you cry.

791
01:12:14,467 --> 01:12:20,463
Long live, Mustafa Kemal Pasha!

792
01:13:00,707 --> 01:13:03,380
By honoring Izmir,
you made all the Turkish nation happy.

793
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:06,459
And by honoring my house,
you made me happy.

794
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,304
Welcome, my pasha.

795
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:11,023
Thank you, ma'am.

796
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,616
Your house is truly beautiful.

797
01:13:17,747 --> 01:13:19,465
Please, sir.

798
01:13:20,747 --> 01:13:24,786
The Greek army was scattered
and the government had collapsed

799
01:13:29,347 --> 01:13:31,622
Thesalloniki, with his glorious army

800
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:36,099
But the Pasha was realistic.
The war was over. From now on

801
01:13:40,627 --> 01:13:43,460
and to the development of his country.

802
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:49,104
If you permit, my pasha...

803
01:13:49,187 --> 01:13:51,143
Come in, Miss Latife.

804
01:13:52,107 --> 01:13:52,983
Please do sit down.

805
01:13:53,027 --> 01:13:54,779
Thank you.

806
01:13:54,827 --> 01:13:58,786
My pasha, I've been educated in Europe,
I know three languages.

807
01:13:58,987 --> 01:14:01,740
If you wish, I can be your translator.

808
01:14:03,107 --> 01:14:05,143
Can you write an ultimatum in English?

809
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:06,740
Of course, my pasha.

810
01:14:12,267 --> 01:14:14,064
Please do write.

811
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,464
To the concern of the consulate...

812
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:24,256
of the empire of Great Britain
at Izmir...

813
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:29,697
We find most appropriate...

814
01:14:29,747 --> 01:14:31,897
that you withdraw in 24 hours...

815
01:14:33,907 --> 01:14:36,216
your war vessels...

816
01:14:41,867 --> 01:14:43,937
presently anchored
at the port of Izmir.

817
01:15:41,707 --> 01:15:43,618
While entering Izmir...

818
01:15:44,947 --> 01:15:48,098
I said that I would burn in regret
if we damage this beautiful city.

819
01:15:51,107 --> 01:15:52,620
But now I see...

820
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:55,380
that Izmir...

821
01:15:56,027 --> 01:15:59,224
is burning before our very eyes...

822
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:04,382
though we have reconquered it.

823
01:16:12,747 --> 01:16:17,263
It's a pity that some burning houses
belong to your family, don't they?

824
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,421
Let all our asset burn, my pasha.

825
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:24,902
All of Izmir can burn.

826
01:16:26,547 --> 01:16:28,219
Just so you are allright...

827
01:16:29,707 --> 01:16:31,823
just so nothing happens to you.

828
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:34,862
We can create a new Izmir
just by your command!

829
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:41,101
So you trust me that much?

830
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,066
Who am I to trust you, my pasha?

831
01:16:45,627 --> 01:16:47,857
I've been for many nights
on this terrace...

832
01:16:48,227 --> 01:16:51,025
crying while looking
at the foreign ships at the port.

833
01:16:52,467 --> 01:16:54,344
I used to say: "Come, Mustafa Pasha.

834
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:56,465
Come, Mustafa Kemal Pasha."

835
01:17:03,427 --> 01:17:04,906
Don't, child.

836
01:17:05,507 --> 01:17:06,940
Please, don't.

837
01:17:09,787 --> 01:17:11,743
Don't cry anymore.

838
01:17:14,827 --> 01:17:17,387
Come on,
wipe the tears from your eyes.

839
01:18:01,307 --> 01:18:06,222
In the middle of Manastir

840
01:18:06,627 --> 01:18:11,860
There is a pool, a nice pool

841
01:18:12,427 --> 01:18:17,820
The girls of this land are all cool

842
01:18:18,147 --> 01:18:22,140
We just play and dance

843
01:18:23,627 --> 01:18:29,179
The girls of this land are all cool

844
01:18:29,347 --> 01:18:33,465
We just play and dance

845
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:43,866
Thank you very much, Latife.

846
01:18:44,107 --> 01:18:45,540
You reminded me of my childhood.

847
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:48,221
This hospitality, this music...

848
01:18:48,467 --> 01:18:51,140
translations from foreign newspapers
in the mornings...

849
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:53,420
I really got used to it.

850
01:18:53,867 --> 01:18:55,664
I don't know what to do
back in Ankara!

851
01:18:55,827 --> 01:18:57,146
That's easy, my pasha.

852
01:18:57,347 --> 01:18:59,656
You can take me to Ankara with you,
that's just it!

853
01:18:59,947 --> 01:19:01,346
Right.

854
01:19:03,147 --> 01:19:05,377
During our stay of three weeks there...

855
01:19:05,627 --> 01:19:08,585
Latife organized excellent feasts...

856
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:12,018
she played for the guests
European style pieces on piano...

857
01:19:12,427 --> 01:19:14,782
she translated
Mustafa Kemal's writings.

858
01:19:15,307 --> 01:19:17,218
Now in his eyes...

859
01:19:17,427 --> 01:19:19,987
she became the female
figure representing

860
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,547
the modern Turkey he wanted to create.

861
01:19:24,347 --> 01:19:27,703
Everything was turning out to be
to poor Fikriye's disadvantage.

862
01:19:28,547 --> 01:19:31,220
Fikriye was representing the Orient...

863
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:33,139
while Latife...

864
01:19:33,427 --> 01:19:34,780
was the Occident.

865
01:19:34,907 --> 01:19:36,499
Fikriye was the past...

866
01:19:37,347 --> 01:19:40,225
Latife the future.

867
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:44,657
It's such a beautiful creature,
isn't it, Fikriye?

868
01:19:45,227 --> 01:19:46,501
Yes, my pasha.

869
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:48,175
It's such a pretty dog.

870
01:19:49,787 --> 01:19:52,426
When I despaired about everything...

871
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:54,620
I dreamed of settling in a farm...

872
01:19:55,307 --> 01:19:57,662
living with dogs and horses.

873
01:19:58,787 --> 01:20:00,505
I wish that had been true, my pasha.

874
01:20:01,067 --> 01:20:03,023
Then I would be your eternal servant.

875
01:20:04,747 --> 01:20:06,339
You're here by my side in any case.

876
01:20:07,787 --> 01:20:09,857
Yes, but my pasha...

877
01:20:10,627 --> 01:20:12,583
I just don't know.

878
01:20:15,347 --> 01:20:17,463
What are you afraid of, Fikriye?

879
01:20:17,707 --> 01:20:20,346
They say that you met a girl at Izmir.

880
01:20:21,027 --> 01:20:23,222
Apparently,
she is much superior than me.

881
01:20:24,267 --> 01:20:25,495
Educated...

882
01:20:26,707 --> 01:20:28,618
speaking many languages.

883
01:20:30,187 --> 01:20:31,063
Fikriye...

884
01:20:31,547 --> 01:20:32,775
Don't mind all this.

885
01:20:33,587 --> 01:20:35,259
You're irreplaceable.

886
01:20:37,627 --> 01:20:39,743
I can't live without you, my pasha.

887
01:20:41,067 --> 01:20:42,136
I just can't live.

888
01:20:48,387 --> 01:20:49,263
Fikriye?

889
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:52,378
You never told me about your disease?

890
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:53,746
That's not a disease, my pasha.

891
01:20:54,107 --> 01:20:55,665
I just have a tooth bleeding.

892
01:20:56,587 --> 01:20:58,100
I should have known better.

893
01:20:58,867 --> 01:21:00,905
Your elder sister had also died
from tuberculosis.

894
01:21:01,427 --> 01:21:03,677
We go immediately to the mansion,
we'll call the doctors.

895
01:21:03,747 --> 01:21:04,702
My pasha...

896
01:21:05,547 --> 01:21:06,741
My pasha, please!

897
01:21:07,387 --> 01:21:08,979
I can't do without you!

898
01:21:10,107 --> 01:21:10,903
Please!

899
01:21:11,227 --> 01:21:12,455
Fikriye, off to the mansion
immediately!

900
01:21:12,547 --> 01:21:13,343
My pasha, please!

901
01:21:22,947 --> 01:21:24,400
Even though I'm destined to die...

902
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,224
I'd like to die by your side.

903
01:21:29,227 --> 01:21:30,979
Don't even mention death, Fikriye.

904
01:21:31,907 --> 01:21:33,579
You'll get over this illness...

905
01:21:33,947 --> 01:21:35,096
and you'll come back.

906
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:37,146
I will wait for you here.

907
01:21:39,747 --> 01:21:41,100
Come on, get in the car.

908
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:55,906
Farewell.

909
01:22:13,747 --> 01:22:19,185
The doctors found that the tuberculosis
of Fikriye was very progressed.

910
01:22:19,947 --> 01:22:22,905
Her illness was a peril
to both herself and the pasha.

911
01:22:23,307 --> 01:22:29,462
So they decided that
she goes to a sanatorium at Munich.

912
01:22:32,227 --> 01:22:35,219
I just can't stand the idea that this
magnificent palace will be his tomb.

913
01:22:37,227 --> 01:22:40,378
Every time I think that he will die,
it's as if my head explodes.

914
01:22:40,947 --> 01:22:44,906
I don't believe that any of us can feel
this as deeply as you do, Mr. Salih.

915
01:22:45,587 --> 01:22:47,623
You spent all your life together,
right?

916
01:22:48,187 --> 01:22:49,336
Yes.

917
01:22:49,787 --> 01:22:51,220
Since we were six years old...

918
01:22:51,787 --> 01:22:53,664
we studied in the same schools.

919
01:22:53,987 --> 01:22:56,217
Forgive me if I take too much liberty,
Mr. Salih...

920
01:22:56,547 --> 01:22:57,875
but I want to ask you something.

921
01:22:58,147 --> 01:22:58,977
Go ahead.

922
01:22:59,347 --> 01:23:01,303
Haven't you ever get jealous
of your friend?

923
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:05,057
Do you ever wonder
why he has risen up so higher than you?

924
01:23:05,387 --> 01:23:07,218
After all, we're all human beings.

925
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:11,897
You asked me an interesting question,
Doctor.

926
01:23:15,107 --> 01:23:16,699
Let me figure it out.

927
01:23:17,227 --> 01:23:19,343
Have I ever get jealous of him?

928
01:23:21,227 --> 01:23:22,262
I don't know.

929
01:23:23,307 --> 01:23:27,744
Maybe at the beginning, I have thought
why I couldn't be as eminent as him.

930
01:23:28,827 --> 01:23:32,661
But later on, I assure you
that I never had such a feeling.

931
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:35,223
This is...

932
01:23:36,787 --> 01:23:38,379
how should I say...

933
01:23:39,107 --> 01:23:40,460
this is something like...

934
01:23:41,587 --> 01:23:42,497
you know...

935
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:46,056
Could you get jealous
of the Mount Ararat?

936
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:49,541
Or of a cloud passing by in the sky?

937
01:23:50,787 --> 01:23:52,425
Or of the Mediterranean Sea?

938
01:23:54,107 --> 01:23:55,745
So getting jealous of Mustafa Kemal...

939
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:58,103
is such an irrational thing for me.

940
01:23:58,387 --> 01:24:00,582
I see, Mr. Salih,
I understand you very well.

941
01:24:18,107 --> 01:24:19,335
Welcome.

942
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:20,941
Thank you, my child.

943
01:24:25,507 --> 01:24:26,622
Thanks.

944
01:24:29,067 --> 01:24:30,022
Here she is, mommy.

945
01:24:30,227 --> 01:24:32,138
This girlie is Latife.

946
01:24:32,947 --> 01:24:34,175
Come here.

947
01:24:38,347 --> 01:24:42,260
Salih, she's such a beauty!

948
01:24:42,547 --> 01:24:45,186
Her ladyship spoils me!

949
01:24:48,507 --> 01:24:51,419
You really are
Mustafa Kemal Pasha's mother!

950
01:24:51,747 --> 01:24:53,066
Yes, I am...

951
01:24:53,907 --> 01:24:57,104
but he doesn't resemble me,
I do resemble him.

952
01:24:58,267 --> 01:24:59,063
Come.

953
01:24:59,107 --> 01:24:59,903
Come.

954
01:25:02,267 --> 01:25:07,295
Miss Latife welcomed Zübeyde Mum
in her mansion for ten days.

955
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:12,024
She revered her in every way, but
Zübeyde Mum's health was deteriorated.

956
01:25:12,067 --> 01:25:16,140
In the meantime, her ideas about
Miss Latife had changed dramatically.

957
01:25:17,307 --> 01:25:20,105
This is my will to you.

958
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:24,417
He shouldn't marry that girl.

959
01:25:24,747 --> 01:25:25,782
Allright.

960
01:25:26,147 --> 01:25:27,580
My son shouldn't be unhappy.

961
01:25:42,187 --> 01:25:44,098
Take this to my Mustafa.

962
01:25:45,947 --> 01:25:47,585
His father gave it to me.

963
01:25:50,707 --> 01:25:52,743
She wanted so much
to come to Ankara to warn you...

964
01:25:52,907 --> 01:25:54,625
but suddenly she got worse.

965
01:25:56,907 --> 01:25:59,580
Since I believed
that you would be happy with Latife...

966
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:02,056
I never told you about her wish.

967
01:26:04,427 --> 01:26:06,622
So all this is because of me.

968
01:26:08,067 --> 01:26:09,546
Your marriage...

969
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:13,059
all those terrible events...

970
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:16,777
your heart attacks...

971
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:21,184
Zübeyde Mum was right.

972
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,383
She had seen the reality...

973
01:26:25,227 --> 01:26:27,263
but I concealed it from you.

974
01:26:29,867 --> 01:26:32,335
Only now I confess it, my general.

975
01:26:34,387 --> 01:26:36,947
I'll never forgive myself.

976
01:26:46,347 --> 01:26:47,666
Sergeant, why did we stop?

977
01:26:47,867 --> 01:26:50,779
My general,
there is an urgent telegraph for you!

978
01:26:53,787 --> 01:26:55,459
I know, my mother died.

979
01:26:57,947 --> 01:26:59,665
Yesterday night I had a dream.

980
01:27:00,787 --> 01:27:04,177
I was strolling in the meadows
together with mom, then came a flood...

981
01:27:04,907 --> 01:27:06,625
and took my mom away.

982
01:27:13,227 --> 01:27:14,626
Now I'm left with my people.

983
01:27:14,747 --> 01:27:16,166
My condolences to you, my general.

984
01:27:18,307 --> 01:27:20,263
Let us continue, sergeant.

985
01:27:20,387 --> 01:27:21,502
Yes, sir!

986
01:27:53,587 --> 01:27:54,622
Mom...

987
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:22,816
Good morning.

988
01:28:23,027 --> 01:28:24,824
Good morning.

989
01:29:23,427 --> 01:29:26,737
The Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha
married two weeks ago

990
01:29:27,507 --> 01:29:29,463
Cemal, are the roses ready?

991
01:29:30,067 --> 01:29:33,184
And remove this mess in the middle
of the room, I don't want to see it.

992
01:29:33,307 --> 01:29:35,775
Don't forget that the orchestra comes
for the evening.

993
01:29:36,507 --> 01:29:37,656
Look at this!

994
01:29:39,147 --> 01:29:40,580
I hope you'll do some dusting here!

995
01:29:40,747 --> 01:29:42,465
I want you to remove this cloth.

996
01:29:42,987 --> 01:29:45,660
Don't forget that all the waiters
will wear gloves.

997
01:29:45,907 --> 01:29:46,783
Gloves!

998
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:49,736
Good morning, my dear.

999
01:29:50,027 --> 01:29:50,982
Good morning.

1000
01:29:51,187 --> 01:29:52,063
Latife...

1001
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:54,419
They're not waiters, but soldiers.

1002
01:29:54,547 --> 01:29:56,583
They don't wear gloves!

1003
01:30:01,307 --> 01:30:02,820
What are you up to, Latife?

1004
01:30:02,947 --> 01:30:05,236
I'm just trying to embellish
this outmoded house.

1005
01:30:05,267 --> 01:30:07,180
I'm trying to introduce
some civilization here.

1006
01:30:07,227 --> 01:30:09,243
I told you, they're to go downstairs,
not upstairs!

1007
01:30:09,627 --> 01:30:11,219
Enough, Latife!

1008
01:30:14,307 --> 01:30:15,103
Allright.

1009
01:30:15,347 --> 01:30:17,019
Look, let us make a deal.

1010
01:30:17,627 --> 01:30:20,983
Do whatever you want with the rest of
the house, just don't touch my study.

1011
01:30:21,347 --> 01:30:22,223
Allright?

1012
01:30:24,107 --> 01:30:25,825
Allright.

1013
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:28,064
For the moment, let's do so.

1014
01:30:30,267 --> 01:30:32,486
Following long debates
at the assembly,

1015
01:30:32,487 --> 01:30:34,704
everybody cried "Long
live the Republic!"

1016
01:30:35,547 --> 01:30:39,779
The Ottoman empire of 600 years
became history officially.

1017
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:42,303
This would be followed
by the abolishment of the caliphate...

1018
01:30:42,387 --> 01:30:43,556
the revolution in clothing...

1019
01:30:43,787 --> 01:30:46,347
and the adoption
of the Latin alphabet.

1020
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:49,380
All of these were coming
like thunder, successively.

1021
01:30:49,867 --> 01:30:52,825
But in the meantime,
there came another person.

1022
01:30:53,587 --> 01:30:55,145
An unexpected guest.

1023
01:30:55,307 --> 01:30:57,104
I came to see the Pasha.

1024
01:31:06,947 --> 01:31:08,824
Yes ma'am, may I help you?

1025
01:31:09,027 --> 01:31:11,177
I came to see the Pasha.

1026
01:31:11,347 --> 01:31:12,666
Did you have an appointment?

1027
01:31:13,107 --> 01:31:15,575
No, but he knows me well.

1028
01:31:15,867 --> 01:31:19,257
Oh, welcome Miss Fikriye!

1029
01:31:19,747 --> 01:31:20,736
Welcome!

1030
01:31:21,187 --> 01:31:22,825
Thank you, Cemal.

1031
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,142
You don't know me...

1032
01:31:25,187 --> 01:31:27,045
but in fact
I'm the mistress of this mansion.

1033
01:31:27,267 --> 01:31:28,916
I beg your pardon,
I don't recognize you.

1034
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:32,626
Please sit and wait, while I go and see
whether the Pasha is already awake.

1035
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,259
Everything's been changed, Cemal.

1036
01:31:54,947 --> 01:31:57,939
Oh ma'am, don't ask me!

1037
01:31:59,467 --> 01:32:00,456
It's Mrs. Latife, right?

1038
01:32:03,787 --> 01:32:04,856
Excuse me.

1039
01:32:15,427 --> 01:32:17,099
A guest at this hour? So strange!

1040
01:32:17,627 --> 01:32:18,423
Who is it?

1041
01:32:19,627 --> 01:32:20,696
Miss Fikriye.

1042
01:32:21,267 --> 01:32:22,177
Fikriye?

1043
01:32:22,707 --> 01:32:25,426
Fikriye? Send her away!
Send her away immediately!

1044
01:32:25,947 --> 01:32:27,182
Ma'am, please don't get upset.

1045
01:32:27,187 --> 01:32:29,417
Mr. aide-de-camp, send her away,
that's an order!

1046
01:32:29,507 --> 01:32:31,702
Listen, that woman
is a peril to the Pasha.

1047
01:32:31,827 --> 01:32:34,860
She came here without his permission,
you'll be responsible of what happens.

1048
01:32:34,987 --> 01:32:36,261
Shouldn't we consult the Pasha?

1049
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:39,624
He is sleeping, you can't disturb him.
Off you go to do your duty now!

1050
01:32:40,027 --> 01:32:40,857
Yes, ma'am.

1051
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:41,943
Now!

1052
01:33:02,547 --> 01:33:04,656
Ma'am, the Pasha is sleeping.

1053
01:33:04,707 --> 01:33:06,062
I'm not entitled to disturb him.

1054
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:06,943
Wake him up!

1055
01:33:07,187 --> 01:33:08,540
Say that Fikriye is here!

1056
01:33:08,747 --> 01:33:09,902
Ma'am, I can't disturb him.

1057
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:14,056
You better go now, and
come back at a more appropriate time.

1058
01:33:14,387 --> 01:33:15,581
I won't go anywhere!

1059
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:16,663
Ma'am!

1060
01:33:16,787 --> 01:33:18,459
I beseech you, be reasonable.

1061
01:33:18,747 --> 01:33:20,066
You can't stay here.

1062
01:33:20,707 --> 01:33:21,742
Sir...

1063
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:24,057
You say I can't stay here,
but this is my own house!

1064
01:33:24,627 --> 01:33:27,016
Ma'am, I must definitely say that...

1065
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,706
you have to leave here immediately.

1066
01:33:28,907 --> 01:33:29,896
She should leave!

1067
01:33:30,107 --> 01:33:30,903
Ma'am, please.

1068
01:33:41,307 --> 01:33:42,376
What is this gun?

1069
01:33:45,107 --> 01:33:46,301
Give it to me.

1070
01:33:47,147 --> 01:33:48,375
Ma'am, give it to me.

1071
01:33:48,787 --> 01:33:52,257
This pistol is the present
of Mustafa Kemal Pasha to me, sir.

1072
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,716
Will you take it by force?

1073
01:33:53,947 --> 01:33:55,699
If that is the case,
put it in your purse.

1074
01:33:56,627 --> 01:33:57,742
Ma'am, listen to me.

1075
01:33:57,947 --> 01:34:00,063
Now it's a security matter.

1076
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:01,900
So I request
you leave here immediately.

1077
01:34:01,987 --> 01:34:02,783
Right now.

1078
01:34:02,947 --> 01:34:04,016
Sir...

1079
01:34:04,547 --> 01:34:06,856
The place you want me to leave
is my house.

1080
01:34:07,147 --> 01:34:09,058
If you don't believe me,
ask the servants.

1081
01:34:09,147 --> 01:34:10,865
Will you cast me out
from my own house?

1082
01:34:11,427 --> 01:34:12,621
Ma'am, please.

1083
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:13,743
Please.

1084
01:34:15,307 --> 01:34:16,183
My pasha!

1085
01:34:16,307 --> 01:34:17,103
Ma'am!

1086
01:34:17,987 --> 01:34:18,863
My pasha!

1087
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:19,863
Ma'am, please!

1088
01:34:19,907 --> 01:34:20,703
My pasha!

1089
01:34:24,067 --> 01:34:24,897
My pasha!

1090
01:34:25,467 --> 01:34:26,502
Fikriye?

1091
01:34:27,267 --> 01:34:28,416
My pasha!

1092
01:34:28,547 --> 01:34:29,457
Send that woman away!

1093
01:34:47,107 --> 01:34:48,142
My pasha!

1094
01:35:13,227 --> 01:35:14,865
Go ahead!

1095
01:37:26,227 --> 01:37:31,221
This unexpected tragedy ruined all.
He was unable to recover for months.

1096
01:37:32,947 --> 01:37:35,541
My son, how can you keep this
as a secret?

1097
01:37:35,607 --> 01:37:36,776
But my father made me swear.

1098
01:37:36,827 --> 01:37:38,376
How can you swear for this, Muzaffer?

1099
01:37:38,407 --> 01:37:40,138
Maybe your mother
will convince Mr. Salih.

1100
01:37:40,227 --> 01:37:41,865
My God, I hope we're not late.

1101
01:37:53,027 --> 01:37:53,937
Good morning.

1102
01:37:54,147 --> 01:37:55,216
Good morning.

1103
01:37:58,427 --> 01:37:59,596
You're an early riser today.

1104
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:02,704
Yes, you looked tired,
I didn't want to wake you up.

1105
01:38:02,787 --> 01:38:03,663
Thanks.

1106
01:38:04,827 --> 01:38:06,101
Look, Kemal.

1107
01:38:06,267 --> 01:38:08,223
You're on the cover
of even Time magazine.

1108
01:38:09,427 --> 01:38:13,864
They praise you for creating a modern
state from an ancient feudal society.

1109
01:38:13,947 --> 01:38:15,300
But everybody praises you.

1110
01:38:15,507 --> 01:38:17,065
Even your former enemies.

1111
01:38:17,547 --> 01:38:20,180
I was surprised most
by the former British prime minister.

1112
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:23,016
The man who once said "The Turks
should be exiled to Central Asia"...

1113
01:38:23,027 --> 01:38:23,823
says now that...

1114
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:25,879
"A genius comes to world
every few centuries.

1115
01:38:25,907 --> 01:38:28,102
This chance is now granted
unfortunately to Turks."

1116
01:38:30,067 --> 01:38:31,295
Leave all this aside.

1117
01:38:32,667 --> 01:38:34,897
What really concerns me
is your attitude.

1118
01:38:35,907 --> 01:38:37,101
You torment me.

1119
01:38:37,827 --> 01:38:38,623
What's wrong?

1120
01:38:38,707 --> 01:38:39,617
What more?

1121
01:38:40,907 --> 01:38:44,820
You embarrass me in the crowd.
Bad temper, disputes...

1122
01:38:46,107 --> 01:38:47,540
I don't want to hurt you...

1123
01:38:47,587 --> 01:38:49,020
I bear it...

1124
01:38:49,307 --> 01:38:51,138
I show patience...

1125
01:38:51,427 --> 01:38:52,655
but you are way out of line.

1126
01:38:52,787 --> 01:38:56,746
Kemal, I'm tired of sitting around the
same table every night with those men!

1127
01:38:56,987 --> 01:38:58,659
They are my comrades.

1128
01:38:59,067 --> 01:39:01,183
Well, it's not how an marriage works!

1129
01:39:03,107 --> 01:39:05,337
Yes, but these are not ordinary times!

1130
01:39:05,507 --> 01:39:07,179
We're building a civilization here!

1131
01:39:08,307 --> 01:39:10,537
Please, try to understand, Fikriye.

1132
01:39:13,427 --> 01:39:15,657
Fikriye?

1133
01:39:24,427 --> 01:39:25,826
Latife!

1134
01:40:00,307 --> 01:40:01,296
Soldiers!

1135
01:40:29,907 --> 01:40:31,784
Were you wrestling in the village,
child?

1136
01:40:31,907 --> 01:40:33,103
Yes, I used to, my commander.

1137
01:40:33,107 --> 01:40:34,460
Were you a good wrestler?

1138
01:40:34,827 --> 01:40:36,485
Nobody can knock me down, my commander.

1139
01:40:38,067 --> 01:40:39,341
I was also a good wrestler.

1140
01:40:41,027 --> 01:40:42,426
Can you beat me?

1141
01:40:42,467 --> 01:40:44,139
All the world wasn't able
to beat you...

1142
01:40:44,307 --> 01:40:45,137
how can I?

1143
01:40:45,947 --> 01:40:47,141
Well done, boy.

1144
01:40:48,187 --> 01:40:52,260
Now you're done chatting with friends,
and it's turn of the soldiers, Kemal?

1145
01:41:12,107 --> 01:41:14,382
That day we all were so scared.

1146
01:41:15,187 --> 01:41:17,143
When he pulled himself together...

1147
01:41:17,227 --> 01:41:19,263
he told me to send Latife immediately
to Izmir...

1148
01:41:19,587 --> 01:41:22,101
and to start
with the procedure of divorce.

1149
01:41:23,747 --> 01:41:25,385
He had been too patient...

1150
01:41:26,067 --> 01:41:27,580
but it was his final decision.

1151
01:41:29,427 --> 01:41:32,339
Then he never saw Mrs. Latife again.

1152
01:41:34,667 --> 01:41:36,464
He didn't answer
her begging letters either.

1153
01:41:37,107 --> 01:41:37,903
My general...

1154
01:41:39,747 --> 01:41:41,385
Do you hear me, my general?

1155
01:41:43,467 --> 01:41:44,900
Do you hear me?

1156
01:41:47,187 --> 01:41:49,860
What if you just get up
and run away from this palace?

1157
01:41:50,627 --> 01:41:51,616
Tell me, my general.

1158
01:41:52,667 --> 01:41:54,180
As you like...

1159
01:41:54,947 --> 01:41:56,539
as you always do...

1160
01:41:58,347 --> 01:42:00,178
without anybody noticing...

1161
01:42:00,867 --> 01:42:02,903
What do you say, my general?

1162
01:42:48,547 --> 01:42:49,900
Please.

1163
01:43:01,227 --> 01:43:02,546
In the last years of his life...

1164
01:43:03,147 --> 01:43:04,216
he took pleasure in...

1165
01:43:04,267 --> 01:43:07,339
secretly running away from the palace
and getting in the crowd.

1166
01:43:08,387 --> 01:43:10,537
He wanted to observe closely...

1167
01:43:10,707 --> 01:43:12,663
the modernization
of the Turkish society.

1168
01:43:31,227 --> 01:43:37,746
That day, he was so merry, and wanted
for the last time to dance Zeybek.

1169
01:43:38,147 --> 01:43:41,264
But his state of health
did not let him.

1170
01:43:42,067 --> 01:43:47,664
At that moment, to my pain,
I saw in his eyes the death.

1171
01:43:48,907 --> 01:43:49,817
My general...

1172
01:43:56,067 --> 01:43:57,386
My son...

1173
01:43:57,547 --> 01:44:00,015
I don't have much time left.

1174
01:44:00,307 --> 01:44:04,061
I trust you for the care of
your mother and sisters.

1175
01:44:04,707 --> 01:44:06,857
Farewell.

1176
01:46:31,867 --> 01:46:33,539
I feel really fine, mom.

1177
01:46:38,387 --> 01:46:39,342
Mommy?

1178
01:46:39,427 --> 01:46:41,861
You never told me the end of the tale.

1179
01:46:42,387 --> 01:46:45,185
Was the mother able to save her child?

1180
01:46:54,827 --> 01:46:56,180
But mom...

1181
01:48:27,387 --> 01:48:29,586
Salih Bozok, seriously wounded,
was taken to hospital.

1182
01:48:29,587 --> 01:48:31,585
He died on April 21st, 1941.

1183
01:48:32,307 --> 01:48:33,867
The tombs of Atatürk, Salih Bozok...

1184
01:48:33,868 --> 01:48:36,984
Nuri Conker and Miss Fikriye are in
Ankara Mrs. Zübeyde's tomb is in Izmir.

1185
01:48:38,067 --> 01:48:43,346
None of them was able to see
Thessaloniki again.

1186
01:48:44,227 --> 01:48:48,937
Mrs. Latife died in 1975 at Istanbul.

1187
01:48:50,707 --> 01:48:54,106
Venizelos, the Greek
prime minister, nominated...

1188
01:48:54,107 --> 01:48:57,463
Atatürk for the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1934.

1189
01:48:59,067 --> 01:49:01,906
The republic, founded
by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk...

1190
01:49:01,907 --> 01:49:04,740
and his friends, celebrated
its 87th anniversary.

1191
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:08,840
