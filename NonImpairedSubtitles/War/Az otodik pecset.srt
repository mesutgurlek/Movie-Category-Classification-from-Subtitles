10
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:18,000
Mr. Kiraly! Who would
believe it?

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,075
It cannot be true.
Impossible, these days!

12
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,050
So you don't believe it?

13
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,900
So you don't?
Here it is!

14
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
My God that's some meat!

15
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,100
Really nice.

16
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,800
It's beautiful!

17
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,900
I don't remember
when I saw such a thing.

18
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,131
Now you see!

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,750
I traded it for a
Romanische Baukunst,

20
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,900
and a collector's prize:
a wonderful Bosch

21
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,350
I am going to have a
big dinner tonight.

22
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,400
So what?

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,460
Won't you die then?

24
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:03,900
What?

25
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:05,450
I said
won't you die then?

26
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,500
If what?

27
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,500
If you have a
big dinner tonight.

28
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:13,075
Philosophical mood again?
Did you do a dirty job?

29
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,400
We all do the job we can.

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,833
Some will have veal-breast
some chicken meat tonight,

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,800
depending what you have.

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
But you can get
veal-breast

33
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,550
only in the crookedest way
these days!

34
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,750
Here you are
it's on the house!

35
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:31,575
No objections, Bela,

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,141
it's bloody cold outside.

37
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,300
You surely know

38
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,950
what kind of meat this was?

39
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,075
Veal-breast. A most
beautiful one!

40
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,500
How do you know,

41
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,900
it wasn't human breast?

42
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,850
Don't be disgusting,
Mr. Auricular!

43
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,075
Keep your perversity
to yourself!

44
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,500
You won't spoil my
appetite.

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,075
I ran my legs off for it!

46
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,285
I bet you don't even know,
who Bosch is...

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,400
Don't worry,
I will enjoy my meat!

48
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,200
Veal-breast...
it's good food!

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,950
I'm beginning to forget
how to prepare it!

50
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,195
I might just as well
tell you how.

51
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,250
My wife makes it so...
that...

52
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,450
she takes the meat,
I mean not too...

53
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,250
Is that veal breast yours
or Mr. Kiraly's?

54
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,650
Then, will you please
let Mr. Kiraly speak?

55
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:30,800
All right,
I didn't say a word.

56
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,376
Please don't embarrass me,
Mr. Auricular!

57
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:36,750
But I'd gladly tell you
how to make it,

58
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,200
since I happen to have
a special recipe...

59
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,075
This doesn't mean that
the wife of our friend,

60
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,075
whom I respect as a
good housewife,

61
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,500
couldn't prepare it
even better than I...

62
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,550
I believe, it's not the way

63
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,300
you do the stuffing,

64
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,075
but larding is
what really counts...

65
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,075
Everything depends on this.

66
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,250
While preparing to lard it,

67
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,250
you must be careful

68
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,550
to make the ham
really crispy...

69
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:08,500
Then you can lard the
veal-breast

70
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,850
with the tasty, saucy
crispy ham.

71
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,350
and you can add
if you want to,

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,000
some very thin slices
of cheese...

73
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,350
I'd like to see what

74
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,750
a veal-breast would be!

75
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,850
- So you'd like to see it!
- I do!

76
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,550
Have you seen a roast-meat
without garlic?

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,075
Of course,
there is garlic in it!

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,928
Say! Have you or
haven't you?

79
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,600
Without garlic?

80
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,750
There's no roast-meat
without garlic!

81
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:11,441
And I bet you
there'll never be!

82
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,075
If you want to know
how to make it good

83
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,450
I should tell you
how my wife makes it...

84
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:25,750
She takes the meat
not too big a piece,

85
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:29,450
She washes it clean,
some people

86
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,433
even wash it twice...

87
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,750
Hurry up a little bit,
mister

88
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:38,036
All we need is
an air-raid warden!

89
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,075
I would gladly hurry...
but I can't.

90
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,416
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to hurt you.

91
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,200
What would you like to have?

92
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,081
I don't really know
what I can ask...

93
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Have some hot-spiced wine!

94
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,300
It would do you good now!

95
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,350
I could do with some
hot spiced wine, now.

96
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,600
Don't listen to
what he's saying!

97
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,700
Just let his remarks pass!

98
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,075
I don't have any
hot spiced wine

99
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,824
and he knows it very well.

100
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,750
Could I have then
half a liter of wine?

101
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:29,271
Here's your wine!

102
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:34,075
You can sit here mister
if you want to.

103
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,406
Come over here!

104
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,800
Thank you so much.

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,900
Good evening, gentlemen!

106
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,081
I would join your table
if you don't mind...

107
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,213
Please, do!

108
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:48,850
There's always some room
to swing a cat here...

109
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,450
Thank you again.

110
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,800
Let me take my overcoat off,

111
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,850
it's quite warm here.

112
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,200
Yes, do take it off.

113
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,700
Give it to me,
let me help you.

114
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,200
It's quite alright...

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,200
A cigarette, Mr. Kovacs?

116
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,060
Please, help yourself...

117
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,350
What? "Darling"? You're
really well off!

118
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,650
You're full of complaints
with such treasures...

119
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,360
I got it from the captain
this afternoon.

120
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,000
This brand is becoming
quite popular.

121
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,750
It is said to be flavored
with honey.

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,750
I don't really see why those
classy people like it...

123
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,700
It's almost like
sipping on perfume...

124
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,850
Only because they like
to show off.

125
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,050
Don't think that
they enjoy it.

126
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,800
They always want
something different!

127
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,250
When I was young
I worked

128
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,550
in Balaz's restaurant.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,250
It must have been
long ago...

130
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,950
There was a villa-house
near.

131
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,050
A council lived in it,
some real aristocrat...

132
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,250
He stepped out to his
terrace every day,

133
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,750
and did his gymnastics
completely nude...

134
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,250
Nude?

135
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,800
Completely nude.

136
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,000
He must have been
some maniac

137
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,250
A maniac! That's good!

138
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,300
If I may interrupt you...

139
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,900
When I once visited an
aristocratic family...

140
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,150
What's your profession,
mister, if I may ask.

141
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,500
I am a Photographer.

142
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,950
Actually, I am an
artistic photographer.

143
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,500
A what?

144
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,250
Artistic photographer,
my name is Keszei.

145
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,010
Karoly Keszei.

146
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,015
So you're a master
if I am correct.

147
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,900
No! I am an
artistic photographer...

148
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,800
Just like in my profession.

149
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,850
It makes quite a difference
the way you work...

150
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,585
Your customers would want
something nice.

151
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,630
Not just something good,
but nice, too.

152
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,999
And I think, that's
already art.

153
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,450
Is that right?

154
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,850
Perfectly so...

155
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,300
You can hardly imagine,

156
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,950
what a great pleasure it is
when your own

157
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,050
more mature tastes prevails
over another person.

158
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,850
Because I believe,

159
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,800
when we have achieved
a higher perfection,

160
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,900
then it is our duty
to encourage the ones

161
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,050
lagging behind to change
their opinions...

162
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,900
Did you say something?

163
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,450
I only said: Ah-huh!

164
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,850
And how do you mean it?

165
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,900
Nevermind me, mister!

166
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,750
Well then, cheers!

167
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,650
Let's drink to the idea

168
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,250
that we should continue

169
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,050
to like what we like

170
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,750
and not what others do!

171
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,700
That's the way
I prefer it, too.

172
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,750
Life can have a meaning

173
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,950
only if we've got the right
to do what we decide...

174
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,750
Tastes are seldom similar,
fortunately...

175
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,250
It would be intolerable

176
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,050
if we all had the same views.

177
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,750
If that councilor found it
enjoyable

178
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,300
to dance on his balcony

179
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,900
in the nude, let him do so!

180
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,450
As long as he leaves
my business alone.

181
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,350
The trouble begins if
this councilor is charged

182
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,750
with the distribution of
ration-books.

183
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,850
Imagine this fellow
going down to the street,

184
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,050
where he'll see
a lot of people.

185
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,750
But he will no longer see

186
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,050
women, men and children...

187
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
he'll only see rations.

188
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,750
Like, there go two rations.

189
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,800
there goes another one...

190
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,500
Or, there's an old ration
that can soon be canceled.

191
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,700
That poor wretched ration
can hardly walk...

192
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,500
Quite a sense of humor!

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,750
It's not that very funny,
Bela!

194
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,950
If you think about it,
it's not very funny.

195
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Thank you Mr. Kovacs,
surely it's not funny.

196
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,850
Like, here's our friend...

197
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,550
What did you say
your name was?

198
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,950
Karoly Kaszei.

199
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,850
Did this happen to
your leg

200
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,900
at the front line?

201
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,850
Yes, but my case
wasn't the only one.

202
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,250
That's exactly what I mean.

203
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Could anyone of us live
with a clean conscience

204
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,750
if he had sent this man
to the front line,

205
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,850
saying go ahead man,
it's your duty...

206
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,750
Or saying: I'll take care
of everything...

207
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,400
And then here is
what happened...

208
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,500
Could you live with a
clean conscience, Bela?

209
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,200
No, I couldn't.

210
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,900
But I wouldn't say
such things!

211
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,400
Some people do!

212
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,850
They're never bothered
by bad conscience.

213
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,850
Thousands of people are
crippled and killed

214
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,950
and they just keep
sending new ones.

215
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
Won't they die then?

216
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,050
If what?

217
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,200
If they just keep
sending new ones.

218
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,250
Do you think
they wouldn't die?

219
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,745
Mr. Auricular, you are just

220
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,300
like the grocer's parrot,

221
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,350
which keeps saying
good morning, good morning.

222
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,050
Very good.
It's a clever parrot.

223
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,300
Much cleverer than some
book peddler intellectual

224
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,850
I mean: intellectuwal...

225
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,500
Why are you picking on me?

226
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Why do you think so?

227
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,850
I did hear you say
"intellectuwal"

228
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,500
Very educated people
often pronounce it this way!

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,850
If it's correct for them

230
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,450
it should be good for you!

231
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,200
You can say "allo" on
the telephone, too

232
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
You, book-peddler
intellectewal...

233
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,800
I protest, Mr. Auricular,

234
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,200
And let me ask you
a favor...

235
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,400
Help me! Help!

236
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,100
Stop! I told you to stop!

237
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,500
Didn't you hear
what I said?

238
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,050
Can you see something?

239
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,800
Not a thing!

240
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,500
Dear Mr. Kiraly

241
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,500
I'd rather you didn't
insist on this now...

242
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,200
I am sorry.

243
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,300
Let me give
your money back...

244
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,250
What Mr. Kiraly said
is probably right,

245
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,050
still how could a country

246
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,950
exist without leadership?

247
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,750
Especially in war-time
like now?

248
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,850
It depends on the leaders

249
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,500
that the country's interest

250
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,900
should be above
everything else...

251
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,900
You must be kidding!

252
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,500
I hope you don't really
mean that any interest

253
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,900
would make a war
worth-while.

254
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,400
I don't claim to be
an educated man,

255
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,999
but I know,
and I can tell you,

256
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,740
that there's no interest
of any kind

257
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,015
for which it would be
worth making war!

258
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,750
May I ask you something?

259
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:43,200
If anybody said
for example,

260
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,850
let me stress it's
only a theory

261
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,800
that you are wrong,
what would you do then?

262
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,350
I wouldn't bother
arguing with him.

263
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,050
But if somebody told you

264
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,600
that you must be a fool
saying such things?

265
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,800
Please don't get me wrong.

266
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,150
I'm not saying this,
just let us suppose!

267
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,400
So what would you do then?

268
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,999
Hell, I don't know
what I would do!

269
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,350
It would depend on
the person, too.

270
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,300
Still, what would
you do?

271
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,999
I'd tell him that
he is wrong

272
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,800
because I wasn't saying
anything stupid...

273
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,050
You are an honest,
decent fool, Bela!

274
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,999
Now I see what our friend
is driving at...

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,450
Go ahead and answer him
Bela!

276
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,650
Tell him what you'd do if

277
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,100
somebody called you a fool.

278
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,900
And if that person would
stick to his claim!

279
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,850
Why would anyone say this
without any reason?

280
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,900
The reason is that
he doesn't

281
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,050
agree with you!

282
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,550
It means he's convinced
that you're a fool,

283
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,999
and he'd go around
shouting that

284
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,450
you are a fool!

285
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,800
Then I'd be forced
to beat him up

286
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,500
for insulting me
without reason

287
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,700
That's the way
wars get started.

288
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,750
You'd also start a fight
for a trifle,

289
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,850
in which you can kill
or be killed.

290
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,400
Excuse me, Mr. Kiraly

291
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,700
But I wouldn't call it
a trifle...

292
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,500
There's a minor factor
you've failed to consider.

293
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,200
The fact is that

294
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,372
this other man also had
some definite ideas.

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,400
He thought that his ideas
were better than yours.

296
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,200
And what did he do?

297
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,700
He was only trying
to convince you

298
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,550
that you represented a
wrong idea. That's all.

299
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,750
By calling me a fool?

300
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,850
He probably said that
much later...

301
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,800
and was probably carried
away by his emotions.

302
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,300
But if he's convinced
that his idea is right,

303
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,250
then doesn't he deserve
respect

304
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,050
for trying to show you
the right way?

305
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,500
Such a man would only want
to share the good things

306
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,999
with all other people...

307
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,999
He'd even scarify himself

308
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,850
to help realize a world

309
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,500
that he imagined.

310
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,750
Let's stop here
for a moment, mister!

311
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,750
The real trouble is

312
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,550
there are abnormal people

313
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,500
who want everybody

314
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,850
to believe what they want.

315
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,950
If you say no,
they'll break your neck.

316
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,500
You only need a few

317
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,800
crazy fellows to have trouble.

318
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,050
They would never believe

319
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,500
that other may be right.

320
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,850
What do you think, Bela?

321
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,950
Quite so!

322
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,250
What are you laughing at?

323
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,400
You could at least let us
have a discussion in peace!

324
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,150
Just let him laugh!

325
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,350
He must be thinking of his
nude angels again...

326
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,400
Nevermind him.

327
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,750
And what about Jesus?

328
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,700
Do you think he was also
an abnormal fellow?

329
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,850
If Jesus hadn't believed
strongly in his ideas...

330
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,700
It couldn't have happened
without strongly believing

331
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,900
that he had indeed
found the truth.

332
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,600
So what? Has the world
changed at all?

333
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,750
How can you say the world
hasn't changed?

334
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,850
What can I say?

335
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,200
Has there ever been soap
made of human flesh?

336
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,300
Mr. Kiraly! Are you crazy?

337
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,750
Honestly, has it never
happened before?

338
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,750
Though Jesus's teachings
are well known today...

339
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,750
I know it's not nice to
hear it

340
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,900
but we all know well
what I'm speaking about.

341
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,550
I hope you won't
get me wrong

342
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,800
but we should stick
to the facts...

343
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,050
So, has it ever happened
before now? Never!

344
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,050
Only because there's

345
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,050
a self-conceited character

346
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,050
who claims to be
the cleverest of all,

347
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,900
and who wants to tell
all mankind

348
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,350
how to live from now on.

349
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,900
Did you say something,
Mr. Auricular?

350
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,980
Nevermind him, he's only
trying to be funny!

351
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,800
How can such a man
sleep in peace

352
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,050
when he causes the death

353
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,850
of many people everyday?

354
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,150
Don't worry,
he sleeps very well.

355
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,050
Oh, no!

356
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,400
Did you see that film
in which that king

357
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,850
strangled his nephews in
fear of losing his power?

358
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,900
Such a man cannot live
very securely.

359
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,850
But they are on top,

360
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
it must be worth anything.

361
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,050
And what do the others get?

362
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,750
Just like in the army,

363
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,850
if a private is told
to lick the floor

364
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,840
then shut up private
and lick the floor!

365
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,010
We are a big nil,

366
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,400
we must obey
the big shots.

367
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,450
But tell me then,

368
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,750
Isn't it more decent
the way we live?

369
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,901
At least we don't
hurt anybody.

370
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,950
Aren't you listening,
Mr. Kovacs?

371
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,850
I do.

372
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,700
I am not a rich man,

373
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,300
I'm not a big shot either,

374
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,250
I am working alone...

375
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,150
I live the way I manage,

376
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,150
but I'm not complaining.

377
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,450
Please don't laugh at me.

378
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,899
for what I am saying,

379
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,150
but I've always wanted

380
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,050
to have a phonograph.

381
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,050
Do you know what
it's like?

382
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,350
Not as big as this,
but a small one.

383
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,950
If you speak into it

384
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
you can listen to
your voice.

385
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,050
It's quite childish,

386
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,000
but it's still something
I wanted so badly.

387
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,562
for so many years.

388
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,850
though it really wasn't
a big thing.

389
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,150
It was just a trifle, really.

390
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,800
Just a few kilos of wine.

391
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,300
But I'm still saying,

392
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,146
that my life with troubles
and disappointment

393
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,050
is still worth more than

394
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,493
the life of those big shots

395
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,350
Don't you think so,
Mr. Auricular?

396
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,650
You should know...

397
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,450
I've got no wealth

398
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,900
not even a bloody
phonograph

399
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,950
but I've got
clear conscience!

400
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,010
Bela, my good ol' buddy
am I right!

401
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,250
That's right, buddy,
that's right.

402
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,850
Our names won't be printed
in history books,

403
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,750
but we never did anything
evil, either.

404
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,624
Though, some day
some people might say...

405
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,250
Oh no! Not this again!

406
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,800
Air-raid warning!

407
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,300
Bela, dear!

408
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,050
What is it honey?

409
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,450
I'll be with you
in a minute, dear!

410
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,750
Shall we go to the
air-raid shelter?

411
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,850
No. We've only got
an old cellar.

412
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,900
It doesn't matter.
I've been on the front,

413
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,050
I've learnt a thing or two.

414
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,050
Well-then...this way!

415
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,750
The switch is
right next to the door.

416
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,500
It seems they're not
coming this way.

417
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,800
Yes seems so...

418
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,300
Maybe to Komarom?

419
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,000
Or to Miskolc.
They bombed it yesterday.

420
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,999
You're going to have
a good dinner tonight?

421
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,800
I hope so.

422
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,800
You haven't finished

423
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:17,524
how you do the veal
breast.

424
00:25:18,204 --> 00:25:20,902
Our friends always
interrupted me...

425
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,980
I didn't want to argue,

426
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,739
but my stuffing is
really something...

427
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,001
That I know, too

428
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,839
Bread, some spices,
things like that...

429
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,150
if you want to do it well

430
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,367
listen to me and
try it this way.

431
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,600
Put some salami in it

432
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,850
but cut it first into
tiny little pieces

433
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,050
You must be joking!

434
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,750
Just do it this way

435
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,786
and you won't be disappointed.

436
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,750
Only a few people
know about this trick,

437
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,400
but believe me, it will
make it wonderful.

438
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,750
How about the garlic,
my friend?

439
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:00,850
There is garlic in it,

440
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,775
more than you'd believe.

441
00:26:06,422 --> 00:26:07,540
It's just about over.

442
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:09,900
It must have been a
false alarm.

443
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,262
Air-raid warning only
for Miskoic.

444
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:16,350
Did you say more garlic
than usual?

445
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,020
That's a bad mistake.
Right, Mr Kovacs?

446
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,999
Tell me, Bela. Do you put

447
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,600
salami into the stuffing?

448
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:25,200
Don't be kidding!

449
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,207
Well, I do!
And how about it?

450
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,500
That's great! Why not put
some horse meat in it?

451
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,850
Or some brawn, or
maggoty cheese?

452
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,600
Not those! But I do put
some salami in it!

453
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:39,850
Have you tasted it?

454
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,217
Air-raid warning over!

455
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,750
Sorry, I can't invite you
for tonight,

456
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,078
but next time
I'll insist...

457
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,750
Mr. Auricular!

458
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,324
For God's sake,

459
00:27:04,546 --> 00:27:06,357
what's the matter with you?

460
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,300
I am thinking whether

461
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,900
I should be Tomoceuszkatatiki
or Gyugyu.

462
00:27:13,858 --> 00:27:20,550
I see. That's clear
as daylight.

463
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,800
I would stay a bit
if you don't mind...

464
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,800
Just in time, mister.

465
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,157
Can you tell me what
you'd like better

466
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:38,900
a veal breast or a
globe artichoke?

467
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,050
Do you know what an
artichoke is?

468
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,200
It is some kind of
a berry, is it?

469
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,800
But how can you ask
such a question?

470
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,800
Who would be so foolish

471
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:54,500
as to choose an artichoke?

472
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,475
Am I right?

473
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,050
Mr. Kovacs!

474
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,850
If somebody told you that
you're going to die,

475
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,600
but before that you've got

476
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,400
the right to choose

477
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,950
who you want to be
born again as.

478
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,950
Would you choose Gyugyu or
Tomoceuszkatatiki?

479
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,090
I'll explain it to you.

480
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,250
This Tomoceuszkatatiki is
a monarch, you see.

481
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,750
He rules the island of
Lucs-Lucs.

482
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,999
Mr. Kovacs, let me warn you

483
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,870
before he takes you in

484
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,900
that such an island
doesn't exist at all!

485
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,900
You'll be surprised my
intectuallewal friend

486
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,850
that this island
does really exist.

487
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,900
You can take my word,
Mr Kovacs

488
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,350
it has existed from time
immemoriably

489
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,400
and from now on
you'll also know about it.

490
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:54,800
But what have I got
to do with it?

491
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,850
You've got a lot to do

492
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,900
with Gyugyu and not
Tomoceuszkatatiki...

493
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,800
who is Gyugyu?

494
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,220
He's a slave, Mr Kovcas.

495
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,320
He's a simple slave
just like in the books.

496
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,900
Let me tell you a few
stories about him.

497
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,800
so that you could see

498
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,050
what a real slave he is...

499
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,050
He broke into a smile once

500
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,350
in his master's presence

501
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,050
who asked him what he
was smiling at.

502
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,100
The slave candidly answered:

503
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,620
"Something came to my mind."

504
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,050
"Is that so,"
said the master.

505
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,800
"I'll see to that

506
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,300
it shouldn't happen again."

507
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,700
And he had the slave's
tongue cut out.

508
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,350
cause he thought he could cut

509
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,750
the slaves thoughts,
by cutting out his tongue.

510
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,450
When his daughter was taken
away, Gyugyu wept.

511
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,400
She was a pretty
teenager and

512
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,600
was given to the
master as "a present."

513
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,850
How can people...

514
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,850
She was killed
by his master's lechery

515
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,750
and finding this out
Gyugyu, became embittered...

516
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,150
Two years later his son
was also taken away

517
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,550
and was given to an old
voluptuous lord.

518
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,950
Gyugyu was thrown into even
more agony.

519
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,800
It's disgusting
even to listen to this!

520
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,500
Aren't your virgins enough?

521
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,050
You need young kids, too?

522
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,800
These are really terrible
things Mr. Auricular!

523
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,900
I'm only telling you
the facts.

524
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,700
But to make his bitterness
even more justified

525
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,900
the nose of his wife was

526
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,700
cut off for clumsiness

527
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
and then one if his eyes
was put out because

528
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,250
he stepped on the tail

529
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,850
of his master's pet monkey.

530
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,700
The bastards! The son's
of bitches!

531
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,850
Wretched, poor man!

532
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,650
How could he bear
so much misery?

533
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,111
He had a theory,
Mr. Kovacs.

534
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,850
He consoled himself

535
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,850
by repeating every evening

536
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,450
"I am a wretched slave
they can torment me,

537
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,800
they can humiliate me,
they can put out my eyes,

538
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,500
they can take my kids away,
they can kill my wife...

539
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,865
my life is still the best,

540
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,800
because I'm not committing

541
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,501
any such terrible crimes..."

542
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,750
He also said:

543
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,950
"I am one of those who are
deprived of everything,

544
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,600
but my conscience
is clear,

545
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,800
and that's what counts
most."

546
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,200
The slave consoled himself
with these thoughts,

547
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,800
and surprisingly

548
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,050
he really became consoled.

549
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,550
I guess I understand it,
Mr. Auricular

550
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,900
And what happened to
that brute?

551
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,850
Nothing.

552
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,300
He was perfectly sure

553
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,550
that he was the best
monarch in the world.

554
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,050
What? How could he have
a clean conscience,

555
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,350
after committing such
terrible crimes?

556
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,500
He did worse things too.

557
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,050
Thousands of worse things...

558
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,750
He never had a guilty
conscience,

559
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,300
since he followed
the morals of his age...

560
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,500
He was convinced of the

561
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,250
justice of his deeds.

562
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,750
You don't really mean it!

563
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,500
People must know about
crimes they commit!

564
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,750
Why are you so shocked,
Mr. Kovacs?

565
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,500
How about the millions of
hungry people today?

566
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,850
Or those who cannot buy
a bloody phonograph?

567
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,700
Let's not waste time,
Mr Kovacs!

568
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,500
You've got five minutes
to decide if you want

569
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,200
to be Gyugyu or
Tomoceuszkatatiki.

570
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,650
How come I've got
only five minutes?

571
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,350
In five minutes
you are going to die,

572
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,800
but immediately you'll be
reborn again

573
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,300
either as Gyugyu or as
Tomoceuszkatatiki...

574
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,950
I'm checking the time.

575
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,600
It's a tasteless game,
Mr. Auricular!

576
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,800
Don't you understand what
this is about?

577
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,400
I do. I very much do!

578
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,300
But what five minutes?
Why five minutes?

579
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,750
Will you please put
that watch away?

580
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,200
It's not a simple question.
And five minutes?

581
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,050
It's a matter much more
important, isn't it?

582
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,300
Say something, you, too!

583
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,050
The situation is that...

584
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,800
...that our friend
is looking for fun!

585
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,200
You think so?

586
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,750
I am sorry
but I don't think so.

587
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,050
Mr. Kovacs is quite right

588
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,100
this is a serious matter.

589
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,850
We are talking about

590
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,699
all kinds of things here

591
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,033
in one way or another...

592
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,850
and now Mr. Auricular is
asking us the question...

593
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,850
What do you mean he's
asking us?

594
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,850
Just how do you mean it?

595
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,050
Did he ask you anything,
Bela?

596
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,450
Not a thing!
- Well, not of me either.

597
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,900
And let me stress this
once for all!

598
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,900
May I ask you something?

599
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,750
Can you just sit at a table

600
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,750
with a clear conscience

601
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,800
without answering
such a question?

602
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,900
Certainly, you can!

603
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,850
Do you know what a
cool head is?

604
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,750
Let me explain it to you.

605
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,800
A cool head is watching

606
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,450
the flies on the ceiling...

607
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,150
Tell me the truth,
Mr. Kovacs,

608
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,050
has anything like this
ever occurred to you?

609
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,800
Why didn't we think of
such things?

610
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,750
We have our own views,

611
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,750
and we don't need Gyugyu
or Tomoctiki

612
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,750
to see what is going on
in the world.

613
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,750
Then you already know
which one you'd choose.

614
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,750
What do you mean I know?

615
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:13,750
You've just said you've got
your own views and

616
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,850
you don't need to mediate
about such things.

617
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,550
So you must already know
which one you'd choose.

618
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,850
Come on!
Leave me alone!

619
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,050
Am I right, Mr. Kovacs?

620
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,200
Yes, certainly...

621
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,750
But Mr. Kiraly's protest

622
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:35,050
is also justified,

623
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,250
because Mr. Auricular
asked it from me.

624
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,250
So it is my duty
to give an answer.

625
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,600
Tell me Mr. Auricular,

626
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,700
is this Tomoceuszkatatiki

627
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,050
really not at all
in doubts about...

628
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,850
Heil!  Heil Szaiasi!

629
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,050
Good evening.

630
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,850
"...Happiness is to be

631
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,100
in friendly company..."

632
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,050
Yes, please,
what can I get you?

633
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,000
Have you got any
hard liquor?

634
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,850
Not...really...

635
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,750
Don't worry, our friend

636
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,700
we won't look just drink.

637
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,200
Give him a good shot.

638
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,050
It is enough?

639
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,100
I'll try it.

640
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,500
Thank you.

641
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,250
Cheers.

642
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,300
How about you?

643
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,500
No thanks
I don't want anything...

644
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,450
Nice place.
Are you the owner? - Yes.

645
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,150
Very nice.

646
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,800
Quite fine.

647
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,500
Gee! What a liquor!

648
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,850
You must be a sharp fellow
to get such liquor.

649
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,450
I beg your pardon?

650
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:31,750
Excuse me,

651
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,950
How much?
How much is it?

652
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,750
Please..let me...

653
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,600
Oh no!
I'll take care of it!

654
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,700
Thank you.

655
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,500
Is 17/B the next house
to the left?

656
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,050
Yes. This is 17/A.

657
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,850
Thank you for the fine
liquor.

658
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,700
Good night.

659
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,400
Heil! Heil Szalasi!

660
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,500
Sons of bitches!

661
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,750
Do you want another drink?

662
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,350
No, thank you.

663
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,850
It'll be one forty.

664
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,700
Did I hear him well?

665
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,650
Did he say 17/B?

666
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes.

667
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,200
Dirty murderers!

668
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,500
Well, we might just as
well go.

669
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,850
Yes, we'd better
call it a day.

670
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,800
Cheers!

671
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,700
Please, Mr Auricular!

672
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,950
We haven't finished what
we were talking about...

673
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,050
Oh, not again! Don't
start it again!

674
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,250
I think that I could
answer your question.

675
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:25,900
Could you?

676
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,050
about the world's affairs,

677
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,840
and so my answer is:

678
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,300
Yes.

679
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,750
How do you mean that?

680
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,050
I would choose
Gyugyu the slave.

681
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,000
Your overcoat, Mr. Kiraly.

682
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,150
Could you have really
chosen it?

683
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,750
Yes. Only him.

684
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,400
You're lying.

685
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,050
I beg your pardon.

686
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,700
You're lying.

687
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,850
So, off we go, Bela.

688
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,900
I'm sorry, why did you
say this to me?

689
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,950
Because you're not telling
the truth.

690
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,550
It's not a big thing,
it can happen to anyone.

691
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,200
Shall we go, gentlemen?

692
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,600
Never mind him,
it's his usual style.

693
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,860
Please take it back
what you just said.

694
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,600
Are you coming,
Mr. Kovacs?

695
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,300
Are you also doubting
my word?

696
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,800
You know it's difficult...

697
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,650
You can't make up your
mind so soon...

698
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,950
Maybe you only rushed
the answer.

699
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,600
I didn't say that!

700
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,650
And you, you  don't believe
either what I chose?

701
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,760
What does it matter if
I believe it or not?

702
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,250
Isn't your own choice
more important for you?

703
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,050
Do you believe it or not?

704
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,300
Answer me straight,
answer me decently!

705
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,700
Listen, mister! I didn't
offend you,

706
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,500
so you'd better not
offend me either.

707
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:25,900
If a man is right,
he doesn't shout!

708
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,050
Aggressive, nervous people
like you, now,

709
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,444
won't make a good Gyugyu.

710
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,950
It's no use arguing
about silly games,

711
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,350
you can take my word,
mister.

712
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,459
Forgive me!

713
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,700
Oh no!
You should forgive me!

714
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,280
And thank you
for the good wine, boss,

715
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,950
and I really hope

716
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,250
at least one of you
would have the courage

717
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,400
to make up his mind
and choose

718
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,000
what he indeed could become.

719
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,850
Good night.

720
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,500
Shut the door!

721
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,800
All I need now
is an air-raid warden!

722
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,999
You're a damn fool,
Mr. Auricular! No insult!

723
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,750
I agree!
I perfectly agree!

724
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,750
Do you know,
what the truth is?

725
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,850
The truth is in this bag!

726
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,850
Just don't forget
to put garlic in it!

727
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,750
You know how much
you understand about

728
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,350
making a veal-breast?

729
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:50,950
You know what you can do

730
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,500
with your being so right?

731
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,850
All right! All right!

732
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,650
Good night, everybody.

733
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,250
I'll bring your watch
tomorrow.

734
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,050
That will be fine.

735
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,850
See you tomorrow.

736
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,150
Stop for a minute.

737
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,750
Mr. Auricular

738
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:18,850
Is this Timoteusz

739
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,750
really not aware of the crimes

740
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,950
he is committing?

741
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,050
No. He's not.

742
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,950
He doesn't even know what
a guilty conscience is...

743
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:38,500
Then maybe...he is not
guilty at all?

744
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,500
This is something
you must decide.

745
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,800
And when I'm reborn,

746
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,450
when I'm born to be
one or the other,

747
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,320
shall I remember that
this was my own choice?

748
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,600
No.
-Are you sure?

749
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:57,720
Sure.

750
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:01,170
You won't remember a thing
Mr. Kovacs.

751
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:07,500
Well, then...good night.

752
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,200
Greetings to your wife.

753
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,800
Thank you.

754
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,750
You played this silly game
too tough,

755
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,750
the poor man won't sleep
all night.

756
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,950
I'd believe him if he
chose Gyugyu.

757
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,750
You would?
-Yes, I would.

758
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,800
But you wouldn't believe us?

759
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:27,900
Who?

760
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,725
Me or Bela, for example.

761
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,750
You must answer this
question yourself, alone.

762
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,032
If you deceive yourself
Mr. Kiraly,

763
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,400
it means grave trouble...

764
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,900
Well, good bye.

765
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,800
Sleep well.

766
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,450
Young girls are not enough!

767
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,500
He needs young boys as well!

768
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,550
He's a perverted pig.

769
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,200
A blood bath of virgins...

770
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,550
That's what he'd liken
the dragon of virtue.

771
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,750
And he's still got the guts

772
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,350
to ask questions!

773
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,700
She mustn't find the
tenderloin in my suitcase!

774
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,050
She'd snatch it and eat it

775
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,400
with her beloved husband.

776
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,850
Once I should really

777
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,200
drop in without any bags

778
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,850
and just say:
"Listen, honey,

779
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,850
No more eggs, no more bacon,
no more meat,

780
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,150
no nothing at all!

781
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,100
And your beloved husband
can drop dead...

782
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,600
Your lucky break is over!"

783
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,050
But the bitch has
fantastic lips...

784
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,300
if only she didn't notice
the tenderloin!

785
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:03,550
She can take the veal, I
don't care,

786
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,850
but not the tenderloin!

787
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,600
My wife's favorite is
tenderloin...

788
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,500
Where have you been,
for God's sake?

789
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,500
If I had told them that
I chose the tyrant

790
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:17,200
they would have believed me.

791
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,050
But I chose the good side,

792
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,750
so they called me a liar.

793
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,050
What will become of us,
my God?

794
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,950
Poor, miserable mankind!

795
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,750
Whatever deprived them of
goodness, beauty

796
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,500
and grandeur?

797
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,550
One thousand three hundred
and sixty-seven steps...

798
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,850
Pretty good average.

799
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,000
Good evening.

800
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,050
Have you had your dinner yet?

801
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,750
Yes, we have.

802
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:28,050
How are you feeling?

803
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,900
I feel fine.

804
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,250
Nothing the matter?

805
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,250
I'm just a bit dizzy...
sometimes.

806
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,050
Did anyone see you?

807
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,300
This is the moment when
I must be tough...

808
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,500
I must tell her immediately

809
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,350
the tenderloin is not hers.

810
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,050
An entry of 50 pengo
to that hoodlum

811
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,050
called Kalmar,
so he would bring us

812
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,250
some of that fine liquor
again

813
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,500
that our elegant customers

814
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,900
liked so much today.

815
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,650
Take one of these pills
twice a day.

816
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,850
It will soothe the little
pain and fatigue that

817
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,850
you'll regularly feel
for three to four days.

818
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,100
But put it away so others
won't find it.

819
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,950
Were you frightened?

820
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,350
You though you wouldn't
make it another day?

821
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,250
It's not the end.
Rather the beginning.

822
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,950
It means you're healthy
and growing up

823
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,850
Life has send you the word

824
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,700
why you were born.

825
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,400
Don't let this prey
on your mind.

826
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:59,500
You know, Mr Auricular is
a strange man.

827
00:50:00,115 --> 00:50:01,300
He's a good man!

828
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,700
Since his wife died
four years ago,

829
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,600
he's been rearing those
three kids alone,

830
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,050
but I never hear him
complain about it.

831
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,850
He's a very decent man.

832
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,050
Of course, he is,

833
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,600
but he's also a little
peculiar.

834
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,300
He likes to tease you.

835
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,750
He invented this story
only to tease you.

836
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:28,800
My God! This is
really not it!

837
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,750
Unfortunately, this is
just not it.

838
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,300
This can't be true!
My dear, is it mine?

839
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:41,100
Oh, my sweet darling,
a real veal breast!

840
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,250
What's in that other bag?

841
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,050
I've seen another bag, too.

842
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,500
Lucy dear! Please don't!
Not that one!

843
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,050
Tenderloin!

844
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:09,550
You've got tenderloin?

845
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,500
I am lost.

846
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,200
A hundred pengo to the
local fascist commander?

847
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,800
Hell, no! What is he
doing for it?

848
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,850
That's it! I don't want
him to do anything!

849
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,300
That's what the money
is for.

850
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,999
People of our kind can
get along nowadays

851
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,050
only if we drawback
quietly.

852
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,500
We must kiss the hands
of our local commander,

853
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,050
let him believe he is
a big shot.

854
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,750
Is that clear, honey?

855
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,400
If the Russians come in
you'll be hanged.

856
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,850
And what if the Russians
don't come?

857
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,350
What if these guys
stay on top?

858
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,600
What if the wonder weapon
happens to work out?

859
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,050
Those who have suffered

860
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,250
a lot and have faced death

861
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,350
they know that nothing
can save you

862
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,550
from evil and sin

863
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,450
except suffering itself.

864
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,150
You shall not refrain
from suffering.

865
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,850
for that is the way
to achieve goodness...

866
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,050
This is the only way to be

867
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,750
among the chosen ones

868
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,050
on Last Judgment's Day.

869
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,050
To be present when

870
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:29,450
the angel of
the Book of Revelation

871
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,550
breaks the fifth seal...

872
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,050
Everything that is today
will pass.

873
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,800
Evil is alien to man.

874
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,800
Alien like a sickness
that can be cured.

875
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,350
Whatever is happening today

876
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,850
you'll forget it one day.

877
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,500
Life shall be victorious

878
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,050
it can't happen the other way.

879
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:56,950
Do not be afraid.

880
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,250
It's getting late,

881
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,200
time for you to go to bed.

882
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,120
How restless he is...

883
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,850
Is he like this all day?

884
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,550
Yes, always.

885
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,450
He's waiting for a meeting.

886
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,050
Always waiting for someone,

887
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,650
but he never tells anybody
for whom...

888
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,250
His cover is down again.

889
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,550
What about them?

890
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,550
I sleep them together

891
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,200
so I could free one bed.

892
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,550
You're a clever girl.

893
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,450
I'll try to get one more
bed,

894
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,750
though I don't know
where I could put it.

895
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,050
You're a clever little
mother. Sleep well.

896
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,150
Good night.

897
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,850
I've put the books
in your workroom.

898
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,300
Thank you.

899
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,200
Put the Teddy bear
on the cover, here.

900
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,050
Aren't you sleeping?

901
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,850
No, I'm not.

902
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,700
Still brooding on the
same situation?

903
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:16,900
Yes.
-Why?

904
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,750
On the question: why there
has to be

905
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,850
Tomoceuszkatatikis and Gyugyus
in this world...

906
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,850
Otherwise, who would ever

907
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,200
think of them after all?

908
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,050
Who makes life so evil?

909
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:37,550
Isn't everything created
by man himself?

910
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,850
I think, I could
make a choice...

911
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,700
Are you serious?
-Yes, I am.

912
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:56,350
I think I could make
a choice.

913
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:00,650
because I've gone through
so much misery that

914
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,150
it would have been more
than enough for three...

915
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:07,050
I know your family also
lived in hardship,

916
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:11,550
but the way we lived...

917
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,850
I still can't understand

918
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,900
how we could bear it all.

919
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,850
Still, we carried on.

920
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,850
I am used to this lot
in life,

921
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,850
and I don't think I could

922
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,500
ever choose another one.

923
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,850
Isn't this the way
you see it, too?

924
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,050
We'll open a new account

925
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,200
of 50 pengo for Mrs. Szabo.

926
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,050
No way, buddy, no way!

927
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,800
Who is Mrs. Szabo?

928
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,850
Is she a policewoman,
or some local commander?

929
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,400
She's a widow, my dear.

930
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,350
A widow?

931
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,050
Her husband was taken away.

932
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,750
He was carried away legally
and politely, tonight.

933
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,100
How do you know it?

934
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,600
I saw the hangman
with the rope.

935
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,350
This 50 pengo may be useful

936
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,750
for use one day only.

937
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,850
If the Russians come in

938
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,050
Mrs. Szabo will be alright.

939
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,650
And I will have helped

940
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:09,750
the family of the communists.

941
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,800
We must be prepared for
any situation.

942
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,650
I am not a fool to
become Gyugyu

943
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:19,550
I won't let Tikitakis
do anything with me!

944
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,500
In old times,

945
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:26,750
when you died for a belief
...for truth

946
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,100
you could face death
in front of the people,

947
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,450
bound to a stake,

948
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,550
surrounded by a crowd.

949
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,700
They kept their eyes on you

950
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,050
until the glorious
extinction of yourself

951
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,050
They could see the flames
reaching your body,

952
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,650
they could hear you cry out:

953
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,350
I am dying for you!

954
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,700
And today?

955
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,650
I still believe,

956
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,350
the duty of the devoted is

957
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,150
to accept all suffering.

958
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:57,950
Good evening.

959
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,450
Don't be afraid
nobody saw us.

960
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,150
I am uncle Miklos
what is your name?

961
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,750
Anni.

962
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:15,500
There's a beautiful Teddy-
bear waiting for you...

963
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,100
He's got a huge piece of
chocolate for you!

964
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,050
You'll be staying here

965
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,350
until your mummy and daddy
come back.

966
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,150
My mom and dad are never
going to come back.

967
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,350
Where did you get this
idea?

968
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,550
I saw them shot dead.

969
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,050
When I grow up. I'll be
shot too.

970
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,450
So, I'm ever glad I'm not
grown up, yet.

971
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,850
Here's your little handbag.

972
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,700
Good night.

973
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,300
Let's see the Teddy bear,
and your chocolate.

974
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,050
We must survive, honey!

975
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,750
We must stay alive,
the way we can...

976
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,400
It's a rotten, miserable
world.

977
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,850
We're forced to maneuverer
as if we committed some crime...

978
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,300
I must do this or I'm going
to die...

979
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,500
What else can I do? Break my
own neck?

980
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,400
No way!

981
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,050
I prefer to live.

982
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,250
I want to live!

983
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,300
I want to live with you!

984
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,900
Come over here!

985
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,800
Come, you naughty little
thing!

986
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,900
Come to your Tomotiki!
To hell, with Gyugyu!

987
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:43,250
We've got the brain
we need!

988
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:47,050
Why am I so Goddamn stupid?

989
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:52,700
Why do I magnify
everything?

990
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,450
Ever since I can remember

991
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,250
made centuries ago

992
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,050
without anybody bothering

993
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,100
to ask my opinion.

994
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,050
Is that right?

995
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,350
Lucy, where are you?

996
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:30,500
Oh, my God!
What is happiness?

997
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:36,500
To have the courage to
do what we want!

998
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,050
Anything we want.

999
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,500
This is what makes
you free...

1000
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,999
Why must I endure

1001
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,900
the torments of hell

1002
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,950
because I love to be
with a woman?

1003
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,050
And because I can't take
home

1004
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,800
one kilo of meat?

1005
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,850
My wife doesn't even know

1006
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,150
that there's ever been
any meat...

1007
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,700
Where have you been
for God's sake?

1008
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,850
I haven't slept all night.

1009
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,500
Look at yourself.
See how you look?

1010
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:18,250
Oh, Timoteusztikis

1011
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:22,150
undisturbed happiness!

1012
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:36,850
Lucy, where are you?

1013
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,750
Where are you, bitch?

1014
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,750
You bitch?

1015
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,150
How long do you want
me to wait?

1016
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,850
Why did you keep me
waiting so long?

1017
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,200
My nice little whore!

1018
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:11,350
My dear whore, you!

1019
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:20,850
My god! What's the matter
with you today?

1020
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,800
Shall I cut your throat?

1021
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,900
Or rip your belly open?

1022
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,200
Do you want me to drink
your blood?

1023
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,850
Yes, I do.

1024
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:39,300
My dear little Gyugyu!

1025
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,800
You were born to be killed.

1026
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,650
My dear bloody bitch!

1027
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:49,750
My disgusting, dear
wonderful bitch!

1028
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:01,600
Ilonka!

1029
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,550
I cannot bring myself
to do it.

1030
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,800
To choose Gyugyu.

1031
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,850
Is this why you woke me up?

1032
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:20,850
I am not the man I thought
I was.

1033
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:25,850
I've been preaching about

1034
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:28,615
righteousness and honor...

1035
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:30,800
and now I've come to realize

1036
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,500
that if I have a choice

1037
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:34,350
I don't want to be a slave.

1038
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,600
Would you rather be
a blood thirsty brute?

1039
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,500
But he's not guilty!
He doesn't feel guilty.

1040
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:48,010
And he's living a good life,
not like a slave

1041
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,850
Can you imagine

1042
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,500
what a pleasant life

1043
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,550
you would have with me?

1044
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:02,840
The answer is obviously:
Timonkinkoish

1045
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:07,750
My honorable watchmaker
friend,

1046
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,750
you were perfectly aware

1047
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:16,750
that we all know very well

1048
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,250
what the honest answer is

1049
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,750
to your sinister question.

1050
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,800
Only we were wondering

1051
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,400
how this miserable

1052
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,550
cockeyed world would react...

1053
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,850
My honorable friend,

1054
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:34,950
the credible answer is

1055
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:36,850
the one you had in mind

1056
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,250
when you invented your
stupid little tale.

1057
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,500
The truth is what you
had in mind.

1058
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:48,450
Everything else is
hypocrisy

1059
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:50,900
cheating or just a lie...

1060
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:57,450
Just like this whore who is
nothing more...

1061
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:05,050
They all want to be
Tomoketiscki's

1062
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,550
including myself, too...

1063
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,750
To hell with Gyugyu

1064
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:18,250
Who would be so stupid...

1065
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,550
Damn it!

1066
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:48,050
For God's sake, where
have you been again?

1067
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:53,050
Hello dear,
are you still awake?

1068
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,800
God bless you, people!

1069
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,850
What is this, Bela?
Saving your firewood?

1070
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:10,700
Do you grudge us
with your firewood?

1071
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:14,650
I'll take it back!
It's getting warmer...

1072
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,950
Can your machine play
anything else?

1073
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,700
Why do you ask?

1074
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,850
I've never heard it play
anything else...

1075
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,450
What the heck?

1076
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:26,050
So the master has already

1077
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,250
brought back the watch?

1078
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,750
It's a nice watch!

1079
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,550
He's a bunglar, but now
he did a good job.

1080
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,850
Don't take it for granted!

1081
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,800
Only because it's working
doesn't mean a thing.

1082
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,250
He may have stolen the bits
that are worth something...

1083
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,850
Have you ever met
an honest watchmaker?

1084
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,050
Mr. Auricular!
Why do you tolerate this?

1085
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,350
Why not?  Won't he die then?

1086
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,050
At last! Here we go again!

1087
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:56,800
He's starting it all again!

1088
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,250
Let's make it clear:
Who will die and when?

1089
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:04,350
You! The moment I've had
enough of you!

1090
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:10,050
Say, mister!

1091
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,450
Do you need to make a
nuisance of yourself?

1092
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:14,050
I do.

1093
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:18,550
Has there ever been anything
you didn't scorn?

1094
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,850
Not really. But what can
I do about it?

1095
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,050
He's in bad spirits again.

1096
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,850
He must have had bad luck
last night.

1097
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:27,750
He seems to have quarreled

1098
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,500
with his bread and butter...

1099
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:36,050
Could you sleep last night
Mr Kiraly?

1100
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:39,850
Why couldn't I have
slept well?

1101
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,050
Couldn't you sleep?

1102
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:45,850
I was meditating about
Mr. Auricular question...

1103
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,750
My God!

1104
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:51,900
This good soul will ascent
straight to heaven!

1105
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,850
He'll be carried by angels
to heaven!

1106
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,750
And what was your
conclusion?

1107
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:00,500
I didn't come much
to an conclusion.

1108
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,750
But the question
Mr. Auricular asked

1109
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:08,250
may not have been
a proper question.

1110
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,350
To live the life of a slave

1111
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,800
is not the only righteous
way of life to live.

1112
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,850
You can lead a dishonest life
not only the way

1113
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:20,850
that the only man did...

1114
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,850
Wasn't this your
conclusion too?

1115
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,850
Don't play jokes on me!

1116
01:09:25,242 --> 01:09:26,350
I asked it seriously.

1117
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,327
It was a silly game!
What do you take me for?

1118
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,050
Do you really think that
I have nothing better to do

1119
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,050
than think about such
stupidity at night?

1120
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:36,850
After a dinner of veal?

1121
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,050
That's right
- How much was it?

1122
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:43,850
I traded it for a Bosch and
a Romanische Baukunst

1123
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,050
I mean how much did it
get in weight?

1124
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,600
About a kilo and a half

1125
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:48,850
That's a nice piece already

1126
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:53,850
But say...did you really put
salami into it?

1127
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,150
Listen, Bela,

1128
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,850
Why don't you pick on
somebody else?

1129
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,200
I did put salami in it!

1130
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:03,100
I went right home,

1131
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,450
and my wife was pleased
with the way I did it.

1132
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,345
I didn't meditate about
such stupid things!

1133
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,750
I didn't start to
contemplate my naval...

1134
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,850
Some appetizing smell

1135
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:15,050
from the kitchen, is what
I like.

1136
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:19,050
You're right.
That's the best thing.

1137
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,050
I don't understand you.

1138
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,550
Weren't you bothered by
this question at all?

1139
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:27,050
You should be exhibited
in a museum!

1140
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,050
You know what I did?

1141
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,850
I checked my account-book

1142
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,300
and then went to bed.

1143
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,213
I don't have time for
such games...

1144
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:37,999
Well, I am surprised...

1145
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,800
Why don't we drop this
subject?

1146
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,850
How is Mrs. Sari and
her husband?

1147
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:45,850
My God! What a good bitch
she was!

1148
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,850
This story always makes me
sick!

1149
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,850
And why does it make you
sick?

1150
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,500
A decent marriage makes
you sick?

1151
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:56,050
With church, a wedding and
a best man?

1152
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,850
It's disgusting!

1153
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,850
You're overshooting the
mark again!

1154
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,750
The old man got himself
a pretty chick

1155
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:07,668
and the lady will get
a fortune when he dies.

1156
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,050
It's good business, both
parties get a good deal.

1157
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,750
What else should the old
man do with his money?

1158
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:15,750
Should he go to Monte
Carlo?

1159
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,450
Or carry his money with
him into his grave?

1160
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,050
These fellows are back
again!

1161
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,050
Stay where you are!

1162
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,250
I told you not to move!

1163
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,500
I am sorry.

1164
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:14,700
That's what I like,

1165
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,950
quiet, solemn place
soft music...

1166
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:19,850
Nice atmosphere.

1167
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,650
Good evening!

1168
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,999
May I...
-Shut up!

1169
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,750
Father Christmas has
arrived!

1170
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,750
We've got a deal for you,

1171
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,500
which means that you're
going to leave this place

1172
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,950
and come with us
for a little ride.

1173
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:49,450
Understand?

1174
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,350
What is this...?

1175
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:55,850
You could at least
tell us...

1176
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,050
I've told you to shut up!

1177
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,750
Is it clear now?

1178
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:14,200
Do you want another
explanation?

1179
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:23,500
Get out! Go!

1180
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,500
No overcoat!

1181
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:52,050
Who did they say
they were?

1182
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:55,850
It's a trifling story
petty people.

1183
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,050
Yes, a bar-keeper,
a watchmaker...

1184
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:01,400
The other two.
- A joiner and a peddler.

1185
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,400
What peddler?
- A book peddler.

1186
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:08,600
Have you started it?
-We're just about...

1187
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:10,300
Go ahead with it!

1188
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:23,050
Thank you.

1189
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,300
Macak!

1190
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,450
Bring here one of them!

1191
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:44,850
Good evening.

1192
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,050
Come here, boy!

1193
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:54,200
I told you to come here!

1194
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:05,750
Come on man.

1195
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:08,025
Can't you speak, boy?

1196
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,850
Please...
- What?

1197
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,350
My name is Janos Kovacs
I am a joiner...

1198
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,550
I've got a family.

1199
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,550
I am quite certain...

1200
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,206
it must be some
misunderstanding...

1201
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,300
Would you please check

1202
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:35,250
who should have been

1203
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,850
brought here instead
of us?

1204
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:37,850
Where?

1205
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,250
Well...here.

1206
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,700
What here?

1207
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,500
I mean here. Please...

1208
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,650
I asked you what here?

1209
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:56,431
You see what a mistake
your ignorance can be?

1210
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:59,650
We'll take care of it!

1211
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,850
Let's take such a
misunderstanding first.

1212
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,950
What did you say
you are, boy?

1213
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,300
I am a joiner...

1214
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:10,050
I am a joiner with
a proper trade license.

1215
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:13,402
What an obsession!

1216
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,050
If you are an honorable
master joiner,

1217
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,650
than your wife should be
an honorable housewife

1218
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:23,350
and not a dirty whore,
which is what she is.

1219
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:25,650
You son of a bitch!

1220
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,600
No reason to get jumpy!

1221
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,900
You see you must pay
for knowledge.

1222
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:42,300
You should know that
if a criminal like you

1223
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,720
whose wife is a dirty
whore

1224
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,620
who has worked all the
streets of the city...

1225
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:50,400
so if such a bastard
like you

1226
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:52,900
call people honorable
names such as murderers,

1227
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:56,850
then these people will
obviously protest

1228
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,860
and will let you know it
in a very direct way,

1229
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,550
like we did now.

1230
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:35,884
Not bad, not bad,
but not the best either.

1231
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:40,303
Let me make a few comments,
may I?

1232
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,750
This is not the last time

1233
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,650
you'll hear me say this:

1234
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,999
there's a mistake in
your approach.

1235
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:52,720
You just said it was
a trifling matter.

1236
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:58,050
Can you explain why you
believe it's a trifle?

1237
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:02,150
Well, isn't it?
- You tell me why!

1238
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,500
Two of our people were
shot dead yesterday.

1239
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,616
Our party headquarters
was bombed two weeks ago.

1240
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,630
Two youngsters were
captured with leaflets...

1241
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,789
These are not trifles.

1242
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,750
But when four people call
us murderers

1243
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,850
while drinking in a bar

1244
01:18:19,725 --> 01:18:22,761
and then go home in peace
to sleep with their wife

1245
01:18:23,176 --> 01:18:24,882
they are people with
a big mouth

1246
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:27,050
who never do a thing.

1247
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:29,050
Such case is a trifle.

1248
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:32,315
These fellows have never
seen a gun.

1249
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,450
We won't need to tie them
up before execution.

1250
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:39,340
You want to execute them?
- Certainly!

1251
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,850
Then why beat them up?

1252
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,500
What do you mean why?

1253
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,080
What should I do with them?

1254
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:49,450
How old are you?

1255
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,200
Twenty-eight

1256
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,050
An arts student?

1257
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:55,150
Have you read Huizinga?

1258
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,450
And Ortega?

1259
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:58,200
The "Revolt of the Masses"?

1260
01:18:58,650 --> 01:18:59,850
Yes, of course.

1261
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,050
Then why do you order
the beatings?

1262
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,800
Why?
- Yes, why?

1263
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,420
Have you thought about it?

1264
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,800
By right of the power
we seized.

1265
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,650
Through the passion of
my beliefs.

1266
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:24,800
Is that all?

1267
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,650
Isn't it enough?

1268
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,200
Let me correct one of
your mistakes, first.

1269
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,250
Leave us alone!

1270
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:41,050
The attack against
the party headquarters

1271
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:45,950
and the slogans of the
walls are trifles.

1272
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:50,100
Our people are shot
it's a trifle, why?

1273
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,750
Because we capture them!

1274
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:55,600
We'll hang them or
shoot them in the head.

1275
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,200
How many are they?

1276
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,900
A small fraction of the
population.

1277
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,600
A few thousand? They'll
all,

1278
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,850
become nice corpses.

1279
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:05,200
So they're trifles.

1280
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,750
But the rest of them are not!

1281
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,050
Those who don't throw
bomb, who never shoot,

1282
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,900
must be taken very
seriously.

1283
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,850
Those who are living here,
breathing here

1284
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:20,350
must be our main target.

1285
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:29,050
This is the age of the
disgusting masses.

1286
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,850
The mobs never cherished
more illusions about

1287
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,300
themselves and their roles
than today.

1288
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,050
It is sickening and
nauseating,

1289
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,150
what the masses thing of
themselves today!

1290
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:44,500
Strikes and demonstrations!
What world is this?

1291
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,750
That's why we are
not going

1292
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,350
to execute these ones.

1293
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:55,050
Then why were they
brought here?

1294
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,350
Do you know, my
young professor

1295
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:00,750
what these people think
of themselves and the world?

1296
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:03,750
I don't know
- Let me tell you, then.

1297
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,750
They say: "We are pretty
little nobodies

1298
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:09,500
we have no say in
the matters of the world.

1299
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,050
We can only watch the storm

1300
01:21:12,999 --> 01:21:14,600
of history blow over,

1301
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,850
we are at the mercy of
these people,

1302
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:20,650
they can do whatever they
want with us.

1303
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,850
That is why they were
brought here.

1304
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,650
So that you could
bring it home to them.

1305
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,050
So that this Macak should
break their noses,

1306
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,050
twist their arms,
beat them up and

1307
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,200
kick them in the groin!

1308
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:39,250
So that he should call
their wives whores.

1309
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:43,350
They must learn that you
have right

1310
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:46,280
to break their nose,
beat them up

1311
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:51,120
or kick their kidney
into pieces.

1312
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,850
That is why you order
the beatings.

1313
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:59,380
They should learn: you have
all the rights.

1314
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,050
That is why you will

1315
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,050
send them home
and not kill them.

1316
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,750
Let them spread the news of
what happened here.

1317
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,850
And they need not know
what their crime was.

1318
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,900
No need to tell them what
the photographer said.

1319
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,550
Don't even mention it
at all.

1320
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:20,050
Let them live in
uncertainty.

1321
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:24,300
Let both the guilty and the
innocent live in fear!

1322
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,750
Making dead bodies is an
easy job, professor!

1323
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,050
But the dead which goes on
eating and drinking,

1324
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,750
which keeps his mouth shut
like a clam,

1325
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:38,050
is a lot more difficult job,
professor!

1326
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,050
But that's our real job!

1327
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:42,250
So you should beat them up
not out of some temper,

1328
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,999
but directed by educational
motives.

1329
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:46,650
It's clear what I've said?

1330
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,100
Yes, it is.

1331
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:49,950
I'm glad we agree.

1332
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:51,950
So you're going to send

1333
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,850
these four people home

1334
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:57,650
in the morning when others
can also see them.

1335
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,050
Until then, you can teach
them a lesson or two.

1336
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,850
But call me before you
let them go home.

1337
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:04,750
Why?

1338
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,350
Are you sure you did
understand everything I said?

1339
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,050
Yes!

1340
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,150
Think about it again.

1341
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:16,750
Follow the logic that
I explained to you.

1342
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,050
Isn't there something
missing in it?

1343
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,500
What are you hinting at?

1344
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,850
Those fellows will go home

1345
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,050
they'll be scared of us,

1346
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:30,650
they'll hate us,
which is all very well.

1347
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:34,250
But what will they think
of themselves?

1348
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:36,050
Can you answer it?

1349
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:38,750
I think they'll be glad

1350
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,800
to go home from here.

1351
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,050
Your imagination is
quite slow, my boy.

1352
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:48,050
Don't you think they'll
have some self-respect

1353
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:51,750
for raising a fist

1354
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:55,250
when you called their
wives whores?

1355
01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:57,750
Aren't you concerned
about this?

1356
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,850
Only people with some
self-respect

1357
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,350
can start a protest or a
revolt.

1358
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:07,850
Would you let people go
home knowing

1359
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:10,050
that they'll hate us,

1360
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:14,550
but keep their self-respect
too?

1361
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,750
Would you really make such
a grave mistake?

1362
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:20,850
As long as they have any
pride,

1363
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:22,950
there's no use making them

1364
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,200
scared by any beatings.

1365
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,450
So what shall be your
duty, my professor?

1366
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:37,050
You must make them hate
themselves!

1367
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,600
Otherwise you haven't
accomplished a thing!

1368
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,050
Nothing at all!

1369
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,400
Here's what the principles
of your approach should be

1370
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:52,450
First:

1371
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,515
people desperately
hold onto their lives,

1372
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,050
Two:

1373
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:57,950
people are extremely
weak,

1374
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,550
absolutely worthless,

1375
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,050
cowardly creatures.

1376
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:29,500
Isn't that coat too
uncomfortable for you?

1377
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:42,300
Try to remember
Mr. Kovacs,

1378
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,300
whether they told you
anything

1379
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,020
that would give us a hint

1380
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:50,500
why we were brought here.

1381
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,162
They said

1382
01:25:55,112 --> 01:25:58,532
that my wife was a whore...

1383
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:04,350
a no-good dirty whore...

1384
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,850
My wife!

1385
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:11,410
Mr. Auricular

1386
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:21,150
It's impossible
to live in this world!

1387
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:29,500
Murderers, sons of bitches!

1388
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:32,750
Open the door!

1389
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:35,750
Let me out of here!

1390
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:41,850
How are you, Bela?
How is your head?

1391
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:43,850
I'm stiff all over...

1392
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,750
And you, you clumsy
watchmaker?

1393
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,050
Do you fear for your
shitty life?

1394
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:50,850
I've got only one...

1395
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:54,600
Why don't you sit up,
it might help.

1396
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,350
Forget it!

1397
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:58,050
You better send the
peddler

1398
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:01,850
away from the door.

1399
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,450
Are you waiting for
the Saviour or the next tram?

1400
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:08,400
Get away from there.

1401
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:17,050
They might not let us out
at all.

1402
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:21,150
We're all going to kick up
on our toes here, Laci!

1403
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:23,350
Are you sure?

1404
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:25,900
Just as sure as

1405
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:29,600
there's no need for salami
in a roast-veal.

1406
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,750
There may be one thing
you can try.

1407
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:34,450
What?

1408
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:37,900
Tell them you don't know
why you are here,

1409
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,950
but you repent everything.

1410
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,250
Promise to be a good guy!

1411
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:43,250
They might let you out
then...

1412
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,050
Are you kidding?

1413
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:52,950
I am not good at jokes.

1414
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:55,650
Take a chance!

1415
01:27:56,550 --> 01:28:00,550
It may work out...
though I'm not sure...

1416
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:05,950
What do you think about it?

1417
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:11,200
It's worth a try, maybe...

1418
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,950
Maybe...I've got noting
to lose!

1419
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:27,900
Nothing to lose!
Are you serious?

1420
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,950
This is not the way you
imagined it, was it?

1421
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,480
What?

1422
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,950
The way you finish your
life...

1423
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,500
This is not over yet.

1424
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,000
Like hell, not.

1425
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:50,350
A few days before your
wife died...

1426
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:53,340
forgive me for telling you
this now

1427
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:55,150
she came to our house and

1428
01:28:57,550 --> 01:28:59,900
asked my wife for some
recipe.

1429
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,505
She stepped in with
her round figure

1430
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,850
and I told her,

1431
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,500
Piroska, I bet you'll
have a boy

1432
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:09,850
She said I hope it will
be a boy,

1433
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:12,250
What will it's name be
I asked her...

1434
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,450
"Named after the father,"
I asked.

1435
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,369
"Yes," she said.

1436
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,550
But you already have a son
named Miklos.

1437
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:25,800
She said:

1438
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:29,800
"I'd like to name all my
children after him..."

1439
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,650
and she blushed like
a child.

1440
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,850
Let me ask you something,
you don't have to answer.

1441
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,050
Are you listening?

1442
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:54,750
Do you know why we were
brought here?

1443
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:56,850
No, I don't

1444
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,750
Are you sure?

1445
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,101
Why should I know?

1446
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:03,450
Forgive me for saying this

1447
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:08,550
I always thought you
had something to hide.

1448
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,450
I mean, something descent
to hide.

1449
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,100
You're wrong.

1450
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:27,150
I was thinking about these
bastards, and I figured

1451
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:30,800
if they had any brain
they would let us out.

1452
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:35,600
They have flattened us
out already.

1453
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:41,800
I would hurry to the
counter to serve them!

1454
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:45,550
I would crawl to them and
kiss his ass,

1455
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:49,850
for anything in the bar.

1456
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,850
If they butcher us,

1457
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:53,300
they'll lose
a lot of investment.

1458
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,850
Why beat the hell out
of us

1459
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,200
if they want to kill us?

1460
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,750
What kind of business
would that be?

1461
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:02,250
Do you remember? If you're
told

1462
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:08,800
to lick the floor, shut up
and do it...

1463
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:11,950
Do you think if I try it

1464
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,750
they might let me go?

1465
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:18,900
You can take a chance...

1466
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,350
Anything can happen...

1467
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:34,000
It seems,

1468
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:38,200
this fellow failed to
repent...

1469
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:44,850
It is justified to do

1470
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:49,800
anything for your life.

1471
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:53,650
It would be a sin not to
do so.

1472
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,650
To do anything for it!

1473
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,850
How are you, boys?

1474
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:16,050
Did you call each other
bastards?

1475
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:29,750
Would it be possible
for me to...

1476
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,850
Shut up!

1477
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:26,550
What's up?
Don't mosey along!

1478
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:32,550
How are you champion?
You seem much quieter.

1479
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,950
You'll get a Christmas present

1480
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,200
from Jesus himself!

1481
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:54,450
Here's your Father
Christmas!

1482
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:06,850
Are you still breathing,
my boy?

1483
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:08,950
Look, what daddy has
brought you!

1484
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,050
You can go ahead and
admire him!

1485
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,850
Stand in a row facing him,

1486
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,850
like nice kids are
suppose to...

1487
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,500
Stand there, in front of
him!

1488
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,050
Look up!

1489
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:33,250
Why are you shouting?

1490
01:33:33,999 --> 01:33:35,050
They are reasonable people

1491
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,650
who will need your words.

1492
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,750
Good morning.

1493
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:45,050
Good morning.

1494
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:47,250
You've been staying out a
little later

1495
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:48,750
than decent people do

1496
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:50,550
so it's time to go home.

1497
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,850
I can't establish beyond
a doubt

1498
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:58,850
if you were brought here
with or without reason.

1499
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,750
If it was unjustified,

1500
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:02,800
consider it a mistake
and forget it!

1501
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,200
I am aware that your
dignity

1502
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:08,050
may have been hurt...

1503
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:11,950
but what else could we do
in such a situation?

1504
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:16,050
I must express my apologies
to you

1505
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,800
provided that you are
indeed

1506
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,999
citizens of perfect morals

1507
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:24,050
and good intentions who

1508
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:26,900
only wish to live in peace.
Is that right?

1509
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,300
Yes, it is.

1510
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:33,850
I admit that we didn't
quite agree about your fate.

1511
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,850
My comrade thought

1512
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:37,250
you should be executed here.

1513
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:42,250
I managed to make him
change his mind arguing

1514
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:44,050
that you all claim to be

1515
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:46,050
the victims of some
misunderstanding.

1516
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:50,250
I suggested that we should
give you a chance

1517
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,050
to prove your loyalty

1518
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:54,250
and alliance with the state.

1519
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:58,050
So we've brought this
half-dead creature here,

1520
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,050
who has a maximum few
hours left, as you see.

1521
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:04,950
This miserable creature
was an iron-founder

1522
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:08,900
who blew up one of our
ammunition depots.

1523
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:12,850
He called us dirty
bastards and

1524
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,050
the suppressors of liberty

1525
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:17,050
the descendants of Nero...

1526
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,999
He also called us traitors

1527
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,400
and many other names.

1528
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,600
We couldn't convince him
that he was wrong.

1529
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:31,999
So, I suggested that

1530
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,850
we shouldn't rush your
execution here but

1531
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,950
we'd rather give you
a chance

1532
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,050
to express your scorn at
this social misfit,

1533
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:43,750
and then you can go home
in peace.

1534
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:46,950
What I mean exactly is
that

1535
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:50,650
you should step to this
disgusting creature

1536
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:53,150
and slap him twice
in the face.

1537
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:55,050
Unfortunately, your
hands

1538
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,250
will be stained with blood,

1539
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,050
but you can wash it
at home

1540
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:00,050
with some warm water, so

1541
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:03,050
there'll be no trace of
blood on your skin.

1542
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,825
Whichever of you wants to
go first, go ahead!

1543
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,400
Take your turn.

1544
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,300
The devil, you!

1545
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:21,850
The first tram is soon
due to start...

1546
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:31,420
Oh, my God, help me!

1547
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:01,350
What should happen

1548
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:03,050
if they don't want to
prove their loyalty?

1549
01:37:03,999 --> 01:37:07,450
They will. It's obvious.

1550
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:10,950
You won't be able to
execute them so easily!

1551
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:17,050
Start it, one of you!

1552
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,450
Jesus, my Jesus!

1553
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:51,250
Go ahead!
Get over it!

1554
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:55,800
Jesus, have mercy upon me!

1555
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,450
God, help me!
Jesus, help me

1556
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,250
Get him up and
take him away.

1557
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:12,050
Oh, my God!
I don't want to...

1558
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:14,450
Do you want to go home?

1559
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:17,200
Go ahead, whose turn?

1560
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:22,450
Leave me alone!
Let me go!

1561
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:27,400
I can't, I don't
want to...

1562
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:34,950
Well then, we
must go back

1563
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,200
to the basement!

1564
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:37,950
No!

1565
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:39,900
You stay here,
Mr. Kiraly.

1566
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,450
Let me go.

1567
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:45,850
You stay here!
Damn butchers!

1568
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:47,850
Watch out, Macak!

1569
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,550
Damn, rotten murderers!

1570
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:06,550
OK that's it. Kill them.

1571
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:09,050
No need for education!

1572
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:13,250
Wait!

1573
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:20,750
I see, at least one of you
is a decent man.

1574
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:27,350
Go ahead.

1575
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:37,050
Don't be afraid, it'll
be over and the door is open!

1576
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,050
Mr. Auricular!

1577
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:45,900
Don't do it! Don't!

1578
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,900
You mustn't do it!

1579
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:51,450
Away with that idiot.

1580
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:27,050
Congratulations.
That was one.

1581
01:40:27,850 --> 01:40:29,850
One more and the show
will be over.

1582
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:34,350
Don't waste your time!

1583
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,550
You're a fine man.

1584
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:49,200
You deserve to be free.

1585
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,350
Macak, open the door.

1586
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,300
This way, my friend.

1587
01:40:58,050 --> 01:41:00,050
Always the shortest way!

1588
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:34,500
Are you crazy?

1589
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:38,550
Put your hands down.
Walk straight!

1590
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:40,500
What?

1591
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,050
Put your hands down.

1592
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:53,200
Do you want to go back?

1593
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:55,500
Then get out of here.

1594
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:57,850
Yes.
