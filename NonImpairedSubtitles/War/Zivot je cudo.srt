1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,726
Milica!

2
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:13,762
I'll go bankrupt!

3
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,201
I can't carry these anymore.

4
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:21,724
BOSNIA 1992

5
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,603
Milica!

6
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:18,964
Out of the way!

7
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:07,075
1, 2, 3, 4...

8
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:20,205
Let's see if your old man still
has it!

9
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:33,799
Milos, you have to play with
your head.

10
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,162
Yeah, right! Piss off!

11
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,679
Hey, Eso!

12
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:06,845
Hey, Luka, you can't be in two
places

13
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:09,885
at the same time. - Sure, I can!

14
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,163
You see, I can!

15
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:27,596
Lord! I hope he remembers me.

16
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:31,123
Hey, Einstein, the coach
has a memory for remembering.

17
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:32,686
For remembering?

18
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:36,964
It's been 18 months since we
left Belgrad

19
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:41,598
Just keep your mind on the match.
Your job's to play.

20
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:55,277
Hey, Veljo...
My great big friend!

21
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,517
Here's your pension.

22
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:59,598
I'm glad to see you!

23
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:07,559
Amazing...

24
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,084
The miracle of life!

25
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,720
Neighbor!

26
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:16,799
Neighbor!

27
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,035
Joksa! Hey, Joksa!

28
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:33,595
You're too small to scare me...

29
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:26,405
Get that donkey off the track,
Vujan!

30
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:29,206
I'll go bankrupt, my dear Veljo.

31
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:33,565
These are in great demand
and that cow won't carry them.

32
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,683
Why not? - She's suffering.

33
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:40,602
Can't she suffer in a ditch?
What's it matter where she suffers?

34
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,803
I'll have to use...

35
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:45,476
a stick.

36
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,679
Get a move on!
You won't get in my way.

37
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,678
What's this? Why is she crying?

38
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:59,237
She's lovesick.
She wants a train to run her over.

39
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:02,842
What train? The track isn't
finished yet.

40
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:06,317
Exactly what I told her.

41
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,639
I'll use the stick on her. - A
stick?

42
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,723
I'm skeptical about that.

43
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:15,959
People! They've killed Joksa!

44
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:26,602
Luka!

45
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,643
I have to tell you something!

46
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:33,765
Just let me get past.

47
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:40,118
I have to tell you...

48
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:45,646
Just one word!

49
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:02,245
The bears are slaughtering everybody!
But Tito shot the last one.

50
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,602
They're pouring in from Croatia.

51
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:08,436
Beasts from Croatia!
And you just sit here playing!

52
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:11,599
What beasts?
Why, bears!

53
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:17,319
They're like ours, only
different.

54
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:22,845
A bit bigger but with gray fur.
They must be Persian bears.

55
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:26,920
Not Persian bears!
They're fleeing the war in Croatia.

56
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,766
Is the track OK? - Why shouldn't
it be?

57
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:32,202
Luka, this is no joke.

58
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:35,597
Folks are dying and you sit
here playing.

59
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,483
Here, boy!

60
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,083
Here, boy!

61
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,036
Radovan!

62
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,160
What's up?

63
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:06,081
Why won't she leave me alone?

64
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,800
What is it?

65
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,436
Let's stop so I can feed the dog.
Be a darling.

66
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:15,600
Since when does a goddam mayor
feed stray dogs?

67
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,638
Tell me that.

68
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,759
Since when does a mayor

69
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:23,556
gobble breakfast in a car?

70
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,724
Can't you see that Lily's in
love?

71
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:41,158
Paws off my lunch!

72
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,039
Good for you!

73
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,924
Scram!

74
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:57,925
You're a lawyer, Filipovic.
We made you party secretary.

75
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:00,880
You know these things better
than me.

76
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,482
That's why I'm telling you.
There are laws, man.

77
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,683
Want to get us arrested?

78
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,361
Only nitwits get nabbed. - Not
crooks?

79
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,119
That's not what I said.

80
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:15,325
Yes, it is. Fraud is fraud,
however you dress it up.

81
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:19,400
But the Muslims & Croats do just the same.
- Do what?

82
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:22,763
Finance political parties
from cigarettes and oil.

83
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:25,281
Building democracy on freight
trains!

84
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:28,838
Tito did it for 30 years. - Tito?

85
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:32,476
Forget Tito. Tito was Tito,
after all.

86
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,162
I'll tell him everything.

87
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:58,884
If it isn't my dear old
brother-in-law!

88
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,162
Are we ready for Liberation Day?

89
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:04,159
The band, not the track.
The Serbians are behind.

90
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:07,717
But our side is on time.
How are my artists?

91
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:11,087
My lovely music!

92
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:13,198
Sir, can I speak to you?

93
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:15,960
Sparavalo, of the Sarajevo
Opera.

94
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,686
Sarajevo! A magic town.

95
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,723
Mr. Mayor... - Wait!

96
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:24,277
Mr. Cuhaj, our guest artist from Hungary.
A universal artist.

97
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,559
This is going to be OK.

98
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,683
OK, he says...

99
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:44,638
As president of the town
council,

100
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,002
I would like to express my
gratitude

101
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:51,080
for the support you've given
our railroad

102
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:55,678
But we politicians haven't
slept.

103
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:58,242
Just read this, bro.

104
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:04,004
Mr. Mayor, if we don't organize a hunt
the beasts will slaughter us all.

105
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:07,762
"We approve purchase of a
"Sneider-Holstein locomotive..."

106
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,121
This is fantastic!

107
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:13,200
Not a single Serb will be left!
Look what you've done!

108
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:20,558
Mr. Mayor, friends,

109
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,036
allow me to present our project.

110
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:25,277
Here you see the section of
track that

111
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:29,042
will link Bosnia and Serbia for
12 miles.

112
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,118
Mr. Mayor... - In fact,

113
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:35,280
the Austrians first built this track
but then it was destroyed.

114
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:40,122
We now need to rebuild it
to boost tourism and trade.

115
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,767
With this tunnel... - Mr. Mayor!

116
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,715
...we will overcome a major
obstacle...

117
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,320
and be ready for Liberation Day.

118
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,557
Well done, bro!

119
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:55,037
We are lumberjacks and we're
okay

120
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:58,403
In the green forests of Bosni-ay

121
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:01,877
We are lumberjacks and we're
okay

122
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:06,199
In the hills and mountains of
Bosni-ay!

123
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,440
Listen, hotshots,

124
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,199
let me tell you the basics

125
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:13,517
about being a goalie.

126
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,041
I can't wait to hear this!

127
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,163
You have to guard that line

128
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:21,159
regardless of who's shooting.

129
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:22,839
Is that so? - You bet.

130
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:25,760
That's why there are no smart
goalies.

131
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:30,079
Did Einstein say that?
No, you idiot! Wrong again!

132
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,044
It was the coach who said it.

133
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:39,964
And now Tomo Krotolina's
gonna show you how to shoot.

134
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,684
Where are you going, for god's
sake!

135
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:55,196
Didn't you say you're fearless,
goalie?

136
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:56,959
Then come with me.

137
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,765
What for?

138
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:02,118
Prove that you're fearless.
- Don't pull!

139
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:03,606
Who's pulling, Mr. Fearless?

140
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,166
But I wanted to go dancing...

141
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:07,283
No more buts, Eso.

142
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,005
Here comes a goal shot.

143
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,964
You said you're fearless.

144
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:19,566
What's all this? - Just stand
there!

145
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,838
No, bro, stand there!

146
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,801
You said you're fearless, so
stand still.

147
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,560
Milos Djukic!

148
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,720
Milos!
Come and see our Eso!

149
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:38,876
Here's a cross shot.

150
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:40,878
Catch!

151
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:43,640
Bravo, boss! Bravo, legend!

152
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,718
And now? - Something completely
different.

153
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,718
Watch this trick.

154
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:51,766
Hold it on your head.

155
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:55,078
What is this, Tomo? - Hold it
like this.

156
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,998
Put your arms down.

157
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,237
Just great!

158
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,403
Just watch this, Eso!

159
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:04,966
What are you doing?

160
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:06,400
Are you nuts?

161
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:09,275
You crazy fucking idiot!

162
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,439
Shit, I missed!

163
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:17,404
I aimed for the forehead.

164
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:23,476
Your turn now, tough guy!

165
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:27,161
Fuck you! You're crazy!

166
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:30,125
No problem, buddy. I'll play
the game.

167
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:33,802
Here's your chance.

168
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:38,199
I'm emptying the fucking gun! Relax.
A new player calls for fresh bullets.

169
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:39,845
Eso, this isn't a joke.

170
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:42,282
Relax, I've got experience.

171
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,000
Uncle Faik bought some guns
cheap.

172
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,202
We've been practicing.

173
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:52,165
Buying guns now? - Your turn.

174
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:54,317
Here's a moving target.

175
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,602
Tomo, quit messing around.

176
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,724
Milos, out of the way! - Goddam
you!

177
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,759
Go ahead, shoot, tough guy!

178
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:05,157
Milos, out of the way!

179
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,840
Here we go!

180
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:19,045
I don't give a fuck!

181
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:26,117
If you survive, asshole,
I'll kill you!

182
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:39,165
I gotta admit,
your uncle's really something.

183
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:49,717
It's homemade. Have a swig.
It'll calm you down.

184
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:54,159
We'll get a hunt going.

185
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:08,325
She won't move.
She's lovesick.

186
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:11,399
She's waiting for a train to
run her over

187
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:14,121
Whose donkey is it?
It's Vujan's.

188
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,483
Vujan who? - Vujan Peric from
Zabrdje.

189
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:21,196
Vujan died five years ago!
But I spoke to him today.

190
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:28,046
C'mon!

191
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:30,163
Move!

192
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,397
It's useless!

193
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,324
Is she crying?

194
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:39,923
I told you she's suffering.

195
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,517
You don't know the secret word.

196
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,837
Move it!

197
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,404
Step aside.

198
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,325
Now whistle.

199
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:20,965
You're not listening to me.

200
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,962
I don't say speed isn't
important.

201
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,481
But any fool can run fast.

202
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,400
What are you talking about?

203
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,524
Oh God, are You listening to
this?

204
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:38,245
Sure, He's listening.

205
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,444
Don't upset me, Nada. I never
said that.

206
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,724
I said she looked at her husband
and saw he had big ears.

207
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,275
Know how Napoleon won matches?

208
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,085
You mean battles. - Right.

209
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,441
He'd calculate how fast

210
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,087
his cavalry could reach enemy
lines

211
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:56,284
and cut them off. Speed's
everything!

212
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:58,523
You read a lot,

213
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:00,837
but careful you don't get a
headache.

214
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:02,645
If you ride a cloud at the
speed of light

215
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,764
you can't see yourself in a
mirror.

216
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:08,077
I need that speed.

217
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:09,964
Such speed's unhealthy.

218
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,560
The feeling matters

219
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:14,036
Know what feeling is? - Tell me.

220
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,606
Talent.

221
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:19,236
Talent? I'll make a note of it.

222
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:21,443
You either have it or you don't.

223
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:23,520
We were given reason

224
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,359
to escape from our upsets

225
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:27,517
and I'm really upset.

226
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,315
I don't mean Anna Karenina,

227
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,285
I mean me.

228
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,517
I didn't come here for nothing,
you know.

229
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:37,837
My next stop's the nursing home.

230
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,122
I heard Luka talking to the
director,

231
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,357
but he doesn't know I know.

232
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:44,085
He told Luka: "No, Luka, please.

233
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,237
"It's too early for Jadranka

234
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,204
"to enter a nursing home.
She'll still

235
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:51,404
"young, so don't do it."

236
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,917
But I worry for Milos!

237
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,920
You know, a child without a
mother

238
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:02,683
is like a broken umbrella in
the wind.

239
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,677
Big fish eats little fish.

240
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,479
God, what's wrong with me?

241
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,519
I just want you to know:

242
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:41,122
Never will I leave this place!
Ever!

243
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:43,402
Come on, take a pill.

244
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,036
Why don't you take it yourself?

245
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:49,925
Think I don't know what you're
planning?

246
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,237
Don't even think of it!

247
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:55,524
You want your son to hear you?

248
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,520
Lie down. Hospital regulations!

249
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,758
Look, he won't let her on a
stretcher!

250
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:13,680
Come on! - Please, listen to
me...

251
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:17,396
I want to go home.

252
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,240
I'd change that guy for free.

253
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,397
Just one injection!

254
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,478
His wife sings beautifully.

255
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,716
I heard her on the radio.

256
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,196
There's no nursing home.

257
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,959
Too bad about the dust.

258
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:31,162
She has an allergy?

259
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:34,080
An allergy? She's out to lunch.

260
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:39,759
That's what I call love.

261
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:46,038
Wouldn't you like to be
carried like that in his arms?

262
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,800
No way! He's not a Muslim.

263
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:50,684
As if that mattered!

264
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:53,638
It matters! Ask your dad.

265
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:56,287
You don't ask dad for
everything.

266
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:59,643
I want to go home to Milos.

267
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,479
Mouse!

268
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:10,285
Here's the doctor. - How you
are, ma'am?

269
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:14,806
Come in.

270
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,642
It's just a minor allergy.

271
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:06,564
Bosnia! SDA!

272
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:20,358
I'm gonna buy him into every
team,

273
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:22,961
right up to the national team.

274
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:30,845
Djukic, get back!

275
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:33,242
He can't handle this!

276
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:36,046
He can handle it. Calm down.

277
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,038
Get back when I tell you!

278
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:42,402
Is that the kid you mean?

279
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:59,242
Milos Djukic!

280
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,798
Jadranka, come back!

281
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:04,764
I'm Milos's mother.

282
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,486
Ah, you're the mother!

283
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,320
Milos's mother.
I'm Zurovac.

284
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:15,077
You may recall, he played for
"Partizan"

285
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:16,919
when he was a kid.

286
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:25,402
He's no. 9. - Nice kid.

287
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,682
Yes, but he's very sensitive.

288
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,439
He's Mommy's little boy.

289
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:34,322
I'm an opera singer.

290
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm taking time off

291
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:39,043
because of a throat problem.

292
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,924
I'm allergic to dust

293
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:43,475
so I'm here to recuperate.

294
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,605
Go for him!

295
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,964
Close him down!

296
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:07,723
I'm the only one who understands him.
I know what it's like to play.

297
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:11,004
Theatre, soccer, it's all the
same.

298
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:13,917
"All the world's a stage."

299
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,397
Know who said that?

300
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,200
I have no idea.

301
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:22,118
Sure, you do.

302
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:24,402
A name that starts with Sh...

303
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:25,801
Shekularac?

304
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:27,923
No, a foreign guy.

305
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,963
"All the world's a stage.

306
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:33,636
"And all the men & women merely
players."

307
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:36,844
You mean Shuster? - Not at all.

308
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:41,476
I have no idea.

309
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,637
Shakespeare.

310
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,724
I don't follow the Premier
League.

311
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:50,207
This is opening night for Milos.

312
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:51,959
Everything in life is a stage.

313
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:56,598
But different things happen on
it.

314
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,557
Am I right? - Sure.

315
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,484
Take me, for instance.

316
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,842
When I sing on opening night,

317
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:08,236
my throat goes like this...

318
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:12,398
Look at the poor woman.

319
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,523
The things she does for her son!

320
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,199
She's like Mama Juanita.

321
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:26,805
Let me see. - It's nothing, just
a ball!

322
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,323
That was awful.

323
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:32,444
You have to hear me in
rehearsal.

324
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:49,637
What's her problem?

325
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:52,636
Have you seen the movie, "Mama
Juanita"?

326
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:53,876
No.

327
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:55,878
Then you ain't seen nothing.

328
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:57,759
What's there to see?

329
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,157
Know what I'd do for my mother?

330
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:03,158
What would you do for your
mother?

331
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:06,284
I'd fuck half the stadium for
her.

332
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,076
What a generation!

333
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:16,516
For you, Mama Juanita

334
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:20,925
I dedicate this song to you

335
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:24,363
At the break of dawn

336
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:27,359
This song is heard

337
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:30,678
For you, Mama Juanita

338
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:34,396
I dedicate this song to you

339
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:48,877
Here it comes!

340
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,758
You abnormal fuck!

341
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:03,600
What's your problem? Let the
ball in!

342
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:08,636
Let go of my fishing rod,
you motherfucker!

343
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:18,121
This is going too far.

344
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:24,956
Goal!

345
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:27,641
Goal!

346
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,326
Milos!

347
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:44,762
Bravo! You're the champ!

348
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:47,361
Ma'am, your "Sh" stands for
"champion"!

349
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:51,486
The classic champion.
Partizan needs a player like him.

350
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:03,806
Eso!

351
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:07,405
Stop the fight!

352
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:25,963
Leave my son alone!

353
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,117
Leave the kid alone, dopehead!

354
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,925
I'll fucking kill you!

355
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:44,965
You did it, Milos!

356
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,285
Mommy's coming!

357
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,840
Uncle's coming!

358
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,083
I'm coming, my boy!

359
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,840
Leave it to me, Dad! Please!

360
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:06,320
You band of fucking
nationalists!

361
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:15,561
Milos!

362
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,080
Bash that one, he's getting
away!

363
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,600
He's getting away!

364
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:33,283
Tell me exactly what he said.

365
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:36,518
He said: "Ma'am, your Milos is
the best.

366
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,757
But you know that already.

367
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:40,519
Spare me your comments.

368
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:42,120
Mind if I finish?

369
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,078
Secondly, he said he'd phone

370
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,839
in a week's time.

371
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:47,155
So why didn't he call?

372
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,841
He said if business didn't
prevent him.

373
00:29:49,927 --> 00:29:52,202
He's a very busy manager.

374
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:55,165
He said: "Partizan needs Milos."

375
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,442
What more do you want?

376
00:29:57,607 --> 00:29:59,643
Anna Karenina had no allergy.

377
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:00,842
She was visiting her brother

378
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:03,157
and she took the train home.

379
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:05,807
No, Nada, he didn't really have
big ears.

380
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,526
She just didn't love him
anymore.

381
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,917
He was supposed to call last
Monday.

382
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:14,481
He'll call, don't worry. - He'll
call?

383
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,683
It's been a week already.

384
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:20,038
Not even Einstein would say
that.

385
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:21,719
What day is it?

386
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:24,002
I have no idea. - Saturday.

387
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:26,282
He'll call, I tell you.

388
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,680
Will he?

389
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:31,156
If he really needed me,

390
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,158
he'd be calling five times a
day.

391
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,280
Are you crying?

392
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,085
No, I'm not.

393
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:39,516
Looks to me like you are.

394
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:42,679
Well, you're blind. - You're
crying.

395
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:50,043
I want to go back to Belgrade.

396
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:52,958
I want to play soccer there.

397
00:30:53,047 --> 00:30:55,481
Then go, but don't cry.

398
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,205
And you stop shouting. - Who's
shouting?

399
00:30:57,287 --> 00:30:59,118
You're shouting! - I'm not
shouting.

400
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:02,601
What's more,

401
00:31:02,687 --> 00:31:04,757
you dragged me out here.

402
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:06,326
Did I?

403
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:10,881
And you took me off the stage.

404
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:13,517
Better me than the critics.

405
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:16,841
What did you say? - Just kidding.

406
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:19,646
When did I ever have bad reviews?
I know...

407
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:21,797
Tell me, when?

408
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:23,240
That's what I'm saying.

409
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:25,477
Can't a man joke around here
anymore?

410
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:49,278
Those beech trees don't go with
the house

411
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,279
They're not beeches, they're
linden trees

412
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:54,278
Something has to smell nice.

413
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:01,000
What? You want to dig?

414
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:03,885
Then go ahead.

415
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:06,360
Wait. Not like that.

416
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:09,996
Like this. Your foot goes here.

417
00:32:34,607 --> 00:32:36,325
What a sensation!

418
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:37,522
I feel like blowing up

419
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,006
the whole countryside...

420
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:48,237
Hey, bro, we won't have a
border here,

421
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:49,362
will we?

422
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:50,926
Where do you see a border?

423
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:55,637
There, Nada. And Serbia's over
there.

424
00:32:55,727 --> 00:32:59,003
Customs in the middle of the
tunnel?

425
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:00,566
I don't know.

426
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:03,525
But the border is here.

427
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,126
What a tragedy!

428
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,084
I want to thank you

429
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,885
for turning out in force

430
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:12,959
to show your readiness at tough
times

431
00:33:13,047 --> 00:33:14,878
to defend your homes

432
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:17,276
against the wild beasts.

433
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:20,484
I officially declare this bear
hunt open.

434
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:28,043
Just a quick word...
What is it, Filipovic?

435
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:31,324
The party called from Sarajevo
again.

436
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:36,166
They said:
"Does Radovan know who's in charge?"

437
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,999
Are they threatening me?

438
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:41,363
Why are they so hung up
on that freight train?

439
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,644
Big deal!

440
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:46,639
Well, it is big. A million
marks.

441
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:49,639
That's what I call greedy.

442
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,797
Do you think I'm stupid?

443
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:55,243
No, but we're farting on our
own candle.

444
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:58,205
They'll cross us off the map
if we don't play along.

445
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,960
Over my dead body!

446
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:05,802
No more scams using cripples.
Shame on you!

447
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:08,640
I have higher connections in
Belgrade.

448
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:12,276
We'll see who fucks who.
You or me.

449
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,397
Enough of this...

450
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:31,366
When a young hunter I used to be,
a young girl fell in love with me.

451
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:35,560
She was so lovely and so fine,

452
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:39,526
she was my darling, she was
mine.

453
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:43,077
Before I'd set off to hunt at
dawn,

454
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:46,796
Her goodbye kiss was like a ray
of sun.

455
00:34:46,887 --> 00:34:50,516
It gave me luck along the track,

456
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:54,600
a pledge that I would safely
come back.

457
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:58,043
Rabbit, fox and quail,

458
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:01,597
partridge and wild duck,

459
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:06,556
you can catch all these with
luck.

460
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:10,805
But never will you pick up my
trail.

461
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,246
If only people knew the life to
live.

462
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:18,876
Happiness is all that life
could give.

463
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:22,562
Those were days of dreams for
me.

464
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:27,596
When a young hunter I used to
be...

465
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,566
A bear!

466
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:32,161
Run!

467
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,482
All clear, Mr. Mayor.

468
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:32,677
Who leads every revolution?

469
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:36,555
Who gives us our daily bread?

470
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:40,481
Who can be pope, king or sultan,

471
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:45,886
and presides over living and
dead?

472
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:51,516
It's a man, an intellectual,

473
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:55,356
he is the cornerstone of
progress.

474
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:59,281
A gentleman, a professional,

475
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:03,406
his biography is marvelous.

476
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:07,196
He can change mud into gold,

477
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:11,280
turn a stone into a flower.

478
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:13,517
To create is in his power.

479
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:18,920
Honey, it's a man's world.

480
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:24,120
You can build an ark

481
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:30,285
to save humanity,

482
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:35,846
you can raise your little finger

483
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:39,920
to part the waves of the sea.

484
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:43,716
You can build the peace

485
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:48,438
or the Great Wall of China,

486
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:52,684
you can read our dreams,

487
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:57,124
books and beliefs.

488
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,797
You can make war

489
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,720
transact a NATO pact

490
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:07,280
You can write history,

491
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:11,076
constitutions and poetry,

492
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:14,681
but you do all of this

493
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,086
just because of me.

494
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:21,726
To conquer a women's heart

495
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:25,117
is the hardest victory.

496
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:50,642
It's a man, an individual pure,

497
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:54,436
for every illness he finds the
cure

498
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:58,600
He built railroads and great
roads.

499
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:02,760
Honey, it's a man's world.

500
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:06,844
Without me,

501
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:13,919
You're an unfinished rhyme.

502
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,681
Without me,

503
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:25,165
you are a sad linden in a
desert clime.

504
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:30,405
Cities you can build,

505
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:35,045
or take apart,

506
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:40,157
You can split the atom,

507
00:40:40,247 --> 00:40:43,637
but not my heart.

508
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:48,205
You can make war,

509
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,159
transact a NATO pact

510
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:57,723
You can write history...

511
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:03,281
The Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina
declared

512
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,278
that the murder at a Serb
wedding

513
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:08,404
was a shot aimed at the Serb
people.

514
00:41:08,487 --> 00:41:10,796
Among conditions are demands

515
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:13,526
for an urgent resumption of
the...

516
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:17,043
conference on the
democratization...

517
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,839
Where's Milos?

518
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:21,757
At Eso's. Where else?

519
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:25,999
What's he doing there?

520
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:28,237
He likes the cakes. It's
Ramadan.

521
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:30,443
He was there last year too.

522
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:34,399
He should stay away from that
Esad.

523
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:38,036
Why? He's a good boy.

524
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,476
...the result of yesterday's
murder

525
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:43,479
of a Serb, Nikola Grdovic,

526
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:49,085
outside an Orthodox church
in Sarajevo.

527
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:55,285
Citizens were advised to stay
home.

528
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,640
Although there has been no
fighting,

529
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,116
gunfire has been heard.

530
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:04,836
You ask why? Look around you.
They're shooting everywhere

531
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:08,203
and you ask why. Don't you
watch TV?

532
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:10,323
It's all lies.

533
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:12,319
It won't happen, woman.

534
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:13,840
Folks are reasonable here.

535
00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:16,441
The way you talk isn't
reasonable.

536
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:19,360
Me? What's wrong with you today?

537
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:22,240
Veljo left a letter for Milos.

538
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:24,318
It may be from Belgrade.

539
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,719
On the table.

540
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:33,160
From Belgrade.

541
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:35,801
Maybe Partizan wants him.

542
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:40,595
In today's events, one citizen
was killed

543
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,917
and four wounded...

544
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:49,000
He is to report within 24 hour
to his army unit.

545
00:42:49,127 --> 00:42:50,924
The army!

546
00:42:51,047 --> 00:42:53,641
That calls for a toast!

547
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:55,763
It's the army, you idiot!

548
00:42:58,127 --> 00:43:02,996
Hey, Dad, if only you were here
to see Milos off to the army.

549
00:43:03,087 --> 00:43:06,762
Fuck you and your railroad!

550
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:10,237
And damn me for letting you bring
me out here. What's wrong?

551
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:14,876
What is it, woman? - What is
this?

552
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:21,925
It's a scale model. - Scale
model?

553
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:25,043
What are you doing?

554
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,397
You call this a life?

555
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:30,600
Calm down, woman!

556
00:43:30,727 --> 00:43:32,046
Let go of me!

557
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:37,405
You call this a life? - Leave
that alone!

558
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:41,281
You want a dead hero in the
house?

559
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:48,002
Do you want to have a bust
made for your son?

560
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:51,324
Idiot! It's not just military
service.

561
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:54,365
Okay, calm down. - It's a call
to war.

562
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:57,877
They won't get my child! - Leave
Dad alone

563
00:44:03,687 --> 00:44:05,518
I'm not going back!

564
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:13,165
I won't go. - Wait!

565
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,600
What is it now?

566
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:19,206
Upset mother again?

567
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:20,879
I didn't say a word.

568
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:22,446
You did.

569
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:23,926
So why's she crying?

570
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:26,123
It wasn't me, honest.

571
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,761
A Ramadan cake from Mom!

572
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:30,599
Thanks, son.

573
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:32,325
Off I go.

574
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:35,606
Do you have a spark of
intelligence?

575
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:39,320
Want to hear something
intelligent?

576
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:42,319
Yes, tell us. - Come here.

577
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:49,876
That manager, Zurovac, called.
He made me an official offer.

578
00:44:52,927 --> 00:44:55,646
They want your son to join
Partizan.

579
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,405
Milos Djukic! - That's my boy!

580
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:06,797
That's my boy!

581
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:08,605
Milos!

582
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:27,877
Tomo's got something for you!
Something fancy and modern!

583
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:47,560
Basic training?

584
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,877
Just basic training, honest!

585
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:52,441
Filipovic arranged it with the
army.

586
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:53,642
You can ask him.

587
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:55,763
Milos!

588
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:59,039
Hold on, son! Calm down!

589
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,964
What is it?

590
00:46:02,407 --> 00:46:04,967
I don't believe him.

591
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,726
Not a word he says!

592
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:10,561
You have to do basic training.

593
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:12,603
Not even God can change that.

594
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,439
That's how it is.

595
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,087
That's how it is? - Yes.

596
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:19,285
How it is?

597
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:31,795
As soon as you finish basic training,
you join Partizan straightaway.

598
00:46:32,647 --> 00:46:34,239
Listen to me.

599
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,557
It's all been arranged.

600
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:40,435
What's this?

601
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,807
Why the long face if it's fine?

602
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:49,758
Who has a long face?

603
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,520
You know what I mean.

604
00:46:54,607 --> 00:46:57,167
What do you mean, long face?

605
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,003
Just what I said.

606
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,681
Why do you look so miserable?

607
00:47:05,887 --> 00:47:07,639
Miserable?

608
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:11,206
Oh, son,

609
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:14,643
I was born that way.

610
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:21,801
Quick!

611
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:32,999
Here's Tomo Krtolina,
your Santa Claus!

612
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:36,965
Where have you been, Tomo?

613
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:39,118
3, 4...

614
00:47:39,207 --> 00:47:44,122
Come one, come all

615
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:47,120
Come everyone
When I take my oath this fall...

616
00:47:47,207 --> 00:47:49,198
Go to your mother now.

617
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:53,079
Mother!

618
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:54,880
Milos!

619
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:05,637
Aleksic! - Hey, Luka...

620
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,723
Old pal, where you been?

621
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:10,799
I have to ask you something.
You're my only hope.

622
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:13,003
Me, your only hope?

623
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:17,877
If a soldier's your only hope
you're really in bad shape.

624
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:21,239
It's about the war. She's
bugging me.

625
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:25,115
She says he's going to war,
not basic training.

626
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:27,598
There won't be a war.

627
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:29,365
There won't?

628
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:33,645
If everything goes according to plan,
we can avoid it.

629
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:38,200
Auntie's little honeybunch!

630
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,875
Where will you be stationed?
In Novi Sad. - That's not far!

631
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,161
True.

632
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:50,966
What's it near to? The battle
zone.

633
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:54,477
You're as good at geography
as my old lady is.

634
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:58,244
I've been halfway across Europe.

635
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,722
Just eat. Eat!

636
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:38,725
I have no one here. Just my son.
And my husband.

637
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:41,644
Come over here.

638
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:44,045
I have something to tell you.

639
00:49:58,927 --> 00:50:01,395
Oh, you're so funny!

640
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:03,398
Our chief's in Moscow.

641
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:06,239
If they let us,

642
00:50:06,327 --> 00:50:10,957
the military could take over,
and put an end to all this shit.

643
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:13,555
That means no war?

644
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:17,965
No war, Luka. - Thanks, Aleksic.

645
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,839
You're a real brother.

646
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,241
Sure, Luka.

647
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:30,518
No war.

648
00:50:34,127 --> 00:50:36,163
Excuse me! Come over here.

649
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:38,078
What is it? - Over here.

650
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:40,840
C'mon, give me a little kiss.

651
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:43,796
We won't have a war. - Says who?

652
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:45,639
Someone who knows.

653
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:49,436
That "someone" will end up
starting the war.

654
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:14,478
Luka, you poor martyr.

655
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:17,525
Fuck women and their creator!

656
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:26,926
Stop playing!

657
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:29,805
Stop the music!

658
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:33,119
Stop, when I tell you.

659
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:35,477
Is Milos serving in Hungary?

660
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,364
Play one of our songs.

661
00:51:40,687 --> 00:51:41,961
Good evening.

662
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:44,607
I wanna extend a welcome
to everyone here.

663
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:50,364
And I'd like especially to welcome
the Djani Rebus Band.

664
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:52,403
Give 'em a big hand!

665
00:51:54,327 --> 00:52:00,675
The song I'd like to dedicate to Milos
as he goes off to the army is "Time's Up"

666
00:52:00,807 --> 00:52:03,560
Karakaj. - Fuck Karakaj.

667
00:52:03,647 --> 00:52:05,080
Never Mind.

668
00:52:11,727 --> 00:52:16,562
Time's up!

669
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:20,038
I have to go into the army

670
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:22,880
So long, mom and dad

671
00:52:22,967 --> 00:52:26,164
So long, good old godfather

672
00:52:28,207 --> 00:52:32,917
So prepare my farewell party

673
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,995
And now for the knockout punch!

674
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:41,399
Momcilo! Momcilo!

675
00:52:43,087 --> 00:52:46,079
What is it now?

676
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:49,598
The war's started. What are you
doing?

677
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:51,518
What? What?

678
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:54,041
The game's on, sweetpea.

679
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:56,118
But I don't feel it!

680
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:17,040
Gotcha, you slut!

681
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:24,046
Godfather Rajko

682
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:26,243
Let out the dog

683
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:31,240
To watch over the house

684
00:53:32,327 --> 00:53:35,046
Don't let the wolf

685
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:38,005
get his paws around

686
00:53:38,087 --> 00:53:41,079
my Red Riding Hood

687
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:44,284
while I'm away

688
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:48,679
County Tuzla, village of Karakaj

689
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:54,797
That's the place I call home

690
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,037
Anybody home?

691
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:58,001
Anyone to see the soldier off?

692
00:54:58,447 --> 00:55:00,199
Here I am.

693
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:10,960
Where's mother?

694
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:13,686
I took her to the hospital.

695
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:16,327
They're keeping her for tests.

696
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:22,483
That allergy come pretty often?

697
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:24,683
It doesn't go away so easily.

698
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:28,077
In some cases, it's for life.

699
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:34,565
Get ready. Don't just stand
there.

700
00:55:59,327 --> 00:56:00,919
I'll miss my bus.

701
00:56:01,007 --> 00:56:02,838
Wait!

702
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:05,758
Kiss Mother for me.

703
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:20,085
Wait up!

704
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:24,438
Wait, Milos!

705
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:34,917
You see? Speed is important.

706
00:56:35,927 --> 00:56:39,158
The feeling's important.
You dropped your wallet, dummy.

707
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:45,486
Speed and feeling are equal.

708
00:56:46,047 --> 00:56:49,517
They're part of the same
equation.

709
00:56:52,807 --> 00:56:55,275
Take care.

710
00:57:19,887 --> 00:57:24,039
"Kiss Mother for me"

711
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:49,523
Damn women!

712
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:47,725
What?

713
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:51,441
I'll put an end to your
babbling!

714
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:05,722
Fuck you!

715
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:22,282
Think what you want
but Veljo is no fool!

716
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:23,959
Who says you are?

717
00:59:24,047 --> 00:59:26,163
When I use my head things clear
up.

718
00:59:26,247 --> 00:59:27,282
People told me:

719
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:31,918
Veljo, hide your family! But I
didn't.

720
00:59:32,047 --> 00:59:33,685
Who told you to?

721
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:37,316
I said: Luka's smart, an engineer.
He didn't hide his wife.

722
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,523
So why should I? - What?

723
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:41,916
You hid her with the Hungarian.

724
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:45,124
I told my wife: Off to Serbia
with you!

725
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:47,203
I didn't hide Jadranka.

726
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:50,802
But I saw her leave with the
Hungarian.

727
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:08,246
Listen good,
the railroad is under military control.

728
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:12,599
From now on, you answer only to
us.

729
01:00:12,807 --> 01:00:16,880
You're in charge of maintenance
and communications.

730
01:00:16,967 --> 01:00:19,276
Report all damage to me.

731
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:20,846
That's an order.

732
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:24,806
The tracks must be operational
at all times. Understand?

733
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:50,084
Look at her! Where are you
going?

734
01:00:50,207 --> 01:00:52,437
Want a train to run you over?

735
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:54,245
Go on home!

736
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:56,966
It's useless to talk to you!

737
01:00:57,527 --> 01:00:59,245
What did you bring?

738
01:00:59,327 --> 01:01:01,363
A bit of everything.

739
01:01:01,447 --> 01:01:02,960
What goes into a Bosnian stew?

740
01:01:03,047 --> 01:01:06,164
Everything. Milos loves it.

741
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:08,602
Hear those explosions?

742
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,246
They're pounding away.

743
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:20,124
Milos is being transferred here.

744
01:01:20,207 --> 01:01:22,846
Whereabouts? - To Bosnia.

745
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:26,357
He'll pop in if he's nearby.

746
01:01:26,447 --> 01:01:28,642
I'm scared to be in my house
alone.

747
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:33,642
I brought a chess set. We can
have a game. Good idea.

748
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,398
What's that?

749
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:45,037
They're our boys.

750
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:47,879
Hey, soldier!

751
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:56,680
Those aren't our boys! Run!

752
01:01:57,007 --> 01:01:59,567
Didn't I say they were pounding
away?

753
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:02,284
What is it? Not afraid?

754
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:04,927
Why afraid? They announced a
cease-fire.

755
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:06,486
A cease-fire?

756
01:02:07,567 --> 01:02:09,398
Fucking cease-fire!

757
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:12,886
They're pounding away!

758
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:17,925
I can't hear anything.

759
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:33,158
You have the first move.

760
01:02:34,407 --> 01:02:37,524
I'm black. - Fine.

761
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:49,324
Know what my old man used to
say?

762
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:50,556
What?

763
01:02:52,047 --> 01:02:54,436
That war always comes quickly.

764
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:56,722
You see it coming.

765
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:58,399
It rolls in like a flood,

766
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:02,196
but starts
by surprise, understand? - Yeah.

767
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:17,915
Let's play, and the hell with
them.

768
01:03:22,567 --> 01:03:23,602
Veljo!

769
01:03:24,887 --> 01:03:27,117
Was that a 120mm shell? - Yes.

770
01:03:27,247 --> 01:03:28,965
Where'd the Ustasha get them?

771
01:03:29,047 --> 01:03:31,402
Genscher sent 'em to the Croats.

772
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:42,364
Wake up, Luka! - What are you
yelling for?

773
01:03:42,967 --> 01:03:45,640
Where's Veljo? He's not home.

774
01:03:45,727 --> 01:03:47,763
Why do you need him?

775
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,715
Mobilization!

776
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:01,767
A rocket launcher consists the
following:

777
01:04:01,847 --> 01:04:05,362
The barrel, the rocket inside,

778
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:08,876
front and rear sights,

779
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:10,764
and the launch mechanism.

780
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,962
Is that clear?

781
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:15,084
You, young man.

782
01:04:16,207 --> 01:04:17,481
Step forward.

783
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:21,043
What in thunderation!

784
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:27,117
We'll do a little test shot.

785
01:04:27,207 --> 01:04:31,485
See that isolated tree at 250
meters?

786
01:04:31,687 --> 01:04:33,245
That's the target.

787
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:37,041
Okay, doll, is that clear?

788
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:38,924
It is.

789
01:04:39,647 --> 01:04:41,319
Take aim...

790
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:47,041
Fire!

791
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:58,565
Zowie! What a ricochet!

792
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:17,476
Good news, your son's here!

793
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,239
Milos! Where?

794
01:05:19,327 --> 01:05:21,761
At the house. The captain drove
him there

795
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,725
Is that the truth?

796
01:05:25,847 --> 01:05:27,997
Why would I lie?

797
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:51,685
Milos!

798
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:07,645
Get down, Zujka!

799
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:35,843
Why are you lying like this?
Stretch out.

800
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:31,766
Wait up!

801
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:53,958
Take it easy! Don't overdo it!

802
01:08:56,807 --> 01:08:59,196
Where's my Milos hiding?

803
01:09:18,927 --> 01:09:20,406
Hey, Veljo!

804
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:25,804
Everything okay at your place?

805
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:30,005
It really shook last night.

806
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:33,796
I lost some roof tiles.
You know the real miracle,

807
01:09:33,887 --> 01:09:37,846
nothing happened to the Bosnian stew.
It just got cold.

808
01:09:39,127 --> 01:09:41,163
Oh, my Luka!

809
01:09:41,287 --> 01:09:44,723
My boy visits and I give him
nothing.

810
01:09:44,807 --> 01:09:47,367
What an ass, I fell asleep.

811
01:09:52,447 --> 01:09:54,165
Had any damage?

812
01:09:54,247 --> 01:09:56,442
Come down. I have news.

813
01:09:56,527 --> 01:10:01,840
Could you hand me up that long board,
there, on the ledge?

814
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:14,397
Come down. I have to tell you
something.

815
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:17,883
I can't. Tell me.

816
01:10:18,087 --> 01:10:21,966
Come down!
It's not about Jadranka.

817
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:24,759
Is it Milos?

818
01:10:31,287 --> 01:10:32,879
Is he dead?

819
01:10:34,807 --> 01:10:37,605
Tell me. Is he wounded?

820
01:10:38,807 --> 01:10:40,684
No. Come down!

821
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:42,519
Tell me what happened?

822
01:10:42,607 --> 01:10:45,838
I'll murder you if I come down!

823
01:10:48,607 --> 01:10:50,404
He's a prisoner.

824
01:10:50,927 --> 01:10:52,565
A prisoner?

825
01:10:53,847 --> 01:10:55,803
Milos, a prisoner?

826
01:11:04,887 --> 01:11:05,922
How did it happen?

827
01:11:06,007 --> 01:11:07,679
The captain will tell you.

828
01:11:18,967 --> 01:11:22,926
Vladan! Get the chopper for the wounded!
On the double!

829
01:11:27,887 --> 01:11:29,400
Captain!

830
01:11:34,247 --> 01:11:38,365
Send your unit to hill 805!

831
01:11:38,647 --> 01:11:41,719
He wants to take Milos's place.

832
01:11:41,807 --> 01:11:43,798
To do what? - To replace Milos.

833
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:45,479
Transfer me!

834
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:47,485
You've gone crazy too?

835
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:50,605
Let's go home. - I don't want to.

836
01:11:55,567 --> 01:11:56,920
Listen.

837
01:11:57,047 --> 01:12:00,278
I won't leave without a mission.

838
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:14,083
Remember, this isn't your
private war.

839
01:12:14,727 --> 01:12:18,322
I can't take any more. I'll
kill myself.

840
01:12:19,527 --> 01:12:21,165
What?

841
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:26,883
Vladan, get out. - You haven't
finished.

842
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,446
Get out. - But you haven't...

843
01:12:28,527 --> 01:12:30,597
Dismissed! - Yes, sir.

844
01:12:35,487 --> 01:12:37,159
You'll kill yourself?

845
01:12:38,407 --> 01:12:42,036
Too easy. Death doesn't hurt,
my friend.

846
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:45,681
It's living that hurts.

847
01:12:47,887 --> 01:12:49,923
Did you know I have a brother?

848
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,556
Or I had one. I don't know.

849
01:12:52,647 --> 01:12:54,603
My Stevan.

850
01:12:55,887 --> 01:12:57,605
It's been two years.

851
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:00,757
Two years since he disappeared.

852
01:13:02,927 --> 01:13:04,838
He's not among the dead

853
01:13:05,327 --> 01:13:07,397
so I can't bury him.

854
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:09,682
He's not among the prisoners.

855
01:13:09,767 --> 01:13:10,722
He's not among the living

856
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,399
so I can't hug him.

857
01:13:12,487 --> 01:13:14,364
The man simply vanished!

858
01:13:14,487 --> 01:13:17,524
Vanished into thin air!

859
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:20,036
I asked for a transfer to Lika.

860
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,277
Know what they told me?

861
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:27,001
This isn't my private war.

862
01:13:27,727 --> 01:13:29,240
It's someone's war, my dear
Luka.

863
01:13:32,647 --> 01:13:34,000
It's a war for scum.

864
01:13:35,887 --> 01:13:37,286
Not yours or mine, for sure.

865
01:13:42,887 --> 01:13:46,197
We have good reason to believe
that Milos is alive.

866
01:13:48,607 --> 01:13:50,598
We'll find him.

867
01:13:51,087 --> 01:13:53,317
We'll liberate him.

868
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:57,563
Know how big my Stevan is?

869
01:13:57,927 --> 01:13:59,838
Three times my size.
