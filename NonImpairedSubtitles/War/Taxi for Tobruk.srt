1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,840
CHRISTMAS 1941


2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,040
Midnight.


3
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,040
In his castle of Stargard, Pomerania;


4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,760
Captain von Stegel of the 15th armoured
division, is about to leave


5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,720
once again his mother,
wife and son.


6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,440
It's his third war Christmas.
What is his destination?


7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
He doesn't know it yet.


8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,800
The same night
at the same time in London,


9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,640
a British family introduces the Christmas
pudding to corporal Théo Dumas,


10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,080
from the 1st Free French Division.


11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,360
Corporal Théo Dumas is distracted.


12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,440
He thinks about his bar-tabac
in Montmartre.


13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,920
With his European champion's gloves
hanged behind the bar.


14
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,480
In Ablis, west of Paris.


15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,520
A grandmother says goodbye
to her grandson.


16
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,440
He's off to England.


17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,360
François Gensac isn't a warrior.
He's 30 and he's always get bored.


18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
He's hoping for a change.


19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,160
At the same time, a small boat is taking
out of France a eight men group.


20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,200
They have different reasons
to leave occupied France.


21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,960
This medical extern got only one
but that's a good one:


22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,560
His name is Samuel Goldmann.


23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,800
At Bayonne's prison,
people are thinking.


24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,920
There's a lot of thinking going on
in prison on Christmas Eve.


25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,120
This one mostly thinks that
he's been sentenced to death


26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
and that if the escape
he's planning fail,


27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,440
he will be executed in two days.


28
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,360
TAXI FOR TOBRUK


29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,520
10 months later, in Libya


30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,960
inside Tobruk
occupied by the troops of Rommel.


31
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,440
What the fuck is he doing?


32
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,400
Come on, let's go.


33
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,360
Everybody down!


34
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,920
Come on, quickly!


35
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,800
It was like if the lieutenant was
feeling he wouldn't make it.


36
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,280
Was he bashed up a lot?


37
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,640
You know what kind
of funeral oration he was up to:


38
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,360
muscatel in Pleurnel,
but we're not there yet.


39
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,520
Yeah, I know; I maybe moved
a bit from the road,


40
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,720
but I got us out
of the mess, thought.


41
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,720
And I can guarantee you we'll be
in El Alamein tonight, in our beds!


42
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,200
If you keep going, corporal,


43
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
and if my notes are right...


44
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,280
we're not heading to El Alamein anymore
but to the Cape of Good Hope.


45
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,360
- And he has stripes on his jacket!
- Do you want them?


46
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,200
- How far did we move from the road?
- I was saying the Cape of Good Hope


47
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,600
to avoid offending you but we're
actually rushing to the South Pole.


48
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,520
Come on, slow down with that!
We just have to change direction.


49
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,640
We've got petrol, water and meat.
We're only 700 kms from our lines


50
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,240
and we can do 1000;
it's a piece of cake.


51
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,560
Of course, if we forget planes, tanks,
land mines and other trifles!


52
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,600
If a superior invites you for a ride,
my friend, just enjoy it


53
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,760
or you'll see you'll end up
under arrest.


54
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,800
Yeah; one day you'll be surprised
to end up having your arse kicked.


55
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,840
Hey...
Is this thing over there on the map?


56
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,760
No, it's not.


57
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,040
Morons.


58
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,000
And what about this one?


59
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,040
It's maybe a friend.


60
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
- Don't touch that.
- You bet!


61
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,520
Don't touch that, God damn it!


62
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,640
If it's a Kraut, let him thing we're
Krauts too; they've got British cars too.


63
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,280
Cool it, take it easy!


64
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,200
- We've got a brain with us!
- That's for sure.


65
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,600
Don't screw it.


66
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,480
- Messersmith 109.
- The one who doesn't turn left


67
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
and has messy machine-guns
according to Paris-Soir.


68
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I got him!
I got my Kraut, guys!


69
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,080
Jesus, everybody out!


70
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
The radio and water!


71
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,040
He won't make it to Tobruk.


72
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,600
I mean the Kraut.
- I better like not answer you back.


73
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,440
Dumb people like you should wear a sign.
You'd deserve the council of war.


74
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,280
- I hear people.
- Try to catch the base.


75
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,400
And you, get our position.


76
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,880
In three hours time,
a plane could be here;


77
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,360
if Mr Arsehole don't shot him down.


78
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,560
We can copy but we can't transmit.


79
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,240
The oscillator burned out and
we don't have a spare one.


80
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,880
- How's that!?
- We didn't bring one.


81
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,720
Jesus fucking Christ; so you all
don't give a shit about nothing, huh?


82
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,120
So we're gonna croak because
you didn't bring a spare oscillator!


83
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,880
That's a bit rich!
That really is!


84
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,880
- What's wrong with your leg?
- It's nothing, just a burn.


85
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,880
It looks bad. Put your hanky on it
to keep it away from the flies.


86
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,960
You know flies...


87
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,640
Now or later...


88
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,400
So you don't even try anymore?


89
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,960
You just don't give a shit.


90
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,360
What were you saying?
- We were speaking about flies.


91
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
What?


92
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,760
You don't know what is it
to die of thirst, general?


93
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,600
I studied it, it's really groovy.


94
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,800
First, your tongue will puff up.


95
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,760
Swallowing will become painful.


96
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,320
Then will come hearing troubles,
and next vision troubles.


97
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,520
That's the standard progression.


98
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,680
Spasms will come later,
just before agony.


99
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,480
That's the moment when
the flies will attack.


100
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,760
What about speaking
of something else?


101
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,280
Why? That fit the present situation
and I'm a doctor.


102
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,080
That's funny.


103
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,040
I often thought about death.


104
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,120
Mine, of course.


105
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
I use to figure it around 70 years old,


106
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,040
with an add in the medical magazine.


107
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,080
Doctor Samuel Goldmann
died of a heart failure.


108
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,400
And I'm gonna die here.
Of thirst, like a geranium.


109
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,320
Is that it? Then, on your feet.
If you forgot something,


110
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,120
you'll tell us on the way.
Let's go.


111
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,360
Just from you to us, don't you think
that's the end of the road?


112
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,200
We've got no car and no water and
we're 700 kms away from our lines.


113
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,120
- We're gonna make it.
- How?


114
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,120
By foot!


115
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,280
You fool, tomorrow your feet
will be big like this!


116
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,960
Feet, tongue, spasms...
you really won't spare us anything!


117
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
- You'll see!
- Then if I can't walk, I'll crawl!


118
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
I'm gonna get through
that 700 kms no matter what!


119
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,480
- No matter what!?
- No matter what!


120
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,200
And even if I can't, the only way to find
a patrol or something is to walk!


121
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,320
Then you'll walk, but without me!


122
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,960
We'll both give up, you'll see.
We're all gonna give up.


123
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,960
Sure, go ahead: give up!


124
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,920
I heard that one so many times:
"Just give up, Dudu".


125
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,200
But that was always the other guy
who fell on his arse.


126
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,680
- Boxing is not exactly the same thing.
- Yes, it is!


127
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
There's only two options:
croak here or walk.


128
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,640
I am walking! And you too!


129
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,480
No.


130
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,680
Sorry, corporal; I haven't been
a hussar for 11 months


131
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,520
to end up a footsoldier.
- What does it mean?


132
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,480
Just this: I accept to die but
with the less effort as possible.


133
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm gonna stay here,
smoke my last cigarettes and wait.


134
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,440
I let you crawl on the sand,
your tongue panting.


135
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,520
I'll be seating when
the flies will find me.


136
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,000
Come on, my brave men!
I'd rather die for the desert's fertilisation.


137
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,000
"Tomorrow on the tombs, the wheat
will look better.", like the poet said.


138
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,440
Gensac was a name and now
it's gonna be a fertiliser brand.


139
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,000
Colonialism is changing.
- And they call that a commando!


140
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,760
The orators commando!


141
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,240
Come on, let's go,
they're getting on my tits.


142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
- Dudu!
- Shit!


143
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,880
Doctor, I think the Neanderthal man
is screwing us.


144
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,080
A walking brute goes further
than two seated highbrows.


145
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,960
Dudu...


146
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Are we stopping because of me?


147
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,400
Him.


148
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,840
It's not because of someone.


149
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,120
Théo...


150
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,000
I can't take it any longer.


151
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,760
Do as I do:
think about something else.


152
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,880
Do you think those tracks
lead to somewhere?


153
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,280
Yes.


154
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,520
That's the only thing
we should think of.


155
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,080
I've got hearing troubles:
I hear music.


156
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,280
Me too.


157
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,120
Aren't you?


158
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,400
I've got lazy ears.


159
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,280
But if you both hear music, dummies,
that means there's really music!


160
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,080
Leave that!


161
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,560
Guys, that's the last metro.


162
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,320
We come back with it
or we don't come back.


163
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,080
Which one you pick?


164
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,120
The one facing us.


165
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm taking this one...


166
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,640
And you?
- I don't care!


167
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,640
- You take the one on the right.
- Fine with me.


168
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,040
- You take the one in the middle.
- Yeah.


169
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,440
Don't screw it, guys,
there will be no second sitting.


170
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,320
Ready?
- Ready.


171
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,080
No!


172
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,880
Hurry up, scumbag!


173
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,240
They'd piss less if they
weren't drinking so much.


174
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,640
Wait, I lost mine.


175
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,960
Now, for Christ's sake!


176
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,200
There's some leftovers, guys!


177
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,560
You'd better hurry up!


178
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Come on, cool it!


179
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,400
Does "hauptmann" mean "captain"?
- Ja.


180
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,160
Ludwig von Stegel, 1912...


181
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,880
Hey guys...
Do you know he's terrific?


182
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,440
Do you think they'll let me
take him home?


183
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,440
Hurt?


184
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,240
He wanted to play with his radio...
When you do stuff like that,


185
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,200
you get your paws caught.


186
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,320
Ask him who he was speaking with.


187
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,920
Don't mind us, Her Hauptmann;
just say it if we're bothering you.


188
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,720
La Haye's agreements
are protecting you...


189
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,160
Ask him if he has friends around.


190
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,440
I had those ones.


191
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,040
You'll obtain no information
from me.


192
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,160
But you can yap in French, bitch!


193
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,640
I don't yap, I speak.


194
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,840
Even if I'm only a private,
allow me an advice, captain...


195
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,440
if you really want to be ironic,
you'd better talk to the corporal:


196
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,920
he won't touch you, you're not
in the same weight division.


197
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,120
But with him, you'll have your arse
kicked before sunrise.


198
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
In a blink.


199
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,600
We won't touch you but can you
give me your officer's word


200
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,600
you won't try to escape?


201
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,040
The laws of war allow me to give you
my word and not keep it.


202
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay.


203
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,640
But as we have 700 kms to do together,
I'd like to clear the situation.


204
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,240
If everything's all right,
I'll hand you over to the military police


205
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,040
but if you try something sneaky,
I'll plug you.


206
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,400
You've my word in both case.
Understood?


207
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,200
What means "something sneaky"?


208
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,880
Well. Come here,
we have some mechanical work to do.


209
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,520
You two, tell me how much water
and petrol we've got.


210
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,080
We're carrying the Tanganyika, general:
at least 30 litres of water.


211
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,080
Tanganyika or not,
draw up the rationing.


212
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,200
Shit, we just came out of rationing!


213
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,160
30 litres for five and
at least 20 hours of road,


214
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,560
don't figure on having a bath!


215
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
Did you say for five?


216
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,320
I can see only four of us.


217
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,000
Where is the fifth?


218
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,880
He'll drink and eat
the same as us.


219
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
Otherwise, plug him now.


220
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,360
Go ahead, we're looking at you!


221
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,760
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead!


222
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,040
Excuse-me, father. I didn't realise
I'd join the Salvation Army.


223
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,840
Let me laugh!


224
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,160
Let me laugh!


225
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,040
I'm a Jew.


226
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,640
What does it mean?


227
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,320
I thought you could
speak German?


228
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,520
I didn't learn it in a garage.


229
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,240
It could be faster if we'd ask him.


230
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,520
Yeah, faster...
If you're hurry to look like a sucker,


231
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,360
I've got all the time.


232
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,640
Stop it, they love to show
how brave they are anyway.


233
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,120
Hop in. In France,
we don't shoot our prisoners.


234
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,720
For sure,
we don't have much of them.


235
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,920
Gentlemen... The bar's open.


236
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,480
The container's opaqueness
allowing to cheat,


237
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,680
don't forget God is watching you.


238
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,640
- Drink up, I'll handle the wheel.
- Veterans first.


239
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,600
Here.


240
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,200
We're really drinking
too much, guys.


241
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,680
- You can skip your turn.
- I'd rather have a dilation.


242
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,320
You could say thank you.


243
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,360
I can put 20 more litres,
do I feel it up?


244
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,160
Yes, then you'll come
to help me with the meal.


245
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,400
I should only handle technical matters;
but if I let them do...


246
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,840
Is it the same for you?
- Sometimes.


247
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,120
- Are you coming from El Alamein?
- Yeah.


248
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,240
Without an officer?


249
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,040
We had one.


250
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,760
During the shootings,
he wasn't hiding in the car.


251
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,640
At what age they start
paying you your pension?


252
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,400
Can't you change the bloody record?


253
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,920
Why? They started it.
And I have plenty more to say.


254
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,360
It looks bad.


255
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,840
You could use an antiseptic.


256
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,720
I'll clean it anyway.


257
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,640
- It would annoy me to be amputated.
- Don't talk crap.


258
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,240
It would annoy me because of tennis.


259
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,040
Do you play tennis?
- I never had time for that.


260
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,880
Grant, examination, faculty,
examination again, internship...


261
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,400
I was a hard-working boy.


262
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,360
Careful, deserving...


263
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,280
revolting.


264
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,360
But I had only two choices:
be a doctor or fixing old cauldrons.


265
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,160
From father to son,
the Goldmann are tin workers.


266
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,880
If your grandfather isn't a banker,
where's the use of being a Jew.


267
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,400
Is it painful when I press around it.
- You bet it is.


268
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,840
It's so stupid not
to have Mercurochrome.


269
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,960
You're gonna enjoy that
but you can scream if you want.


270
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,720
You can count on me on that.


271
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,080
You know what they say in Cairo?


272
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,200
When you find a dead body
you can't identify in the desert...


273
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,200
You check his pockets:
if there's a can opener, it's a British.


274
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,680
If there's a bottle opener,
it's a French.


275
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,200
How could I knew?


276
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,840
Jeez...


277
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,920
If it was me, I would have been bawled out...
- What?


278
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,200
Nothing. I didn't talk to you.


279
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,640
By the way, Sam; you could also
take care of his hand.


280
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,440
His hand?


281
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,720
It's better be cautious,
joints are very fragile.


282
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,040
We never know.


283
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,880
Here you go.


284
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,120
I want to take you back
in good shape.


285
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,800
We're doing what it takes for that.


286
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,880
Let's see this hand.


287
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,200
Don't worry: there's nothing broken.
- What do you think?


288
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,800
I didn't use all my strength.
- Of course!


289
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,520
Now that you're feeling better,
don't forget you're in charge of the radio.


290
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,680
Yes, Sir.


291
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,600
I'd prefer if the buddies know
we're using a German car.


292
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,960
And is that grub ready or what!?
- Just a sec.


293
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,320
I'm so hungry, guys.


294
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,640
So?
- I don't know why


295
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
but it's worst than last night,
I can't copy anything.


296
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,920
Then just keep trying.


297
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,040
Hey, listen that.


298
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
"Violent combats are on.


299
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,480
The statement transmitted by
the Cairo this morning says that


300
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,680
the 8th army, with the help of
the air force, had launched last night


301
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,920
from El Alamein
a general offensive..."


302
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,200
"The decisive battle is on.


303
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,240
At the time we're transmitting,


304
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,800
Rommel's forces are
drawing back everywhere."


305
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,400
We just have to call them, they'll take
care of us after the war is over.


306
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,360
I want to have a closer
look on this, right now.


307
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,480
- I thought you were hungry?
- Not anymore. You get the wheel,


308
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,600
I'll get the compass.
You come with me.


309
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,720
I heard the situation isn't good
for you, my good man.


310
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,200
You'll forget about it...


311
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,760
Everyone on board.


312
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,920
En route to El Alamein.


313
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,840
Halt!
If you don't mind...


314
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,840
the wounded ones first.


315
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,160
We've been suffering,
we have rights over you.


316
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,520
Step in, my dear colleague.
- You really have some nerve!


317
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,400
That's how things are going:


318
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,520
soon, just any scratch will
be convertible into cash.


319
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,080
What's wrong?


320
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,040
The news are good.
I mean, for you.


321
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,280
Yeah.


322
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,480
Looks like home is getting close.


323
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,280
Do you have someone
waiting for you?


324
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,440
Are you married? Any children?


325
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,400
Yes.


326
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,880
So you're a father.


327
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,680
I'm a son.


328
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,720
That's my daddy I'll meet.


329
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,840
Yeah. Right now,
my dear father is in Vichy.


330
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,520
Legality is running into his veins.


331
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,080
If the Chinese invade us,
he'd become a mandarin.


332
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,120
If the niggers were taking over,
he'd stick a bone in his nose.


333
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,560
If the Greeks...


334
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,240
Let's skip this one...


335
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,040
So depending on things are gonna turn,
I'll be the Gaullist delinquent


336
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,080
or the purifier hero.


337
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,320
Watch out,
you're swerving to the south.


338
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,080
- You asked me to.
- Then it's because of their shitty compass.


339
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,320
Our is way better.
- It doesn't matter anyway,


340
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,440
you just guide me as you feel it.


341
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,080
Halt!


342
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,880
What did you say?


343
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,240
Halt.


344
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,640
Why halt?


345
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,600
- Stop, if you prefer.
- I don't prefer anything,


346
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm the one who says
when to stop.


347
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,640
You won't reach
El Alamein like this.


348
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,000
You're gonna get stuck
in the soft sand.


349
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,360
- Soft sand yourself.
- Let him talk.


350
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,640
May I?


351
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,720
We have to by-pass this zone.


352
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,320
We have to do a "S".
Like this.


353
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,600
Then let's do it.
- It's over 100 kms detour,


354
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,720
we'll have it for the petrol.
- Yeah, we'll run out of petrol.


355
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,280
I don't see a solution.


356
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,240
What would you do
if you were in my shoes?


357
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,880
I am not in your shoes.


358
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,760
But I know that...


359
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
I would go here.


360
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,480
Siva's oasis.


361
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,640
You'll find all the water
and petrol you want.


362
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,760
- And we'll find your buddies too.
- You really have some nerve, Bismarck.


363
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,200
- A funny boy we have here.
- We had Siva's control yesterday but today?...


364
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,960
Radio Cairo said we are
drawing back everywhere.


365
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,520
If you don't trust
your own information...


366
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,040
Captain von Stegel, you really think
we're a bunch of morons.


367
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,640
We can take you directly
to Tobruk if you prefer.


368
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,600
In what floor do you live?
I'll can also run a bath for you.


369
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,760
Come on, Sammy, step on it.
Hard sand or soft sand,


370
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,560
El Alamein is straight ahead.


371
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,360
- Don't let the engine heat up.
- I'm spinning.


372
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,880
Use the intermediates.
Didn't I teach you that?


373
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,120
Yes, Sir; you taught me that.
Take the wheel if you can do better.


374
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,120
- You'll get stuck in the sand.
- I can stop if you want.


375
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,160
That moron's gonna get stuck.


376
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,600
That's it, I was sure
this would happen, didn't I?


377
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,560
- Me too.
- Try to go backwards.


378
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,720
Easy on the pedal.
Don't step on it, just caress it.


379
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,000
Get off and change
the gearwheels if you want.


380
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,640
I must really love war
to make it with that!


381
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,360
Get your shovels, gentlemen!


382
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,120
Pushing is maybe enough,
we need to know on what we're going.


383
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,040
On soft sand.


384
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,640
Hey... You speak German,
say him fuck for me.


385
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,960
What about taking a shovel?


386
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,760
- No.
- It could makes you tired.


387
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,440
This is not the point.


388
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,320
No French officer prisoner
is forced to work.


389
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,920
As an officer, I just ask for
the implement of an admitted rule.


390
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,080
Somebody needs a good kick
up the arse, guys.


391
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,560
- He's right: he doesn't have to work.
- And me?


392
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,560
You're not a prisoner so you dig!


393
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,040
I could use some water.


394
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,440
Same here.


395
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,040
Come on, guys,
that's the labourers round.


396
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,880
Special service.


397
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,880
Is it cool?


398
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,960
Like a southern rosé.
Maybe a bit too iced.


399
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,120
I'm not sure what La Haye's
agreements are planning for this type


400
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,880
of situation but I'll check it out
when we'll arrive.


401
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,520
Maybe a retroactive round will come.


402
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,000
Regulations are regulations.


403
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,640
Come on guys,
we're almost there.


404
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,800
Push!


405
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,840
Come on.


406
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,520
It won't start.


407
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,360
Let's do it again.


408
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,200
How much does it use?


409
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,840
30 litres.


410
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,840
- That's enough only for half of the way.
- I know that!


411
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,760
But if we go to Siva, we'll bump into
his friends and if we go straight


412
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,200
we'll run out of petrol.
There's no way out.


413
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,280
Having tasted what dying slowly could be,
I'd rather try something new.


414
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,840
- You're gonna be spoiled!
- You can count on it.


415
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,600
Well...


416
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,440
If He can remember we're representing
civilisation, God will maybe help us!


417
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,000
I think I noticed He'd rather help
big armies over smallest ones


418
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,000
so we'd better
not expecting too much.


419
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,280
Yeah...


420
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,560
But Siva isn't that big
and we first need to find it.


421
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,120
We're doing you a favour so what about
guiding us with the compass?


422
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,400
My pleasure.


423
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,440
Come on, guys, let's go.


424
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,480
Who's that?


425
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,760
Would you mind going
at the back?


426
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,920
Handle him.


427
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,960
Not like this, here.


428
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,400
Do we hook on the wagon?


429
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,680
Yeah.


430
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,840
But don't be overzealous.


431
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,520
We must land on it
just like in candyfloss.


432
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,720
"Hello ladies and gentlemen,
we're just passing through."


433
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,720
Okay?
- Yes.


434
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,280
Let's go.


435
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,240
Your road is a bit busy for me.


436
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,320
Do you know a better one?


437
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,040
What I dislike is their military police.


438
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,400
You know, they just have
the same one we have.


439
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,480
Some MPs are really twisted.


440
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,600
They'll be there if you're pilfering.


441
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,960
Slow down.


442
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,080
Can you make up your mind?


443
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,200
- We've got motorcyclists on our back.
- Do you think they'll give us a ticket?


444
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,560
- Let them pass.
- What if they stop?


445
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,440
Then we'll see.


446
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,720
What are we doing?


447
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,120
If you don't plan to take off,
then keep on driving.


448
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,400
See what I see, big chief?


449
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,240
Damn it, Samuel!


450
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,600
So they busted you too?


451
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,200
Samuel... Don't you recognise me?
- Hurry up, for Christ sake!


452
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,440
What a bloody moron!


453
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,640
Is he recovering?


454
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,440
Slowly.


455
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,800
- Théo...
- Yeah?


456
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,200
Did you noticed I didn't touch
a single hair of his head?


457
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,600
You speak of La Haye's agreements...


458
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,520
But that's the second time
you smashed his face!


459
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,120
Feeling better?


460
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,880
Get off and help him to walk a bit
but hurry up, we've got no time to lose.


461
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,240
I'll evaluate the situation.


462
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,680
Don't take this personally,
Théo is a brute born from the war.


463
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,040
In medical terms,
they call that a paranoiac,


464
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,280
in military terms a corporal.


465
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,880
- Is that brandy?
- Three stars.


466
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,760
- Show me that.
- No, no...


467
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,240
You took the car to the German army:
it's war.


468
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,360
But the bottle...


469
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,560
is mine.


470
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,960
It's maybe time to give him
another wallop.


471
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,280
Where did you steal this?


472
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,160
I bought it.


473
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,680
When was the last time
you went in Paris?


474
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,960
A year ago.


475
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,120
I transited there


476
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,840
three months ago.


477
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,760
I hope you enjoyed it.


478
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,480
What about speaking
of something else?


479
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,400
Why? It's instructive.


480
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,120
A nice garrison town, isn't it?


481
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,360
"Beaucoup plaisir, promenade,
jolie mademoiselle..."


482
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,040
I lived two years in the student residence
across Montsouris Park.


483
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,840
The left bank is nothing
except for the stadium.


484
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,000
At night, I used to go to eat
rue Monsieur Leprince.


485
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,280
- At the Chinese's?
- At Adèle's.


486
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,920
Is the tour over?


487
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,240
I've been listening this "Paris this,
Paris that" crap for two years.


488
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,440
The nice cheap bars,
the saturday night balls,


489
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,080
the place du Tertre and so on...


490
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,720
Soon, one of you is gonna show a metro
ticket and pictures of Notre-Dame.


491
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,440
For me all this is gone; there's
no more Paris and that's it.


492
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,280
Are you insensitive to nostalgia,
corporal Dudu?


493
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,280
No, but I don't think backwards,
I leave that to pussies and crayfishes.


494
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,120
- Bravo!
- I'm glad to hear that!


495
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,360
Scratch a boxer and a philosopher
will come out of it!


496
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,760
There's a sleeping Plato
in every Dudu.


497
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,080
Do you know what Plato is telling you?


498
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,560
Did you notice, captain, the friendliness
between noncommissioned officers


499
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,440
and privates we have?
That's what they call democracy.


500
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,080
We share joys and sorrows.
We share everything


501
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,440
...but the brandy.


502
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,360
And they are supposed to be
out of equipment...


503
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,720
What are we doing?


504
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,080
We move. Come on.


505
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,840
Do you really want to stay here?


506
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,200
That's the beginning
of the end, guys.


507
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,280
We've got 200 litres
of petrol with us!


508
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,080
Everybody down!


509
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,000
After you.


510
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,520
They are bombarding from high,
they must be Canadians.


511
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,440
Those morons are gonna
dump one of these on us!


512
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,560
Don't insult them,
they are our allies.


513
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,640
Don't try to run,


514
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,040
that would be stupid.


515
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,960
Don't worry, Dudu, 
we're here.


516
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,480
Wow, my man...


517
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,960
so it's not only about
making prisoners...


518
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,440
We could use a coachbuilder.
- Let's just hope it starts.


519
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,560
- Shit, my beret.
- Don't move, I'll get it.


520
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,400
Listen to this...


521
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,880
Remind me to buy myself
a Mercedes.


522
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,120
Special service for the labourers.


523
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,040
- Here.
- Hurry up!


524
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,080
You can hold your brandy.
Bravo!


525
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,400
Get off by this side.


526
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,720
Slowly.


527
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,040
If it overturns, we won't be able
to put it back on its wheels.


528
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,800
Look at this...


529
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,320
Maybe I can handle this.


530
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,760
Maybe, yes.


531
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,840
Hold here.
- What?


532
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,880
Here!


533
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,960
Wait, while you manoeuvre it,
we'll prop it up.


534
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,000
- With what?
- With that!


535
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,480
If the car overturns,
we'll be crashed under, great idea!


536
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,720
The greatest idea I had
was to let you drive.


537
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,880
I wouldn't say anything
if I was you.


538
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,880
Ready?


539
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,880
Come on.


540
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,760
Stop, it's okay.


541
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,480
He's running away,
shoot on the tyres!


542
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,640
With what?
- Jesus Christ, I told 100 times


543
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,600
to never get off the car
without your weapon.


544
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,280
Give him yours.


545
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,920
Come closer, gentlemen.
Hands on your neck.


546
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,280
- We look smart.
- Who's at fault?


547
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,920
"Who's at fault?, Who's at fault?"
- We won't be here if you had let me do.


548
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,160
If the other one didn't overturned
the car, we wouldn't be here neither.


549
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,080
"It's not me, sir, it's the other fellow."
You're worst than kids.


550
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,720
"Concord between the French
has never been needed as it is today."


551
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,480
A field marshal said that.
- Come on, not today!


552
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,640
Okay.


553
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,720
I said hands on your neck.


554
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,680
Don't you understand French?


555
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,120
Take the front seats.


556
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,640
Corporal, you take the wheel.


557
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,400
On your neck.


558
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,560
En route to Tobruk.


559
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,920
Where do you think
it's gonna take you?


560
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,440
To Tobruk. Fourth floor.


561
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,440
I'm sorry, corporal,
but I can't wait to take a bath.


562
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,240
Don't answer, just drive.


563
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,120
I can't watch
the four of you.


564
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,640
Corporal...
- What?


565
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,760
Tell him there's no grenade
under the seat.


566
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,640
What could I do
with a grenade?


567
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,720
I don't know but don't do
anything stupid.


568
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,360
I think we're stuck in the sand.


569
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,960
I couldn't have done
better myself.


570
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,640
Get off.


571
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,040
Everyone.


572
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,320
Dig.


573
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,560
No.


574
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,400
You won't drink anything before.


575
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,600
We don't care,
we're not thirsty.


576
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,480
Good.


577
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,880
I'm not in a hurry.
- We neither.


578
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,080
Step back.


579
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,240
A southern rosé.


580
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,960
Don't you want some?


581
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,160
Good night!


582
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,720
Hey, captain!


583
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,040
En route.


584
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,920
If someone told me there
were snails in the desert...


585
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,040
Not as good as the grey ones,
but quite okay.


586
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,840
No one can contest that
you improve on acquaintance.


587
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,840
That's true: ace driver...


588
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,680
chef...


589
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,040
What were you doing
in civilian life?


590
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,640
I never was a civilian.


591
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,560
Since 1939, you military people haven't be idle.
- Since 1938.


592
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,080
Do you think it's funny?


593
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,080
Very.


594
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,880
I think like him.


595
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,200
An officer who doesn't like
to fight is a crook.


596
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,600
You are making war thought
you say everyday how stupid it is.


597
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,440
You should had stay home.


598
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,880
That's a funny one!


599
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,640
He is a professional soldier
but I didn't ask to come.


600
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,040
They sent me a notice.


601
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,040
So what?
You didn't had to answer.


602
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,360
Sammy, replace me with him,
I'm out of breath.


603
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,680
To my point of view


604
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,240
the best part of war
is the victory parade.


605
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,440
The boring part is
everything before.


606
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,720
We should cash our enlistment money
and parade right after.


607
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,760
Can I ask you something?


608
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,880
Of course.


609
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,040
If you don't like war


610
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,280
why sign treaties with countries
that always fight war?


611
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,960
Sign a treaty with Switzerland
or Luxembourg.


612
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,680
My dear Ludwig, you don't know
the French well enough.


613
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,600
Our freedom complex
goes back to 1789.


614
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,400
That's why we slaughtered
half of Europe.


615
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,400
Ever since Napoleon
crushed Poland,


616
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,760
we've refused to let
anyone else do it.


617
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,880
It would make us feel frustrated.


618
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,560
That was a long time since
you didn't talk nonsense.


619
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,960
Yes, I was missing it.


620
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,360
Yet it's because of the Polish
they sent me to Norway.


621
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,480
Can you understand that?


622
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,200
You were in Narvik?


623
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,600
Nice little seafront.


624
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,800
- I know very well.
- Is this coming from there?


625
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,760
Yes.


626
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,520
The only things I brought back
are frostbites.


627
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,840
From Narvik, I went to England
instead of going home.


628
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,520
Why? I'm still wondering...


629
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,080
If you want to make friend with him,
just pretend


630
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,920
you believe it was patriotism.


631
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,560
It was ambition.


632
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,360
The petty bourgeois mind,
the lunchbox security.


633
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,800
You won't get me like this,
you bunch of dummies.


634
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,720
And there's the double pay. For the
noncommissioned officers it's not bad.


635
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,680
The more it last,
the more he fills his pockets.


636
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,920
It won't be okay if you start
speaking dough, guys.


637
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,480
I'm the only one who'll
end up sunk by all this.


638
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,600
-How's that?
- You know it perfectly.


639
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,120
Ludwig doesn't.


640
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,400
You know I'm not
a professional soldier.


641
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,560
I had a job you don't do for long
and it was my last years.


642
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,800
When I think that 15 days
before the declaration of war,


643
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,200
I was suppose to box with Gustav Rudin.
A fellow citizen of yours.


644
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,960
Only 15 days before
and on top of the bill.


645
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,200
- On top of the bill!
- Perfectly, on top of the bill.


646
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,840
And they would have had
to add more chairs.


647
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,200
That's what I left behind me, only to have
my arse kicked in the fjords!


648
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,840
That would maybe have had
the same thing on the ring.


649
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,160
Kidding me?
It was a piece of cake.


650
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,840
- How do you know?
- The fight was fixed.


651
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,040
Don't you think they're
a bit dumb, captain?


652
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,200
- We must admit we have some good laugh.
- Yes...


653
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,680
Here, have another one.


654
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,560
Shit.


655
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,240
It seems some were
in trouble here.


656
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,200
It's no longer a minefield,
it's a fairground.


657
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,560
Anyway we've been through this
on the way, we'll do it again


658
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,720
on the way back.
That's how things are going.


659
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,680
Who was driving the first time?
- Me.


660
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,480
Then it's you again.
Let's go!


661
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,520
"Let's go!". That's a funny one.
The first time we had marks, and a map.


662
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,880
- Where is it then?
- In Tobruk...


663
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,080
With the lieutenant.


664
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,600
Boys, I'm okay to try,
but I can't guarantee anything.


665
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,360
Because the landscape
is pretty different.


666
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,000
You can believe me.


667
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,040
There's no hurry
to blow ourselves up!


668
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,000
Take your time,
we're not in a hurry.


669
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,440
Anyway, they'll say
we've been sightseeing.


670
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,760
If anyone dares
to tell me that!


671
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,840
Do you mind?


672
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,080
Do you know he's a good guy?


673
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,080
Of course I know it.
What can I do about it?


674
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,640
You were right.


675
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,600
At war, we should always kill
the people before to know them.


676
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,600
Let me sit, Dudu.


677
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,640
Look at the specialist.


678
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,000
You still love that, do you?


679
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,720
I'll never get use to land mines.


680
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,960
I'd like to know who's the moron
who invented them.


681
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,680
Leonardo Da Vinci.


682
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:09,760
I'm lost.


683
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,120
Some marks are gone.
I don't recognise the place.


684
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,120
- No... You'll remember!
- I'm telling you I'm lost!


685
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,920
I'm lost, I can't help it.


686
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,360
There's only one solution.


687
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,000
Get back in our tracks.


688
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,240
And go round the minefield.


689
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,000
Why?


690
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,120
Are you afraid?


691
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,840
Yes.


692
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,160
Thanks.


693
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,840
No...


694
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,520
Don't touch.


695
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,040
How far is the other road?


696
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,920
It's a 120 kms detour.


697
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,280
Let's get back to it.


698
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,600
Don't worry: you'll be in
the hospital in one hour.


699
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,680
And us, under the shower.


700
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,040
Oh shit, I forgot...


701
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,240
What can we do?


702
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,760
We could suggest him for
the Croix de guerre.


703
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,120
Let's go.


704
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,440
How far is El Alamein?


705
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,960
About 15 kms.


706
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,360
Stop.


707
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,160
I have to give an injection,
otherwise he won't be back with us.


708
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,440
What would you do if
you were in my shoes?


709
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,440
What you're gonna do.


710
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,840
Take François to the hospital.


711
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,920
Yes but...


712
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,320
And you?


713
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,480
This situation is so stupid.


714
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,280
You already said he's a good guy.
What's your point, let him go?


715
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,000
No...


716
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,040
But we could think it over...


717
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,840
Just a supposition:
while we drop François at the hospital,


718
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,520
he could get away
from our watch.


719
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,600
It's only a supposition.


720
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,920
What does it mean clearly?


721
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:22,800
It means I'm really fed up of all
those military codes of conduct!


722
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,040
Is that clear like this?


723
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,880
Say, Ludwig...


724
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,960
Yes.


725
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,960
I feel like Dudu is gonna hate you,
he really loathes problems.


726
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,960
My case is not a problem.


727
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,720
To me neither,
but have a look at them!


728
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,880
Dudu forgets the frostbites from Narvik,
the other one the two years


729
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,920
he spent in the pen.
They evolve into the sublime.


730
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,400
But me, I don't forget anything.
I'm the nasty one, the spiteful one.


731
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,480
I don't like being a cuckold.


732
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,800
When I started reading Hegel,
you guys were already on "My kempf".


733
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,680
The French always
are a book too late.


734
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,200
That's why I'll sort good and
bad German later, with a clear head.


735
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:59,240
But as long as my head will be
under a kepi, I'll stick to clichés.


736
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,040
And I see only one for you.


737
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,120
When you have a prisoner,
you keep him.


738
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,240
Exactly. We were five when we left,
we're five to come back.


739
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,520
The account is good.


740
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,160
I don't want to bother you...


741
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,840
but I don't think
you'll stay five for long.


742
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,960
You're in Samuel Goldmann's hands,
a leading expert, so don't speak


743
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,440
of what you don't know.


744
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,960
You'll be on your feet
in one week.


745
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,480
And you'll shag your nurse
in two weeks.


746
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,840
For a start, we'll put you
in a terrific room.


747
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,560
And after?


748
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:32,480
I wanted to be put under
the Arch of Triumph...


749
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,800
Too bad there's already someone.


750
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,640
Send the guy back to his family
wouldn't be a bad idea.


751
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,560
But send him back on the other side
so we can keep on fighting each other,


752
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,080
is it that great?


753
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,120
Shit, a Kraut.
He really has some nerve!


754
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,320
Load it.


755
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,280
