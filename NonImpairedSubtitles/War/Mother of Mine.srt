1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,800
At the beginning of WW II,
Sweden wanted to help -

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,840
<b>its war- torn neighbor Finland
by offering Finnish children -</b>

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,880
temporary homes
with Swedish families.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,960
There were more
than 70,000 "war children".

5
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,040
<b>Mother, do you still remember
how it all began?</b>

6
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,840
<b>Do you still remember
how the war began?</b>

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,880
Eero!

8
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,200
Mother!

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,800
Eero! Eero!

10
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,400
MOTHER OF MINE

11
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,200
You want to talk about the war?
Sure, I remember the war.

12
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,160
Maybe I shouldn't have come?
- Tuomas will pick me up soon.

13
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,880
Who's Tuomas?

14
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
You missed my birthday,
but thanks anyway.

15
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
I was out of town...
- As always. Hi, Tuomas!

16
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,240
Hi, Kirsti. What's up?
- This is my son Eero.

17
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,160
So you're Eero. Tuomas,
from seniors' home help.

18
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
Let's go.
Lots of errands to run.

19
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,680
Were you leaving?
- I guess so.

20
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
When can we talk, Mother?

21
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,560
Lmagine, now he wants
to talk about the war.

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,320
You never wanted to
talk about it before!

23
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,240
I was invited
to a funeral in Sweden.

24
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,840
Signe Jönsson's.

25
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,480
<b>Signe's niece Siv
wrote in the invitation -</b>

26
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,280
<b>that Signe had wanted
me to attend the funeral.</b>

27
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,800
<b>I thought I wouldn't
travel as far as Sweden, -</b>

28
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,400
<b>they were all
strangers to me noW.</b>

29
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,600
<b>But you went.
- Yes.</b>

30
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,360
<b>Do you remember, Mother,
what it was like?</b>

31
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,440
<b>How different everything was
before it all began?</b>

32
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
Go to sleep, dear Eero.

33
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,200
What, are you
being a little girl now?

34
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,000
Nothing's going
to happen to me.

35
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,560
If I see a Russkie, I'll hide in
the bushes, quiet as a mouse.

36
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,560
Soon we'll be
together again.

37
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,880
What if their
bombers attack you?

38
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,040
Then the Finnish fighter planes
shoot them to pieces!

39
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,480
Eero, you'll be the man of
the house. Take care of Mother.

40
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
Understand?

41
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,560
I'll be back soon,
and everything will be as it was.

42
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,640
Let me take that.
- Eero, it's too heavy for you.

43
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,280
Mother?

44
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,720
Mother, you have to eat.

45
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,680
Come on!

46
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,600
We have to seek shelter!

47
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,240
Mother...

48
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,000
Come here if you dare!

49
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,040
Eero...

50
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
Are you crying?

51
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,400
I'm not going!
- Listen, Eero...

52
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,360
I can fix the house,
Dad taught me!

53
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,080
Don't do this to me.

54
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,920
Why do those ladies
get to decide?

55
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,480
Eero Lahti.

56
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,200
Date of birth?
- August 20th, 1934.

57
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,400
Why can't you come, too?

58
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,960
There's no war there
and nothing to be afraid of.

59
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,800
I don't want to!

60
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,160
Eero, remember...

61
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,880
When you miss me there,
I'll miss you here.

62
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,400
I'll always be with you.

63
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,040
It's time.
- Think of it as a vacation.

64
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,960
<b>But... - We'll be together soon,
and everything will be as it was.</b>

65
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,640
Dad said that, too.

66
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,800
<b>They'd promised the girls dolls,
and the boys bikes.</b>

67
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,760
<b>First, they picked the youngest
and then the prettiest girls, -</b>

68
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,880
<b>the ones with
the cutest smile.</b>

69
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,960
<b>Everybody was afraid of
a children's home -</b>

70
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,440
<b>and wanted a Swedish family
to take them in.</b>

71
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,840
<b>Except me.</b>

72
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,080
<b>Finally, they put me on a train,
and I was happy.</b>

73
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,040
<b>I thought they sent me
back to Finland.</b>

74
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,280
<b>I didn't realize the train took
me further away from home.</b>

75
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,680
Hello, my name is Eero Lahti
and I'm from Finland.

76
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,400
Yes, hello.

77
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,600
This is my wife.

78
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,480
This is it.

79
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,320
That's where I work the most.
You can chop wood.

80
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,360
We have a horse.

81
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,880
These are the pigs.
What's "pig" in Finnish?

82
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
She's here, she's here!

83
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,520
I thought they sent a...
Auntie Signe, he's here!

84
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,280
Some other day, alright?
- No!

85
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,760
You don't know
any Swedish, do you?

86
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,920
"Hyvä päivä!" Right?

87
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
Come on. Take off...

88
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,240
Let's take off...

89
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,040
The shoes, the shoes, -

90
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,280
you must take off your shoes, -

91
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
or Mother Signe will be mad!

92
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,920
The kitchen...

93
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,040
<b>This is it.
We have a radio, -</b>

94
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,920
a clock and a Grandpa.

95
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,800
He's sick and can't talk,
but he hears everything you say.

96
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,000
Right, old man?

97
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,400
Don't you want any, Signe?

98
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,920
He has a letter, too.

99
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,920
From the Finnish Children's
Aid Committee.

100
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,600
Look, there's a... word list.

101
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,560
There are a few lines
from the mother.

102
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,840
She says you do know
a little bit of Swedish.

103
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,280
<b>It says here... - My name is
Eero Lahti and I'm from Finland.</b>

104
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,080
Maybe you understand?

105
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,760
He must learn Swedish
if he stays here.

106
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
<b>No- one here
speaks Finnish.</b>

107
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,920
He'll be a good and strong
farm hand, won't he, Grandpa?

108
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
A good farm hand.
You can tend to the geese.

109
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,160
Skane goose.
Can you say that? Geese...

110
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,400
Stupid, they don't have
those words in there.

111
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,680
We're done eating.

112
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,440
Father's going to bed now.
Thank you!

113
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,320
<b>I'll put him in the children's
room. - No, on the kitchen sofa.</b>

114
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,800
Aren't you going to read
the letter? - It's past ten o'clock.

115
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,920
There's always tomorrow.

116
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,480
Hi, Skane geese!
Can you say Skane goose?

117
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,600
You pour this in here.

118
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,600
Get a hold of the bottom.

119
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,600
Spread it evenly,
so they all get some.

120
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,760
This is Eero, so you'll have
to speak Finnish. Say hello.

121
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,240
Hi! Hyvä!

122
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,560
Take off your boots.

123
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,800
Quickly now,
and then you wash your hands.

124
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,800
Let me see your hands.

125
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,320
Turn!

126
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,640
Still dirty.
Wash them again.

127
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,880
You have to
wash your hands properly.

128
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,400
This is not good enough,
they're dirty.

129
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,480
Hold your hands up,
so I can reach them.

130
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,320
Rinse!

131
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,760
You can't go to school
with dirty hands.

132
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,280
<b>School? - Yes,
you're going to school -</b>

133
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,880
if you're staying in Sweden.

134
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,920
I made you lunch,
Hjalmar's taking you to school.

135
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
What?

136
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,600
You're going to school, Hjalmar's
taking you there. Go on now!

137
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,760
I don't understand a word.
You'll learn Swedish at school.

138
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,840
Go on now! Don't fight it!

139
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't understand. Go on!

140
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,120
Get your shoes
and your jacket.

141
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,720
Will you find your way home?

142
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,440
<b>Bye! - Bye! See you!</b>

143
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,400
Stop! Hallo!

144
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,640
I guess you're the war child.

145
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,760
Come on! Welcome.

146
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,200
Your name...

147
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,320
GIRLS

148
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Do you pee sitting down?

149
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,840
Come on, Siv!

150
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,360
Where did you go?
Where are you going?

151
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,720
Will you stay at Auntie Signe's?

152
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,120
My mother feels sorry for you.

153
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,920
<b>She says children
are coming to Sweden -</b>

154
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,200
because their parents died
in the war. Did yours die?

155
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,360
Is Signe going to
be your mother?

156
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,240
Want to come over
to my house?

157
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,240
I have a foal!

158
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Forget it!

159
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,320
<b>Then there was a rumor that
there was peace in Finland -</b>

160
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,960
<b>and those who wanted to and
could were allowed to return.</b>

161
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,520
<b>Then the children wanted to go
home from the strange country.</b>

162
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,600
Is Dad afraid of the Russkies?

163
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
There's a war on,
everybody's afraid.

164
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,120
"The strangers and their
guardians laughed and said:

165
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,280
<b>'Home? You dear,
innocent children, - </b>

166
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,200
do you know how far it is?
More than 100 leagues.'

167
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,800
'We don't care', the children
said, 'as long as we get home.'

168
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,160
'But you have a new home
here with us..."' -Mother.

169
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,880
Is Dad afraid of dying?

170
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,240
I guess, because then
he wouldn't see you anymore.

171
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,880
Are you afraid?

172
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,640
Eero!

173
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
You don't want
to stay here, right?

174
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,960
What? Say something!

175
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,520
You don't want to stay here!

176
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,440
Do you want to go home
to your mother?

177
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,040
I don't like you!
You are mean.

178
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,720
I don't want to be
on vacation anymore.

179
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,520
You should tell that
to you mother.

180
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,800
You don't like...

181
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,440
Mean... you can't
even pronounce it right.

182
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,640
Write that to your mother.
Go on!

183
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,160
You won't have to go to school
or feed the geese, either!

184
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,240
But you must
stay away from the beach!

185
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,480
The pig sty wall is rotten.
I need to buy some timber.

186
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,080
What are you doing?
- I don't understand any of this.

187
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,400
He's obnoxious, he's ungrateful.

188
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,480
He thinks this is a vacation.

189
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,320
Isn't it stupid?

190
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,200
The wall may not stand
another autumn storm.

191
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,000
I'll buy timber in Ystad.
- Sure, go ahead.

192
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,880
Do you have the
Aid Committee's adress?

193
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,840
I'm going to write a letter, too.

194
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,960
Are you alright, love?

195
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,320
What?
Of course I'm alright.

196
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,320
Why?

197
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,000
Hjalmar Jönsson.
- Mrs. Grävnäs.

198
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,560
Welcome. Signe.

199
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,360
So, you want to get rid
of the child.

200
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,280
Well, I...

201
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,320
To tell you the truth... yes.

202
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,560
You've stated that there's
plenty of room for a child -

203
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,960
and that you
have an urge to help...

204
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,560
An urge...

205
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,880
Things don't always
turn out the way you had hoped.

206
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,200
I don't know,
maybe we haven't...

207
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,640
At least he doesn't
want to stay here.

208
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,560
It's not unusual that children
are troublesome first.

209
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,600
They don't always know
what's best for them.

210
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,120
What do you say,
Mr. Jönsson?

211
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,440
<b>Everything's new to the boy,
he's a refugee from the war - </b>

212
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,000
in a strange land,
among strange people.

213
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,160
That's exactly what I mean!

214
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,400
That's no reason to be running
out nights, stealing money...

215
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,080
How are we going
to keep an eye on him?

216
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,640
God knows what he'll do next!
- Signe...

217
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,760
But I can't take it anymore!

218
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,840
What I mean,
Mrs. Grävnäs, is that...

219
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
There's enough work with
the farm and my sick father...

220
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,240
<b>We can give him
food and accommodation, - </b>

221
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,240
but not against his will!

222
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,160
It is important to
the Committee -

223
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,040
that the parents like the child
and vice versa.

224
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,520
Thank God!

225
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,200
Then you'll take him?

226
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,360
<b>Go home! - Dear child,
how could you do that?</b>

227
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,120
Where would you go?
- Home. Mother's waiting.

228
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Don't you know that your Mother
doesn't live there anymore?

229
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,520
Oh yes, I brought
a letter from Eero's mother.

230
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,480
Sending you to Finland
is out of the question.

231
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,960
Where would he go then?

232
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,440
I'm sure the Committee
will find a good solution.

233
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,600
There's room in the children's
homes. - Children's homes?

234
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,120
A children's home can't take
better care of him than we can.

235
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,000
So, shall I take him with me?

236
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,680
There you go.

237
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,640
Skane goose.
- Skane goose.

238
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,480
Can you say "scarecrow"?
- Scare crow.

239
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,840
No, scarecrow.

240
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,040
<b>So, he talks to you,
does he? - Yes.</b>

241
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Good.

242
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,680
He doesn't say a word to me.
Except "Thank you" at the table.

243
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,040
Well, as long as he works
and eats... He's not complaining.

244
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,360
That's good.

245
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,200
You're the one who knows...

246
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,880
It is obvious you two
are getting along.

247
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,920
It'll be fine. The Committee
lady said so, too.

248
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,640
He's doing his best. Give him
time, don't be so hard on...

249
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,200
Hard?

250
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,320
It's not about giving time.

251
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,480
It's not about him!

252
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,720
I can't take this any more!

253
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm just falling apart,
and you can't see a thing!

254
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,720
For heaven's sake, Signe...

255
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,040
You think
everything's alright.

256
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Give Signe another kid,
and everything's fine.

257
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,240
But it isn't.

258
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,400
I don't know that kid.
I don't know who he is!

259
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,280
Just a stranger!

260
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,680
How could I be a good mother
to a child I don't want?

261
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,240
I couldn't even take care
of the one I had!

262
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,040
We've been through this before...
- No!

263
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,640
No, we haven't.
We have not talked about it.

264
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,480
Don't just sit there
like a fool!

265
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,520
What are you staring at?
Talk to me!

266
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,200
What do you expect me to do?

267
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,040
Should I kneel and beg
for forgiveness? Is that it?

268
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,160
Should I vanish, too?

269
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,240
<b>Should I pretend everything's
fine just like you? - Shut up!</b>

270
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,040
Signe, you're the one
making him a stranger. It's you!

271
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,840
Got you some timber.
You're building like a real man!

272
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,880
I guess your father
was a carpenter.

273
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,960
<b>You can sail a raft in the breeze,
but if there's a storm, - </b>

274
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,160
it'll bob up and down like
a piece of cork.

275
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,440
I know the feeling.
Once you've been there...

276
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,800
I've sailed to
France and England.

277
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,960
Let me show you...

278
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,120
That there is from Bordeaux.

279
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,400
The Bay of Biscay is rough
in a storm, wow!

280
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,040
You get seasick.

281
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,440
I was on my way to America
once, but I met Mother Signe -

282
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,240
and my boots
got stuck in this dirt.

283
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,760
Did you and your dad
build things together?

284
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,920
I helped him fix the house.
- I can imagine.

285
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,560
The Russkies bombed it.

286
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,600
They bombed Dad, too.

287
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,520
I wanted to stay home,
I'm not afraid of the Russkies!

288
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,240
When the war's over,
you'll go home again.

289
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,600
I'll pack you
a sack full of food to go.

290
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,840
Let me know when
you're launching the raft.

291
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,560
Don't tell Signe.

292
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,400
Don't tell Signe.

293
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,040
"Dear Signe, -

294
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,600
I hope that you can manage
to take care of my son.

295
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,240
Someone's safe arms
is what he needs.

296
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:08,000
Since my husband died, I've
cried a lot and couldn't cope -

297
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,560
if I didn't know
that Eero is alright..."

298
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,520
How dare she write this
to someone she doesn't know?

299
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,760
Pleading to my conscience?

300
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,240
Isn't it enough that I have to
feel sorry for the kid?

301
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,200
Should I mourn for her, too?

302
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,560
She means well...
- Thanks. There's two of you...

303
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,640
That's good.

304
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,320
God, I'm so tired.

305
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,600
What does the woman write?

306
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,560
She's left the house.

307
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,040
She's working at
the German HQ in Helsinki.

308
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,920
She's rented a room.

309
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,080
She doesn't want Eero
to hear about that.

310
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,400
There! Shouldn't a mother
be honest with her own child?

311
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,000
There's a letter for you, too!

312
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,320
<b>"My dear little son, - </b>

313
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,920
I'm so sad to hear
that you don't like it there.

314
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,480
Don't you think about me.
Think of how lucky you are -

315
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,960
to be able to play and
eat your fill every day.

316
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,560
<b>It'll take longer than I thought
until you get home, - </b>

317
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,280
so try to be a good boy.

318
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,240
Remember, Mother
always loves you."

319
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,560
Try to be a good boy.

320
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,040
Behave and stay
near the farm.

321
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,920
It'll be a while
until you get home.

322
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,120
Think of what's
best for you.

323
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,200
I'm only thinking
of what's best for you.

324
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,080
Stay near the farm...

325
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,640
"These poor children who came
in such a poor state are now, -

326
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,240
thanks to the hospitality
of our Swedish families..."

327
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,040
Listen, it's about you.
- Shut up.

328
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,480
"...regain the life and health
war-torn Finland couldn't give."

329
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,640
<b>"These children are grateful
to their Swedish benefactors - </b>

330
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,880
for their sacrifices
in these times of hardship."

331
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,240
Grateful, it says!

332
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,480
We're good to you,
but you're angry and boring!

333
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,720
They could've sent us
someone nice.

334
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,920
Wait!

335
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,240
I know something
I mustn't tell you!

336
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,680
Look at this nice dress.
It was for you.

337
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,200
What's this?

338
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,360
What are you
doing in here?

339
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,760
At home you can do
as you please, but not here.

340
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,480
You've no business being here.
This isn't your home!

341
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,680
Supper time.

342
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,720
The letter that came
was from your mother.

343
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,400
She sent you her love.

344
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,280
To Mother.

345
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,920
How nice.

346
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,080
What did you write?

347
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,360
<b>I can help Daddy Hjalmar
with the geese, - </b>

348
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,080
Aunt Signe cooks good food,
and I like it here.

349
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,280
You can go to Siv later, after...

350
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,160
You're making
the Finn boy work?

351
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,160
You get off
the shitty work.

352
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,840
Want to help
all the Finnish war children?

353
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,880
Lt'll be Christmas soon.
Will you let the boy rest then?

354
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,680
I'll check the electricity.
- With the geese

355
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,720
Not now! Sit down!

356
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,320
That's the phone now.

357
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,600
Hello?

358
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,720
Yes, it's me.

359
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,200
Yes, he is.

360
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,480
Merry Christmas to you, too.

361
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,600
Eero, it's for you.

362
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,200
Come on, hurry up.

363
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,360
Hurry up now.

364
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,440
<b>Eero, darling.
It's Mother. - Mother!</b>

365
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,600
<b>I miss you so much.
Is everything alright?</b>

366
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,400
<b>Merry Christmas!
Get any nice presents?</b>

367
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,600
Mother! Are you coming here?

368
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,040
<b>I can't talk any longer, I'm at
HQ, but everything's fine.</b>

369
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,080
<b>They say peace will soon come,
and then you can come home.</b>

370
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,720
<b>I'll see you soon!</b>

371
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,560
Mother! Mother?

372
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,520
Roll up your sleeves, like this.
- What?

373
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,000
Whatwhat?

374
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,760
And now...
Whatwhat?

375
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,600
The Russians
have bombed Helsinki!

376
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,200
The Russians
have bombed Helsinki!

377
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,320
<b>The city was badly damaged...
- What are they saying?</b>

378
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,240
<b>...explosions and fires.
Windows were shattered...</b>

379
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,320
<b>What are they saying? - The
Russkies bombed everything.</b>

380
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,960
All of Helsinki?

381
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,400
Have the Russkies
invaded Finland?

382
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,000
<b>The main reason
to the loss of human lives -</b>

383
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,680
<b>was that people didn't seek
shelter. The wounded and dead...</b>

384
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,320
Mother...

385
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,480
It's alright.

386
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,320
Mother...

387
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,920
What is this?

388
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,600
What would your mother
have said if you'd drowned?

389
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,920
How could she survive that?

390
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,560
God almighty!
Sailing to Finland!

391
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,800
Have you gone
completely insane?

392
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,960
I don't want Mother to die.

393
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,360
You did survive,
but I wasn't important to you.

394
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,880
Do you want me to have
a guilty conscience again?

395
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,880
No, Mother!
That's exactly what I don't want!

396
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,760
Why didn't you
ever talk about it?

397
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,000
<b>Often I tried,
but you didn't listen. - Not true.</b>

398
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,040
I would've listened,
I'm your Mother...

399
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,040
You just wanted
everything to be alright.

400
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,000
<b>That's what you wrote me, - </b>

401
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,920
and I never knew
how you were doing.

402
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,080
You were only a child,
you must understand that.

403
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,040
I couldn't burden you
with my worries.

404
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,560
Why didn't you talk
when you came home?

405
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,400
To you?
- Who else?

406
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,280
Don't you understand? You
weren't my Mother anymore.

407
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,480
Give me back my bike!
It's not fun!

408
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,880
Give it to me!

409
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,400
It's not fun, stop!

410
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,080
Thank you.

411
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,520
Is this your mother?

412
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,720
She's so pretty.
- Signe!

413
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,880
Stop running after me!
Go somewhere and play.

414
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,720
Show me the letter.
I want to know.

415
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,080
Goddamn!

416
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,120
Eero, stop.
It's not fun!

417
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,600
Stop! Leave them alone!

418
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,080
Stop! Get out!

419
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,120
What is this? Get out!

420
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,480
Stand still,
so I can talk to you!

421
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,160
What are you doing?

422
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,840
Don't yell at me!

423
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,120
<b>We know now Russia will win,
and that fills us with fear.</b>

424
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,320
<b>Hans-Jürgen, a peaceful man
and no warrior, -</b>

425
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,640
<b>is returning to Germany
and asked me to join him, -</b>

426
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,040
<b>and if it wasn't for Eero,
I'd immediately say yes.</b>

427
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,400
<b>Taking Eero there would be
selfish and wrong, -</b>

428
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,560
<b>as Germany is the least
safe place now.</b>

429
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,320
<b>If I deny my love
and stay here, -</b>

430
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,920
<b>I'm afraid I'll lose all hope. Does
it make me a better mother?</b>

431
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,800
<b>Maybe it was meant to be
that my dear son came to you -</b>

432
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,000
<b>who can give him
all the love he needs.</b>

433
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,720
<b>That's why I'm asking you,
with grief in my heart, -</b>

434
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,080
<b>if Eero could stay with you.</b>

435
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,320
<b>Please, think about it,
but don't tell Eero yet, -</b>

436
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,440
<b>just give him my love
and say everything is alright.</b>

437
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,280
Eero! Come!

438
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,320
We have been talking, -

439
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,640
and there's something
we want to tell you.

440
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,080
Let's take a walk,
you and me.

441
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,320
We had a little girl,
Hjalmar and me.

442
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,880
Her name was Elin.

443
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,400
Elin was so...

444
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:56,800
<b>...full of life.
"Like Signe", they used to say, - </b>

445
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,240
"they're two of a kind,
always happy."

446
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,080
Elin, she... drowned.

447
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,720
She was only six.

448
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,760
<b>Some said it was God's will, - </b>

449
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,760
but it was my fault.

450
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,120
You see,
Elin loved to swim.

451
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,880
She ran so fast, so fast -

452
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,680
that she could hardly strip
before she jumped in.

453
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,760
She wasn't allowed to go
if the wind was too strong.

454
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,800
I used to say to her: "Elin, don't
go if the wind's too strong."

455
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,880
Then there was a storm.

456
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,440
Two years ago.

457
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,480
Elin wanted to go see.

458
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,040
I said I was busy.

459
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,880
<b>She kept asking and asking, - </b>

460
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,520
and finally I let her go alone.

461
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,240
How could I have been
so stupid?

462
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,640
My Dad's dead, too.

463
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,920
Why do people die? Why do
people change all the time?

464
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,840
If you're here, you're here,
I think.

465
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,720
The Lord gives
and the Lord takes away.

466
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,800
You see, life doesn't always
turn out the way you wanted.

467
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:41,880
We don't always understand
why we do the things we do.

468
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,120
Like your mother.

469
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,480
Remember the day when you
first came here on the bus?

470
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,960
<b>I was hoping to get
a little girl, - </b>

471
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,200
as if that were easier.

472
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,160
Then you came.

473
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,160
I didn't want you.

474
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,240
<b>The Lord takes away, - </b>

475
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,880
but He also gives.

476
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,080
We'll hang
your clothes here then.

477
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,440
Come here.

478
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,640
Sir, a little closer
to your wife, please.

479
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,960
Great.

480
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,840
Take your hand
off her shoulder, please.

481
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,000
Smile, please.
It's not a funeral.

482
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,680
Here he comes!

483
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,840
Look at me.

484
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,960
Close your eyes.

485
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,360
Don't look.

486
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,640
Now!

487
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,640
<b>We thought
you needed one, - </b>

488
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,560
so you'll be home faster
when you've been gone.

489
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,280
<b>"Dear Kirsti, - </b>

490
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,720
we have thought about your
proposition about Eero's life.

491
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:14,680
If your love to the German
is that strong, -

492
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,080
I wish you all the best.

493
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,440
I guarantee you that the boy
is like our own now.

494
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,440
<b>Surely, I'm not a better mother
than you would be, - </b>

495
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,760
but I'll do my best to be
the best of mothers."

496
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,400
<b>To agree to this
Finnish proposition -</b>

497
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,760
<b>seems to be in the interests
of Germany, as well.</b>

498
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,520
<b>If the Germans were to comply, -</b>

499
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:00,400
<b>we'd always remember them
as our brothers in arms...</b>

500
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,120
<b>Those damn Germans
will stay put... - Quiet!</b>

501
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,920
The Russkies will take
the whole country. - Quiet!

502
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,760
<b>Citizens! We have taken
the first steps in order -</b>

503
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:18,760
<b>to regain peaceful relations with
our great eastern neighbor.</b>

504
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,160
<b>It's a step towards...</b>

505
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:25,240
<b>We'll have to pack you lots
of food, anyway. - Pack?</b>

506
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,720
Your halcyon days are over.

507
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,280
Stop! Don't say that.

508
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,520
<b>No- one's said
anything like that.</b>

509
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:37,600
Isn't Eero going back
like all the war children?

510
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,400
I guess it's true what they say...

511
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,040
Children should be
where their home is.

512
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,360
I thought Hjalmar liked me.

513
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:09,040
Oh, he does, a lot.

514
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,000
He wants to do
everything by the book.

515
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,480
<b>Does the book say I have to
go home? - Only those who can.</b>

516
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,280
And I can't?

517
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,920
Go to sleep.

518
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,000
School in the morning.

519
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,040
Hjalmar said he would've
gone to America, -

520
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,600
but his boots got stuck
in your dirt.

521
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,400
He said that?

522
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,440
Nonsense.

523
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,280
I want to do that, too.

524
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,440
You'll stay here
with me and Hjalmar.

525
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,400
<b>No- one's going
to take you away from us.</b>

526
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,160
<b>Never? - Never.</b>

527
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,720
I promise.

528
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,920
But don't tell Hjalmar.

529
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,400
Have you explained?

530
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,640
Explained?

531
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,240
What's there to explain?

532
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,480
That the German left her, -

533
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,600
and now it's alright -

534
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,920
for her to have her kid back.
Is that what I must explain?

535
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,880
<b>Good Lord, - </b>

536
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,480
we don't even know
if she is in Helsinki!

537
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,160
You're being unfair.
- Unfair?

538
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,880
Am I being unfair?

539
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,920
What's fair, then?

540
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,680
That she'll be forgiven
and be called a mother, -

541
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,920
a woman who voluntarily
gives away her child?

542
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,320
And I'll just gratefully take it?

543
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,040
First, I lose a child,
then I lose another child.

544
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,080
Is that fair?

545
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,840
We can't help it.
- I'm not going to do it.

546
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,160
I am not going to...

547
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,880
give back our child.

548
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,120
He's not our child.
Don't make him believe that.

549
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:00,560
I'm very good for him,
he needs me!

550
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,880
What if Elin were away
and couldn't come back?

551
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,840
Elin...

552
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,720
Hjalmar, please,
Elin doesn't exist.

553
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,160
She's not coming back to us.

554
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,920
Elin's never ever coming back...

555
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,720
You have to go now, Eero.

556
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,480
Mother! Mother Signe!

557
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,440
Mother Signe!

558
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,520
Let go of me! No!

559
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,200
Eero!

560
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,080
My dear little Eero,
how you've grown!

561
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,000
How was your trip?

562
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,160
Let's go home.

563
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,120
They called me again
to come to the office.

564
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,040
I'm sure I'll get the job.

565
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,800
Don't you think?

566
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,960
Does a Kirsti Lahti live here?

567
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,880
Sender: Signe Jönsson
Sweden

568
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,840
No.

569
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,000
Are you sure?

570
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,160
Who was it?

571
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,200
Eero...

572
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,320
All the bad things are over.

573
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,480
Mother's here with you.

574
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,200
I could never believe
what you said.

575
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:40,080
I thought you'd disappear
at any moment.

576
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,480
<b>I felt - </b>

577
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,240
I could lose everything -

578
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,120
at any moment.

579
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:02,000
<b>This, or these - </b>

580
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,480
Signe wanted to give me.

581
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,640
<b>She'd always hoped
I'd get them.</b>

582
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,560
<b>Or we.</b>

583
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,960
<b>They came with
the funeral invitation.</b>

584
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,600
<b>I couldn't open them...</b>

585
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:29,960
<b>Until I got there.</b>

586
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:54,240
"Dear Kirsti. Life on the farm
is empty without Eero.

587
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,800
Sending him away was hard, and
I damned you for you decision.

588
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,640
To tell you the truth,
I didn't believe you loved him.

589
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,160
Eero never knew
that you wanted him back.

590
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,320
I realize now that
this was wrong of me.

591
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:25,480
Please, Kirsti, let him read
this letter, so he will know.

592
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:30,240
He must know. Signe."

593
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,280
"Dear Signe.

594
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,600
There's peace now in Finland,
which is a huge relief to us all.

I must've been
blind and insane.

How could I even consider
leaving my own child?

600

I may have to carry this
guilt for the rest of my life.

601
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:31,320
But I ask of you, thankful

That's where I decided

But you did.

609
