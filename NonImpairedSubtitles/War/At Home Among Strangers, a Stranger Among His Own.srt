00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,756
A big boat for his grandkids
our forefather decided to build.

4
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,436
He had been building it all his
life.

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,278
But that forefather of ours had
no time to finish it,

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,278
leaving it to our grandfather.

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,874
We had been waiting for that
boat in vain...

8
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,197
Victory!

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,358
A big boat for his grandkids
our father decided to finish.

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,870
He had been building it all his
life.

11
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,278
We had been dreaming, my friend,
of circling the world

12
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,438
in that boat.

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,033
But our dreams had been shattered,
dreams shattered...

14
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,669
And we started to build a tall ship.

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,597
Victory!

16
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,674
Equality!

17
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,878
Brotherhood!

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,871
Peace! Peace!

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,115
Victory!

20
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,111
There will come the day, my son,
when you wake up at dawn

21
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,869
on a ship,

22
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,678
and stand firmly on the deck,
facing the ocean of life.

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,189
And embodied in you will be
all our dreams, our dreams...

24
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,359
The grandfather's boat has grown
into a ship.

25
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,871
There it is sailing free,
our pride,

26
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,275
not fearful of any storm.

27
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,677
Be worthy, my son,

28
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,359
of accepting our banner
in fond memory

29
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,437
and with a reliable hand.

30
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,876
And take along on yourjourney
my faith,

31
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,270
your fortune and the future world!

32
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,435
It will come!

33
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,359
It will be here for all mankind!

34
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,197

The song performed by

50
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,279
...Sixty three, sixty four,

51
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,679
sixty five, sixty six,
sixty seven...

52
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,518
Sixty seven.
You're really nervous.

53
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,349
What are you all doing here?
Is there nothing else to do?

54
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,872
I get tired just thinking of
all the work there's to do.

55
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,676
Our work is just peanuts.
Zabelin's got the real work.

56
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,876
Like what?

57
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,038
Just keep away from his saber.

58
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,596
Let him learn.
Enough of saber-rattling.

59
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,078
I think we may need swords yet.

60
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,591
It would make it much easier if we
could see the enemy's face.

61
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,356
But when it's like that, it's hard,
guys.

62
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,875
For renting the grain warehouse,
we made a deposit of 50 rubles.

63
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,110
Besides, we've got a bill
for the purchase of forage.

64
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,110
Here, the oats for a total of
700 rubles and 90 kopecks,

65
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,030
and the hay comes to
120 rubles and 10 kopecks.

66
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,199
And then there's also a bill
from the insurance fund.

67
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,870
We have paid 700 rubles

68
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,755
and 14 rubles 20 kopecks penalty
for being tardy.

69
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,958
Sorry, I meant 18 kopecks.

70
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,756
I feel like I'm being buried
in this pile of accounts!

71
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,510
That's some job
for a cavalry officer!

72
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,679
Why are you looking at me
like that, old man?

73
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,276
Debit-credit, balance-galance!

74
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,515
I can't stand it any more!

75
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
- Mylnikov, Ishlanov wants you.
- Coming.

76
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,116
- Good morning.
- Hi!

77
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,432
To all Regional Party Committees!

78
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,598
Thousands of our citizens are
dying and require our help.

79
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,758
The League of Nations has refused
assistance to the starving Russia...

80
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,434
Food will only be delivered
against payment in gold.

81
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,598
I therefore direct that
all confiscated gold and valuables

82
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,758
be sent immediately
to Moscow.

83
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,797
Dzerzhinsky,
Chairman of the Cheka.

84
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,870
What can you expect? The League
of Nations...

85
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,198
- How much did we confiscate?
- In gold, 526 thousand.

86
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,198
We have to ship it to Moscow,
but how?

87
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,277
What can I do? We've got one
armored car, two machine guns.

88
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,759
And fifty men. Not enough?
But it's all we've got.

89
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,037
We know. Brylov's band
has been reported in the area.

90
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,117
Thanks, Tamara.

91
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,880
- We'll send Grunko, Dmitriev...
- Lemekh.

92
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,038
And Yegor Shilov. They'll be
held personally responsible.

93
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,039
Send me along. You've got
to let me go.

94
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,676
Grunko, Dmitriev,
Lemekh and Yegor Shilov.

95
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,435
They'll be the only ones to be
told that they're carrying gold.

96
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,596
Yegor can handle this right.

97
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,349
This past spring, the band of
Ataman Soloveyko was wiped out.

98
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,509
During the operation, a Cossack
officer, Fyodor Shilov, was killed.

99
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,032
As we discovered later, he was
the brother of Yegor Shilov.

100
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,876
Well, so what?

101
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,870
We'll be shipping a treasure.
We can't take any chances.

102
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,036
So I'm against Shilov.

103
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,357
Explain the joke to me,
will you, Lipyagin?

104
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,677
Shilov fought for three years
in my battalion alongside of me!

105
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,878
Yegor has nothing in common
with his brother.

106
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,029
A war record
can'tjustify everything.

107
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,756
I don't know.
Maybe, I'm wrong.

108
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,438
What do you think,
Comrade Kungurov?

109
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,270
Well, what do you want me to say?
We all have to decide.

110
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,591
Many relatives fought against each
other. Sons, fathers, brothers...

111
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,029
That's how a revolution is.

112
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,879
As for Yegor Shilov, he is...

113
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,270
He's one of us and I will vouch
for him.

114
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,279
I suggest we vote on all
the candidates together.

115
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,600
In favor? Opposed? Abstentions?

116
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,871
The day after tomorrow, on the 17th,
there's a train to Moscow.

117
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,868
We're going to attach the armored
car to it.

118
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,118
- No!
- No what?

119
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,109
I'm giving up cigarettes.
I can feel my heart pounding.

120
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,870
So, Kolia's become quite
abstemious.

121
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,039
Take my place, and I'll see
what you're going to become.

122
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,191
Suppose we switch? You take over
the accounts, I'll fight the Whites.

123
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,673
Your cartridge belt.

124
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,598
You'll escort the gold to Moscow
on the seventeenth, at 6:30 p.m.

125
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,872
I suggest you get lots of sleep
before that.

126
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,799
And try not to leave your home.

127
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,198
You'll be personally responsible
for the gold and valuables.

128
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,358
- Any questions?
- No.

129
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,350
You've got a difficult assignment,
Yegor. You'll be in charge.

130
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,718
- What's funny?
- Everything will be fine, Nikolai.

131
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:24,193
Farewell dear heart, adieu my joy.

132
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,189
You go away and leave me behind...

133
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,029
Listen, I didn't vote for you.

134
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,871
Getting old, I guess.
Nerves aren't holding out.

135
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,269
I'll stay alone till you return.

136
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,270
Farewell, I'll never see you again.

137
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,348
I swear no other girl will ever
tempt me.

138
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:11,877
You're the only joy of my life,
and yet I must say farewell to you.

139
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,191
- He'll be here any minute.
- Good.

140
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,875
There's everything you need.
Keep him asleep till I tell you.

141
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,675
- And the needle?
- I said everything you need.

142
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,198
But I don't see the reason for
doing that.

143
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,188
After the operation he could
leave the Cheka for good.

144
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,751
Just do yourjob, Fannyackov.

145
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,200
Stop it. My name is Vanyukin.

146
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,356
Fannyackov.

147
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,353
I'll do everything just right,
I assure you.

148
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,348
- Mitka, Shilov's been killed!
- I know. I'm coming!

149
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,269
I'm through here. His whole body
is covered with traces of torture.

150
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,277
His face was disfigured
beyond recognition.

151
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,677
He was killed by two bullets
in the neck.

152
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,037
Take him away. You can go.

153
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,074
Sasha!

154
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,194
All right, Vassily Antonovich,
I'm going.

155
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,678
Well?

156
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,516
I don't know, I can't...

157
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,874
Is the gold in the safe?
Have you checked it? Then do it!

158
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,033
Stepan, go to the Cheka. Send for
Grunko, Dmitriev, Lemekh.

159
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,437
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.

160
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,949
You're going in Shilov's place.

161
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,279
What's wrong with you? It's not
the first death you've seen.

162
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,598
I can't go on doing this work.

163
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,595
Send me to the army or to industry.

164
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,271
To let a man like you go into
a factory? Just forget that!

165
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,869
I won't let you, I...

166
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,515
The gold will be shipped out today,
and without any army escort.

167
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,110
The armored car will stay in
the station. In view of everyone.

168
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,680
Let those who murdered Shilov
think we've postponed the shipment.

169
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,357
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- I do.

170
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,518
Go to the station now and see
that it's arranged.

171
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,598
This is how it should have been
done from the start.

172
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,199
No noise, no escort.
Yegor might still be alive.

173
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,957
My heart is trying to tell me
something.

174
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,280
- I'm nervous and worried.
- It's all those cigarettes.

175
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,876
I'm going to quit.

176
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,878
- Are the boys asleep?
- Yes.

177
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,516
- The compartments all locked?
- All locked.

178
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,349
And there're no profiteers on
the roof either.

179
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,039
We're traveling first class.

180
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,951
- Lebedev, do you use lipstick?
- Sure I do. Take it easy.

181
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,755
Each to his own taste.

182
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,438
Gentlemen, the train!

183
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,949
- Everything ready? The semaphore?
- Yes.

184
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,869
- Don't move from the switch.
- Got it.

185
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:19,269
The operation must take 4 minutes,
or we'll all go off the bridge.

186
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,029
The signal is the white tower.
And make sure of one thing...

187
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,275
I haven't finished yet, Captain.

188
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,948
There's no need to explain
anything, Staff-captain.

189
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,755
It stinks of cologne in there
like in a soldiers' whorehouse.

190
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,678
- Well, now?
- The train's slowing down here.

191
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,673
Let's go!

192
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,870
- What're you waiting for?
- Here I go.

193
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,231
A red signal! There's never
been a stop here!

194
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,028
Grab the bag! Move!

195
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,596
Jump!

196
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,878
- The bag!
- I've got it!

197
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,759
It all went well. Just right.
Thank you.

198
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,676
I gave him three ampules.
He's been out all the time.

199
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,118
Let him go? I got it, I got it...

200
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,278
Yes, I see...

201
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,472
Thank you. Thank you.

202
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,995
If you want me to let him go,
go he will.

203
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,510
Bandits! Jesus!
What shall we do?

204
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,508
Everyone out of the car! Move!

205
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,518
Or I'll shoot!

206
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,356
What are you doing?

207
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,354
Get away!

208
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,869
Don't touch it!

209
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,878
Lemke!

210
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,870
He locked us in.

211
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,270
My name is Guivi, darling.

212
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,429
- This is no time for games, dear.
- That's it, friend.

213
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,030
That's that.

214
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,597
Where is it?

215
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,272
Good God! Gone!

216
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,196
I want to join you.

217
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,676
- Who are you?
- Captain Lemke.

218
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,512
Where were you going?

219
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,518
I've been wandering since Chita.
I want to fight the Reds.

220
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,869
It isn't worthwhile,
fighting the Reds.

221
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,199
Especially with today's booty,
wouldn't you say?

222
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,879
Today's loot isn't much, you know.
Just some junk.

223
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,878
Hey, move along, move along!

224
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,029
- I would like to...
- All right, hop on, help yourself.

225
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,108
Klava! They killed Stepan!

226
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,516
It happened between Kedrovka
and Berezovaya, we think.

227
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,676
Brylov has disappeared.

228
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,754
We don't know what happened
to Lipyagin and his comrades.

229
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,676
- Andrei Timofeyevich!
- Lay off, or you're a dead man!

230
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,673
You must sign those bills!
I've been waiting five days!

231
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,878
What are you waiting for?
Come here!

232
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,669
We must send an expeditionary
force, or Brylov'll escape again.

233
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,878
What are you doing?
Half a million stolen!

234
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,356
Yegor and Lipyagin have been
murdered, and you stand around?

235
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,877
Alyokhin, start her up!

236
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,514
Cool down, Andrei.

237
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,672
Calm down.

238
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,676
There must be something behind
this. I mean Shilov and his brother.

239
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,276
Yes, something's wrong here,
Vassily Antonovich.

240
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,596
Shilov is dead!

241
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,878
Loosen the girths before
the horse starts eating.

242
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,876
It's just me, don't get scared.

243
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,272
You know, I don't trust you.

244
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,876
Don't trust you at all.

245
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,958
- Why not?
- I don't really know.

246
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,676
Listen, Brylov!

247
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:44,271
Suppose plenty of money fell into
your hands? Say, 500,000 in gold.

248
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,115
What would you do?

249
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,873
Don't take your eyes off him for
a second. Or I'll tear your ears off.

250
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,879
I don't understand how it is
possible

251
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,038
not to remember anything at all.

252
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,189
- Had you been drinking?
- I didn't drink.

253
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,675
- Then how did you end up there?
- Andrei, stay out of this!

254
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,515
Let's see, Yegor...

255
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,357
Where are your documents?
Your party card?

256
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,196
I don't know.

257
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,040
I can't remember anything.

258
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,596
Not a thing!

259
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,870
- Where the hell was he...
- Andrei! Calm down!

260
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,280
All right, let's start again
from the very beginning.

261
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,030
- You had come back home...
- Yes, I had come back.

262
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,277
- Where was your revolver?
- Under my pillow, as usual.

263
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,189
Here, take mine. Put it
under the pillow and sit down.

264
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,356
We'll try to reconstruct it.

265
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,670
No, guys, I can't remember
anything. Even if you kill me.

266
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,435
You've already been killed once,
and they put somebody else's body!

267
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,872
And then Lipyagin was murdered,
and Dmitriev, Lemekh and Grunko!

268
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,038
Because of you! The gold's
been stolen because of you, too!

269
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,869
You're all crazy
to listen to his lies!

270
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,869
The Whites knew when the train was
leaving and that the gold was on it.

271
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,276
How did they find out?

272
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,198
And you... you think that I...

273
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,517
But you don't remember anything.
You could babble while being drunk.

274
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,871
I didn't have a drop to drink!

275
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,436
- Then where were you three days?
- Listen to me, for God's sake!

276
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,200
Nikolai, get him out of here.

277
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,028
What are you doing to me, guys?

278
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,189
Itjust isn't right, isn't right.

279
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,794
Come on, we need
to find out the truth.

280
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,878
What? The truth?

281
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,957
What about me?

282
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,880
You think I don't want the truth?

283
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,869
Only you? You...

284
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,029
Stop! Stop the car!

285
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,358
- He's taking the cattle to the station?
- Yes, sending it to the starving.

286
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,200
Ho ho ho! Move along!

287
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,036
I have to get out a minute.

288
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,595
- To do what?
- I have to go.

289
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,872
- Why didn't you do it before?
- I didn't need to then.

290
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,038
You can't. Hold it back.

291
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,276
All right, keep moving!

292
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,869
- Look at those authorities!
- Forget it, come on.

293
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,515
- Look, I can't hold it any more.
- What d'you want me to do?

294
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,678
Sergei, stop, please!

295
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,356
Come on, don't humiliate me.
I can't hold back any longer.

296
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:59,269
- Alyoshin, come with me.
- Alright, but you'll have to hurry.

297
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,879
I'll hurry.

298
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,673
- Where're you going?
- I can't do it in the street...

299
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,276
Hey, stop!

300
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,436
I'm sorry, Alyoshin,
but there's no other way.

301
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,516
They're going to shoot me today,
and I have to find out the truth.

302
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,120
I won't believe it!

303
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,869
It can't be true!
No, it isn't true.

304
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,278
I'm back.

305
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,030
- Hello.
- And hello to you.

306
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,199
Well? Shall we talk?

307
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,276
Yes, sir.

308
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,517
Who is it?

309
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,516
Who are you?

310
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,316
Why are you staring like that?

311
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,279
- Who are you?
- Shilov, Yegor Petrovich.

312
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,678
- You in the Cheka?
- Yes, I'm in the Cheka.

313
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,949
It's not fair, Shourik.

314
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,598
It's a pretty mean thing to do.
Let's take a ride.

315
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,878
I don't like what you did.

316
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:55,872
I collected the gold, it was mine,
and you took it all for yourself.

317
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,037
That isn't right to cheat your
elders.

318
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,953
Five hundred thousand
that you took on the train.

319
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,438
It was you who robbed the train,
wasn't it?

320
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,039
I did all the work,
and you don't want to share.

321
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,196
It isn't right, Shourik. Itjust
isn't right!

322
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,275
Ah, Lemke, Lemke...

323
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:45,511
You know, if you're lying,
you'll regret it. Let's go!

324
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,278
Let's get back!

325
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:52,271
So that's your game? The gold
is in the band, and you keep mum?

326
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,195
You wanted to have it all for
yourself, didn't you?

327
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,198
You bastard, what the hell
are you doing here?

328
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,869
That's for the "bastard"!

329
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,518
- Where is the gold?
- Somewhere around here.

330
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,676
- You've got a spy in the Cheka?
- Yes.

331
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,878
- What's his name?
- To hell with you, you Red dog!

332
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,996
That's for the "Red dog"!

333
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,869
Idiot...

334
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,278
What's his name?

335
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,877
Say "please".

336
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,758
I'll kill you, bastard.

337
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,953
No, you won't. You are going
to take good care of me,

338
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:58,439
because only I know
who is our man in the Cheka.

339
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,598
Well, that's some company
we've got.

340
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,512
Now listen!

341
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,758
That's all your own business.

342
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:35,031
As for the gold,
not a word about it, get it?

343
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,350
If my boys get wind of it,
there might be trouble.

344
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,518
We don't want it,
don't you agree?

345
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,030
Calm down, Vanyukin.
Tell us all about it in good order.

346
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,676
All right. But I don't know who
the chief is. I never saw him.

347
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,354
Only the officers saw him, not me.

348
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,516
Then how did you get your orders?

349
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,515
On the telephone.
Yes, that's how it was...

350
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,678
Or sometimes through the officers.
But they're all dead.

351
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,434
Or maybe the bandits
captured them?

352
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,598
In that case, someone might
still get in touch with you?

353
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,880
What narcotic
was it that you gave Shilov?

354
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:30,030
I don't know about drugs. They
brought some ampules and a needle.

355
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,674
What kind of narcotic was it?

356
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,354
They gave me the needle and
the doses.

357
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,189
Vanyukin, do you realize that
you've got no choice?

358
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,109
I came here voluntarily. Comrade
Shilov told me to, and I did.

359
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,871
In the morning you'll wait at the
station for the officers to show up.

360
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,516
Then you'll report to us.
And make no mistake.

361
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,278
You can count on me.

362
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,677
- Everything understood?
- Very well understood.

363
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,592
Take him away!

364
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,876
Yes, I'll be going now.
Excuse me...

365
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:15,350
Well, Andrei, I think that now
we need your talent.

366
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,435
- Uncle Andrei, take me along!
- No, you can't go.

367
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,596
Alexei, have the squadron stand by!

368
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,876
Squadron, fall in!

369
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,598
- Katya!
- Andrei!

370
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,668
Fare thee well, dear girl of mine,
You'll stay behind till I come back...

371
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,277
- Why your saber on the right side?
- You know I'm left-handed.

372
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,675
We must follow the regulations.

373
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,515
- Why are you so stern?
- I've lost my cigarette holder.

374
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,280
- It's time to get going.
- All right.

375
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,674
Father...

376
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,594
Vanya, come here!
You can see better from here!

377
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,835
Good morning. How are you,
Comrades?

378
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,868
Squadron! Attention!

379
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,513
Good luck!

380
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,872
Warriors!
Heroic soldiers of the revolution!

381
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,277
Undefeated remnants of the enemy
still lurk in dark corners!

382
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,519
The serpents of treason await the
moment to get at our throats!

383
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,956
Our revolutionary fatherland is
in danger!

384
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:16,871
The fiendish enemy is still hoping
to turn back the clock!

385
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,596
But our forces are vigilant!

386
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:26,035
We will defeat the traitors,
though it costs our lives,

387
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,879
because the peasants and workers
are always victorious!

388
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,276
Squadron!

389
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:42,669
At the trot! Forward march!

390
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,116
What's the matter?

391
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,198
What is it?

392
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,358
Vanyukin was found murdered
in his cell.

393
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,436
I've questioned the guards.
No one came in but our own people.

394
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,353
Who?

395
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,118
Who of our people?

396
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,674
I was there.
Had tea with the chief guard.

397
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,874
- Kolia! What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me.

398
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,268
When the murderer came in,
Vanyukin probably woke and got up.

399
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,438
The murderer stunned him with
a blow.

400
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,200
There's a hematoma
on the right cheek.

401
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,358
- Then he was stabbed.
- You may go.

402
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,956
Thank you, Grigory
Christoforovich.

403
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,876
Damn this whole rotten business!

404
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,759
The right cheek...

405
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,275
Catch!

406
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,118
- What's that?
- Nothing.

407
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,674
I found this in Vanyukin's cell.

408
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,196
That's Zabelin's.

409
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,279
The devil!

410
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,880
- Is this yours?
- Mine.

411
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,869
And the gold? Where's it?

412
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,275
You show me. Hurry!

413
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:09,192
I have pity the horse. Bey no good.

414
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:14,520
- Your father is a Bey?
- What? He ain't Bey!

415
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:20,199
Kaioum want get married.
No money pay dowry for girl!

416
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,598
My father old.
My mother she old.

417
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,510
House so old.
All rain coming in house.

418
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,678
Kaioum so poor, not have coat.

419
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,677
Every jackal has great coat.
Kaioum have no coat whole year.

420
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,278
Horse! Horse was sick!

421
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:53,431
I not run far away!
I sorry for horse!

422
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,677
That's enough!
Where's the gold?

423
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,518
Here is gold. Take, jackal!

424
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,870
Put it back for now.

425
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,756
You fool!

426
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:44,119
Swim toward the shore!
Let the current push you!

427
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,877
- Grab me!
- Don't want!

428
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,036
Hold on, dammit!

429
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,277
Let go! I don't want!

430
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:20,030
Who gave you this skinhead?
There's nothing to get hold of.

431
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,872
No! Let me drown!

432
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,872
What if I hadn't been able to swim?
You'd have drowned, you dimwit!

433
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:48,040
Why not let me drown?
Then all gold only for you.

434
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,357
For you, for you! Is that all
you know how to say?

435
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:57,112
The Bey you say is bad, and all
you want is to be one someday.

436
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,278
Then you'd beat your tenants
like your Bey did. You would.

437
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,273
You see, brother, it's Marxism,
that's what teaches us how to act.

438
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,598
How you know I take gold? Ah?

439
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,516
That chain was from the bag.

440
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,679
Did you know you're starting
to grow horns, on top of your head?

441
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,598
All those who steal from
their brothers, the poor,

442
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,437
will end up with horns on top
of their heads!

443
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,513
You understand?

444
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:47,428
It's rotten, friend,
to steal from your brothers.

445
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:55,155
You save my life.
Now you my brother.

446
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,269
- Give me back my blanket.
- I didn't take it.

447
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,675
Did you find the gold?

448
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,195
You drink too much!

449
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,869
They're fifteen miles from here,
Excellency. Maybe less...

450
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,038
In any case,
we must be very cautious...

451
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,196
Near the village of Rossokhi.

452
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:32,509
A squadron of about 300 men.

453
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,876
They have machine-guns
mounted on wagons.

454
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,357
I can't really vouch for it,
there're no guarantees.

455
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,109
If they press us down to the river,
we won't stand a chance.

456
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:55,516
Not a chance!

457
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,678
If they catch us backed up at
the stream, not a chance.

458
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,195
Go get the horses ready, you hear?

459
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,032
What the hell is there to joke
about? You want us all exterminated?

460
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,190
You know, Lemke, I think it's time
to cut the commissars' guts out.

461
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,039
And then it's your turn.

462
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,356
Semyon, when are you going
to give me a haircut?

463
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:59,108
- Have you seen the captain?
- No.

464
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:04,872
Where's he gotten to?
Captain! Captain Lemke!

465
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:13,589
I have a cold. I can't breathe
as long as you keep my mouth shut.

466
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,270
And I tell you once more,
I think you're really dumb.

467
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:24,508
You may kill me, but still I won't
give you the name of our agent.

468
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,870
Not unless we share the gold.

469
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,356
Be reasonable, Shilov, come on!

470
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,519
Split the gold. One half for each,
more money than we've ever seen.

471
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:49,199
Have you ever even had
as much as five rubles in your hand?

472
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,437
You haven't. And now, 250,000.

473
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,436
Can't you get it through your head?

474
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,516
Devil! Jackal!

475
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,036
It wasn't my fault!

476
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,959
- What's wrong?
- Kill him!

477
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,039
He know about gold.
He tell Brylov.

478
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,516
Excellency take it... Run away...
Leave band...

479
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,517
It wasn't my fault!
He beat me!

480
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,877
- Where did he go?
- Toward the bridge.

481
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,356
- When?
- At sunset.

482
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,516
Then he has a five hours' start.

483
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,196
Down the river!

484
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,118
We need raft, Commander!
We need a tree!

485
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,278
Quick we catch him, Commander!

486
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,759
Oh, how he fooled you...
Hurray for Brylov!

487
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,518
He said he would take me along...
He beat me... It's not my fault!

488
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:17,874
We'll trap them at the ford and cut
them down with the machine-guns.

489
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,674
- What time is it?
- It's still too early.

490
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,118
No, it's time!

491
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,756
And here we go!

492
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,870
Squadron! Fall in!

493
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,869
Watch out! Hold her steady!
Hang on tight!

494
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,949
There's Brylov saying hello to you.

495
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,118
We got him, Kaioum!
Push ashore now!

496
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,870
The devil... All right...

497
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,599
Kaioum, go ahead with the gun.
Cover me.

498
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,871
- Sun in eyes. I cannot see.
- Here, I'll take the gun.

499
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,429
Leave me alone, it's all your show.
I'll stay neutral.

500
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,518
You fight and I'll wait.

501
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,678
You won't have long to wait,
Captain. It'll be ended soon.

502
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,599
You circle around to the right, I'll
draw their attention to the cliff.

503
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,358
I hope you kill each other,
the sooner the better.

504
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:45,190
- Stay here!
- You idiot!

505
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,672
Shilov!

506
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,276
- I can no help you, Shilov.
- I'm stuck.

507
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,438
I can no more... I try...

508
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,435
Ah, that's the end.

509
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,592
That's the end!

510
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:50,678
- Well, that's the end?
- Where are you going? Get back!

511
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,438
What are you doing? Get back,
I said!

512
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,029
- What?
- Get back.

513
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:08,677
You dog!
Untie my hands, quick!

514
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,870
Damn you!

515
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,437
I risked my life for that gold
a hundred times.

516
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:22,192
And you want to take it?
Bastard! You son of a bitch!

517
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,517
Throw that toy away, idiot!

518
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,109
Or I'll kick your teeth in!

519
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,759
Kill him, Shilov!

520
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,279
You got him! My dear man!

521
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,872
- You going to carry me on your back?
- I'll carry you.

522
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,188
Too bad Brylov didn't kill me.

523
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,594
That would've spoiled your show.

524
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,680
Listen, Shilov, show me the gold.
I've been after it for so long.

525
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:10,510
Tell me, what are you going to do
with it? I'd like to know that.

526
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:15,589
Give it back to your side,
and what's next?

527
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:22,512
They'll shoot you all the same.
Do you understand that?

528
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,679
The border is close, it's right
there!

529
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:30,869
Cross it, don't be an idiot!

530
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,679
The gold won't last a minute if it's
for everybody, you get it?

531
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:42,268
You get this chance only once.
Never again!

532
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,869
Can't you understand? Once
in a lifetime!

533
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,516
Holy Father...

534
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:04,032
Lord, why do you help this idiot,
and not me?

535
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:10,589
Because you're too greedy.
And even God teaches us to share.

536
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:18,031
Now pipe down,
I need a rest.

537
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,231
I'll have to carry you
on my back yet.

538
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,039
Catch!

539
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:00,119
- You did it with your left hand.
- So what? I'm left-handed.

540
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,676
That gold was stolen by some
members of your underground group.

541
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,879
You kidnapped Shilov and
substituted a railroad man's body.

542
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,870
That's a good one!
You're kidding?

543
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:23,358
All right, I'll play along with you.
You have nothing better to do?

544
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,516
What clowns you are!

545
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,952
But Shilov forced your liaison man
to give himself up.

546
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:36,948
Then you killed Vanyukin and put
Zabelin's cigarette holder in his cell.

547
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,116
Here, Andrei, you lost this!

548
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,357
We would've swallowed your bait,
if it hadn't been for your left hand.

549
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,439
- You're left-handed, aren't you?
- Yes, I'm left-handed...

550
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,438
First you hit Vanyukin with your
left hand, then you stabbed him.

551
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,200
- Didn't you?
- Sure, I killed everybody.

552
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,279
I stabbed everybody.
But hasn't this gone far enough?

553
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,359
Even for a joke?
Everybody knows me, Nikodimov.

554
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,439
The real Nikodimov was killed
on his way here from Omsk.

555
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,598
His wife can testify to that.

556
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:21,270
That's bullshit.
Nikodimov has no wife.

557
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:25,439
So you thought. Your men
were supposed to kill her.

558
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,598
But, luckily, she survived.
That's something you didn't know.

559
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,515
What a bunch of clowns you are!

560
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:46,348
Farewell dear heart, adieu my joy,

561
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:53,271
You go away and leave me behind.

562
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:01,669
I'll stay alone till you return...

563
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,276
What's wrong?

564
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,276
They didn't believe me.

565
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,676
They think I'm a traitor.

566
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,438
You lousy Rothschild!

567
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,869
Lemke! Lemke!

568
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,276
Captain!

569
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,951
Why are you standing? Go away!

570
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,514
Let me die.

571
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,357
I ask you as a man and a soldier.

572
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,872
- What about the prisoners?
- Escort them to HQ.

573
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,115
- Go on, I'll catch up with you.
- All right.

574
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,196
Squadron! Fall in!

575
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,757
Shilov's gone! Brylov's gone!
And the gold's gone!

576
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,880
It's my fault, Dmitry Petrovich.

577
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,874
I initiated the shipping of gold.

578
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,275
And I will have
to answer for my actions

579
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:40,596
before whatever superior
authorities the Party decides.

580
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,036
And Yegor...

581
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,758
There must be a village...

582
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,119
or a place to get water...

583
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,275
Hey... Brothers...

584
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,516
The End
