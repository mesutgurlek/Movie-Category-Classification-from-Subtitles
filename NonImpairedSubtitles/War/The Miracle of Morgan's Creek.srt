1
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:12,948
- Hey, Doctor!
- I'm not a doctor. He's upstairs.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,121
Hold the presses! Hold everything!
Hold it! Get me the state capital.

3
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:19,222
I've got to talk to the Governor immediately!

4
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:21,290
It's a matter of life and death.

5
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:15,052
- Hello. Mr. Governor?
- Yeah.

6
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:20,316
The editor of what? <i>The Bugle?</i> Yeah.

7
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:24,955
What town was that again? Morgan's Creek?

8
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:28,595
Is that in my state? Never heard of it.

9
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:29,929
You never heard of it?

10
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:31,903
By tomorrow morning,
Morgan's Creek will be...

11
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:33,769
- the most famous town in America.
- The world!

12
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:36,900
This is the last free phone in town.
Every room has been reserved...

13
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,205
- for 15 miles around.
- Thirty!

14
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:41,111
A 100 newspapermen are here
and 500 more are expected tomorrow.

15
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,170
A thousand.

16
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,183
- There's a shortage of food, telephones...
- Milk.

17
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,275
- Telegraph wires!
- Liquor.

18
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:47,377
- Transportation, policemen and everything.
- Tents.

19
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:51,049
We need a lot of help or they're going
to tear this town up by the roots.

20
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:52,489
We need state police...

21
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,050
- <i>food, water, beds, blankets.</i>
- <i>Plumbing!</i>

22
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:57,995
Wait a minute. Take it easy, will you?
What happened down there?

23
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:00,191
You got a flood or did you strike oil
or something?

24
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,633
- "Did we strike oil or something?"
- Tell him!

25
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:05,830
- No, Mr. Governor, we did not strike oil.
- Anybody can strike oil.

26
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:08,340
- We have not got a flood.
- Anybody can have a flood.

27
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:11,900
- What we've got, Mr. Governor, is...
- You got what?

28
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:13,605
- Yes, Mr. Governor.
- Shut up! Not you.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,875
Are you sure of your facts?
This is important.

30
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:17,473
I wish I could be down there myself.

31
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:21,385
This is a matter of state policy,
state pride, national pride.

32
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:24,913
Hold the wire a minute. Get on this line,
take everything down in shorthand.

33
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,960
Get a map of the state.
Make sure that Morgan's Creek is in it.

34
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,690
If it ain't, maybe we could persuade them
to move over.

35
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:32,288
- Yes, Mr. Governor?
- Shut up! Not you.

36
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:35,334
Get me all the newspapermen.
I want to speak to the radio stations.

37
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:37,996
- What happened?
- Things like this gotta be guided.

38
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,869
Get right down to Morgan's Creek,
buy up a few choice corners...

39
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:44,672
some hotel sites, they'll need some.
And the bus franchises will be very valuable.

40
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:46,644
- Morgan's what?
- "Creek," like a little river.

41
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:49,648
- A little river should have a big dam.
- Why not? Give me the facts.

42
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:53,447
It's the biggest thing happening to
this state since we stole it from the Indians.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,919
- Borrowed.
- Who's excited now?

44
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:58,287
I'll tell you all I know, Mr. Governor.
I started the whole thing.

45
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:02,351
I was writing my midweek editorial,
I was looking for a subject for it.

46
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:05,159
<i>I'm rather famous for my editorials</i>
<i>in this part of the state.</i>

47
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:06,665
He's going to tell us his life story!

48
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,701
And I noticed a few soldiers in the town.

49
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,258
- What an eye!
- What a bore!

50
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:12,805
<i>It occurred to me</i>
<i>that the girls in the town...</i>

51
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:17,139
and the soldiers around the towns would
make an excellent subject for my editorial!

52
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,146
All right, let's have it!
We're going to get it anyhow.

53
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:24,672
I was looking out the window
and there I saw Off. Kockenlocker...

54
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,912
our town constable,
directing traffic as usual.

55
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:28,852
Keep moving! Can't you see it says "Go?"

56
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:30,751
Get out of here!

57
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,083
We got to get some dates for that
dance tonight. You got any numbers?

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,526
Try the telephone company.
What do you think I am?

59
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,087
- Tough guy, huh?
- Tough enough, rookie!

60
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:40,632
Where do you get that rookie stuff?

61
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,635
Listen, cookie, I was in France
before you were housebroken.

62
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:46,035
Now, get off the street
and behave yourselves.

63
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:49,004
- What's all the trouble?
- There's no trouble.

64
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,839
I just don't like to be talked to
by rookies, that's all.

65
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:55,473
This is Mr. Kockenlocker, gentlemen,
a sergeant in the other war.

66
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,541
- It's all different now, Ed.
- It's all done with kindness.

67
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:01,553
Yeah. Come on, get off the street.
Quit blocking the traffic.

68
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,316
- Please.
- Please.

69
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,553
You get the idea, Ed?
It's more psychological.

70
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,423
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

71
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,790
Excuse me, were you looking for some girls?

72
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,696
- We certainly were.
- I know of one.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,701
- I'll bet you do, sugar.
- It's Mr. Kockenlocker's daughter.

74
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,828
That crab?

75
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:21,806
She's one of the prettiest girls in town.
She works in Rafferty's Music Store.

76
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:23,060
Come on now, you got to beat it or buy
something before Mr. Rafferty gets after me.

77
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,434
- Will you come tonight?
- Sure, I'll be there.

78
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,563
All right, so long, Trudy.

79
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,370
- Save the first dance for me, will you?
- I'll flip you for it.

80
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:30,909
Save me the last dance.

81
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,210
- Hello, Trudy.
- Hello, Norval.

82
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,848
I'd like a package
of phonograph needles, please.

83
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,916
- Three Indestructos or 36 Ragons?
- It really doesn't matter.

84
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:49,985
- I think the Indestructos...
- Thank you, Trudy.

85
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:54,124
I passed by the lobby. They've got
three pictures playing at the Regent tonight.

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,863
I thought that if you weren't doing anything,
considering that I was also free...

87
00:05:57,937 --> 00:06:00,997
I'm awfully sorry, Norval,
but I wouldn't be able to make it tonight.

88
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,373
I promised to go to the dance
for the boys that are going away.

89
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:08,039
- For the soldiers.
- That's right, Norval. I'm awful sorry.

90
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:11,572
You'd think they'd give a party sometime
for those who have to stay behind.

91
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:15,348
They also serve, who only sit and...
Whatever they do, I forget.

92
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:17,322
I'm sure they do, Norval.

93
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,089
I don't get to see you quite as much
as I used to, or as I'd like to, Trudy.

94
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:24,062
I'm awfully sorry, Norval.

95
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:28,560
Naturally, the camps, the canteens and
everything take up a lot of your spare time.

96
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:29,795
Naturally.

97
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,360
Why don't you come tonight?
The tickets are only 50 cents.

98
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,533
It isn't the 50 cents.
I wouldn't feel right not being in uniform.

99
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:39,271
- I guess nobody feels good about that.
- It isn't as if I hadn't tried.

100
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:42,143
- But every time they start to examine me...
- I know.

101
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:43,978
- And then...
- I know.

102
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:45,979
- The spots.
- The spots.

103
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,651
- Maybe some other time, Trudy.
- I'd be glad to, Norval.

104
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,087
Good night, Trudy.

105
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,461
You forgot your needles.

106
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,224
It really doesn't matter.
I haven't got a phonograph, anyway.

107
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,249
What are you looking at?

108
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,921
You wasn't thinking
of getting married, was you?

109
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,122
At 14?

110
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:34,364
I was thinking of going down
to the corner and having a soda.

111
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:37,562
I don't mean what you were thinking about
right now, I mean generally.

112
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,197
- Generally, yes.
- "Generally, yes" what?

113
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,674
Generally yes, I think about marriage.
What else do you think I think about?

114
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:48,236
- You do, do you?
- Anybody can think about it, can't they?

115
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:52,410
It doesn't cost anything to think about it.
It's only when you do it that it costs $2.

116
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:53,816
What costs $2?

117
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:57,323
You seem to know a great deal
about a subject far beyond your years.

118
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,223
- Like it says here in the paper...
- That's your subject, Papa.

119
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,592
You introduced it.
If you don't like it, ignore it.

120
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,438
Tell your sister
the house ain't paid for, will you?

121
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,575
She knows that, Papa.
You tell her every day.

122
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:28,348
Every day ain't enough.
What's she doing up there, anyway?

123
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,254
- Getting ready for the party.
- Getting ready for what party?

124
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:34,691
The dance, Papa.
You've got to kiss the boys goodbye.

125
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:38,128
It's a farewell party. A military affair.

126
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:51,868
- Good night, Papa.
- Just a moment!

127
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,709
What is this military
kiss-the-boys-goodbye business...

128
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,715
and where is it to be transacted?

129
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,284
Just like they always do,
in the church basement...

130
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:02,378
then the country club
and then kind of... Like that.

131
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:04,582
- Like what?
- That's all.

132
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:07,084
- Good night, Papa.
- Just a minute!

133
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,652
- What happens after the country club?
- Then they bring you home.

134
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,466
Yeah, by way of Cincinnati
with a side trip through Detroit!

135
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,434
I was a soldier, too, in the last war.

136
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:19,699
But, Papa, I've already promised
and I'm all dressed up.

137
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:22,172
You can go get undressed.
It says here in the paper...

138
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,264
But, Papa...

139
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:26,904
People aren't as evil-minded as they
used to be when you were a soldier, Papa.

140
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,414
When I want any advice out of you,
I'll ask for it.

141
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:30,642
- And you'll get it.
- Yeah?

142
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:32,082
I wish Mama was here.

143
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:35,416
So do I, believe me.
But she ain't. Daughters.

144
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,856
So, as your father and mother combined...

145
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:41,257
I'm here to tell you that
you ain't going on no more military parties.

146
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,659
Read what it says here in the paper!

147
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,897
If you don't mind my mentioning it, Father,
I think you have a mind like a swamp.

148
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:56,066
What!

149
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:01,446
- Aren't you going out tonight?
- No, ma'am.

150
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,077
I thought you were going to the picture.

151
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,051
I thought I would,
and then I figured I wouldn't.

152
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:12,789
Isn't there a dance or something tonight?

153
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,554
For the soldiers.

154
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,621
I'm sorry, Norval.

155
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,826
If they don't want me, they don't want me.

156
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,369
Couldn't the doctor
give you something to calm you?

157
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:28,168
Just long enough for the examination,
like whiskey or something?

158
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:31,039
I'm perfectly calm. I'm as cool as ice.

159
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:34,235
I start to figure maybe they won't take me...

160
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:38,580
and some cold sweat runs down the middle
of my back, and my head begins to buzz...

161
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:41,484
and everything in the middle of the room
begins to swim...

162
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,818
and I get black spots in front of my eyes...

163
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,983
and they say I've got
high blood pressure again.

164
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,118
And all the time I'm cool as ice!

165
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:52,088
- Don't get so excited, Norval.
- Who's excited?

166
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,267
Hello. Yes.

167
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,395
Gee, that's swell, Trudy.

168
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,506
Kind of a lucky break, huh?

169
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:06,176
I certainly appreciate you calling me
right away. I'll be right over.

170
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:08,008
Goodbye. Oh, boy!

171
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:11,241
- Have you got any money?
- Money?

172
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,785
What for? Yeah, I've got plenty. Goodbye.

173
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,946
- Your coat!
- My coat.

174
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,955
- I got it.
- Don't get so excited!

175
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:27,255
What kind of music is that?

176
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:34,432
Hello?

177
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:38,801
Hello, Trudy. Hello, Emmy.
Good evening, Mr. Kockenlocker.

178
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:41,472
I'm glad you're going to
the picture show with me tonight.

179
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,777
- Who, me?
- I'm very glad to go with you, Norval.

180
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,718
Fine. I don't want to sound unpatriotic
but I'm glad they called that dance off...

181
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:50,483
- for my sake, I mean.
- It wasn't exactly for your...

182
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:53,957
- It was just called off.
- Come on, Norval. Good night, Emmy, Papa.

183
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,894
- Be home right after the picture.
- Where else could I go?

184
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,659
- I didn't ask where else...
- There's a new boogie-woogie joint...

185
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,256
- Listen, you.
- Come on, Norval.

186
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,392
Right after the picture.

187
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:04,663
- Yes, Papa.
- Yes, Mr. Kockenlocker.

188
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,831
Now, what do you know about
this little boogie-woogie joint?

189
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,272
Nothing, Papa.

190
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:12,869
I just heard you were there,
digging quite a trench.

191
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:19,776
It was certainly very sweet of you
to come and get me right away, Norval.

192
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,319
The pleasure's all mine, Trudy.

193
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,515
Except to get into the Army,
I can't hardly think of anything...

194
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,058
that gives me as much pleasure
as taking you out.

195
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:30,459
That's nice to hear. You certainly
helped me out by taking me out tonight.

196
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,998
After I was all dressed up
like a horse and everything.

197
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,661
The pleasure's mine, Trudy.
Not that you look anything like a horse.

198
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:39,671
- Maybe I should have worn my tuxedo.
- Thank you, Norval.

199
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,832
- You certainly helped me out.
- Any time.

200
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:44,976
- You really mean that, Norval?
- Really mean what, Trudy?

201
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,511
You'd help me out anytime?

202
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,310
Why, Trudy, that's almost all I live for,
except maybe getting into the Army.

203
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:53,819
I can't think of anything that
makes me more happy than helping you out.

204
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:57,652
I almost wish you'd be in a lot of trouble
sometime so I could prove it to you.

205
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,418
You can prove it tonight.

206
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:04,226
I am in a lot of trouble, Norval.
They didn't call off that military dance.

207
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:06,959
Papa just called it off
as far as I was concerned.

208
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,091
He did?

209
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,328
He probably had pretty good reasons, then.

210
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,735
That's what parents are for,
to listen to their advice.

211
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:15,239
That's why I always missed
losing my parents so much.

212
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:18,300
I know. But he didn't have a good reason.
He's just old-fashioned.

213
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:20,937
Soldiers aren't like they used to be
when he was a soldier.

214
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:22,810
You know, all in France and like that.

215
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,509
- Aren't they?
- Of course they're not.

216
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:27,018
They're fine, clean young boys
from good homes...

217
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,213
and we can't send them off to be killed...

218
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,756
in the rockets' red glare,
bombs bursting in air...

219
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:33,917
without anybody to say
goodbye to them, can we?

220
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:35,460
They've probably got their families.

221
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:38,088
Even if they have, they ought to have
girls and dancing.

222
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:41,224
How about those who haven't
got any families? How about the orphans?

223
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,996
Who says goodbye to them?
You ought to know about them.

224
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,631
The superintendent probably comes down
from the asylum for old times' sake.

225
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,799
Norval, I think you're perfectly heartless.

226
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:53,642
I hope you get into the Army someday
and the last thing that happens to you...

227
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,546
before you sail away,
the last thing you have to treasure...

228
00:13:56,616 --> 00:14:00,450
while you're fighting beneath foreign skies
is a kiss from the superintendent!

229
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,080
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say:

230
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:06,421
"Trudy, it's your bounden duty
to say goodbye to our boys.

231
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:09,825
"To dance with them, to give them
something to remember, to fight for.

232
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:13,832
"I won't take no for an answer, so
I'll drop you off at the church basement...

233
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,391
"take in a movie, then pick you up
and take you home...

234
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:19,404
"like a chivalrous gentleman
so you won't get in wrong with Papa."

235
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:21,838
- That's what I want you to say.
- I won't say it.

236
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,602
- Please, Norval.
- I won't do it.

237
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,940
I won't sit through three features
all by myself.

238
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:28,572
Couldn't you sleep through
a couple of them?

239
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:31,742
Suppose you get caught?
Where does that put me with your father?

240
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:34,752
Why should I get caught?
Anyway, I'm not doing anything wrong.

241
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,254
The whole idea sounds
very cheesy to me, Trudy.

242
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:39,450
I'm not trying to be disagreeable...

243
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,517
but if you want me
as a kind of a false front, a kind of decoy...

244
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:46,691
I might just as well take you home
right now and say goodbye to you.

245
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:50,067
That doesn't cut any ice with me.

246
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:53,603
Go ahead, cry all you like.
I've seen you cry before.

247
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:59,076
- Stop it, will you?
- I'm not crying for me.

248
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:04,482
I'm just thinking of those poor boys
going away like poor little orphans.

249
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,917
- You're not the only dame in town, are you?
- That's right, insult me.

250
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:10,046
I'm not insulting you, Trudy. I...

251
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,118
Where will I meet you?

252
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,785
It doesn't matter now
that you've spoiled everything.

253
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:17,556
- Doesn't it?
- What time is the third feature over?

254
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,224
About 1: 10, if my seat holds out.

255
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,393
- All right, I'll pick you up at 1: 10.
- Pick me up?

256
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:24,993
What do you mean pick me up?

257
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:28,336
Don't you think I ought to take your car?
The boys mightn't have any.

258
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:29,806
Take my car?

259
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,776
First, you get me out
under false pretenses...

260
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,678
which you never had
the slightest intention of...

261
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:38,942
Then you want me to sit through
three features all by myself...

262
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:42,510
and now you want to take my car
in the bargain for a bunch...

263
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:45,489
Of all the confounded nerve I ever...

264
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,554
All right! Here.

265
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:51,620
The car's in front of my house.
Is there anything else you want?

266
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:53,995
How about my gas card?
My money? My watch?

267
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,500
Maybe one of the boys could use it.

268
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,167
What a war.

269
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:05,637
- Say, I've got a wonderful idea.
- What?

270
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:07,696
Let's all get married.

271
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:43,742
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</i>
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

272
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:03,256
The finest bunch of boys I've ever seen.

273
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,160
I want champagne
for everybody in the house.

274
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,727
I'm so sorry. The whole house.

275
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:25,107
I've got a wonderful idea.

276
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:34,025
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</i>
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

277
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:13,985
Hello, Norval. It's nice to see you.
How long you've been waiting?

278
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:18,224
What do you think?
Holy mackerel, you know what time it is?

279
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:21,164
We had a wonderful time, Norval.

280
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,837
We sang and then we danced
and then we had some lemonade and then...

281
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:28,840
it's almost as if somebody slugged me
or something.

282
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:32,036
Isn't that funny?
The next thing I remember...

283
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:36,175
I was driving down the street
and all of a sudden I said, "Norval.

284
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,214
"Norval must be waiting for me."

285
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:41,645
I bet I'm a couple minutes late.

286
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,212
- You win.
- I'm awful sorry, Norval.

287
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:48,388
If there's one thing I despise,
it's people who...

288
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:51,927
I mean if there's one thing I love,
it's punctual...

289
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:55,924
People who are on time.

290
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,731
- You've been drinking!
- Who's been drinking?

291
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,465
I never had a drink in my life!

292
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,700
How dare you insinuate I've been drinking?

293
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:05,266
You certainly don't get
what you've got on lemonade.

294
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,312
- I certainly did.
- All right.

295
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:10,377
What have you been using on my car,
a pickaxe?

296
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,243
Is this your car?

297
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:15,443
I was wondering
where I found this old jalopy.

298
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:19,817
- Where do you suppose I've been?
- I'm sure I don't know.

299
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:24,486
It's funny, I remember everything perfectly
up to someplace.

300
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:27,223
We were dancing or something, and then...

301
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:30,128
I can't remember anymore.

302
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:33,233
What am I supposed to do now,
take you home?

303
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:36,240
Naturally, Norval, since I'm out with you.

304
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:39,937
- What's your father going to say?
- Papa's probably asleep.

305
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:41,775
We don't have to worry about him.

306
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,280
I suppose you realize
it's 8:00 in the morning?

307
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,874
8:00!

308
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:49,546
Norval, you shouldn't have
kept me out so late!

309
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,817
I shouldn't have kept you out so late!

310
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,348
- Papa will be very cross with you, Norval.
- He will, will he?

311
00:21:55,427 --> 00:21:59,158
Suppose I tell him I've been waiting
in a picture lobby for you all night?

312
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:01,664
That doesn't sound like you, Norval.

313
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,496
I've heard a lot of things against you but
I never heard anybody say you were a heel.

314
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,267
Thanks. Move over.

315
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:13,641
Maybe we could tell him
we'd been in an accident or something.

316
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:15,907
Wouldn't we have to wreck the car a little?

317
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:18,074
It could pass the way it is!

318
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:23,313
Maybe we went for a ride after the movie
and had a flat.

319
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:26,756
- It's old, but it's reliable.
- I don't think Papa goes for that one.

320
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,850
- He makes you show the patch.
- He does?

321
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,224
Yeah.

322
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:34,492
We might have fallen asleep
in the movie and not waked up...

323
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:38,726
but the best one I can think of is that Papa
had better be asleep when we get there.

324
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:40,032
You said it!

325
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:09,299
Thanks a million, Norval.
I'll never forget your kindness.

326
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,664
- I had a wonderful time.
- Can you get in all right?

327
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:17,708
"Can I get in all right?"
Why, what's the matter with you, Norval?

328
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:20,443
I never had a drink in my life...

329
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:23,606
and you talk as if I were
swaffled or something.

330
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,215
Good night!

331
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:33,321
- Are you hurt, Trudy? Are you all right?
- You stop that!

332
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,518
Norval, you stop!

333
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:39,658
- You're playing too rough.
- And what kind of a game is this?

334
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:41,498
Hello, Papa.

335
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:45,298
We were just kidding around a little
before saying good night.

336
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,564
I see.

337
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:49,406
And what time do you say good night
as a rule?

338
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:52,569
- Good night, Norval. Thanks for the movie.
- Just a minute, Mr. Jones!

339
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:55,636
Where have you been with my daughter
till this hour of the morning?

340
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,182
I don't want to hear about
the accident on the way home...

341
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,480
or the flat tire,
or falling asleep in the movies!

342
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:03,817
- It's not so late, Papa.
- It may not be late where you come from.

343
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:06,153
- Stop it, Papa!
- Why don't you say something?

344
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:09,353
Don't make so much noise, Papa.
You'll wake up the whole neighborhood.

345
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:12,363
Will you get back in the house?
I'll give you one more chance.

346
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:15,161
- He's going to explode, Papa!
- Flat tire!

347
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:17,065
We fell asleep in the movies!

348
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:20,230
That's all I wanted to know.
I'll flat tire you, you flat tire!

349
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:22,705
Stop it, Papa! Beat it, Norval!
Trip him, Emmy!

350
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,699
Beat it, Norval!

351
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:40,990
- Good morning, Mr. Shottish.
- Good morning, Norval.

352
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:43,091
Been out on a little party?

353
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,466
Yes, sir. You know how it is.

354
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,491
I certainly do.

355
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,634
All right, step lively, men.

356
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:01,645
Catch those bags up there. That's it.

357
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:04,408
So long, Lefty.
It's a swell town you got here.

358
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:05,541
Take care of yourselves.

359
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:07,016
- Swell girls.
- Swell party.

360
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:10,577
- How can you feel so good this morning?
- I never felt better in my life.

361
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,146
Why shouldn't we feel good?

362
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:14,886
If I drunk that much lemonade,
I'd be sour for a week.

363
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,224
Puts my teeth on edge to think of it.

364
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:19,355
- Any prisoners, Sergeant?
- Nothing, sir.

365
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,932
Sunday morning
and not a stiff in the guardhouse.

366
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,797
Fine. Psycho-lology.

367
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:27,328
But I still can't understand
how you could stay out so late...

368
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:30,807
- no matter how much fun you had.
- I can't figure that out, either.

369
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:35,540
I remember everything perfectly
up to someplace we were dancing.

370
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:39,816
The next thing I remember,
I was driving down Main Street...

371
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:41,944
and Norval was waiting.

372
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,681
You didn't go to sleep somewhere
or something?

373
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:47,987
I don't think so.
You know me, I never get tired.

374
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:54,588
Did somebody say something about,
"let's all get married," or something?

375
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:57,498
- No.
- Or did I dream it?

376
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:01,028
Yes, they did!

377
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:06,408
And some of those poor dumb kids
thought that would be a wonderful idea.

378
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:07,638
No!

379
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:11,575
Can you imagine getting hitched up
in the middle of the night...

380
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:16,347
with a curtain ring to somebody that's
going away that you might never see again?

381
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:19,655
You don't suppose any of them
were dumb enough to...

382
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,621
Trudy?

383
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:24,921
What's that on your finger?

384
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,195
You didn't...

385
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,528
Trudy!

386
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,238
Are you sure you can't remember his name?

387
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,745
How can I remember his name
when I can't even remember...

388
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:44,206
Wait a minute.

389
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:53,347
I remember I danced with a tall, dark boy...

390
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,120
with curly hair...

391
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:58,590
and a little short one with freckles...

392
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:03,460
and a big fat blond one who sang in my ear.

393
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:07,130
But if I married any of those
it would have been the tall, dark one...

394
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,696
- with the curly hair, don't you think?
- That's a big help.

395
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:11,299
All we've got to do is line up...

396
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:14,812
all the curly-haired men in the Army
and the Navy and the Marine Corps...

397
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:16,574
It had a "Z" in it.

398
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:19,082
- His hair?
- No, his name, foolish.

399
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:22,976
Like Ratzkiwatzki, Pvt. Ratzkiwatzki...

400
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:26,056
or was it Zitzkiwitzki?

401
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:30,754
- With a name like that I'd forget him.
- Now you knocked it out of my head!

402
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,330
What's the matter with us?

403
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:35,696
If you got married,
you must have given your name.

404
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:38,759
Now all we've got to do is find out
where you got the license.

405
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:42,967
We've got your name, his name, the date
and everything, and there you are.

406
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:49,077
- I just remembered something else.
- What?

407
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,210
Somebody said,
"Don't give your right name."

408
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:55,920
But you didn't fall for it?
You told them to go suck a lemon.

409
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:58,422
You weren't such a corn-fed dope as to...

410
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:03,552
- What name did you give?
- I don't remember.

411
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:08,060
Then the guy can't ever find you
even if he comes looking for you.

412
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,601
Then we'll never even know
if you got married.

413
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:12,102
I hope not.

414
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:17,166
If you will just follow these instructions
and come in again in about a month.

415
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,540
Thank you, Doctor.

416
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:24,677
There, there.

417
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:29,114
You'll find your husband, I'm sure of it.

418
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:32,987
And if you shouldn't find him...
You will find him!

419
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:36,759
Thank you, Doctor.
You don't have to tell anybody.

420
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:39,730
I mean, you won't tell anybody
until I find him?

421
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:44,292
Of course I won't, Trudy.
I'm a doctor, not a gossip smearer.

422
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:46,732
Thank you, Doctor.

423
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,602
- Well?
- Well, what?

424
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,805
- How are we doing?
- Great.

425
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:59,014
Then we're really in a mess.

426
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:00,847
Not you, just me.

427
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,844
So what? You don't have to cry about it.

428
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:06,914
You're not the first dumb cluck
who couldn't find her husband.

429
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:10,155
What with the war and all,
there'll probably be millions of them.

430
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:12,696
They say they have
much the prettiest babies, too.

431
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:14,959
He'll come back. He has to come back.

432
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,591
What're you laughing about?

433
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,899
I was just wondering whether
I was going to be an aunt or an uncle.

434
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,336
Stop it, will you?

435
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:23,670
I'm only trying to make you smile, Trudy.

436
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:26,609
- Come on, we'll see Mr. Johnson, the lawyer.
- What for?

437
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,873
To find out if you're really married.

438
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:31,677
You're kind of hard to convince, aren't you?

439
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,244
- Certainly she's married.
- Even with a phony name, Mr. Johnson?

440
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,120
What's the name got to do with it?
Marriage is a matter of fact, not names.

441
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:40,988
The marriage was celebrated, I presume?

442
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:42,287
- They usually are.
- I think so.

443
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,454
Since you're here on behalf of a friend
who does not wish to appear...

444
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,998
all I've gotta say is,
she ought to be ashamed of herself.

445
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,296
She's a very nice girl.
It just happened, that's all.

446
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,131
I mean because of her carelessness!

447
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:55,696
The responsibility for recording a marriage
has always been up to the woman.

448
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:58,641
If it wasn't for her,
marriage would have disappeared long since.

449
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,770
No man is going to jeopardize his present
or poison his future...

450
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:04,873
with little brats hollering around the house
unless he's forced to.

451
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,248
It's up to the woman
to knock him down, hog-tie him...

452
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,345
and drag him in front of two witnesses
immediately, if not sooner.

453
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,117
Any time after that is too late.

454
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,715
Your friend doesn't remember
the bridegroom's name?

455
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:15,851
No, sir.

456
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:18,623
She used an assumed name. Perfect.
That's really airtight.

457
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:20,858
- Couldn't you do anything?
- What, for instance?

458
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,059
- Divorce...
- Or sue him for alimony?

459
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:24,830
Sue who? Annul who?

460
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:29,840
I practice the law. I'm not only willing, but
anxious to sue anyone, anytime for anything.

461
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:33,844
They've got to be real people with names,
corpuses, and meat on their bones.

462
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,641
I can't work with spooks.

463
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:39,283
Your friend doesn't need a lawyer,
she needs a medium.

464
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:46,121
- Thank you, Mr. Johnson.
- That will be $5.

465
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:49,990
Which you'll kindly hang onto
and buy flowers with on the happy day...

466
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:51,551
for your friend, of course.

467
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,428
You don't have to tell anybody,
do you, about our friend?

468
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,229
How could I when I don't even know
who she is?

469
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:59,031
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

470
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,742
I've gotta get back to the store now, Emmy.

471
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:10,747
Could you get me a sandwich
and bring it in to me, a Swiss on rye?

472
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:14,080
Sure. But the way I look at it, it was
a man got our friend in the soup.

473
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,347
- Let a man get her out of it.
- But how?

474
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,514
She could always get married, couldn't she?

475
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,524
How can I get married
when I'm already married?

476
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:23,060
Don't talk about yourself,
we're talking about our friend.

477
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:26,529
It's all very well to say she's married,
but when the time comes to prove...

478
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:28,657
Are you trying to say our friend is a liar?

479
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,894
- Don't talk so loud.
- You better not.

480
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:34,700
I'm only 14.
My ideas probably aren't any good, anyway.

481
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,673
I was only trying to be helpful.

482
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:39,574
Our friend could just marry somebody
and then one day...

483
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:41,168
Sure. One day she could say:

484
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,840
"By the way,
there's something I forgot to mention."

485
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:46,110
Anyway, I'm already married.
Mr. Johnson said so.

486
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:49,415
What does he know? He takes in roomers.
Nobody's going to believe it.

487
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:52,752
Nobody believes good if they've got
a chance to believe something bad.

488
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:54,257
But that would be bigamy.

489
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:57,124
How can it be bigamy
if they didn't get your right name?

490
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:59,459
You never got married.
That was somebody else.

491
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,863
I could ask the other girls
who were on the party.

492
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,868
If they knew, we would have heard about it,
you can bet your life.

493
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:08,565
You must have slipped away somewhere
and done it quietly like movie stars.

494
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,803
- I wonder what Papa's going to say.
- He probably won't say much.

495
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:15,812
He'll just haul off and shoot Norval
so full of holes, he'll look like Swiss cheese.

496
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,939
That was a Swiss on rye you wanted,
wasn't it?

497
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:20,507
- Norval? Where does he fit in?
- He took you out, didn't he?

498
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:23,577
He brought you home, didn't he?
At 8:00 in the morning, didn't he?

499
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:25,816
He fits like the skin on a wienie.

500
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,120
Poor Norval. We'd better warn him.

501
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:31,026
- We'd better marry him.
- Marry him?

502
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:32,927
How can you say such things, Emmy?

503
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:35,330
What's the matter with you?
He was made for it.

504
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,665
Like the ox was made to eat
and the grape was made to drink.

505
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:40,898
I'll get you the Swiss on rye.

506
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,669
I'm certainly glad to see you all again.

507
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:51,204
For a while there, I thought you were
kind of sore at me, Mr. Kockenlocker.

508
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:53,308
- Papa's bite's worse than his bark.
- You said it.

509
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:55,910
Wait till you get married
and have half a dozen daughters...

510
00:32:55,987 --> 00:32:59,218
and see how you feel when some mug
brings them home 8:00 in the morning.

511
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,657
- But, Papa, you only have two daughters.
- That's plenty.

512
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,853
They're a mess
no matter how you look at them.

513
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,328
A headache till they get married,
if they get married...

514
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,956
- and after that they get worse.
- Pudding?

515
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,398
Either they leave their husbands...

516
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:12,300
and come back with four children
and move into your guest room...

517
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,567
or their husband loses his job
and the whole caboodle comes back.

518
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,734
Or else they're so homely
you can't get rid of them at all...

519
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,108
and they hang around the house
like Spanish moss...

520
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,306
and shame you into an early grave.

521
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:26,646
I guess it's a good thing
I didn't have any designs on you.

522
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:29,846
The way Papa kept talking about
marriage and all.

523
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:33,220
If you had any designs, they wouldn't
be on me much anyway, I guess.

524
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:36,783
I guess they would be, if I had any.

525
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:40,524
Yes, but you haven't. That's what I mean.
Like the night of the party...

526
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,998
you could have stayed
and gone to the show with me...

527
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:45,832
- but instead, you didn't.
- I'm sorry I didn't, Norval.

528
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:48,270
- No fooling?
- No fooling.

529
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,470
I wouldn't have got
your car nicked up or anything.

530
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:53,374
It was only for the boys.

531
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:54,639
I know.

532
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:58,444
You can't expect a girl to see much
in a civilian these days...

533
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,347
even an unwilling civilian.

534
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:03,387
If they had uniforms for them,
it might be a little different.

535
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:06,618
- I'm not so crazy about uniforms.
- You're not?

536
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:09,219
I'd give anything to wear one.

537
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:10,885
That's because you're a man.

538
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:14,056
Lots of women wear them, too,
like those WACos.

539
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,992
Woman's place is in the home.

540
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:21,494
That sounds kind of old-fashioned
and domestic coming from you, Trudy.

541
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:25,339
Sometimes you just naturally feel
old-fashioned and domestic, Norval.

542
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:28,068
I guess no girl ever gets away
from it, really.

543
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:31,673
She thinks she is, and then one day,
something happens...

544
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,150
and she finds out she isn't.

545
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:37,214
Something like what, Trudy?

546
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:40,515
Something like falling in love,
maybe, or something.

547
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:42,719
Why, Trudy!

548
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:44,718
If I didn't know you so well...

549
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:47,264
and know that nothing could be further
from your mind...

550
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:51,234
a fellow would almost swear
you were giving him a hint.

551
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:53,031
Would that be so terrible?

552
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:55,368
Terrible! It'd be marvelous!

553
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,905
How much of a hint would you need?

554
00:34:57,976 --> 00:35:00,774
Why, Trudy! I...

555
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:02,979
Norval, remember your blood pressure.

556
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:06,210
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you
just before you said...

557
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:08,047
whatever you're getting ready to say.

558
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,381
Don't worry about me.

559
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:13,220
It's only the surprise of realizing that
what you've been dreaming about...

560
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,953
I mean, what you've been thinking about
all these...

561
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:20,464
It's not only not impossible,
but even totally...

562
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:27,163
Trudy, will you marry me?

563
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:29,001
Norval, this is so sudden!

564
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:31,633
- Trudy!
- Norval!

565
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:35,836
Are you all right?

566
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:39,777
- What happened this time?
- Nothing, Papa.

567
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:42,251
- Norval just took a little fall.
- Come on, Papa.

568
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,185
Don't tear the house down. It ain't paid for.

569
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:47,349
- She knows that, you tell her twice a day!
- Twice today ain't enough.

570
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:50,258
- I'm sorry I was so clumsy.
- That's all right.

571
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,624
- Are you comfortable?
- Fine, thanks.

572
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:03,163
Say, did I just propose to you or something?

573
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,766
- Yes, you did, Norval.
- How did I come out?

574
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:08,472
- It was so sudden.
- So sudden?

575
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:11,142
What do you mean it was so sudden?

576
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:15,517
How can anything be sudden that's gone on
since you were little kids together?

577
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:17,245
Almost since I can remember.

578
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:20,985
I can tell you what dress you wore
at the first Fourth of July party...

579
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:23,789
and you weren't hardly any bigger
than the firecrackers.

580
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:27,524
Then you remember the church lawn party
when you sat in the apple butter...

581
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,032
and they blamed me for it?

582
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,069
Then later, at high school,
when I took all kinds of subjects...

583
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:35,970
I didn't give a hoot about,
it was just to be near you, Trudy.

584
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:39,539
The cooking wasn't so bad, but the sewing!

585
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:43,272
And then the older I got, the uglier I got.

586
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:46,340
When I was a kid they said,
"He'll grow out of it."

587
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:50,751
But I guess a face like mine,
you just can't grow out of so easy.

588
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:53,216
It's like it's cast in iron.

589
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:55,819
So I really didn't blame you...

590
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:59,419
when you began looking at
the personality kids with the Greek profiles...

591
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:00,862
and the curly haircuts.

592
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:02,991
- I did not!
- I didn't blame you.

593
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:06,264
I even bought a thing once for my nose
but it kept me awake nights...

594
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:08,737
except once when I almost smothered.

595
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:11,537
It was only for you.

596
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,305
It's always been for you
and nobody but you.

597
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:18,849
That's what I went into the bank for,
to get rich and to buy you things someday.

598
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:20,942
Anything your heart desired.

599
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,850
And then it began to look as if everything
I ever hoped for wasn't going to be.

600
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,550
You had less and less time for me...

601
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:33,157
and then not having a uniform and all.

602
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:37,632
But now, Trudy, now that everything
in the world is right here beside me...

603
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:42,537
everything I've ever dreamed of, to have
and to hold, to cherish and to protect...

604
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:47,244
- how can you say it's so sudden?
- Norval!

605
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:51,107
- Why, Trudy, what's the matter?
- I can't do it to you, Norval!

606
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:53,616
Trudy, if I've said anything
to hurt your feelings...

607
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:56,586
- I wouldn't hurt your feelings.
- I can't do it, Norval!

608
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:58,679
You can't do what to me, Trudy?

609
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:00,951
What have you done to my daughter now?

610
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:04,222
- Papa! Please, the neighbors!
- What have you done to her?

611
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:07,626
- Papa, please. It wasn't his fault!
- Then what are you crying about?

612
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:10,634
- I can cry if I want to!
- I'm gonna give you one more chance!

613
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,135
Papa, please!

614
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:17,303
Papa, can't you learn to be
a little more refined?

615
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,603
Refined?

616
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,771
- How do you feel?
- How do you feel?

617
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,977
- It doesn't matter about me.
- Thank you, Norval.

618
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:29,849
What made you cry?

619
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,547
I'm sorry.

620
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:34,782
Was it the thought of marrying me?

621
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,089
Yes, but not the way you think.

622
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:41,054
I'm in terrible trouble, Norval...

623
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:44,466
and somehow I just naturally turned to you.

624
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:46,526
Like you said that night, you remember?

625
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:50,301
You almost wished I'd be in terrible trouble
so you could help me out of it?

626
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:53,310
- That's right.
- You certainly got your wish.

627
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:56,641
I don't suppose
you'd want to help me out again.

628
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,706
I mean, the idea might not
appeal to you entirely.

629
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:02,309
- Where's the party tonight?
- What?

630
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:03,547
No.

631
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:07,848
That party I went to was enough of a party
for me for quite a while.

632
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:11,292
That was kind of a party to end all parties,
if you get what I mean.

633
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:13,592
Trudy, you said
you had such a wonderful time.

634
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:17,192
I did, in a way, but some kind of fun
lasts longer than others...

635
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:20,328
- if you get what I mean.
- I'm not sure that I do, Trudy.

636
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:23,063
Maybe I can find a better way
to explain it to you.

637
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,267
Maybe you can.

638
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:27,470
When you asked me to marry you, Norval,
did you really mean it?

639
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:28,978
Of course I did.

640
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,208
Could you think of any reason
why you wouldn't want to marry me?

641
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:35,843
What would I do with such a reason?
I do want to marry you.

642
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:38,013
I can't do it to you, Norval!

643
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:40,489
Now we're right back where we started.

644
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:44,016
- Norval, can you keep a secret?
- Of course I can.

645
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:47,155
Cross your heart and hope to die,
boil in oil and stew in lye?

646
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:50,291
- Cross my heart and hope to die.
- Boil in oil and stew in lye?

647
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:52,495
- Sure.
- I'm married.

648
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,265
You're married. You're what?

649
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:57,239
- Norval! Don't get so excited!
- But, Trudy, you said...

650
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:58,741
Excuse me.

651
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,301
I thought for a minute there
you said you were married.

652
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:05,076
- I did say I was married.
- You did say you were married!

653
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:09,082
Trudy, you... The spots!
...said you were married!

654
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:12,281
- It happened that night.
- It happened that night?

655
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:16,417
- You mean the night you were out with me?
- That's right.

656
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:18,462
Trudy, that's the terriblest thing I ever...

657
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:20,929
How could you do... The spots!
...to me, Trudy?

658
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:24,297
- That isn't even the worst of it.
- That isn't even the worst?

659
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:26,893
That isn't even...
What could be worse than that?

660
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,529
You're going to make me cry.

661
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,370
Go ahead, cry. Cry all you like, see if I care!

662
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:32,739
The spots!

663
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,778
- Who did you marry?
- I don't know.

664
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:37,474
You don't know!

665
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:39,277
What do you mean, you don't know?

666
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,716
That's the most ridiculous statement
I ever...

667
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:44,481
It has a "Z" in it.
His name had a "Z" in it, I think.

668
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:45,783
I don't know.

669
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:47,586
I've thought so much about it...

670
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:50,320
and the more I think about it,
the less I can remember.

671
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:54,262
Don't tell me to find the name on the
marriage license because I haven't got any.

672
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:57,859
And don't ask me if I'm sure I'm married,
because I am sure.

673
00:40:57,935 --> 00:41:01,598
How can you be sure if there's no name
on the record?

674
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:04,505
How can you possibly be...

675
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,474
Trudy, you don't mean...

676
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:12,045
- That's right.
- The spots!

677
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:16,853
That's terrible! I feel terrible.

678
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:20,451
- How do you suppose I feel?
- That's the terriblest thing I ever...

679
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:23,688
What's your father going to say
when he finds out? You can't...

680
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:28,164
You haven't any husband...
I mean, any proof. Who's he going...

681
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,071
- The spots!
- I can almost see them myself.

682
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:37,198
- How can you...
- Norval, take it easy.

683
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:41,041
- I'm the last person, I tried.
- Norval, try to focus.

684
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:44,078
- You better take me home, Norval.
- Focus.

685
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,514
- No, home.
- Hocus.

686
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:55,318
Hey.

687
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:57,685
Just a minute.

688
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:00,629
Now, what was all that clowning around
on the front porch?

689
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:03,826
Don't you know there are times
when a woman doesn't care to talk?

690
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:05,459
A woman doesn't care to talk?

691
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:08,027
Only time a woman doesn't care to talk
is when she's dead.

692
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:10,539
- Where do you get that woman stuff?
- Or to be questioned?

693
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:11,905
Or be what?

694
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:14,610
Papa, don't!

695
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:20,616
- What happened?
- Nothing.

696
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:22,880
Just Papa pulling his usual stuff.

697
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:24,854
No, I mean with Norval.

698
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,426
I couldn't do it to him, Emmy.

699
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:32,062
He was so sweet, honey.

700
00:42:32,263 --> 00:42:36,461
He said he loved me ever since I wasn't
any bigger than a fire hydrant or something.

701
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:40,970
How he didn't blame me for not loving him
because he was so homely in the face...

702
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:43,871
and how he went to cooking class
and sewing class...

703
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,340
just to be near me, Emmy.

704
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:48,537
But he's perfect.
He could do all the housework.

705
00:42:50,014 --> 00:42:52,278
I couldn't do it to him, Emmy.

706
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:55,986
Why don't you give yourself up?

707
00:42:56,053 --> 00:43:00,012
- You ought to have your brains counted.
- I couldn't do it to him.

708
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:01,558
We'll have to find something else.

709
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:04,026
Where are you going to find
another clunk like that one?

710
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:06,757
There's nothing says you got to have
a husband on a happy day.

711
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:09,231
- You take like a widow.
- Yes, but a widow had one.

712
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,631
I had one.

713
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:14,168
You don't have to convince me, Trudy.
I love you.

714
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,636
I know you wouldn't do anything wrong...

715
00:43:16,707 --> 00:43:20,108
except you take after
Papa's side of the family a little.

716
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:23,802
It would hurt me just as much
as it would you to have you hurt...

717
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:26,008
and miserable, ashamed and everything.

718
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,517
That's the only reason
I want you to get married.

719
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:31,077
You can't tell how a town's
going to take things.

720
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:33,316
A town that can produce schnooks like Papa.

721
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:36,791
All suspicious and suspecting
the worst in everything.

722
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:39,852
There are very few dopes like Norval, honey.

723
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:42,092
You can't use anybody too snoopy.

724
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,259
Then maybe I shouldn't have told him.

725
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:45,802
You didn't tell him.

726
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:49,233
- Murder!
- Emmy!

727
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:02,817
What's going on in there, anyway?

728
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:05,549
How about a little quiet? Daughters.

729
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:17,492
- Going to lunch.
- Yes, sir.

730
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:31,904
- Funny thing happened this morning, Norval.
- Yes, sir?

731
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:35,111
Mr. Shottish asked me
if you had announced your engagement yet.

732
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:37,211
- My engagement?
- Yes.

733
00:44:37,288 --> 00:44:40,780
He kind of had a wild idea that
maybe you'd eloped or something.

734
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:43,122
What would I elope for?

735
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:45,355
- What are you so nervous about?
- Who's nervous?

736
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:47,989
- I mean, who's nervous?
- All I mean, Norval, is this.

737
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:51,262
It isn't any of my business,
what time you get home in the morning...

738
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:53,496
or how drunk you are
when you do get home...

739
00:44:53,604 --> 00:44:55,731
- but it is the bank's business.
- The bank.

740
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:56,795
That's right.

741
00:44:56,874 --> 00:45:00,833
A man in a bank is like a fellow crossing
Niagara Falls on a tightrope.

742
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:04,813
- He cannot be too careful.
- Yes, I get what you mean, Mr. Tuerck.

743
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:08,574
Fathers taking pokes at you
and all that sort of stuff.

744
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:11,478
- Very bad for a banker.
- You said it, Mr. Tuerck.

745
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:13,716
- You said it.
- Remember it.

746
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:15,684
Yes, sir.

747
00:45:28,806 --> 00:45:30,774
Come on, step lively.

748
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:33,005
- Hi, Mr. Tuerck.
- Hello, Edmund.

749
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,908
I'm glad to see
they haven't run you down yet.

750
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:36,776
I'll get it from a horse when I get it.

751
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:40,442
I heard a rumor that one of your daughters
is getting married. Any truth in it?

752
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:42,918
- One of my daughters? Who told you?
- A little bird.

753
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:46,479
We bankers, you know. We have our own
little channels of information.

754
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:47,854
Congratulations, Edmund.

755
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:50,860
Maybe you ought to just marry me
and forget the whole thing.

756
00:45:50,928 --> 00:45:52,793
I couldn't do that to you, Norval.

757
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:56,594
I couldn't let you take the risk of going
to jail for 20 years for bigamy.

758
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:58,794
You were going to on the front porch...

759
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:01,633
and you didn't mention anything
about the 20 years...

760
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:04,003
when I started to propose to you.

761
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:06,600
I wasn't in love with you then, Norval.

762
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:09,305
Do you really mean that, Trudy?

763
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,783
I feel very much ashamed of myself
for what I almost did to you, Norval.

764
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:16,147
What are you talking about?

765
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,984
All you did was give me the chance
I've always wanted...

766
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:21,149
that I've been waiting for.

767
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:25,689
To show you how much I love you
and the kind of love I had for you.

768
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,591
- You've got to marry me, Trudy.
- I can't do it to you, Norval.

769
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:34,337
But I want you to know how much
I appreciate your offer...

770
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:38,102
and how much I wish I'd known
how sweet you are a little sooner.

771
00:46:38,342 --> 00:46:41,436
I want you to know that
and to remember it always.

772
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:43,903
It will be my dying wish.

773
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:45,706
And when they fish me out...

774
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:49,082
I want you to know that
my last thought was of you.

775
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:52,350
Fish you out? You mean of the creek?

776
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,948
- It may be the only way.
- What are you talking about, Trudy?

777
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:58,551
That's the last way,
when everything else has failed.

778
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:03,464
Before I tried that, I'd try bigamy,
forgery, burglary, anything.

779
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:07,533
The only awful part about it is that
Papa'd be sure to shoot you then.

780
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:08,970
Well...

781
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:14,842
Of course, without you,
it wouldn't matter, anyway.

782
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,513
Thank you, dear.
Maybe we could jump in together.

783
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:23,710
There's not much water
this time of year, Trudy.

784
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:28,055
Isn't there a swimming hole
about 10 miles away?

785
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:31,954
You're not supposed to use your tires
for anything like that, Trudy.

786
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:35,725
Besides, I'm a very good swimmer
and being a very good swimmer...

787
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:38,962
they say that whenever
they get in a situation like that...

788
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:42,597
they just naturally swim right out.

789
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:45,603
I'm a very good swimmer, too.
I hadn't thought of that.

790
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:48,201
Well, then, let's forget the creek.

791
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:51,344
Maybe we could tie rocks around our necks.

792
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:52,643
Never!

793
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:58,010
- What's the matter with gas?
- What's the matter with bigamy?

794
00:47:58,289 --> 00:47:59,278
Hey!

795
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:01,988
Come here.

796
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:24,078
I want to have a little talk with you.

797
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:27,480
- With me, Papa?
- No, with your gentleman friend there.

798
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:29,815
- You go in the house.
- Yes, sir.

799
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:32,115
Go on.

800
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,618
Sit down!

801
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:41,356
What are you so nervous about?

802
00:48:41,632 --> 00:48:43,156
Who's nervous?

803
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:49,532
There's getting to be quite a little talk
in the town.

804
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,609
Where I come from, we don't skulk
around in the bushes, you get me?

805
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:54,439
- Yes, sir.
- When we gotta cross the street...

806
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:56,342
we don't crawl through the sewer
to get there.

807
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:58,677
- Yes, sir.
- When we've got something to say we say it!

808
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:01,013
- Yes, sir.
- When is the happy event?

809
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:06,216
I didn't hear exactly what you said.

810
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,383
When are you and Trudy getting hitched?

811
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:16,732
- What are you laughing about?
- Who me? I'm not laughing.

812
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:20,030
Just something I heard at the bank today.

813
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:22,231
You haven't answered my question.

814
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,905
There isn't any idiocy
in your family, is there?

815
00:49:25,976 --> 00:49:27,671
- She won't have me.
- She won't?

816
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:30,111
- I already asked her.
- You didn't ask her right.

817
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,444
You gotta be more forceful in these matters.

818
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:35,347
Dames like to be bossed.
Now, you take me...

819
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:36,511
I did my best.

820
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:38,282
You can do better. You better do better.

821
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:40,687
- All you can do is ask.
- We accept.

822
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:42,149
You're in.

823
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:46,692
Now, wait a minute. There might be
a couple of reasons, a couple of details.

824
00:49:46,764 --> 00:49:50,791
You can settle the details up between you.
All I'm interested in is results.

825
00:49:50,868 --> 00:49:52,995
I'm a man who looks at things broadly, see?

826
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,368
- I'm a man who...
- Now, wait...

827
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,471
I'll go!

828
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:04,205
I almost forgot. Congratulations!

829
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:07,242
Thanks.

830
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:34,706
- What was that shooting?
- Nothing.

831
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:38,509
He was just practicing.

832
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:45,888
- It frightened me!
- There's nothing to be frightened about.

833
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,418
Only, he wants us to get married
right away, Trudy...

834
00:50:50,494 --> 00:50:53,190
- and he was very firm about it.
- Why?

835
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:55,561
You mean because you brought
me home the other morning?

836
00:50:55,632 --> 00:50:58,465
You mustn't start arguing, Trudy.
The whole town's talking.

837
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:00,526
You're in a terrible spot, Trudy.

838
00:51:00,604 --> 00:51:03,164
You've either got to marry me right away...

839
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,403
or tell him the whole truth...

840
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:08,411
which would be terrible.

841
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:11,642
- I can't do it to you, Norval.
- What are you talking about, Trudy?

842
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:14,980
It's just a lucky break for me.
I tried to tell you that.

843
00:51:15,052 --> 00:51:16,815
You're just giving me an opportunity.

844
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:19,412
But that's bigamy!
I'm already married to Ratzkiwatzki.

845
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,653
I can't keep on marrying people,
no matter how sweet they are.

846
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:24,091
I've got it!

847
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:26,391
Norval, don't get so excited!

848
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:31,894
Wait a minute, Trudy, I've got it!

849
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,800
- Don't get so excited, Norval.
- Who's excited?

850
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:37,671
This is airtight and watertight.
It's foolproof and almost legal, Trudy.

851
00:51:37,741 --> 00:51:41,074
And when we get through,
you can divorce that gink and marry me.

852
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:45,309
- Norval, take it easy.
- It's a cinch. It's almost an inspiration!

853
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:48,818
Now, will you go to the movies
with me tomorrow night, the early show?

854
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:51,446
- Of course. I'll be glad to.
- That's all there is to it.

855
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:53,752
I'll get everything ready and I'll go this way.

856
00:51:53,824 --> 00:51:55,792
I don't want to meet your father just yet.

857
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,123
- Norval, wait a minute.
- Don't worry about a thing.

858
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:01,653
- It's just as easy as falling off a log.
- But, Norval...

859
00:52:01,832 --> 00:52:03,231
Darling!

860
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,827
- Did you break anything, dear?
- Nothing but my back.

861
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:16,173
Who, me? No. It's for my aunt in the East.

862
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:20,273
She dropped hers down a rat hole...
A crack in the floor...

863
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,648
so I'm getting this as a surprise for her.

864
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,483
Her finger felt kind of naked.

865
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:27,854
- I can't do it, Norval!
- But, Mr. Swartz...

866
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,085
They wrote me a letter.

867
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:32,322
- But it's just to wear around...
- Wool is very scarce.

868
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:35,991
- "We've got to save it for the soldiers."
- Well, how about cotton?

869
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:40,059
"Cotton is very scarcer."
It says so in the next paragraph somewhere.

870
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:42,196
What for do you want
for a uniform for, anyhow?

871
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:45,105
- I wouldn't want you to tell anybody.
- Norval!

872
00:52:45,175 --> 00:52:48,838
Well, it's just to put...
I mean, to wear around the house.

873
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:52,177
- When you've always wanted...
- How about an Indian suit with feathers?

874
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:54,012
That? No, thank you.

875
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:57,110
- Wait! Just to wear around the house?
- Well, in the yard, maybe.

876
00:52:57,187 --> 00:52:58,779
- I got it!
- You have? You got it?

877
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:01,017
- It ain't the latest.
- What does that matter?

878
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:02,388
You got the shoes, too?

879
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:05,189
I'll even throw in the gun.
For $5 you got the whole works.

880
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:08,231
And you can play soldier
till your feet wear out.

881
00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:11,563
- That's very kind of you, Mr. Swartz.
- Very kind of you, Norval.

882
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:13,330
You can have the steel helmet, too.

883
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:16,497
But that's bigamy just as much as
if you married him as Norval Jones.

884
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,507
No, it isn't. They do it all the time.

885
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:21,976
When a king wants to get married,
only, he's too busy in his own kingdom...

886
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:23,842
and he can't get over
to the other kingdom...

887
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:26,314
and the other king won't send
the princess over C.O. D...

888
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:28,010
because he doesn't trust the first king.

889
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:31,953
So they send a kind of a phony bridegroom
over and he marries the princess.

890
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:36,152
Except, he doesn't really marry her.
It's what they call "marriage by prexy."

891
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:38,584
I didn't know prexies
could perform marriages.

892
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:39,788
I didn't either.

893
00:53:39,897 --> 00:53:42,127
- Well, it's bigamy.
- It is not!

894
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:00,416
Good evening.

895
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:05,722
I've come to take Trudy to the movies.

896
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,461
- What's so funny about that?
- Nothing.

897
00:54:12,663 --> 00:54:15,962
Shall I tell her I'm here or will you?

898
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,700
What do you want me to do, fire a salute?

899
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,032
Very funny.

900
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,765
- You remember what I told you last night?
- Yes, sir.

901
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:27,434
- Keep thinking about it?
- Yes, sir.

902
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:29,342
- Movie is a very good place.
- Yes, sir.

903
00:54:29,413 --> 00:54:31,005
- You can hold hands.
- Sure.

904
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:32,844
- Snuggle up.
- Fine.

905
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:37,182
- You get the idea?
- Perfectly.

906
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:39,084
Do you want me to come
and sit behind you?

907
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:40,214
No.

908
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:43,883
Okay. Then, I guess that's about all.

909
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:45,920
Trudy!

910
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:51,895
They ain't giving away
a set of dishes tonight, are they?

911
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,869
That must be him. Emmy, get my coat.

912
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:55,962
- Keep cool, Trudy.
- I'm cool!

913
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:58,837
- I'm not excited! Hello, Norval.
- Hello, Trudy.

914
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:01,639
We're going to see some
pretty good movies tonight.

915
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:04,338
- You said it, Norval.
- Are you gonna start that stuff now?

916
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:05,972
Well, goodbye, Papa.

917
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:09,416
- Goodbye, Mr. Kockenlocker.
- Goodbye, Emmy.

918
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:10,783
- Goodbye, Emmy.
- Goodbye, honey.

919
00:55:10,854 --> 00:55:14,290
What's all the goodbying for?
They're seeing a couple of bum features.

920
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:15,757
Three features.

921
00:55:15,826 --> 00:55:17,191
<i>The Bride Wore Purple...</i>

922
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,593
<i>The Road to Reno,</i>
and <i>Are Husbands Necessary?</i>

923
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:24,623
- And then home! No boogie-woogie!
- Papa, can't you be more refined?

924
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:26,828
Goodbye and watch your step!

925
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:29,235
Papa!

926
00:55:31,274 --> 00:55:33,902
What's going on around here, anyway?

927
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:38,644
- It's about 25 miles.
- I'm going to die before we get there.

928
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:42,446
There's nothing to be nervous about.
There's a justice of the peace.

929
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:44,248
- You got the uniform?
- It's in the back.

930
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:45,788
- And the ring?
- It's in the uniform.

931
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:48,825
- How do you look in it?
- I don't know. I haven't tried it on yet.

932
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:52,123
Now, look. There's one thing
we've got to settle on.

933
00:55:52,195 --> 00:55:55,653
- What was his first name?
- You mean Ratzkiwatzki?

934
00:55:55,732 --> 00:55:57,962
- Naturally.
- Does he have to have a first name?

935
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:00,936
Of course he has to have a first name.
Everybody has a first name.

936
00:56:01,004 --> 00:56:04,167
Even dogs have first names,
even if he hasn't got any last name.

937
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:07,301
Well, I don't know.
I had an uncle named Roscoe.

938
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:09,470
- Roscoe! "He eats them alive!"
- What?

939
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:11,104
That's a snake eater's name!

940
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:14,776
- Well, it was my uncle's name.
- Well, how about Hugo?

941
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:16,079
Phooey.

942
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:17,916
Well, how about Otis?

943
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:19,046
- That was...
- Phooey.

944
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:22,114
- That was my father's name.
- I'm sorry.

945
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:25,684
It doesn't matter. You can call him
Montmorency for all I care.

946
00:56:25,762 --> 00:56:28,424
- What goes good with Ratzkiwatzki?
- Nothing.

947
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:30,989
How about Ignatz?

948
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:34,265
Ignatz! You'd have to take
bicarbonate with that one.

949
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:38,034
Ignatz Ratzkiwatzki. Yeah, that fits all right.

950
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:39,166
Phooey.

951
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:41,506
It's all very well to sit there
and say "phooey"...

952
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:44,809
but I've got to find a first name
before we get there.

953
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:46,610
All right, Ignatz.

954
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:53,250
It's funny having almost our first fight
on the way to the altar.

955
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:55,086
Well, it isn't like having a bad fight.

956
00:56:55,158 --> 00:56:59,754
It's more like people have
when they're picking out a name for their...

957
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,596
You mustn't think about that, Trudy.
Remember what it says in the Bible:

958
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:08,397
"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."

959
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:12,374
And there isn't going to be any evil, Trudy.
Never for you.

960
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:14,009
Thank you, Norval.

961
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:17,808
- I bought you something.
- Thank you, Norval.

962
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:19,849
Please don't do that.

963
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:24,784
It's just that I feel almost as if
it was me marrying you.

964
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:27,016
I wish it were, Norval, so much.

965
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,890
- You really mean that, Trudy?
- Of course I do.

966
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:31,950
Look out!

967
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:34,625
It doesn't seem to be such a very good fit.

968
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:37,461
There seems to be
something wrong with it, Norval.

969
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:39,297
This must be the cavalry or something.

970
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:41,735
I haven't seen anything
like this around here.

971
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:42,829
What are those things?

972
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:45,101
I guess they go around your legs
or something.

973
00:57:45,175 --> 00:57:48,008
Maybe it's a tropical uniform,
like General MacArthur wears.

974
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:52,174
Well, I never saw any pictures of
General MacArthur looking like this.

975
00:57:52,716 --> 00:57:55,514
- What happened?
- I'm afraid to find out.

976
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:57,677
Norval.

977
00:57:57,754 --> 00:58:00,188
There seems to be
another seat left, anyway.

978
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:03,687
- Couldn't you hoist them up a little?
- Be careful!

979
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,092
How many seats do you think
these pants have, anyway?

980
00:58:06,163 --> 00:58:08,393
- I'm sorry.
- Well, how do I look?

981
00:58:08,532 --> 00:58:12,161
Well, you don't look like General MacArthur.

982
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:22,005
- Good evening.
- We'd like to be married.

983
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:23,705
Straight ahead, please.

984
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:32,454
Another army couple, Jake.

985
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:36,549
Just take it easy.
It'll all be over in a minute.

986
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:39,424
- I wish it were all over now.
- There's nothing to be nervous...

987
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:42,659
Good evening. Thinking of getting married?
Good idea.

988
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:45,257
- The names, please.
- Gertrude...

989
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:47,462
- How was that again?
- Gertrude...

990
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:50,973
Take it easy. There's nothing
to be scared of. People do it everyday.

991
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:54,101
- The bad part comes later.
- Gertrude Kockenlocker.

992
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:58,238
- K-O-C-K-E-N-L-O-C-K-E-R.
- L-O-C-K-E-R? That's better.

993
00:58:58,415 --> 00:59:00,212
- And yours, young man?
- Ignatz.

994
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:03,719
Ignatz Ratzki...

995
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:04,981
How was that again?

996
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:08,752
- Ignatz Ratz...
- Now, take it easy, will you?

997
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,795
- L-G-N-A-N-A-T-T-Z.
- R-A-T-Z-W-l-Z-K-l-W-Z.

998
00:59:14,865 --> 00:59:15,957
K-Z, what?

999
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:19,126
- Ratzkiwatzki.
- That's close enough.

1000
00:59:19,402 --> 00:59:20,460
Bride's residence?

1001
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:22,368
17 Genessee Street, Morgan's Creek.

1002
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:26,205
Morgan's Creek. Ever been married before?

1003
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:29,310
I said, you ever been married before?
That's a simple question.

1004
00:59:29,379 --> 00:59:31,609
- No, sir.
- Groom's residence?

1005
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:37,376
What are you doing down there?
What is the groom's residence?

1006
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:39,445
Where do you live, in a tree?

1007
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:42,514
- Your camp.
- Camp Smum.

1008
00:59:42,592 --> 00:59:43,923
Camp what?

1009
00:59:45,562 --> 00:59:47,757
- Smum.
- Where is it located?

1010
00:59:48,431 --> 00:59:51,764
It's located in Smum County.

1011
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:53,893
- Suppose I just put "U.S. Army"?
- Fine.

1012
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,335
- Fine.
- Fine.

1013
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:58,975
- Is there still time?
- Plenty.

1014
00:59:59,409 --> 01:00:01,036
Now, if the witnesses will ever get here...

1015
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:03,545
Miss Sally Blair and my wife
will act as witnesses for you.

1016
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:06,309
Miss Gertrude Kockenlocker
and Mr. Ignatz Ratzkiwatzki Watastki.

1017
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:09,409
Something like that. Or should that be
Pvt. Ignatz and the rest of it?

1018
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:10,976
Are you sure that you love each other?

1019
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:13,249
- What do you think they came here for?
- Are they sure?

1020
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:16,417
Do you want lots of little babies?
And the patter of footsie-wootsies?

1021
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:18,893
You better lay off
or I won't let you be witness anymore.

1022
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:20,429
- Let's get down to business!
- Let's.

1023
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:22,522
Take off your hat. "Ignatz Razly-Wazly.

1024
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:24,590
"Do you take this woman,
Gertrude Sockenbocker...

1025
01:00:24,668 --> 01:00:26,602
"for your lawful wedded wife
to have and hold...

1026
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,934
"to cherish and keep forever,
till death do you part?"

1027
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:30,563
- I do.
- "Gertrude Krockendocker.

1028
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,507
"Do you take Ignatz Razzby-Wadsby
for your lawful wedded husband...

1029
01:00:33,576 --> 01:00:35,373
"to have and hold, in sickness and health...

1030
01:00:35,445 --> 01:00:37,936
"to love, cherish and keep forever
till death do you part?"

1031
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:40,141
- I do.
- Then give me the ring.

1032
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:43,609
Place it on her third finger
and repeat after me:

1033
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:46,155
- With this ring I thee wed.
- "With this ring I thee wed."

1034
01:00:46,222 --> 01:00:48,884
Then with the authority vested in me
by our sovereign state...

1035
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:50,790
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1036
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:57,927
That'll be $2, please.
That's all there is to it. Sign here.

1037
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:00,868
Thank you. That certainly made me nervous.

1038
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:03,497
If you knew what it was like,
it would make you nervouser.

1039
01:01:03,573 --> 01:01:04,631
Jake.

1040
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:08,644
- I've got it, dear.
- Fine. Now, sign there.

1041
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:11,675
It certainly makes me feel much better.

1042
01:01:11,748 --> 01:01:14,512
There you are.
And a little cookbook goes with it...

1043
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:17,382
with best wishes from those
who may have to eat the cooking.

1044
01:01:17,487 --> 01:01:21,856
Don't forget the pitty-patter. I always say,
a childless home is like a homeless child.

1045
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:24,082
Just a minute!

1046
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:26,827
- Who's Norval Jones?
- Norval!

1047
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:30,332
Lock the door, Mariah!
This man is an abductor!

1048
01:01:42,312 --> 01:01:44,075
Get off my lap! What's the matter with you?

1049
01:01:44,147 --> 01:01:47,048
I've got a right to sit on your lap.
I'm your daughter, aren't I?

1050
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:49,745
- That's what they told me.
- I'm nervous.

1051
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:52,720
- What about?
- You don't hear a police siren, do you?

1052
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:55,883
A police siren? That's a tree toad.

1053
01:01:56,426 --> 01:01:58,451
I keep feeling I hear a police siren.

1054
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:01,428
How could you hear a police siren
when there ain't one in town?

1055
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:02,965
I don't know.

1056
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,865
I thought I heard it again there.

1057
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:08,062
How could you hear a police siren when...

1058
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:12,002
- there ain't one in town?
- What's that, a hoot owl?

1059
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:13,607
That's a...

1060
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,891
Make way, please.

1061
01:02:34,397 --> 01:02:37,127
- Hello, Papa.
- Trudy!

1062
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:38,965
What's all this?

1063
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:41,595
What are all you coppers doing in my town?

1064
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:44,367
- Ever see this man before?
- Certainly I've seen him before!

1065
01:02:44,441 --> 01:02:46,136
What're you doing in the outfit, Norval?

1066
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:48,609
All, please take notice
his name is Norval, not Ignatz...

1067
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:50,303
and that is not his regular outfit.

1068
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,076
Who said it was? What are they
supposed to have done anyway?

1069
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:55,845
- You'll find out.
- Go on in the house! Go on.

1070
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:57,714
Clear out of here, folks. Go on.

1071
01:02:57,854 --> 01:03:01,483
Go on home before I pinch you
for loitering! Get out of here!

1072
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,691
He did what? All right, Edmund,
I'll be right over.

1073
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:09,994
Norval's in some mess
with the Kockenlocker girl.

1074
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:12,762
- I don't believe it.
- Nobody asked you to.

1075
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:15,430
Are you nuts or something?
What's the idea of the get-up?

1076
01:03:15,505 --> 01:03:17,200
What war do you think you're in, buddy?

1077
01:03:17,273 --> 01:03:18,672
The ghost of the AEF.

1078
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:20,971
Let's see your dog tags, General.

1079
01:03:21,344 --> 01:03:23,574
No more dog tags than feathers on a fish.

1080
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:25,136
What camp you from, soldier?

1081
01:03:25,215 --> 01:03:28,082
U.S. Marines on one side
and Cavalry on the other.

1082
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:29,982
A horse marine! I always wanted to see one.

1083
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,078
Do you mind if I examine
the evidence, Corporal?

1084
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:35,056
- Sergeant, if it's all the same to you...
- Just leave him alone!

1085
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,615
I can explain everything to my father!

1086
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:39,821
- But can you explain it to the judge?
- What judge! What's the charge?

1087
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:41,796
- I fear there may be several.
- What are they?

1088
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:44,527
If it's all the same to you,
I'm the sheriff of this county...

1089
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:45,932
and will conduct the investigation.

1090
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:49,961
You happen to be in Morgan's Creek
and I happen to be the town constable.

1091
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:52,166
So if anybody's going to conduct
an investigation...

1092
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:55,678
It's a federal matter, as a matter of fact,
so if it's all the same to you...

1093
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:59,181
The way I learned, any man in uniform
is in the Army till proved different.

1094
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:00,682
So we'll just take him over to camp.

1095
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,718
Take your hands off my prisoner!

1096
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:04,412
Good evening, all.

1097
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:08,787
Who did what to who and where, any little
colorful sidelights and stories of interest?

1098
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:11,554
I'm Mr. Johnson, a lawyer.
I represent Norval Jones.

1099
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:14,119
Why, Norval! What are you doing
in your Boy Scout outfit?

1100
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:15,186
Boy Scout outfit?

1101
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,199
He's a mouthpiece.
He knows it's a U.S. Uniform.

1102
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:19,599
- Don't fall for that stuff.
- What are you talking about?

1103
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:21,432
That's a Boy Scout outfit if ever I saw one.

1104
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:24,701
I remember very well when you joined
the Scouts. I said to Mrs. Johnson...

1105
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:26,969
- No.
- It isn't? Of course it isn't!

1106
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:29,477
I remember now.
The Woodsmen of the World.

1107
01:04:29,546 --> 01:04:31,980
The Woodsmen of the World.
I remember when your axe came.

1108
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:34,573
I said to Mrs. Johnson,
"I hope he's not going to chop..."

1109
01:04:34,651 --> 01:04:37,347
No? Very well, Norval.

1110
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:40,752
What's the alleged charge?
It being understood that we admit nothing.

1111
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:44,919
- Trudy! What happened?
- I don't know, Mr. Rafferty.

1112
01:04:47,063 --> 01:04:48,587
Quiet!

1113
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:51,722
Oh, Papa!

1114
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:53,598
Never mind the "Oh, Papa." What happened?

1115
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,297
- Oh, Papa!
- What happened?

1116
01:04:55,371 --> 01:04:56,929
- Everything.
- You go upstairs to bed.

1117
01:04:57,006 --> 01:04:59,770
- This ain't for 14-year-olds. Go on now.
- Piffle!

1118
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:01,707
Will you get off my lap and get out of here?

1119
01:05:01,778 --> 01:05:03,211
She knows all about it, Papa.

1120
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:06,442
She does, does she? How about
letting your old man in on some of the dirt?

1121
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:08,040
Or am I being too snoopy?

1122
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:10,483
You think it's wise?
He'll blab it all over town.

1123
01:05:10,553 --> 01:05:13,488
- Listen, ladder legs...
- It'll be all over town anyway, now.

1124
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:16,719
- Even the secret?
- The secret? This is some secret.

1125
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:18,522
Will you kindly keep your nose out of this?

1126
01:05:18,595 --> 01:05:20,893
It's already been established
the matter's not military!

1127
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:23,057
I told you what you could expect
from that pickle...

1128
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:25,896
You mustn't talk that way about him.
He was only trying his best.

1129
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:28,733
- Imagine if he hadn't been really trying.
- Who signed what?

1130
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:30,773
Who's Katzenjammer
and where does he tend bar?

1131
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,206
- It was Norval. You wouldn't understand.
- Understand it?

1132
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:35,107
You got the certificate? You didn't muff that.

1133
01:05:35,178 --> 01:05:36,702
- I haven't got it.
- What certificate?

1134
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,804
Her marriage certificate.
Why didn't you get it?

1135
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:41,145
- He pulled a gun and...
- Who pulled a gun, that Norval?

1136
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:42,241
Don't try to understand.

1137
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:44,183
Then all those policemen came,
and that's all.

1138
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:46,984
- Who's got the certificate?
- I don't know. The justice, I guess.

1139
01:05:47,056 --> 01:05:49,024
- What certificate?
- Her marriage certificate.

1140
01:05:49,092 --> 01:05:52,027
- To Ratzkiwatzki.
- To Ratzkiwatzki? I told Jones to marry you.

1141
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:56,122
She's already married, perfectly respectably,
to a gentleman called Ratzkiwatzki.

1142
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:58,895
Only she can't prove it.
She hasn't got the certificate.

1143
01:05:58,968 --> 01:06:02,028
- So tonight I married him again.
- Just to get the certificate. See?

1144
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:04,573
- No.
- You have to have a certificate.

1145
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:07,371
- So she married Norval.
- She married Norval?

1146
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:09,741
To prove I was married to Ratzkiwatzki.

1147
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:13,407
But then he signed the wrong name and
now they've got him and we're in the soup.

1148
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:15,974
- I'll shoot him!
- He didn't sign the wrong name on purpose.

1149
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:18,919
- I'll shoot him anyway.
- The one you wanna shoot is Ratzkiwatzki.

1150
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:21,980
- Isn't he Ratzkiwatzki?
- No, I married him a long time ago.

1151
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:24,856
- When?
- The night I was out with Norval.

1152
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:26,485
Can't you understand anything?

1153
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:29,394
They can't agree on anything, Edmund.

1154
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:31,330
Each one wants to put him in his own jail.

1155
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:34,700
If they do, we won't be able
to find him again, let alone get him out.

1156
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:38,229
- Have you got anything against him?
- Nothing except a good kick in the pants.

1157
01:06:38,308 --> 01:06:39,741
I'll tell you what you do.

1158
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:41,902
You take him down
and lock him up in your jail...

1159
01:06:41,978 --> 01:06:43,741
and then they can draw lots
for him tomorrow.

1160
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:45,474
Meantime, we'll sit the whole thing down.

1161
01:06:45,548 --> 01:06:48,517
It's perfectly ridiculous.
They've got 19 charges against that boy.

1162
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:50,814
But he didn't do
any of those things, Mr. Johnson.

1163
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:53,754
He didn't do any of that?
He did all that in the eyes of the law.

1164
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:56,121
- Will you do that for me, Ed?
- All right.

1165
01:06:56,225 --> 01:07:00,093
And what you two ought to have
is good shellacking. Daughters. Phooey.

1166
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:05,828
You're under arrest! Follow me.

1167
01:07:05,902 --> 01:07:07,563
- You can't do that!
- Quiet!

1168
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:10,197
One more crack out of you guys
and I'll lock you all up!

1169
01:07:10,273 --> 01:07:12,332
- Come on, ox brains!
- Norval!

1170
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:14,308
- Don't worry, Trudy.
- I'll be...

1171
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:16,777
- I'll knit you something.
- You'll have lots of time.

1172
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:20,043
Who asked you something? Put away
that gun before you shoot somebody!

1173
01:07:20,116 --> 01:07:23,085
Come on. You get back in the kitchen.
I ain't finished with you.

1174
01:07:23,152 --> 01:07:24,619
Shame on you, Norval Jones!

1175
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:28,248
Shame on you! That'll teach you
to besmirch the name of our fair city.

1176
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:34,855
- I'll take one of those.
- Me, too.

1177
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:38,526
Go on home, folks. There you are.

1178
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:41,227
Go on before I pinch some...

1179
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:48,037
Yeah?

1180
01:07:48,644 --> 01:07:50,544
I wouldn't want this to go no further, see?

1181
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:52,706
But you and your daughter
are in enough trouble...

1182
01:07:52,782 --> 01:07:56,013
without having to annul this marriage
and go through all that rigmarole.

1183
01:07:56,085 --> 01:07:57,575
- You get me?
- No. Go on home now!

1184
01:07:57,653 --> 01:08:00,622
I could've called the cops in
before the ceremony instead of after.

1185
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:03,784
If I don't write it on the books,
it ain't a marriage, is it?

1186
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,953
That's certainly
mighty white of you, brother.

1187
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:08,155
That's all right. I may call on you someday.

1188
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:10,597
Here's your $2. There was no marriage.

1189
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,429
She was saved in the nick of time.

1190
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:14,993
That's mighty white of you brother,
mighty white!

1191
01:08:15,071 --> 01:08:17,733
And here's the last evidence, the certificate.

1192
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,537
Now you see it, now you don't.

1193
01:08:21,043 --> 01:08:23,637
- Not a trace.
- Thank you, brother!

1194
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:27,110
Forget it. I might call on you someday.

1195
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:32,453
- I wonder who else you could marry.
- Emmy! How can you be so heartless?

1196
01:08:32,522 --> 01:08:36,982
I'll love Norval to my dying day.
How could I even look at another man?

1197
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:39,823
I think he's the most wonderful man
that ever lived.

1198
01:08:39,896 --> 01:08:43,024
Yes, but he's going to be in jail,
Trudy, for a long time.

1199
01:08:43,099 --> 01:08:46,933
He can't do you any good in stripes, honey.
You can't be so choosy.

1200
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:48,368
Emmy!

1201
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:56,039
Well, you fixed him...

1202
01:08:56,112 --> 01:08:58,637
and you certainly give us
a good name in the town.

1203
01:08:58,815 --> 01:09:00,908
You spend all your life behaving yourself...

1204
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:03,952
then they find your daughter
in a lovely mess.

1205
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,282
Don't take it that way, Papa.

1206
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:08,118
"Don't take it that way, Papa."
Don't take it what way, Papa?

1207
01:09:08,191 --> 01:09:10,182
You're just a kid.
You can duck down the alleys.

1208
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:12,819
Me, I gotta stand in the middle
of the street and take it...

1209
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:14,522
from every rat in town.

1210
01:09:14,597 --> 01:09:18,033
I'm sorry, Papa.
You told me not to go out that night.

1211
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:21,666
Yeah. I could be wrong, too, you know.

1212
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:24,529
Why don't you come to me
if you're worried about something?

1213
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,770
The trouble with kids is they
figure they're smarter than their parents.

1214
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:30,836
Never stop to think if their old man
could get by for 50 years...

1215
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:34,178
and feed them and clothe them,
he had something up here to get by with.

1216
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,617
Things that seem like brain twisters to you
might be very simple for him.

1217
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:38,984
Like this, for instance.

1218
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:41,387
There's your $2.
You never got married tonight.

1219
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:43,550
- You got nothing to worry about.
- What?

1220
01:09:43,626 --> 01:09:47,084
I got the guy to tear up the certificate.
Just a little politics.

1221
01:09:47,163 --> 01:09:49,063
If you'd have come to me in the first place...

1222
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:51,190
You got the guy to tear up the certificate?

1223
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:53,633
- No!
- What's the matter with you?

1224
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:56,069
If nobody knows you're married
to this Katzenjammer...

1225
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:57,765
and it was all by mistake, anyway...

1226
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,206
with false names a corpse couldn't dig up...

1227
01:10:00,276 --> 01:10:02,904
why do you have to go
around proving things?

1228
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:04,879
Why can't you be practical?

1229
01:10:05,047 --> 01:10:07,311
Shall we tell him or let him linger?

1230
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:10,181
- Tell him what?
- I'm going to have a baby.

1231
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:12,014
You're going to have a baby.

1232
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:15,415
What do you mean,
you're going to have a baby?

1233
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:17,152
I told you he'd blab it all over town!

1234
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:20,855
- That's why we wanted the certificate.
- The one you got the guy to tear up.

1235
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:23,194
The one I got the guy to tear up.

1236
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:37,234
Did Norval know about this
when he asked you to marry him?

1237
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,642
Yes, Papa.

1238
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:41,274
So he gets charged with abduction,
imitating a soldier...

1239
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:44,786
repairing the morals of a minor,
resisting arrest, perjury!

1240
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:46,782
He'll be lucky if he gets life.

1241
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:50,087
When your little surprise package happens,
he'll probably get some more.

1242
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,456
You've got to let him escape.

1243
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:54,360
Sure, and take my pension
right along with him...

1244
01:10:54,697 --> 01:10:58,463
that I've been working 17 years for,
and land in the hoosegow besides!

1245
01:10:58,534 --> 01:11:01,594
Couldn't you think of some bright way?
You always have bright ideas.

1246
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:03,138
Listen, zipperpuss.

1247
01:11:03,205 --> 01:11:06,368
Someday, they're just gonna find
your hair ribbon and an axe someplace.

1248
01:11:06,442 --> 01:11:09,275
Nothing else.
The mystery of Morgan's Creek.

1249
01:11:09,345 --> 01:11:11,643
Papa, that's really not being very helpful.

1250
01:11:11,747 --> 01:11:14,648
Well, what do you want me to do,
learn to knit?

1251
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:17,117
I'm going out for a walk.

1252
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:46,210
Trudy told me what you done for her,
at least, what you tried to do.

1253
01:11:49,685 --> 01:11:52,483
- I didn't understand.
- That's all right.

1254
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:54,522
I'd just as soon she hadn't told you, though.

1255
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:57,286
The less people know about it,
the better it will be for her.

1256
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,124
- It's too bad it had to turn out like this.
- I'll be all right.

1257
01:12:00,196 --> 01:12:03,859
What do you mean, you'll be all right? You
know what they got lined up against you?

1258
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:06,197
What'd you have to take a minor
to a motel for anyway?

1259
01:12:06,268 --> 01:12:07,826
That's no place to take a minor.

1260
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:10,736
I'm not even thinking about that.
I'm so worried about Trudy.

1261
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:13,639
- Well, all she's worried about is you.
- Poor Trudy!

1262
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:17,839
To think that I've got to be locked up
in here at the very time she needs me most.

1263
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:22,048
If I could just get out of here for a while,
I bet you I could find that skunk.

1264
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:23,745
I bet you I could.

1265
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:26,580
I couldn't do it, Norval.
It would cost me my job.

1266
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:31,150
- Why, if I conspired in any way to...
- I didn't mean that, Mr. Kockenlocker.

1267
01:12:31,827 --> 01:12:34,352
I wouldn't do anything
to get you in trouble...

1268
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,728
just when Trudy needs you so much.

1269
01:12:37,133 --> 01:12:38,225
If you got out...

1270
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:42,498
it would have to be without any help
from me in any shape or form whatsoever.

1271
01:12:42,872 --> 01:12:45,067
You'd have to do it all by yourself.

1272
01:12:45,141 --> 01:12:47,871
I wasn't even thinking
about anything like that.

1273
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:51,673
Of course, if turn my back on you...

1274
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:53,271
carelessly like...

1275
01:12:54,684 --> 01:12:57,380
and you happened to grab my blackjack...

1276
01:12:58,087 --> 01:13:00,112
and conk me over the dome with it...

1277
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:04,754
that would be something else.

1278
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:07,660
As if I'd do anything like that,
Mr. Kockenlocker.

1279
01:13:08,998 --> 01:13:12,161
Or if you made a sudden dive for me,
grabbed me around the neck...

1280
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:14,634
spin me, hit me on the jaw.

1281
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:18,129
And while I lie here helplessly, you beat it.

1282
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:20,467
As if I'd do anything like that, either.

1283
01:13:21,143 --> 01:13:24,601
- How did you do in school?
- Who, me? Fine.

1284
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,145
Is that so?

1285
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:30,277
Kind of stuffy in here, ain't it?

1286
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:32,877
- I hadn't noticed it.
- Yes, you had!

1287
01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:35,555
I'll go around the back
and open the window.

1288
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:38,684
- It works from the outside. You get me?
- Yes, sir.

1289
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:42,161
- Way around in the back.
- Thanks very much.

1290
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:51,668
You get me?

1291
01:13:56,212 --> 01:13:59,272
Be careful, Mr. Kockenlocker!

1292
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:12,692
It's a good thing you didn't
try to run away just now.

1293
01:14:12,762 --> 01:14:14,923
I forgot to lock the doors...

1294
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:17,989
and it would take me five minutes
to get down out of this tree.

1295
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,326
You get me?

1296
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:22,063
Don't you worry, Mr. Kockenlocker.
I'll be right here.

1297
01:14:31,113 --> 01:14:33,479
Are you hurt, Mr. Kockenlocker?

1298
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:36,848
I'm all right.
It just knocked the wind out of me.

1299
01:14:37,052 --> 01:14:40,215
Only, I ain't going to do any running
for the next hour or so...

1300
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:42,587
not if you give me a million dollars.
You get me?

1301
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:45,684
- Yes, sir.
- And my gun is way over there someplace.

1302
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:47,323
I'm defenseless.

1303
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:49,330
I'll go get it for you.

1304
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:58,599
All right, you got me, pal! Don't shoot!

1305
01:14:58,674 --> 01:15:00,869
I know when I'm licked.
Just lock me in the jail.

1306
01:15:00,943 --> 01:15:02,740
- The key is in the door.
- No...

1307
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:06,009
Shut up! I know you're going to escape,
but I can't help it.

1308
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:07,514
I can't do anything about it.

1309
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,551
My car is right down in front of my house...

1310
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:12,781
and if you need any gas there's a can
with five gallons in my woodshed.

1311
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:15,187
But you wouldn't take that from me,
would you, pal?

1312
01:15:15,257 --> 01:15:17,953
Of course I wouldn't, Mr. Kockenlocker.

1313
01:15:18,661 --> 01:15:20,526
Maybe I can make things clearer, Norval.

1314
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:28,401
Jiggers! There's somebody in there!

1315
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,252
You get back to bed!

1316
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:56,025
- Papa, he isn't guilty of anything.
- Why isn't he in his cell?

1317
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:58,396
How about keeping your trap shut?
He escaped.

1318
01:15:58,467 --> 01:16:00,935
Can't you see he's got me covered?
Don't shoot, Norval.

1319
01:16:01,003 --> 01:16:01,992
No.

1320
01:16:02,204 --> 01:16:05,196
Papa! You don't think
they'll fire you, do you?

1321
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:07,640
Of course they won't.
I just picked this gun up for him.

1322
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,338
- I'm not going anyplace.
- All right, I give up.

1323
01:16:10,412 --> 01:16:12,903
See if you can do anything with him.

1324
01:16:13,716 --> 01:16:17,709
I want you to go away, Norval.
Don't you understand that, dear?

1325
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:20,755
I couldn't bear to have you in trouble,
on top of everything else.

1326
01:16:20,823 --> 01:16:23,053
But that would only make
matters worse, Trudy.

1327
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:25,116
They can't send me up for very long.

1328
01:16:25,194 --> 01:16:28,925
And, anyway, I'll be happy about it,
because I'll be doing it for you, Trudy.

1329
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:31,556
Every day I'll think, well, this is for Trudy.

1330
01:16:31,634 --> 01:16:35,695
And as soon as I get out we'll straighten it
out somehow and we'll be married again.

1331
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:38,433
But really, Trudy, for always and always.

1332
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:41,408
You're just making me cry,
but you're not helping anything.

1333
01:16:41,477 --> 01:16:42,739
- Don't cry, Trudy!
- Norval!

1334
01:16:42,811 --> 01:16:44,642
What about that guy you were gonna find...

1335
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:46,203
if you could just get out for a while?

1336
01:16:46,282 --> 01:16:48,614
That's right!
Maybe you can find Ratzkiwatzki.

1337
01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:51,346
Of course you can.
Anyway, it's worth trying.

1338
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,409
Do you really think so?

1339
01:16:52,488 --> 01:16:55,218
If I really thought so,
I'd track him to the ends of the earth.

1340
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:57,191
- Of course you can.
- But I haven't any car.

1341
01:16:57,259 --> 01:16:58,317
- Steal mine.
- It's insured.

1342
01:16:58,394 --> 01:17:01,295
- Shut up!
- Lf I was really sure it was for you, Trudy...

1343
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:03,831
and not for selfish reasons,
I'd need a little money.

1344
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:06,697
I've got $900 in the bank,
only, it's in bonds.

1345
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:09,363
Would it be wrong if I took $900 in cash...

1346
01:17:09,438 --> 01:17:11,497
and left my bonds?
I've got a key at the house.

1347
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:13,598
It might be wrong,
but it would be very handy.

1348
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:19,006
All we needed was a little bank robbery.

1349
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,617
- Will you get out of here?
- I'll be all right, Papa.

1350
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:37,296
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

1351
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:39,560
Why don't you look where you're going?

1352
01:17:44,606 --> 01:17:47,166
I'll leave a note the minute I get through.

1353
01:17:47,643 --> 01:17:49,941
You have to be very careful with this.

1354
01:17:50,145 --> 01:17:53,376
You have to know exactly
what to do or else...

1355
01:17:54,116 --> 01:17:55,583
it'll set off the alarm.

1356
01:17:55,651 --> 01:17:57,414
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

1357
01:18:05,894 --> 01:18:07,418
Beat it!

1358
01:18:13,702 --> 01:18:15,795
Come on, Emmy.

1359
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:17,668
- Goodbye, Norval.
- Goodbye, Trudy.

1360
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:21,836
- Beat it, Norval.
- Norval, you've got to hurry! Goodbye.

1361
01:18:22,444 --> 01:18:24,207
Go on, Norval!

1362
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:30,551
Tie me up, quick! Come on!
Around here. Tie it tight. Come on!

1363
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:34,419
Yes, Papa. Here, Emmy. Swing him.

1364
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:44,395
All right, not so hard!
What are you trying to do, strangle me?

1365
01:18:44,466 --> 01:18:47,435
All right, that's tight enough.
Now, a little clunk on the head.

1366
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:51,098
Take the blackjack out of my pocket,
lock the door, beat it home, hide the keys.

1367
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:53,505
- All right, Papa. Which side?
- Any side! Harder!

1368
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:57,306
But not too hard! Harder.
How could that knock anybody out?

1369
01:18:57,546 --> 01:19:01,312
Is that all the harder you can hit?
Will you try to do one thing right?

1370
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:04,352
- Here!
- Papa!

1371
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:06,713
Emmy!

1372
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:09,755
Papa, did we hurt you?

1373
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:14,494
Wait a minute! Never mind the details.
Is the girl married or isn't she married?

1374
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,463
It's a matter of state honor.
A matter of public weal!

1375
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:21,629
I'm very sorry, Mr. Governor, but nobody
knows whether she's married or not.

1376
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:24,103
She's got to be married,
that's all there is to it!

1377
01:19:24,206 --> 01:19:27,141
We can't have a thing like that
hanging over our fair state...

1378
01:19:27,209 --> 01:19:28,733
besmirching our fair name.

1379
01:19:28,811 --> 01:19:31,177
- <i>Where is the father now?</i>
- In jail.

1380
01:19:31,246 --> 01:19:32,440
What do you mean he's in jail?

1381
01:19:32,514 --> 01:19:35,244
Do you realize he's one of the most
famous men in the world?

1382
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:38,150
- I thought you said he escaped.
- He did say he escaped.

1383
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,018
Yes, but he came back
and got caught again.

1384
01:19:41,356 --> 01:19:42,448
- When?
- Yes.

1385
01:19:42,524 --> 01:19:43,548
<i>Yesterday.</i>

1386
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:46,617
<i>It must have been around 6:00,</i>
<i>I guess, because Mr. Tuerck...</i>

1387
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:50,461
<i>was still in the bank with the Christmas Club</i>
<i>and Mr. Rafferty was in his store.</i>

1388
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:52,466
<i>It was closer to 7:00.</i>

1389
01:20:06,882 --> 01:20:09,942
- They left about six months ago.
- Six months ago?

1390
01:20:10,052 --> 01:20:13,852
They left kind of hurriedly, right after
he was discharged by the town council.

1391
01:20:13,922 --> 01:20:15,082
Discharged? What for?

1392
01:20:15,157 --> 01:20:18,456
It had to do with the escape of a prisoner.
They didn't quite believe it.

1393
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:20,051
- You mean me?
- I guess so, Norval.

1394
01:20:20,129 --> 01:20:23,292
But that's terrible!
I was just trying to help Trudy.

1395
01:20:23,599 --> 01:20:26,295
Looking for someone I never found.

1396
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:29,394
But you wouldn't know
about that, or would you?

1397
01:20:29,471 --> 01:20:31,496
I don't know what you're talking about,
Norval.

1398
01:20:31,573 --> 01:20:34,565
Anyway, now that I'm back and
ready to give myself up, I guess...

1399
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:37,612
they'll take Mr. Kockenlocker back
on the job all right, won't they?

1400
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,137
I hardly think so, Norval. Besides, you know
what Mr. Kockenlocker is like.

1401
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:45,209
He didn't exactly take it lying down when
they fired him. He left on very bad terms.

1402
01:20:45,287 --> 01:20:47,881
They had to take six stitches
in Mr. Tuerck alone.

1403
01:20:47,956 --> 01:20:49,753
- Poor Trudy.
- Poor Mr. Tuerck.

1404
01:20:49,825 --> 01:20:50,951
It was ghastly.

1405
01:20:51,026 --> 01:20:54,325
You haven't asked my advice, Norval,
and it certainly isn't up to me...

1406
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:58,059
to advise you to evade the law, but since
you were dragged into this situation...

1407
01:20:58,133 --> 01:21:01,762
and it's practically forgotten now anyway,
and the Kockenlockers have gone...

1408
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:05,466
probably taken root someplace else.
They may have even changed their names.

1409
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:08,704
- Why don't you do the same?
- I'm sure it would be wiser, Norval.

1410
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:12,575
But I couldn't do that, Mrs. Johnson.
I've just got to find Trudy.

1411
01:21:12,714 --> 01:21:14,705
She must be in terrible trouble now.

1412
01:21:14,783 --> 01:21:16,842
I've given you my very best advice, Norval.

1413
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:19,046
It's up to you to act
as your conscience dictates...

1414
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:21,453
but if there were
that many charges pending over me...

1415
01:21:21,523 --> 01:21:23,388
you wouldn't see my coattail for the dust.

1416
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:26,950
Even if they didn't press the Kockenlocker
charges, there's the uniform...

1417
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:31,728
- the jail break, the bank robbery.
- Bank robbery? But I took my own money.

1418
01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:33,831
Norval, I'm so glad.

1419
01:21:33,902 --> 01:21:37,531
So am I, but that isn't exactly what
Mr. Tuerck allowed us to understand.

1420
01:21:37,906 --> 01:21:39,396
Holy mackerel!

1421
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:41,940
Goodbye, Mrs. Johnson.

1422
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,602
- Goodbye, Mr. Johnson.
- Goodbye, Norval.

1423
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,044
Thank you. Goodbye.

1424
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:47,775
Norval, wouldn't you like to take
some fruitcake with you?

1425
01:21:47,849 --> 01:21:51,842
No, thank you, Mrs. Johnson.
I'm afraid I couldn't swallow it.

1426
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,317
- Merry Christmas, dear.
- Merry Christmas to you.

1427
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:10,231
- Merry Christmas, Mr. And Mrs. Shottish.
- And a merry Christmas to you, Mr. Rafferty.

1428
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:13,297
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Rafferty.
- Many happy returns.

1429
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,641
- Hello, Mr. Rafferty.
- What are you doing here?

1430
01:22:20,716 --> 01:22:24,015
- Don't tell me! You're just in time.
- Do you know where Trudy is?

1431
01:22:24,086 --> 01:22:28,614
I know from nothing. Wait a minute.
I'm just going to see her.

1432
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:31,789
You'll take them around a turkey.

1433
01:22:59,788 --> 01:23:02,621
You'll buy at the bakery a plum pudding.

1434
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:06,784
Nothing gives so much indigestion,
at the same time so much pleasure...

1435
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:08,921
like a plum pudding, except a fruitcake.

1436
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:11,659
One time when I was a boy...

1437
01:23:13,268 --> 01:23:15,498
Good evening, Mr. Rafferty,
and you, Mr. Jones.

1438
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:17,731
I wondered if you'd come back.

1439
01:23:35,257 --> 01:23:37,748
Anyway, we're going to have
a white Christmas.

1440
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:42,320
Why don't you say something?

1441
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,535
How about a little smile?

1442
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:57,043
You've got to have more confidence
in the Almighty...

1443
01:23:57,112 --> 01:23:59,842
or whatever it is
that makes the wheels go round.

1444
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:02,315
All right? It's almost Christmas.

1445
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:05,011
Where was he born? In a cowshed.

1446
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:08,715
You might be waiting
for the President of the United States.

1447
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:10,951
You got to have more confidence.

1448
01:24:11,026 --> 01:24:14,291
Speaking of cowsheds, did you remember
to milk Bessie tonight, Papa?

1449
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:17,298
Yes, I remembered
to milk Bessie tonight, Papa.

1450
01:24:17,366 --> 01:24:21,735
- Then what's she doing in the kitchen?
- What? Will you get out of here?

1451
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:25,335
Come on, get out of here! Come on.

1452
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:27,605
Poor Papa.

1453
01:24:36,918 --> 01:24:38,180
Hello, Mr. Rafferty.

1454
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:40,813
- It's so good to see you.
- I've brought you a turkey.

1455
01:24:40,889 --> 01:24:44,586
- Hello, Mr. Rafferty.
- Trudy. Feeling good?

1456
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,423
It's natural.

1457
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:50,431
Thank you, Mr. Rafferty,
and for all your kindness.

1458
01:24:50,499 --> 01:24:52,831
I don't know where we would have been
without you.

1459
01:24:52,901 --> 01:24:54,926
What are you talking? It's a privilege.

1460
01:24:55,003 --> 01:24:59,372
The doctor will come from the next town,
then he'll go back to his town and forget it.

1461
01:24:59,441 --> 01:25:04,037
You got nothing to worry about.
It'll be as quiet as a buttered eagle.

1462
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:05,977
Would you have a cup of tea, Mr. Rafferty?

1463
01:25:06,047 --> 01:25:07,480
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1464
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:08,538
How's Papa?

1465
01:25:08,617 --> 01:25:10,380
Fine, thank you. He's out with Bessie.

1466
01:25:10,452 --> 01:25:13,444
That Bessie, I remember her.
Never satisfied.

1467
01:25:13,922 --> 01:25:16,254
I brought Papa back his car.

1468
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,217
But Norval had it.

1469
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,126
You mean he came back? Where is he?
Why didn't he come out with you?

1470
01:25:23,031 --> 01:25:25,329
He didn't find anybody
while he was away, Trudy.

1471
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,527
That's no reason for him
not to come out to see me.

1472
01:25:27,602 --> 01:25:30,696
He ought to know better than that,
when I've been waiting so long...

1473
01:25:30,772 --> 01:25:33,639
- so anxiously to see him.
- That ain't why he didn't come back.

1474
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:37,371
- They caught him again. He's in jail.
- Mr. Rafferty!

1475
01:25:38,313 --> 01:25:42,215
Now, what good is this?
You've got something else to think about.

1476
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:45,111
So he's in jail, so he'll get out someday.

1477
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:48,588
All right. I'll go back to Morgan's Creek
and I'll tell them everything.

1478
01:25:48,657 --> 01:25:52,115
They'll have to drop the charges
when I tell them what he did and why.

1479
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:54,719
What are you talking?
How about your reputation?

1480
01:25:54,796 --> 01:25:58,459
We spend six months planning,
fixing everything, building up a secret.

1481
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:01,229
- Now you got to build it down, overnight?
- I've got to.

1482
01:26:01,303 --> 01:26:04,636
All right, you don't care about yourself.
How about your father?

1483
01:26:04,706 --> 01:26:06,230
Ain't he got enough trouble?

1484
01:26:06,308 --> 01:26:08,776
How about your sister?
How about me? How about...

1485
01:26:08,844 --> 01:26:10,368
Anyway, they wouldn't believe you.

1486
01:26:10,445 --> 01:26:11,707
They will when they see me.

1487
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:14,476
Trudy, will you listen to...

1488
01:26:14,683 --> 01:26:17,151
What's the use? I love you for it.

1489
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,444
There.

1490
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:23,521
You still have time to change your mind.

1491
01:26:23,592 --> 01:26:26,993
Why don't you, Trudy?
I'll get him out on bail, and...

1492
01:26:35,003 --> 01:26:38,166
Either we make an example of this man,
or we're opening the doors...

1493
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,071
- and inviting crime in to dinner.
- Piffle.

1494
01:26:40,141 --> 01:26:41,540
It may be piffle in your book...

1495
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:45,569
but I say that breaking and entering,
theft, perjury, impersonating a soldier...

1496
01:26:45,647 --> 01:26:49,174
impairing the morals of a minor,
jailbreak, with or without conspiracy...

1497
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:52,118
et cetera, et cetera, are not piffle!

1498
01:26:52,187 --> 01:26:54,155
- Piffle.
- You say that once more, Johnson...

1499
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:55,587
- and I'll...
- Piffle.

1500
01:26:55,657 --> 01:26:58,148
Gentlemen, please!

1501
01:26:58,393 --> 01:27:01,089
There's a great deal to be said
for both sides.

1502
01:27:01,162 --> 01:27:02,288
Hey.

1503
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:12,406
My daughter wants to see you.

1504
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:14,772
- Right away.
- What are you doing in Morgan's Creek?

1505
01:27:14,843 --> 01:27:17,676
I warned you that if you ever showed
up in this town again...

1506
01:27:17,746 --> 01:27:19,873
- Yeah?
- Gentlemen, is this the Christmas spirit?

1507
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:22,348
What is it that you want, Mr. Kockenlocker?

1508
01:27:22,417 --> 01:27:26,251
My daughter wants to tell you about
Norval, why he done what he done.

1509
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:28,482
She says when you hear
what she has to say...

1510
01:27:28,557 --> 01:27:29,819
you'll never prosecute him.

1511
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:31,415
- Impossible.
- You see?

1512
01:27:31,493 --> 01:27:34,223
Well, bring her up.
We must hear both sides, always.

1513
01:27:34,296 --> 01:27:35,888
That is strictly the bunk.

1514
01:27:35,964 --> 01:27:38,194
Women are always trying
to take the blame for men.

1515
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,029
It's what you call a mother instinct.

1516
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:42,035
You can listen to her, can't you, you dumb...

1517
01:27:42,103 --> 01:27:45,971
Or I'll take my business out of your bank
so quick it will make your hair sizzle.

1518
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:47,030
Gentlemen. Bring her up.

1519
01:27:47,108 --> 01:27:49,201
I'm afraid you'll have to come down.

1520
01:27:49,411 --> 01:27:50,969
She don't feel very good.

1521
01:27:51,046 --> 01:27:52,035
Really?

1522
01:27:52,447 --> 01:27:55,416
Is that so? Well.

1523
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:57,811
Yes. What about it, you dumb...

1524
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:58,975
Gentlemen!

1525
01:27:59,087 --> 01:28:00,384
Papa!

1526
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:09,387
- Trudy! Trudy is...
- Trudy?

1527
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:13,160
Well, what are you standing there?
Doctor! Come quick!

1528
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:13,850
Some secret.

1529
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:16,158
So they know. So what do they know?

1530
01:29:22,837 --> 01:29:25,863
Have you any statement to make?
Any little item of general interest?

1531
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:28,704
- How would you like a punch in the nose?
- Mr. Kockenlocker!

1532
01:29:28,777 --> 01:29:30,108
Now, let me handle this.

1533
01:29:30,178 --> 01:29:33,545
- How much would it take to keep this quiet?
- Mr. Rafferty.

1534
01:29:34,482 --> 01:29:35,915
- It's a boy.
- A boy!

1535
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:39,078
Trudy! That's wonderful! <i>Mazel tov!</i>

1536
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:41,054
- Congratulations, Edmund.
- For what?

1537
01:29:41,122 --> 01:29:44,250
A boy is a boy.
No matter how you look at it, it's...

1538
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:53,364
- Twins!
- Twins! That's wonderful!

1539
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:55,466
- Why are you crying?
- Why are you laughing?

1540
01:29:55,537 --> 01:29:58,506
- Congratulations again, Edmund.
- Please be quiet.

1541
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:00,564
Kindly remember this is a hospital.

1542
01:30:01,509 --> 01:30:04,910
- I'd like to get a few more facts.
- Will you get out of here?

1543
01:30:06,614 --> 01:30:09,606
Now, where have you been living
for the last six months?

1544
01:30:14,289 --> 01:30:18,157
Thank you very much. I have all I need.
I'll be getting back to the office.

1545
01:30:40,915 --> 01:30:44,510
If you don't mind,
I guess I'll stick around a minute or two.

1546
01:31:02,403 --> 01:31:04,735
Did she do that? My eyes ain't so good.

1547
01:31:04,806 --> 01:31:06,398
- Did she do what?
- That!

1548
01:31:06,474 --> 01:31:07,998
You don't suppose that...

1549
01:31:08,076 --> 01:31:10,874
- Whoopee!
- Everybody, just keep calm.

1550
01:31:10,945 --> 01:31:12,139
What?

1551
01:31:13,148 --> 01:31:15,309
- Papa!
- Will you get off my neck?

1552
01:31:16,384 --> 01:31:18,181
Everybody keep calm!

1553
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,314
How is she, Doctor?

1554
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:21,787
Wonderful!

1555
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:25,716
Six! All boys!

1556
01:31:44,112 --> 01:31:47,479
You mean he's still in jail,
you dumb blockhead?

1557
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:48,948
- Yes.
- Well, get him out.

1558
01:31:49,017 --> 01:31:52,646
But how can I, Mr. Governor,
with all those charges against him?

1559
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,587
By dropping those charges, you dumb cluck.

1560
01:31:55,657 --> 01:31:56,919
You wealhead!

1561
01:31:56,991 --> 01:31:58,959
Now, get me that banker on the phone.

1562
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:01,518
- His charter is cancelled!
- And the justice of the peace!

1563
01:32:01,596 --> 01:32:03,826
His license is revoked
and his motel is condemned.

1564
01:32:03,898 --> 01:32:05,991
Do you want the MPs and U.S. Men, too?

1565
01:32:06,067 --> 01:32:07,295
What have they got to do with it?

1566
01:32:07,368 --> 01:32:10,269
- That was a state guard uniform.
- I can see it from here.

1567
01:32:10,338 --> 01:32:11,999
As a matter of fact, he's a colonel in it.

1568
01:32:12,073 --> 01:32:15,304
- I'm bringing him his commission tomorrow.
- Retroactive as of last year.

1569
01:32:15,376 --> 01:32:16,638
Go out and get him a uniform.

1570
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:50,367
There's only one thing more,
Mr. Governor, the marriage.

1571
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:52,208
- What's the matter with her marriage?
- Yeah!

1572
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,646
She's married to Norval Jones.
She always has been.

1573
01:32:54,716 --> 01:32:55,978
The guy married them, didn't he?

1574
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:57,813
The boy signed his right name, didn't he?

1575
01:32:57,886 --> 01:33:00,514
But he gave his name as Ratzkiwatzki.

1576
01:33:00,588 --> 01:33:02,579
He was trying to say Jones. He stuttered.

1577
01:33:02,657 --> 01:33:04,921
What are you looking for,
needles in a haystack?

1578
01:33:04,993 --> 01:33:08,019
- Then how about the first Ratzkiwatzki?
- He's annulled.

1579
01:33:08,096 --> 01:33:10,963
- Who annulled him?
- The judge, who do you suppose?

1580
01:33:11,032 --> 01:33:13,057
- Retroactive.
- Get Judge Mendoza on the phone.

1581
01:33:13,134 --> 01:33:14,829
- I'm getting it.
- He's out of the picture.

1582
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:17,337
- He was never in it.
- Get me those guys on the phone.

1583
01:33:17,405 --> 01:33:19,737
Who do they think they are, anyway?
Hello, Mendoza.

1584
01:33:19,807 --> 01:33:21,570
Fooling with the honor of our fair state!

1585
01:33:45,934 --> 01:33:48,266
- Hello, Mr. Kockenlocker.
- How's Trudy?

1586
01:33:48,336 --> 01:33:51,396
She's sleeping, but she'll see you
in a few minutes. Come on!

1587
01:33:51,472 --> 01:33:53,133
I wouldn't want to get you in wrong again.

1588
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:56,074
Get me in wrong, I'm the chief!
Where have you been?

1589
01:33:56,144 --> 01:33:58,442
- Right here.
- Haven't you heard about...

1590
01:33:58,513 --> 01:33:59,639
About what?

1591
01:33:59,714 --> 01:34:02,706
- You mean she's had it?
- Has she had it?

1592
01:34:03,084 --> 01:34:04,642
You'd better come and see your wife.

1593
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:08,587
- My wife? I'm not...
- Yes, you are, my boy!

1594
01:34:40,722 --> 01:34:41,882
Quiet!

1595
01:35:47,688 --> 01:35:48,916
Norval.

1596
01:35:50,124 --> 01:35:51,113
Trudy.

1597
01:35:52,293 --> 01:35:54,386
You look so beautiful.

1598
01:35:54,529 --> 01:35:57,521
- Where did you get...
- I don't know. The Governor sent it.

1599
01:35:57,598 --> 01:36:00,999
- You look so beautiful.
- I love you.

1600
01:36:01,069 --> 01:36:05,096
Your father said...
I don't understand exactly how...

1601
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:09,940
I don't understand a lot of things.
But I'm out of jail now...

1602
01:36:11,546 --> 01:36:15,482
and we're really married, Trudy.
For always and always.

1603
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,277
I'm so happy.

1604
01:36:17,752 --> 01:36:19,049
I love you.

1605
01:36:20,421 --> 01:36:22,082
You're a papa now.

1606
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:24,654
I feel like one, anyway.

1607
01:36:25,093 --> 01:36:26,458
You are one.

1608
01:36:27,028 --> 01:36:29,622
The papa gives love and protection.

1609
01:36:29,997 --> 01:36:33,330
I'll do the best I can, Trudy,
for always and always.

1610
01:36:33,768 --> 01:36:36,134
We'll have to pick out a name for it.

1611
01:36:36,337 --> 01:36:38,328
Was it a boy or a girl?

1612
01:36:40,541 --> 01:36:42,065
I'll find out.

1613
01:36:42,777 --> 01:36:44,267
I'm so happy.

1614
01:36:59,827 --> 01:37:01,795
Was it a boy or a girl?

1615
01:38:07,962 --> 01:38:09,224
