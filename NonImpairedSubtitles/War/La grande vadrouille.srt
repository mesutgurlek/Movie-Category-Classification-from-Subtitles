1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,959
An RAF bomber

2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,959
Night attack over Germany

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,952
Operation codename "Tea for 2"

4
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,050
Water's nippy this morning, isn't it?

5
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:07,061
Come quickly

6
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:12,053
Take my hand

7
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:20,061
American?

8
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:22,062
No, English.

9
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:28,067
Hurry up, the zoo will open soon.
Germans are everywhere.

10
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:33,067
Give me the parachute.

11
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:36,060
Take all your things.

12
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:29,083
Get back up!

13
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:34,076
He's gonna make me fall!

14
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:18,094
I'm sorry...

15
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,099
Did I dirty your uniform?

16
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,099
This is a misunderstanding.

17
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:37,100
No way.

18
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:50,097
I'm coming up.

19
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:55,098
Stop shooting. Search the houses
and take them alive.

20
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:10,101
This is not a place to land!
Are you injured?

21
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:24,106
Very high.

22
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:23,139
Thank you Gentlemen. It was very good.

23
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:27,147
You over there: very good.

24
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:30,150
You were good, well so so...

25
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,149
You over there, we did no hear you.
We never hear you.

26
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,149
You do nothing but chit-chat
You better behave.

27
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:38,150
I have a personal vision of this work.

28
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:43,145
Not triumphant enough,
Not proud enough!

29
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:49,153
All this is mush actually.

30
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:51,154
It was not bad,
It was very bad.

31
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:53,198
Let's start again from Number 17

32
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:25,165
No Sir, chit-chatting again!

33
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,166
Stay focused.
Goodness gracious, you are talkative!

34
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,208
From Number 17 again

35
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:39,167
Who did this?

36
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:41,169
Me, Maestro

37
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:43,169
Where do you think you are?
The Opera, Maestro.

38
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,670
Amusing. Out!

39
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:48,172
Mephisto, Marguerite, Faust, out!

40
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:51,173
I want nobody here when I'm working!

41
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:53,715
Only Berlioz and I.

42
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:57,173
Keep it down please.

43
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:01,176
Sorry Mr Lefort.

44
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:03,168
Number 17

45
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:13,179
More flamboyant please.
Like lightning before thunder.

46
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:18,173
Are you coming darling?
In a minute.

47
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:25,175
Bébert, the explosives.

48
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,182
Wires
Make sure there's nobody outside.

49
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:34,176
You plug the hole.

50
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:45,189
If you keep making so much noise,
Lefort will poke his nose in our business.

51
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,188
Are you done?
Ready to blow.

52
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,187
This flower is poking out.
Do not touch it!

53
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,182
My wire is connected to it.
You'd blow the whole thing.

54
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:06,194
Silence!

55
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,194
Search everywhere.

56
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:12,187
Lights!

57
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:20,190
Everyone stay put.
Leaving is forbidden!

58
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:25,197
A British paratrooper has hidden
in the opera house

59
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,192
Anyone giving him assistance
will be shot

60
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:35,203
Herr Conductor, we have shot down
a British bomber over Paris.

61
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:40,194
Two pilots are hiding here.

62
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:43,204
Very sorry to interrupt your rehearsal.

63
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:46,205
You heard the man...

64
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:50,203
Machine guns have reduced our
rehearsal to 12 minutes.

65
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:55,198
It will be a nice performance tonight!

66
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,201
Let me through.

67
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:08,205
The nerve.
Stopping a rehearsal!

68
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:18,239
I am French... The Germans...
Please help.

69
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:30,253
I am fed up, fed up!

70
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:36,253
Open the door
or we break it open.

71
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:38,255
Yes, yes, I'm coming!

72
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:41,253
Sorry Gentlemen.
This is a global house search.

73
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:43,257
Me too I'm fed up!

74
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:49,258
Shut up, you pain in the ass.
Can't you see we have visitors?

75
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:54,250
Do not mind her, please come in

76
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:01,260
You are lucky.
Your wife is far away.

77
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:04,261
You there soldier,
since you're here.

78
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:07,262
Catch this suitcase
and put it on the bed.

79
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:09,261
I'm out of here.

80
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:15,305
Stop it. Can't you see you're
putting yourself on show?

81
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:15,305
I will not stay another minute
with this idiot.

82
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,257
You'll see once they're gone.
I'll cure you...

83
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,258
Nobody on the balcony, sir.

84
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,271
Let's go.

85
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:39,272
I am really sorry.

86
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:48,265
They are upstairs.
Quick.

87
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,283
If the elevator goes to the top floor,
the Brit will be crushed.

88
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,274
Wait.

89
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:38,280
Too heavy.

90
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:48,282
People never close the doors...

91
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,292
I lost it. What?
The key.

92
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,284
I always put it under the carpet
but...

93
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:01,291
Quick!

94
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,293
Nothing to worry about.

95
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:31,294
Augustin Bouvet,
Paint and renovation

96
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:43,306
Bury this straight away. Dangerous.

97
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:51,348
U kidding? I have a wife and 6 kids. I have
enough material for shirts til the war ends.

98
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,309
Thanks

99
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,312
Alright, they have left.
The street is empty.

100
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:20,317
We shall leave too.
I'll try to bring him to my place.

101
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,315
Your place?
The Germans must be there already!

102
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,314
At my place?

103
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,315
Do you have a telephone at home?

104
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,317
Yes, Clignancourt 1335
is the number.

105
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:30,317
Wait

106
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:34,312
It won't answer. I'm not there,
since I'm here.

107
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:48,325
Augustin Bouvet please.

108
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,323
Speaking.

109
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:56,317
He's lying, he's not me.

110
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:08,329
Without you we would have gone home
and been captured.

111
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:11,331
What a mess!

112
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:15,333
What shall I do now?

113
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,331
What's he saying?

114
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,332
He wants to go to the Turkish Baths.

115
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:36,337
He's supposed to meet his pals
at the Turkish Baths.

116
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:40,339
Another English brain-dead idea...

117
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,337
Wounded, and not speaking French.

118
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:44,332
He will be caught straight away.

119
00:22:57,385 --> 00:23:01,346
I'll find him clothing.
We'll meet at my grandfather's place

120
00:23:01,387 --> 00:23:02,342
Where is that?

121
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:05,387
The Puppet Theatre on Champs-Elysees.
I work with him.

122
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:41,356
Search there

123
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:46,349
Search here

124
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,356
I go in to check

125
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,356
Come in

126
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,363
No no no like the birds,
Chirp chirp chirp.

127
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:11,365
This time I shall not interrupt
your rehearsal. Please continue.

128
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:13,363
Enough.

129
00:24:15,407 --> 00:24:17,363
What are you looking for?
Your Englishman?

130
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,367
Not him

131
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:23,367
Follow me

132
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:26,369
He's not here right?

133
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:31,361
Not here either?

134
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:34,371
Not here.

135
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:36,369
You interrupt my rehearsal.

136
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:39,372
Now you interrupt my lesson.

137
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:42,373
Forgive me Herr Conductor.
Yeah yeah I forgive you.

138
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:44,375
Come here. He's not here right?

139
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,375
There? He's no more there.

140
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:48,416
And here, what's here?

141
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,367
Allow me.

142
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:06,381
Ah. Black Market.

143
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,380
No - It's for the interval.
I'm always hungry.

144
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:13,382
My stomach goes like this...

145
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:16,383
So I need to eat.
That's why I keep provisions.

146
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:18,381
Big crook.

147
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:21,384
No, small crook.

148
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:23,382
Have some...

149
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,383
No thank you, Herr Conductor.

150
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:27,388
Sorry, I must be going.

151
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:38,379
Good-bye

152
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:48,393
Right, back to lesson Number 4.

153
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:50,390
Let's see...

154
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:53,393
No speaking, just shut up.

155
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:54,390
Do not say a word.

156
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:56,392
Sit on the music stool.

157
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:58,392
We shall now read a bit of music.

158
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,397
Me, go to the Turkish baths?

159
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:22,399
Do not whistle this.

160
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:27,394
American song
Forbidden here.

161
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:35,455
Gentlemen, I overheard you.
You were talking of Mc Intosh and Peter, right?

162
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,454
No no no
Don't know what you are talking about.

163
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:44,449
I am looking for a friend.
Lost him in the fog.

164
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:48,457
Have you met him by chance?

165
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:50,458
Big mustache.

166
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:52,458
I am... I was big mustache.

167
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:01,461
Follow me

168
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:06,455
His accent sounds real.
Let's follow him.

169
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:28,462
Herr Conductor, are you there?

170
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:40,465
Open this door, now!

171
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:49,467
Major, have a look.

172
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,475
He has fled

173
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,476
Catch him.

174
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,470
Put this back in its original place

175
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:09,473
Now, I wait for you, Herr Conductor.

176
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:23,478
Opera house, quick.

177
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:30,480
Coming.

178
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:56,495
Are you crazy?
Stealing German uniforms!

179
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:01,537
We need them for operation Mc Intosh
tonight at the Opera house.

180
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:06,489
No, it is too dangerous
I do not want to, understood?

181
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:38,508
Where is the Englishman?

182
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,508
I am sick...

183
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,508
Not sick... It was him!

184
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,506
No, this is a harp.

185
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:48,509
Where is the Englishman?
There's an Englishman here??

186
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,510
Your explanation does not
satisfy me!

187
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:56,509
But it's rather clear!

188
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:58,510
I am regular army
not secret police

189
00:32:58,554 --> 00:33:00,511
But if you refuse to talk

190
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:03,514
I'll hand you over to a department
that will make you talk.

191
00:33:03,556 --> 00:33:05,512
Naturally

192
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:09,516
Only after this evening's performance,
held for our Brigadier.

193
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:13,517
Until then, you are my prisoner.

194
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,518
I arrest you, Madame Crook.

195
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,520
You have no right to arrest me.
Isn't it, children?

196
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:23,520
No

197
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:26,520
If Guignol was here,
He would save me.

198
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:28,518
He won't come.

199
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:31,522
Help me shout for him...

200
00:33:31,564 --> 00:33:36,514
Guignol, Guignol.

201
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:59,531
What audacity, going around dressed
as German officers.

202
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:01,528
What if the police asks for
our papers?

203
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,531
You are talking too loudly.

204
00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:08,524
She is only 3.

205
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:15,535
You're right, she's looking at me.

206
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:19,535
Two Germans at the back.

207
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:26,537
Fortunately, General AUGUSTIN
will come to my rescue.

208
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:31,530
Help me call for him.

209
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:36,531
Augustin.

210
00:35:11,591 --> 00:35:15,551
What a great day...
Two English pilots,

211
00:35:15,592 --> 00:35:17,549
A French hero

212
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:21,554
My granddaughter spoke of
you and your great courage.

213
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:24,545
Really? You mentioned me to your family?

214
00:35:25,596 --> 00:35:27,552
How about her. She was great.

215
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:29,553
I am not surprised.

216
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:34,558
Gentlemen, my noble theatre is a
poor hiding place...

217
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,559
However Juliette and I can help
you leave Paris.

218
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,558
If we manage to sneak into unoccupied France,
we sure can make it back to England.

219
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,561
England?
I bloody well can't go to England!

220
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:49,561
Go with them.
It's safer for you.

221
00:35:56,604 --> 00:36:01,555
There you have it.
The beautiful France.

222
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:05,563
I summarize

223
00:36:05,607 --> 00:36:09,567
Tomorrow morning 8h05 you
take the train for Burgundy.

224
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:13,567
Once in Meursault, go directly to
"Hotel du Globe".

225
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,569
No need to take notes.
My granddaughter is going with you.

226
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,567
You're coming along?

227
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,612
Of course, the adventure goes on.
Isn't it exciting, Augustin?

228
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:26,567
Kindof.

229
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:28,569
Thanks. Thanks to all of you.

230
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:30,569
However tonight
I must first go to the Opera

231
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:33,573
To look for my friend Mc Intosh.

232
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:39,574
Augustin, you will come with me.

233
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:44,567
Well, err...

234
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,576
Ok, I'll go.

235
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,580
Won't take long. Get in, pick up
Mc Intosh and hightail out of there.

236
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:25,586
We have to get backstage.

237
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,594
Excuse me sir, how do we get backstage?

238
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:49,594
End of the corridor, to the left.

239
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,593
This way, Herr General.

240
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:51,608
Poor Lefort.

241
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:53,610
What do we do?
Shall we cancel?

242
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:55,604
Too late. Too bad for Lefort.
Let's go.

243
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:04,617
Thank you.

244
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:39,634
30 more seconds.

245
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:54,638
5.4

246
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:06,651
Shit. It failed.

247
00:41:08,692 --> 00:41:13,643
This time it was not me!

248
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:23,646
Stop

249
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:57,655
Intermission...

250
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:21,671
It was not me, it was not me!

251
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:24,671
It's me!
Ah then it's me.

252
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,671
Pretend you are our prisoner.

253
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,669
No, go left.

254
00:43:36,734 --> 00:43:39,692
The gates of Hell?
No, an underground river under the Opera.

255
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:45,691
Where does it exit?
According to Victor Hugo, nowhere.

256
00:44:13,744 --> 00:44:16,694
God bless you.

257
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:43,711
With your bald head, you're gonna catch a cold.
Take my cap.

258
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:46,708
Leave me alone and mind your oars!

259
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:49,704
Would you please calm down...

260
00:45:06,759 --> 00:45:08,715
Germans?

261
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,710
No, the subway

262
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:42,719
Get out? Ah, ok.

263
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,727
Come on, quickly.

264
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:49,727
We cannot get out
dressed like this...

265
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:51,728
We will all be caught.

266
00:45:51,772 --> 00:45:53,722
Wait

267
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,754
Who are you?

268
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:33,750
Do not worry.
We will not harm you.

269
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:38,752
My wallet

270
00:48:21,814 --> 00:48:24,764
What time is it?
8h04 - Come on.

271
00:48:58,824 --> 00:49:00,781
Excuse me, was this the train for
Chalons-sur-Saone?

272
00:49:00,825 --> 00:49:02,781
Yes
When is the next one?

273
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:05,785
I don't know.
Ask the information counter.

274
00:49:05,827 --> 00:49:08,776
Look - a roadblock.
Something must be going down.

275
00:49:29,832 --> 00:49:31,789
Stop - What is this?

276
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:36,784
Postal Service

277
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,808
Don't bother.
It's out of gas.

278
00:50:36,852 --> 00:50:40,812
Push the car this way.
To hide it.

279
00:50:40,853 --> 00:50:41,808
Push

280
00:50:41,853 --> 00:50:45,813
Come on! Push!
Speak to me politely.

281
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:48,813
Would you please push, maestro?
That's better.

282
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:54,806
Slowly, slowly

283
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:57,817
Stop

284
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:03,818
Now dear friends,
let's share our food stamps.

285
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,817
French stamps, printed in London.

286
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:14,818
French money.
Not printed in London.

287
00:51:21,864 --> 00:51:24,823
Let's go Augustin.

288
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:26,822
Why must he always call me Augustine?

289
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:28,822
Hey, why don't I get any?

290
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:30,817
Wait a minute.

291
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:37,825
I am short of one.

292
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:39,819
Are you sure?
Yes.

293
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:49,830
Wait for me, for crying out loud!
Hurry up!

294
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:51,823
My feet are swelling up.

295
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:19,829
Leave me alone.
My foot is huge.

296
00:52:28,883 --> 00:52:31,843
Come on, let's go.
Stand up... Stanislas.

297
00:52:30,884 --> 00:52:34,844
A little bit of respect, please.

298
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,844
You cannot order me around.

299
00:52:37,886 --> 00:52:40,844
Listen, my dear.
We belong to two different worlds.

300
00:52:40,886 --> 00:52:43,845
Between us, there will always be... this

301
00:52:43,887 --> 00:52:45,844
Give me your hand.

302
00:52:45,888 --> 00:52:47,844
You are so showy!

303
00:52:47,888 --> 00:52:50,848
Be careful... Be very careful.

304
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,848
Fine.
Wait for me...

305
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,853
We'll be back!

306
00:53:11,895 --> 00:53:15,855
Look, they ran off!
They are abandoning us!

307
00:53:15,896 --> 00:53:18,856
Darn, I never thought
they could be like that

308
00:53:18,898 --> 00:53:21,856
What will become of us?

309
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:25,858
Do not worry, we will keep walking.
We will make it anyway, gentlemen!!

310
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:29,859
Wear your shoes

311
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,856
Lean on my arm for support.

312
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:33,860
See, that's what the English are capable of.

313
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:38,852
I'm surprised. They were rather nice.

314
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:44,854
You must have had an English nanny!

315
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,877
Thief! Thief!

316
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:55,924
These shoes are not made for long walks.
That explains why.

317
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:59,884
I accept your kind offer.
What offer?

318
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:01,882
To lend me your shoes.

319
00:55:01,926 --> 00:55:04,883
What size do you wear?
Same as yours.

320
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,877
All right

321
00:55:12,929 --> 00:55:13,879
Ah. That's better.

322
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,889
Wait for me.
Come on...

323
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,890
I have to get used to them.
Come on, get moving.

324
00:55:24,932 --> 00:55:26,892
The Germans!

325
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:41,887
We're lucky you have quick reflexes.

326
00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:45,894
Thank you
Don't mention it.

327
00:55:45,938 --> 00:55:47,895
How about the Englishmen?

328
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:50,898
What?
They will be caught

329
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,900
You're right - they should had stayed with us

330
00:55:54,941 --> 00:55:57,899
Alright. Let's go.

331
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:02,902
Wait. I return you your shoes.
I'm afraid of making them bigger.

332
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,900
Ah yes. You are damaging them...

333
00:56:05,944 --> 00:56:08,903
Are my shoes ok?
A bit wide.

334
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:11,904
Sorry about that.

335
00:56:11,946 --> 00:56:13,902
Are you coming?

336
00:56:13,946 --> 00:56:18,897
Come on, come on.

337
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:31,910
Who did you steal this from?

338
00:56:31,952 --> 00:56:33,908
Me. Good morning, sirs

339
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:34,907
Good morning, Sister.

340
00:56:34,952 --> 00:56:36,908
Let's hurry. I am expected
at the Beaunes hospital.

341
00:56:36,952 --> 00:56:39,912
Get on quickly

342
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Would you pass the salt please.

343
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:35,401
This needs pepper too.

344
00:57:45,402 --> 00:57:56,402
[French Poem]

345
00:57:56,403 --> 00:58:00,403
Charles Péguy.
Wonderful poet, isn't he?

346
00:58:04,404 --> 00:58:06,404
You see,
I know your language well.

347
00:58:31,985 --> 00:58:36,935
What is it?

348
00:58:39,987 --> 00:58:42,947
What? Really? Excellent!

349
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:52,950
We searched the whole train.
There was no other Englishman.

350
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:55,949
Excellent.
Search the entire neighbourhood.

351
00:58:55,992 --> 00:59:00,942
Yes Major.

352
00:59:17,998 --> 00:59:20,957
Send him to the nearest Kommandantur
...Meursault.

353
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,951
Ok, Meursault.
I'll be there tonight.
