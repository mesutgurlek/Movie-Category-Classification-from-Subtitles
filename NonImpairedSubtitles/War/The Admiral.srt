1597 AD The Second
Korean-Japanese War

3
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:29,299
After 6 years of the First Korean-Japanese war, Yi Sun-Shin
was dismissed from his duty on suspicion of espionage,

4
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,300
and was taken to the
capital and tortured

5
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:38,301
On July, 1597, Korean navy led by Won
Kyun was destroyed by Japanese navy.

6
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,548
For the first time since 1592, Japanese
began to ravage Jeolla province of Joseon.

7
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,303
August 16th, the fort of Namwon, August
25th, the fort of Jeon-Joo were besieged

8
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:51,304
Now, the Japanese army was trying to take the capital
as they advanced further north with ferocity...

9
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:56,305
Yi Sun-Shin, at last freed, was
without any military title,

10
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,540
but doing his best to recruit soldiers and
collect weapons to prepare for the war.

11
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:09,305
Acquiring the 12 ships that have
survived in the battle of Chil-Chun,

12
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:14,542
Yi Sun-Shin settled his navy in the west
of the South Sea, at Jindo, Byuk Pa port.

13
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:23,305
At Uh-Ran port, which is only 100 miles away, about
300 Japanese battleships began to assemble...

14
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:38,350
The Admiral: Roaring Currents

15
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:42,391
Jindo, Byuk-Pa Port

16
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:48,894
12 days after the recommission

17
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:58,304
So,

18
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:02,507
When do you plan to have
us join the army, Admiral?

19
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,208
What do you mean?

20
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,208
- Captain Bae-Sul-Why, His
Majesty's command, of course.

21
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,209
His Majesty has commanded us
to join forces with the army,

22
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,802
so I'm asking you when
we are doing that.

23
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:25,762
Is that how you read it?

24
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:27,203
What?

25
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:34,205
Look here Admiral,

26
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,422
the enemy fleets have
already exceeded 200,

27
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:40,605
Are you aware of the fact that many of
our soldiers are running away already?

28
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,630
- Captain Kim Eok-Choo-In the last ten days,
about 50 soldiers have run away already...

29
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,848
I must ask you today, Admiral...

30
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:55,800
We have no idea when this enemy would show up
at our doorstep, and that could be tonight

31
00:03:56,248 --> 00:04:04,595
So I'm curious, how do you propose
to fight against such enemies?

32
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:10,342
Let's heart it from
our young officers!

33
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,149
Do we stand a chance?

34
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,901
Do we?!

35
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,275
Don't be afraid to speak
up to your commander!

36
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:28,302
Admiral...

37
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,733
Please, enlighten us...

38
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:34,821
Aside from that one mere turtle
ship, do we have any other plan?

39
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:37,872
Watch what you're
saying to the Admiral.

40
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:39,753
How dare you!

41
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:43,312
I'm your commanding officer!
Shut the hell up and listen!

42
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:45,170
The hell you are!

43
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:49,195
You should be ashamed of yourself that you
ran for your life at the battle of Chil-Chun

44
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:08,145
Listen boy, it's because I ran for my life,
I was able to preserve those twelve ships!

45
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:12,805
If you don't know shit,
keep your mouth shut.

46
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,006
Admiral...

47
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:17,405
you know how futile
this battle is...

48
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:20,398
I saw it myself at Chil-Chun...

49
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,700
I saw how ferocious and
evil they have become!

50
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:25,887
100,000 of our men have died!

51
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:30,076
Do you intend to wipe out
the entire Joseon's navy?

52
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,944
You're dismissed, officers.

53
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:45,228
Admiral!

54
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,969
Your commanding officer
has just ordered you!

55
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,408
Let us go

56
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:58,671
It is important to repair the
ships and check on our soldiers.

57
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:01,418
Now!

58
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:45,643
Hae-Nam, Uh-Ran Port
(Japanese Navy base)

59
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:58,402
We must capture the king
of Korea and end this war.

60
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:03,379
We cannot let him escape
again like six years ago.

61
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,372
We must be quicker than
storm when attacking.

62
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,657
- Let's hurry up!
- Yes, General.

63
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:15,499
Can't let General Konishi
capture their king first.

64
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:21,824
I wonder why His Excellency (Toyotomi
Hideyoshi) is sending me a new officer...

65
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:26,866
telling me to just wait...

66
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:35,567
Are those Wakizaka's men?

67
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,344
Yes, it seems like they're returning
after spying on their camp.

68
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,618
How many times is this?

69
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:46,641
Counting the last night's surprise
attack, I believe... about three times.

70
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:51,957
But

71
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,682
I wonder who is this new officer
that is keeping you waiting?

72
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:03,879
Someone quintessential to
this battle, I'm told.

73
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:11,692
Apparently, there is no one better
to bring down Yi Sun-Shin than him.

74
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:22,052
Byuk-Pa Port, Admiral's Fleet

75
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:34,298
Considering insufficient number of your navy, it would be
beneficial for you to dismiss your men and join forces with army

76
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:15,436
- Father!
- What is he doing with his sword out?

77
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,216
- I overheard them saying they were going to kill us all!
- Of course they will!

78
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:25,584
Father! Father!

79
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:41,394
I swear to god, I will kill you!

80
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:47,307
No!!!

81
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,605
I apologize for using my
sniper on your prisoner.

82
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:01,804
It was just kind of hard to see.

83
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:07,802
Are you the new officer
that the chancellor sent?

84
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,190
They're lyo Navy from Ehime...

85
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:43,402
What navy? Everyone knows
they are pirates.

86
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,205
Let's go!

87
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,877
Junsa

88
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:59,983
Jindo Byuk Pa Port
(Joseon Naval Base)

89
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,568
-Dispatch Imminent-

90
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:05,737
The Japanese are
acting suspicious.

91
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:14,399
Their ships have already exceeded 200. They are
filling their ships with supplies and stolen horses.

92
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:21,319
If anybody dares to fight back, they kill him and cut his
nose off. They are also using kids as practice targets.

93
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:30,429
It's what they do when
they occupy a region.

94
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:41,867
Is it true that 250,000 Japanese soldiers
are coming down from Jeon-Joo area?

95
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,510
Yes, it seems true.

96
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:53,594
I've overheard them saying that Joseon navy is useless
and that they will soon be storming the capital city.

97
00:12:54,709 --> 00:13:01,581
If we let them pass, then the
capital will surely burn.

98
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:11,206
Deliver this to Junsa and make
sure you bring back his reply.

99
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:12,821
Yes, Admiral.

100
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:28,149
The top part is finished!

101
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,738
Sweetheart

102
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:47,619
Another talisman?

103
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:49,703
I've done this
many times before.

104
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,151
You need not worry too much.
Anyway, I'll keep it safe.

105
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:54,858
Off I go

106
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:09,729
Take good care of
yourself, honey

107
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:23,931
Joseon Army Base (General
Kwon Yul's Camp)

108
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,346
- General Kwon Yul-He's
refusing to follow order again?

109
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:50,622
He believes it is the
right thing to do.

110
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:54,739
If he disobeys His Majesty again, there
will be no forgiveness this time!

111
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:57,334
Namwon fort and Jeon Joo
fort have fallen already.

112
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,445
Japanese army is
invading from the south

113
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:05,498
Moreover, their navy is trying to go around the South
Sea and attack the capital. What will happen then?

114
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:08,339
With a measly 12 ships, what does
he think he can accomplish?

115
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,603
Then why are you
asking us to join you?

116
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:17,209
How dare you! Do you not know Admiral's
health is in bad shape right now?

117
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,299
Who made him that way?

118
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:26,777
Why you... do you have any idea
what it is like over here?

119
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:36,506
That evil Kato Kiyomasa is at our doorstep
right now. at this point, every bit helps!

120
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,605
Stop him!

121
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:57,502
Please General, please give us weapons and
men. Right now Joseon Navy needs your help!

122
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:00,975
If you follow his Majesty’s
order, everything will be fine.

123
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:05,781
Do you truly intend to ignore
Admiral Yi's desperate plea?

124
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:14,980
How insolent! Arrest him!

125
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:20,530
General, please! General!

126
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:23,995
Admiral told me to tell you...

127
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:27,607
If you abandon the sea,
you abandon Joseon!

128
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:47,891
I've been waiting for half a day.
Is this how you treat your guest?

129
00:16:56,607 --> 00:17:03,607
We've been too absorbed in our strategy meeting that we
forgot to greet our important guest. Please forgive us.

130
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:06,805
Anyway

131
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:17,099
Shall we hear from our pirate king on
how to capture the king of Joseon?

132
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:29,497
On our way to Joseon, I took
a look at their waterway.

133
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:33,903
If we go around Jindo
on a morning tide,

134
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:39,114
We can supply our army by night
and still take their capital.

135
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:43,165
It will only take a day and a
half to get to their capital.

136
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:56,600
That sounds nice

137
00:17:57,135 --> 00:18:00,606
But Yi Sun-Shin is not
a feeble opponent

138
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:05,606
We should leave through the
big channel in front of Jindo

139
00:18:06,237 --> 00:18:07,971
Take their capital

140
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:12,604
Afterward, I propose we join ground forces
and destroy Yi Sun-Shin together.

141
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:17,875
Why do you think
Hideyoshi sent me

142
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,358
Wakizaka?

143
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:28,251
What the hell did you just say? How
dare you call our chancellor by name!

144
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:53,603
I'll crush Yi Sun-Shin
with this hand

145
00:18:57,606 --> 00:19:02,606
Or are you trying to let Konishi
take their capital first?

146
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:14,605
I apologize for our behaviors.

147
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:19,581
Please forgive me.

148
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:25,606
Please, have a seat, Kurushima.

149
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:40,602
I swear by my sword to
be feared by the world

150
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:46,602
With one swing, I paint
the world in blood

151
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:55,883
Mother....

152
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:09,602
Father, it's me.

153
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,602
It's nice to be with you

154
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:27,911
Yes...

155
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,522
Father..

156
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:36,402
Go ahead.

157
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:43,508
It seems like a good opportunity,
isn't it? Why don't you retire now?

158
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:49,618
We haven't been able to bring
grandmother home because of this war...

159
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:59,402
Hand your men over to General Kwon Yul And tell the
king you are too ill to carry out your duties.

160
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:06,602
You are angry at His Majesty.

161
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:13,510
He tried to kill you.
Aren't you upset?

162
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,201
Father...

163
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:20,082
We only have 12 ships left...

164
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:22,810
Can we even call ourselves
navy at this point?

165
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:27,474
Even if we could win
against all odds...

166
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,101
The King will
surely abandon you.

167
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:35,763
What do you fight for?

168
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:38,397
I fight for loyalty.

169
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:43,268
Loyal to whom? To
that... shameless king?

170
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:45,063
There is a saying

171
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,301
A warrior must follow his king

172
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:58,301
And the king must
follow his people

173
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,261
not the king?

174
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:05,608
There is no country without its people.
Without people, there is no king.

175
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:15,301
But people just want to survive.
There's nothing to expect from them.

176
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:23,009
Finish your meal.
It is precious.

177
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:35,835
Stay back! Stay back!

178
00:22:38,903 --> 00:22:39,903
Admiral

179
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,426
<i>You all will meet the same fate</i>

180
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:56,666
Is... is this not
Captain Bae Hong Suk?

181
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:01,870
Oh god, Captain Bae...

182
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:05,300
What do we do?

183
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:19,308
Holy shit!

184
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:45,287
Get them out of here!

185
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:46,762
Get out of here!

186
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:54,588
<i>Kurushima Michiyuki 25 years old</i>

187
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:05,306
Were you the one who sent the heads
of the prisoners over to their side?!

188
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:10,828
I also sent their
noses and ears.

189
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:16,199
Do you have a death wish?

190
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:24,306
Why would you exacerbate things
by upsetting your enemy?

191
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,937
If they are worthy
opponents, then why not?

192
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:32,156
But

193
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:37,264
Are they worth it?

194
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:41,140
I told you, Yi Sun-Shin
is not a feeble opponent!

195
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,714
I suppose what I
hear is true then

196
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:49,604
That many of your men
secretly worship Yi Sun-Shin?

197
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:53,606
So I take it your failure
at the battle of Han-San

198
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:57,604
has got your balls shriveled?

199
00:24:58,683 --> 00:25:01,612
What the fuck, you bastard!!!

200
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,904
I'll tell you one more time

201
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:28,905
Why do you think the
chancellor sent me?

202
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:34,145
It's because I am different than
those of you who fear Yi Sun-Shin

203
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,003
Don't be so quick to
pull your sword out

204
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:42,903
or your head will be
the first to roll

205
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:05,610
Since my brother Michiyuki had become the
chancellor's dog and joined this war

206
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:10,939
He paid it with his life

207
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:14,008
I suppose he protected me
from the chancellor's wrath

208
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:17,592
by volunteering to take
my place in this war

209
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:21,587
But he died at the
hands of Yi Sun-Shin.

210
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:25,397
In any rate, the
chancellor is old now.

211
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:27,906
At most, he has until next year.

212
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:32,480
That's why he is so
eager to end this war.

213
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,158
Joseon, which chancellor
desires so much...

214
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:42,821
will be mine soon.

215
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:47,581
That's why

216
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,622
Yi Sun-Shin must die.

217
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,904
Do you understand, Haru?

218
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:01,905
That is the only way

219
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:06,719
to avenge my brother.

220
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,901
What is going on?

221
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:18,904
Isn't that Oh Sang GU?

222
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,540
He must have been
caught running away!

223
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,901
Yeah that's him!

224
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:28,909
Admiral's coming!

225
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:40,461
He was caught running away.

226
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:51,365
My comrades who fought side by side
with me for years have all died...

227
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:57,901
I buried their heads today...

228
00:27:58,472 --> 00:28:01,660
I'm so afraid...

229
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,904
I feel like it's my turn now...

230
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,101
Do we all have to die like them?

231
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,904
Are you done?

232
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:54,901
Military rule should be strict!

233
00:28:56,906 --> 00:28:58,906
Do I make myself clear?

234
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:25,458
We're all screwed now...

235
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:28,366
He's not going to
change his mind.

236
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,908
Fine..

237
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:35,900
I'll find a way.

238
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:44,158
Myungryang Strait, Blood Island

239
00:30:20,723 --> 00:30:25,016
This strait is narrow and shallow. That
is why the current is quite violent here.

240
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:29,789
That's where it gets its name from. (Literally translated,
Ool-Dol-Mok means the corner where water leaves crying)

241
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:32,218
Is this the place?

242
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:37,081
But Admiral,

243
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:42,908
If our enemy decides to come here, it must
mean that they find this place to be useful

244
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:45,812
Look at that strong current.

245
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:51,016
They will have our ships
surrounded in no time.

246
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,392
It does not seem very wise.

247
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:56,086
That is why we
need a turtle ship

248
00:30:56,836 --> 00:31:00,547
If a turtle ship can destroy
the Japanese in the frontline,

249
00:31:00,585 --> 00:31:02,657
and the rest of our ships
can fire cannons at them...

250
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:08,200
It takes half a day for the current to change. Will
turtle ship be able to withstand the attacks until then?

251
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:24,088
When the tide changes, the
current too, becomes mild.

252
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:25,973
But the sound....

253
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:28,236
is quite unusual.

254
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:33,542
Nowadays, it sounds
like a grown man's cry.

255
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:38,906
Problem is the whirlpool.

256
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:44,385
It usually does not sound like
that during high tide but

257
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:52,794
when the great high tide comes
and it makes sounds like that...

258
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,691
There almost always
was a big whirlpool.

259
00:31:57,962 --> 00:32:03,711
It's going to be the great
high tide in about two days...

260
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:30,930
Do you hear that?

261
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:39,200
To me, it sounds like the
dead soldiers' cries.

262
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:47,766
Is that turtle ship
your only plan?

263
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,035
Plan isn't the issue.

264
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:56,706
The problem is

265
00:32:57,706 --> 00:33:03,706
the growing fear among my men.

266
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,725
Is there truly no way
to overcome this?

267
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:23,761
What should we do if
we can't overcome it?

268
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:30,676
Is threatening them with
punishment the only way

269
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:33,700
To overcome fear?

270
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:36,777
Would that work?

271
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:40,705
Then

272
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:42,443
how do you propose...

273
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:46,468
I can probably use that fear...

274
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,814
Use... use fear?

275
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:33,517
Admiral... avenge us...

276
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,580
Admiral...

277
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,705
Please avenge us...

278
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,707
Avenge us...

279
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:58,707
You were alive...

280
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:03,117
I'm glad you came

281
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:06,240
Captain Choi... Captain Lee...

282
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:09,707
Please avenge us, Admiral...

283
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:17,413
Please avenge us...

284
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:22,704
Here...

285
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:27,062
Have a drink...

286
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:34,705
Have a drink and
stay for a while...

287
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:39,262
Hey...

288
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:42,118
Where are you going?

289
00:35:42,703 --> 00:35:46,703
Captain Lee.. Captain
Choi... Hong Suk...

290
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,979
Please wait...

291
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:55,705
Where are you going
in such a hurry...?

292
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:06,702
Father!

293
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:28,704
Turtle ship on fire!

294
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:47,701
Admiral!

295
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:57,706
It's Bae-Sul's men!

296
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:09,704
It's on fire!

297
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:14,704
Save the ship!

298
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:17,707
He's over there!

299
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:29,701
Don't you all want to live?

300
00:37:30,704 --> 00:37:35,704
Yi Sun-Shin is trying
to get us all killed

301
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:41,704
But I've found a way for us!

302
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:46,285
Don't throw away your
lives. It's not worth it!

303
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,707
So hurry up and...

304
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:11,709
Bring more water!

305
00:38:17,972 --> 00:38:19,162
Admiral please.

306
00:38:19,315 --> 00:38:21,705
It's dangerous, sir!

307
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:26,705
No! this can't be!

308
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,708
Let me go!

309
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:38,706
No!

310
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:42,680
No... no!

311
00:38:42,705 --> 00:38:45,705
It's our turtle ship...!

312
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:48,706
Father!

313
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:51,701
It's all over now.

314
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:53,701
We were almost there..!

315
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:56,701
I must defeat them
with that ship...!

316
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:03,703
No...!

317
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:40,803
My lord!

318
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:48,328
Yi Sun-Shin's turtle ship
had just burned down.

319
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:48,945
What?

320
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,806
We sent our spies over to see what was going
on when we spotted fire from his camp

321
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:56,996
we were able to confirm that his turtle
ship has burned down to the ground.

322
00:39:58,806 --> 00:40:01,806
That was his last
one, wasn't it?

323
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,223
Indeed.

324
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:07,775
Yi Sun-Shin no longer
has any turtle ship.

325
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:21,805
The road that we must
go on has no obstacles.

326
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:30,800
I sure can feel your power
in your calligraphy!

327
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:37,806
This should be our motto.

328
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Let's go!

329
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:02,279
Junsa... Junsa where are you...

330
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:22,136
Cleaning before occupying...

331
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:24,203
Help me!

332
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:26,353
Catch him!

333
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:33,806
Catch that bastard!

334
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:45,809
Hey, help me!

335
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:53,807
Hey, don't go! Help me!

336
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Walk faster!

337
00:41:57,805 --> 00:41:59,805
One guy is missing!

338
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:07,805
Find him!

339
00:42:22,196 --> 00:42:23,801
Walk!

340
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:27,808
Faster!

341
00:42:30,937 --> 00:42:37,806
I'm useful. I can
row really well...

342
00:42:38,937 --> 00:42:41,366
What the hell is he saying!

343
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:45,806
What the fuck?

344
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,805
Soo bong!

345
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,804
You little...

346
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,668
I'm sorry..I'm sorry!

347
00:43:02,108 --> 00:43:05,033
Please don't kill me!

348
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:08,800
Calm down!

349
00:44:17,803 --> 00:44:21,803
Whirlpool...

350
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:28,805
Turtle ship...

351
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:51,801
Father! It's Junsa's message!

352
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:59,451
Japanese plan to attack tomorrow morning.
They have about 330 battle ships.

353
00:44:59,476 --> 00:45:04,708
Unfortunately, the new officer you asked
me to look into is someone I do not know.

354
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:10,651
All I know is that his name is Kurushima Michifusa and
that he comes from Ehime, where it is very much like here.

355
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:17,095
Good news is Wakizaka Yasuhiro
is leading the second battalion

356
00:45:17,096 --> 00:45:19,577
I hope this helps.

357
00:45:19,602 --> 00:45:22,808
I will join you as
soon as I return.

358
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:29,482
Let's go to Hae-Nam.

359
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:30,216
Sir?

360
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:32,751
We cannot fight here.

361
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:35,809
They are coming from behind us. We are
going to have to leave from Hae-Nam.

362
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,807
Let's go to war!

363
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:34,800
It's from General Konishi.

364
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:42,810
Why, he's hurrying me.

365
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:47,110
I am sure we will capture
their king first.

366
00:46:47,565 --> 00:46:50,374
We are ready to go.

367
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,172
Tonight, Joseon looks
especially beautiful.

368
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,809
I like Joseon.

369
00:47:17,308 --> 00:47:18,993
My Lord.

370
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:21,374
Report.

371
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:24,284
We are ready to go.

372
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,960
We've chosen Joseon prisoners
to serve in the lower deck

373
00:47:27,985 --> 00:47:30,807
and we also amply prepared
gunpowder as well.

374
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:36,800
Yi Sun-Shin will not
survive this battle.

375
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,311
Let's go!

376
00:48:16,803 --> 00:48:21,310
We don't even have any turtle ship this time!
And what the hell is this one-line-formation?

377
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:23,882
Has he gone mad or something?

378
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:28,886
I agree! Can't you hear that
sound? We'll die for sure.

379
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:32,806
We must think of something!

380
00:48:32,965 --> 00:48:35,214
What is this plan of yours?

381
00:48:35,774 --> 00:48:39,261
Are you trying to suggest that we
try and kill him like Bae Sul?

382
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,800
No, that is not what I mean...

383
00:48:45,271 --> 00:48:51,805
Damn, I'm just anxious. We can't
even send a message to Lord Kim.

384
00:48:54,043 --> 00:48:56,652
Let's go.

385
00:48:57,615 --> 00:49:00,208
Go where?

386
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:08,804
I'll try to convince
the Admiral.

387
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:11,805
If I can't, I'll die tonight.

388
00:49:18,598 --> 00:49:20,297
Your Majesty...

389
00:49:20,613 --> 00:49:22,992
If you dismiss your navy now,

390
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:27,805
I am afraid our enemy will go around the yellow sea
and march straight to the capital city where you are.

391
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:31,800
My only worry is this.

392
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:38,265
I still have 12 ships
left to fight with.

393
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:42,152
If we all combine our
strengths and might

394
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:45,215
We can surely fight them off.

395
00:49:45,871 --> 00:49:50,490
As long as I live,
they will not...

396
00:50:01,055 --> 00:50:06,809
They will not dare
to invade us again.

397
00:50:31,105 --> 00:50:35,951
Admiral... I have
something to say to you.

398
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:44,409
This battle is suicidal

399
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,130
This is suicidal!

400
00:50:47,195 --> 00:50:51,004
Although you say we can fight them
off by luring them to Blood Isle

401
00:50:51,229 --> 00:50:55,016
Without our turtle ship, it seems
unlikely that we could win

402
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,567
Please reconsider this decision
and think of the future. Admiral!

403
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:00,913
Admiral!

404
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:14,403
Is this really what you think?

405
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:19,603
If you can't reconsider,
then please have me killed.

406
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:24,105
I'd prefer to die by your sword.

407
00:51:41,404 --> 00:51:44,404
If this is truly what you think

408
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:48,407
then, all right.

409
00:51:49,032 --> 00:51:53,408
Assemble everybody in front
of quarters tonight.

410
00:51:58,205 --> 00:51:59,600
Yes, sir!

411
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:03,286
Yes, sir!

412
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,453
Have you two brought
what I asked for?

413
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,162
Yes, sir!

414
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:32,727
Pour it!

415
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,503
What are you waiting
for? I said pour it!

416
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:43,401
- You heard what the Admiral said!
- Yes, sir!

417
00:52:53,398 --> 00:52:56,845
- Burn it all!
- Yes, sir!

418
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,408
Admiral! Please don't!

419
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,400
Admiral! Please!

420
00:53:06,409 --> 00:53:11,409
Admiral, this is
not the way to go!

421
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:16,401
Stay back!

422
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,407
What a shame it is

423
00:53:23,405 --> 00:53:26,405
that many of you
still wish to live!

424
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:30,155
We as soldiers

425
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:34,776
cannot and should
not avoid death!

426
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:39,771
You wonder, if we can survive
if we avoid this battle?

427
00:53:40,362 --> 00:53:43,407
Do you believe you will
be safe if you hide?

428
00:53:46,507 --> 00:53:49,566
Mark my words

429
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:54,405
I burn this place so that we could die
out there on that water, fighting

430
00:53:56,035 --> 00:53:58,408
There is no place to go

431
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,400
no place to hide

432
00:54:04,943 --> 00:54:09,407
Do not fear death

433
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:13,523
If you wish to live
you will find death

434
00:54:13,945 --> 00:54:17,240
If you wish to die,
you shall find life

435
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:19,669
There is a saying

436
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:26,228
If one man does his duty
he can defeat thousands.

437
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:33,418
Is that not our situation?

438
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,406
Father...

439
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:15,770
How do you intend
to use this fear?

440
00:55:35,594 --> 00:55:39,289
So this is Captain Bae's son?

441
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:40,687
Yes sir.

442
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,623
He's the one who brought Junsa's message
for you instead of Im Jun Young.

443
00:55:45,022 --> 00:55:49,337
Luckily he escaped
because Junsa found him.

444
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:04,521
This was your father's.

445
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:08,333
Will you take it?

446
00:56:18,467 --> 00:56:20,467
What is your name, son?

447
00:56:21,959 --> 00:56:24,242
I am called Soo Bong, sir.

448
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:30,340
Your father and I fought side by
side for six years in this war.

449
00:56:31,483 --> 00:56:36,136
I will not forget
you or your father.

450
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:52,407
I have a wish, sir

451
00:56:53,715 --> 00:56:54,864
Go ahead.

452
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:59,401
I'd like to be part of your
crew. I want to help you.

453
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:07,889
If you promise to stay out of
harm's way, I will grant your wish.

454
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:13,404
Thank you sir

455
00:57:37,405 --> 00:57:39,405
This is crazy...

456
00:57:51,037 --> 00:57:55,287
Port of Hae-Nam

457
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,773
Mother...

458
00:58:15,595 --> 00:58:20,729
This may be the last
day of my life.

459
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:33,745
I just hope my death
will not be in vain.

460
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:56,766
Admiral

461
00:59:56,915 --> 00:59:58,915
You did well

462
00:59:59,765 --> 01:00:02,765
I am Hae-Yi. I came to help.

463
01:00:03,087 --> 01:00:06,087
You have my gratitude. Your
presence gives me strength.

464
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:14,985
Admiral!

465
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,489
Welcome back.

466
01:00:50,407 --> 01:00:54,407
Sound the attack.

467
01:00:57,414 --> 01:01:00,414
Sound the attack!

468
01:01:10,855 --> 01:01:16,707
Depart now!

469
01:03:14,117 --> 01:03:19,402
Myeongnyang Strait 8 AM

470
01:03:21,366 --> 01:03:24,629
Set up the One-Line-Formation

471
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:45,073
The current is
strong. Row harder!

472
01:04:20,553 --> 01:04:22,862
We must remain in
control! Row harder!

473
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,959
We cannot have our ship
fall back! Row harder!

474
01:04:53,111 --> 01:04:56,111
Get rid of it.

475
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:50,408
- What is that?
- What the hell is that big black mass?

476
01:06:10,819 --> 01:06:13,819
Other ships are falling back!

477
01:06:20,575 --> 01:06:22,778
Soo Bong, I think we
boarded the wrong ship!

478
01:06:23,037 --> 01:06:25,488
You didn't know this
was the main fleet?

479
01:06:25,702 --> 01:06:30,406
That's what I'm saying! Why is
the main fleet going forward?

480
01:06:34,153 --> 01:06:38,406
I will raise the communication
flag and tell them to come back!

481
01:06:38,644 --> 01:06:40,420
Leave them be.

482
01:06:42,006 --> 01:06:42,759
But sir...

483
01:06:42,959 --> 01:06:47,525
Put the ship's anchor into the water and
get ready for a possible close combat.

484
01:06:51,402 --> 01:06:54,402
Put the anchor into the water!

485
01:07:22,327 --> 01:07:26,527
How come Yi Sun-Shin is not
putting up a command flag?

486
01:07:27,164 --> 01:07:33,089
Look at his men. Even if he put
up one, would they listen?

487
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:40,989
Send the first battalion.

488
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:45,789
First battalion! Charge!

489
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:16,177
Turn the ship to the right side
and get the cannons ready.

490
01:08:16,202 --> 01:08:18,202
Get the cannons ready!

491
01:08:20,094 --> 01:08:25,149
Stop the ship and turn it to
the right side! Hurry up!

492
01:08:35,085 --> 01:08:37,085
Captain Nah! Captain Song!

493
01:08:37,741 --> 01:08:42,044
Aim all our cannons
at the front line

494
01:08:42,841 --> 01:08:48,868
Aim all our cannons
at the front line!

495
01:08:49,624 --> 01:08:52,624
Aim it!

496
01:08:59,777 --> 01:09:04,282
Snipers ready!

497
01:09:05,828 --> 01:09:08,609
Fire!

498
01:09:34,107 --> 01:09:36,107
It's speeding up!

499
01:09:36,204 --> 01:09:37,204
Archers ready!

500
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,100
Now!

501
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:52,109
Fire!

502
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,628
Fire!

503
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:34,085
Speed up and turn the
ship to the left!

504
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:46,853
Fire!

505
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:03,357
Watch out!

506
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:18,106
Now!

507
01:11:34,627 --> 01:11:38,627
Yi Sun-Shin is attacking
the ones in the front

508
01:11:38,714 --> 01:11:41,861
Kurushima's men are in chaos.

509
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:46,320
He's neither moving
nor backing down.

510
01:11:47,543 --> 01:11:49,543
Wonder what he's waiting for...

511
01:11:49,837 --> 01:11:53,837
How about we join forces
and attack together?

512
01:11:57,051 --> 01:12:00,051
No. Let's wait.

513
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:11,801
Fear does not discriminate. It
can equally affect both sides.

514
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:17,929
Because they too, are afraid of
me because of their past defeats.

515
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:21,949
Fear does not discriminate...

516
01:12:28,455 --> 01:12:32,832
Is that all? Is that
how you use fear?

517
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:38,581
If we can somehow transform
that fear into courage....

518
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:52,861
Send the second battalion
and push harder.

519
01:12:54,676 --> 01:12:57,676
Second battalion, charge!

520
01:13:02,106 --> 01:13:06,106
Kurushima is pushing hard.

521
01:13:06,202 --> 01:13:09,201
He claims to be the expert

522
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:12,529
Let's wait and see.

523
01:13:17,941 --> 01:13:19,938
Just wait and see.

524
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:22,962
The victory is ours.
They will be crushed.

525
01:13:23,106 --> 01:13:26,106
The current is in our favor.

526
01:13:44,574 --> 01:13:48,574
Admiral, the current has turned our ship so
much that it is interfering with our aim.

527
01:13:50,307 --> 01:13:54,307
Cut the anchor and just ride the
current towards the Blood Isle.

528
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:59,481
Yes, sir.

529
01:14:14,109 --> 01:14:16,107
Caught you.

530
01:14:16,108 --> 01:14:19,108
Fire!

531
01:14:26,105 --> 01:14:29,105
Bring me the pole!

532
01:14:32,933 --> 01:14:36,864
Row harder! We cannot
let the ship get hit!

533
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:43,902
Admiral, we must put the
flag up and call them over!

534
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:46,561
We won't last long
without their help!

535
01:14:46,952 --> 01:14:51,829
Captain, change the artillery
to smaller cannons.

536
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:55,218
Then prepare for close combat.

537
01:15:04,484 --> 01:15:09,265
Soldiers, prepare
for close combat!

538
01:16:12,202 --> 01:16:15,202
Charge!

539
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:17,334
Now!

540
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,200
Fire!

541
01:16:57,915 --> 01:17:00,915
Charge!

542
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:06,951
Kurushima is winning!

543
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:09,477
Yi Sun-Shin tried to
hold as long as he could

544
01:19:09,571 --> 01:19:12,203
But it looks like it's over

545
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:24,208
Fuck it, we're all fucking dead!

546
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:29,207
Admiral!!!

547
01:20:01,698 --> 01:20:04,698
Admiral!

548
01:20:09,753 --> 01:20:12,753
Admiral!

549
01:20:57,007 --> 01:20:59,780
Take the rest of the cannons up on
this deck and move them downstairs!

550
01:20:59,805 --> 01:21:01,804
Aim them at the enemy
ships' lower deck

551
01:21:02,021 --> 01:21:03,839
can you do that?

552
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:08,432
We might die trying...

553
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:11,457
Just tell me you'll get it done!

554
01:21:12,884 --> 01:21:15,884
Yes Admiral!

555
01:21:18,055 --> 01:21:20,055
I'm counting on you!

556
01:21:29,206 --> 01:21:32,049
Stack multiple cannons
and aim at their ships!

557
01:21:32,074 --> 01:21:32,610
Yes sir!

558
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:36,183
Hurry up and go get the gunpowder
and cannons from the armory!

559
01:21:36,305 --> 01:21:39,305
Soo Bong, no! It's dangerous!

560
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,983
Move all of these!

561
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,902
Hurry up!

562
01:22:50,404 --> 01:22:54,404
Admiral! We are ready!

563
01:22:55,635 --> 01:22:58,635
Soldiers get down!

564
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:03,351
Everyone get down!

565
01:23:24,622 --> 01:23:26,622
Is that how you use fear?

566
01:23:27,715 --> 01:23:32,640
If you can somehow turn
that fear into courage

567
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:42,645
That courage will be infectious

568
01:23:45,358 --> 01:23:46,807
But father...

569
01:23:48,803 --> 01:23:54,340
How can you turn such fear into courage
when they are so scared out of their minds?

570
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:01,805
I will have to die...

571
01:24:10,808 --> 01:24:16,395
Could it be really over?

572
01:24:28,089 --> 01:24:30,089
Whoa!

573
01:25:02,183 --> 01:25:05,183
The main fleet is
alive and well!

574
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:14,238
They're alive!

575
01:25:18,701 --> 01:25:21,701
Kill them all!

576
01:25:28,703 --> 01:25:32,652
Damn those motherfuckers!

577
01:25:33,558 --> 01:25:34,706
Wait, I wanna kill them too!

578
01:25:34,804 --> 01:25:36,804
Let's go kill some Japanese!

579
01:26:03,193 --> 01:26:06,703
Speed up, gentlemen!

580
01:26:21,233 --> 01:26:27,837
Myeongryang Strait,
2 PM (mild current)

581
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:41,271
It's the whirlpool.

582
01:26:44,096 --> 01:26:46,668
Yi Sun-Shin...

583
01:26:56,708 --> 01:27:00,657
There's a reason why you
refuse to leave that Isle.

584
01:27:01,334 --> 01:27:05,326
My lord, the current has changed and now
the whirlpool has become ferocious.

585
01:27:05,351 --> 01:27:08,577
That's why on his side,
the current is mild.

586
01:27:08,602 --> 01:27:12,324
From where he is, it will be easier
to aim at us. Do you see that?

587
01:27:12,349 --> 01:27:16,970
Whoever gets that Isle,
will win this fight.

588
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:18,726
The battle would be
over in a heartbeat.

589
01:27:19,704 --> 01:27:26,986
Before he settles there completely,
speed up towards his ship!

590
01:27:32,197 --> 01:27:34,701
Sir, it's their main fleet.

591
01:27:47,197 --> 01:27:48,700
Call our captains over.

592
01:27:48,701 --> 01:27:50,498
Yes, sir.

593
01:29:38,782 --> 01:29:39,705
You're mine now!

594
01:30:21,752 --> 01:30:23,170
Admiral!

595
01:30:24,558 --> 01:30:25,701
Captain Ahn!

596
01:30:25,996 --> 01:30:28,702
I should be punishing you
accordingly for disobeying me

597
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:33,964
But since we are at war right now, You
must focus on fighting the enemy off

598
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:37,217
You must protect Blood Isle.

599
01:30:38,383 --> 01:30:39,700
Do I make myself clear?

600
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:41,701
Yes, Admiral!

601
01:30:43,315 --> 01:30:46,946
Captain Song, we must
move to Mok-Joong port.

602
01:30:47,065 --> 01:30:47,700
Absolutely, sir!

603
01:30:48,706 --> 01:30:51,706
Move towards Mok-Joong port!

604
01:31:18,337 --> 01:31:20,360
Perfect timing, sir.

605
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:22,897
Explosion will be massive.

606
01:31:23,995 --> 01:31:27,275
Yi Sun-Shin's pathetic attempt
to lure us will not work.

607
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:31,115
Our main fleet will continue on
towards the isle as you commanded.

608
01:31:33,589 --> 01:31:35,028
Sir!

609
01:31:37,704 --> 01:31:40,704
There's a strange boat
coming towards our way!

610
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,518
Bring in the archers.

611
01:31:43,554 --> 01:31:44,554
-Yes, sir!

612
01:31:45,913 --> 01:31:47,913
Fire!

613
01:31:55,193 --> 01:31:58,746
We must hurry! Pump it out!

614
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:06,167
Hurry!

615
01:32:07,853 --> 01:32:10,853
What the hell?

616
01:32:47,704 --> 01:32:49,704
Oh my god, I'm free!

617
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:08,920
Im Jun Young?

618
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:12,625
Junsa!

619
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:16,866
Gunpowder?!

620
01:33:21,474 --> 01:33:24,474
He says that ship is
full of gunpowder!

621
01:33:24,604 --> 01:33:30,849
Also, Im Jun Young
is on that ship!

622
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:36,702
Are they not answering?

623
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:40,707
Reload!

624
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:45,535
Sir, there is no answer!

625
01:35:07,087 --> 01:35:13,182
Honey, wave something so
that they can see this...

626
01:35:19,703 --> 01:35:27,193
You cannot let this
ship go to our Admiral!

627
01:35:31,743 --> 01:35:35,133
Sweetheart, do it!

628
01:35:55,706 --> 01:35:59,699
There you go.. that's my girl.

629
01:36:05,465 --> 01:36:08,465
Let's wave something!

630
01:36:24,032 --> 01:36:28,219
Sir, look over there!

631
01:36:36,796 --> 01:36:39,117
There's a strange boat going
towards our main fleet!

632
01:36:43,129 --> 01:36:45,706
- Prepare to fire!
- Yes sir!

633
01:37:33,917 --> 01:37:35,919
Aim!

634
01:37:38,349 --> 01:37:41,349
Fire away!

635
01:37:45,615 --> 01:37:47,854
You did well...

636
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:51,280
I am glad I saw your
face one last time

637
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,120
See you on the other side...

638
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:53,184
Admiral, their main fleet
is approaching fast!

639
01:39:10,685 --> 01:39:11,709
They're coming at us!

640
01:39:12,704 --> 01:39:15,704
Row faster!

641
01:39:43,107 --> 01:39:44,708
Yi Sun-Shin, you're finished!!!

642
01:40:34,525 --> 01:40:36,173
Close combat!

643
01:40:36,417 --> 01:40:37,912
Board their ship!

644
01:40:57,755 --> 01:40:58,419
Kuroda!

645
01:40:58,672 --> 01:40:59,290
Hurry up and get our ship ready!

646
01:40:59,437 --> 01:41:01,906
Shall we back him up?

647
01:41:14,692 --> 01:41:19,973
Everyone, we need your help!

648
01:41:26,705 --> 01:41:29,339
Soo Bong! Soo Bong!

649
01:43:19,158 --> 01:43:21,786
Yi Sun-Shin, I'm coming for you!

650
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:50,708
Sir! Our ships have
come to our aid!

651
01:44:06,465 --> 01:44:09,680
Kimura!

652
01:44:09,905 --> 01:44:11,458
Hurry up and follow them!

653
01:44:11,499 --> 01:44:16,707
Sir, we can't! Our ships are
trapped in that whirlpool!

654
01:44:19,709 --> 01:44:20,709
Aim!

655
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:23,709
Fire!

656
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:36,261
We must call for a back up!

657
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:39,701
You don't understand, do you?

658
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,706
They are not coming.

659
01:44:49,549 --> 01:44:52,702
Should we send back up?

660
01:45:15,708 --> 01:45:18,708
Yi Sun-Shin...

661
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:56,566
you...

662
01:45:56,606 --> 01:45:58,682
Are you Japanese

663
01:45:58,707 --> 01:46:01,706
or are you Korean?

664
01:46:35,227 --> 01:46:38,227
Yi Sun-Shin!!!

665
01:48:23,133 --> 01:48:29,133
Admiral, I'm sorry but our ship
cannot hold on much longer...

666
01:49:31,126 --> 01:49:34,126
Admiral! We will get
you out of there!

667
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:03,079
Admiral! Our
officers are coming!

668
01:50:16,658 --> 01:50:19,416
We must hurry before they
get into a formation!

669
01:50:19,964 --> 01:50:21,932
Why aren't you speeding up?

670
01:50:22,115 --> 01:50:24,115
The current has changed.

671
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:27,749
I know that! Tell
them to row harder!

672
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,360
It's all about speed
at this point!

673
01:50:30,461 --> 01:50:32,460
Speed is the only way to win!

674
01:50:33,702 --> 01:50:36,702
Speed up!

675
01:50:48,706 --> 01:50:51,706
Don't let go!

676
01:50:55,703 --> 01:50:57,703
When the hell can I
get off this ship?

677
01:51:16,707 --> 01:51:19,707
It worked!

678
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:52,706
Sir!

679
01:52:26,214 --> 01:52:28,706
Listen up!

680
01:52:41,739 --> 01:52:43,707
No way

681
01:53:08,502 --> 01:53:10,092
We're gonna crash!

682
01:53:10,377 --> 01:53:13,775
What is this, a suicide mission?

683
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:50,702
What the fuck!

684
01:54:13,844 --> 01:54:16,844
Please hold on... please!

685
01:54:29,302 --> 01:54:32,979
That crash...!

686
01:54:34,042 --> 01:54:41,042
It's the turtle ship!

687
01:55:09,707 --> 01:55:15,305
Was that his plan all along?

688
01:55:30,832 --> 01:55:33,832
They're running away!

689
01:55:40,707 --> 01:55:43,707
Fire away!

690
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:05,706
Yi Sun-Shin...

691
01:56:09,209 --> 01:56:12,209
Retreat!

692
01:56:29,909 --> 01:56:32,909
Let's go back.

693
01:56:32,956 --> 01:56:35,956
The current is back to normal.

694
01:56:44,738 --> 01:56:47,738
We got 23 Japanese
soldiers here!

695
01:56:48,006 --> 01:56:51,005
17 here!

696
01:56:51,739 --> 01:56:54,739
We got 3 Japanese
officers and 9 soldiers!

697
01:56:55,755 --> 01:57:03,333
Even if Japanese want to take
us, they can't! We're too good!

698
01:57:03,439 --> 01:57:06,439
- Eat some of this
- I'm eating already!

699
01:57:07,632 --> 01:57:11,919
You know, earlier I gave one of them Japanese
bitches death glare then they shit their pants!

700
01:57:12,101 --> 01:57:15,101
I'm cool like that

701
01:57:16,705 --> 01:57:20,680
I wonder if our descendants will ever understand
how much shit we had to go through for them?

702
01:57:20,705 --> 01:57:24,799
If they don't, then
they're assholes

703
01:57:26,813 --> 01:57:30,888
Now that we're alive and well,
let's go see our wives and kids

704
01:57:34,341 --> 01:57:37,341
have some water!

705
01:57:42,099 --> 01:57:45,099
Why, isn't this taro?

706
01:57:52,517 --> 01:57:55,517
How wonderful it is to
be alive and eat this

707
01:58:16,305 --> 01:58:17,845
Admiral!

708
01:58:57,267 --> 01:59:01,267
What shall we do...

709
01:59:02,678 --> 01:59:05,678
With all this hatred
between us...

710
01:59:19,725 --> 01:59:21,484
Father

711
01:59:24,004 --> 01:59:29,004
how on earth did you think of
using whirlpool as a weapon?

712
01:59:30,337 --> 01:59:31,388
Father..

713
01:59:35,418 --> 01:59:38,418
You said something?

714
01:59:39,109 --> 01:59:45,465
I was asking you about the whirlpool.
It was such a good timing.

715
01:59:52,105 --> 01:59:54,105
Heaven helped us.

716
01:59:55,102 --> 02:00:01,102
If that is true, then couldn't it also
have turned out really bad for us?

717
02:00:02,335 --> 02:00:05,540
Yes, that's true...

718
02:00:07,411 --> 02:00:13,411
If it wasn't for the people
who came to save me.

719
02:00:15,106 --> 02:00:20,106
You think people helped
us? Not the whirlpool?

720
02:00:29,915 --> 02:00:34,915
What do you think? Which do you
think was more of a miracle?

721
02:01:32,449 --> 02:01:35,912
1592 AD July

722
02:01:36,132 --> 02:01:40,853
Han-San Island

723
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:51,580
That thing over there

724
02:01:52,737 --> 02:01:54,737
What the hell is that?
