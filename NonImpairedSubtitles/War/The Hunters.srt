1
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:52,910
Colonel Armstrong, M.G.

2
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:57,645
Colonel, you'll fly to
Seoul at 18OO hours.

3
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:00,984
You can rest in the lounge until that
time right over here through the door.

4
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:04,492
- Roger.
- Saville.

5
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:11,661
Major, you'll sleep here tonight. We'll
fly you to Seoul tomorrow at 1OOO.

6
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,395
From there you'll go by
bus to the <i>5</i>4th Group...

7
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:16,665
...at K 13.
- Thank you, sir.

8
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:35,651
Martini, please. Very dry.

9
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:39,662
Pardon me, Major, but
aren't you Cleve Saville?

10
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:42,299
- Yes, I am.
- I'm Gifford, the Club Officer.

11
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:44,765
- You wouldn't remember me.
- I'm sorry.

12
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,598
I was only a lieutenant in
your old wing in London.

13
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:49,273
Really?

14
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:52,068
- What 's your assignment?
- <i>5</i>4th Fighter Group.

15
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:56,043
They're the rough ones.
You'd like to be flying with them?

16
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,580
- I am.
- I just thought...

17
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:01,344
I haven't a desk job yet,
I'm glad to say.

18
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:05,683
A <i>5</i>4th pilot is here for a
weekend. Yeah, there he is.

19
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,655
Lieutenant Abbott!
Lieutenant?

20
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:17,164
How are you? This is Major Saville
who is assigned to your group.

21
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:18,666
I'm Carl Abbott, Major.

22
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,430
- It was nice to have seen you.
- Thank you.

23
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:24,707
- You want a drink?
- Just got one.

24
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:29,505
Give me a double bourbon. And
fill the Major's up when he's through.

25
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:38,089
I have sinus trouble
and it 's torturing me.

26
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,559
- Wait, you're Cleve Saville.
- That 's what the man said.

27
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:47,493
This sinus I can't think.
We've been expecting you.

28
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,862
The guys are already trying
to get in your command.

29
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,367
- It may be a different war...
- It 's a lousy war!

30
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:57,364
It may be a different war, but
nothing else has changed.

31
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:00,545
You still find things out for yourself.
What command?

32
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,914
- Squadron. Col. Imil said so.
- Imil?

33
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:08,279
Dutch lmil. That sinus!
I must have another drink.

34
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:12,252
Kevin, put one on the fire.
He's our Group Commander.

35
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,789
- He flew with you?
- Oh, sure! I remember him.

36
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:18,622
- We were in the same flight in London.
- He goes way back too.

37
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:24,131
The hero of 44. The first of the
jet pilots. A killer. A hunter.

38
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:28,103
He eats two steaks at dinner.
The world is too small for him.

39
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:32,402
A pilot needs confidence and
he has enough for all of us.

40
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:36,007
- When do you report?
- I fly to Seoul at 1OOO tomorrow.

41
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:41,441
That 's my flight. Do you wanna have
dinner with me? I'm meeting a girl.

42
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:45,180
- Not if you have a date.
- Major, I want you to come.

43
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,950
- Okay?
- All right, thanks.

44
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,028
We'll have just one more and we'll
go. Kevin, you're neglecting me.

45
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:14,078
Tell the driver I'll be back.

46
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:27,257
- Lt. Abbott 's table?
- Yes, sir. Someone is waiting for him.

47
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,325
No, I'm not staying.

48
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,264
He'll take care of you.

49
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:49,320
Do you... speak English?

50
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:54,014
Fairly well, I think.

51
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:57,660
In a place like this,
I expected you to be Japanese.

52
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,493
Thank you for interest, but
I am waiting for someone.

53
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,894
Yes, I know. Lieutenant Abbott.

54
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:06,467
I came to tell you
he won't be here.

55
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,666
It isn't like Lt. Abbott
to send a substitute.

56
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:13,207
I'm not... but neither
is it a bad idea.

57
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:18,242
- Where is Lt. Abbott?
- He's outside in a cab.

58
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,817
- I'll go with you.
- Allow me.

59
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:24,446
Thank you.

60
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:53,878
- Carl? Carl?
- Don't waste your time.

61
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:58,044
It wasn't the doubles at the club, it
was the triples on the way over here.

62
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:02,659
- Why did you let him?
- Would you care to repeat that, please?

63
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,556
I'm sorry.

64
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:08,358
I'll drop you off before
taking him back to the field.

65
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:11,000
I would'nt like anyone
to see him this way.

66
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:16,504
In the barracks there is nothing
odd about a man being poured into bed.

67
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:21,111
I know, but I want to take him
with me. Will you help me?

68
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:24,412
Ok.

69
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,117
Where are we going?

70
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,069
My name is Saville.
Cleve Saville.

71
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,866
- Do you fly with Carl?
- Not yet, but I'm assigned to his group.

72
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,976
Do you know when
he returns to Korea?

73
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:56,170
Ten tomorrow morning.
Same flight as mine.

74
00:08:56,848 --> 00:09:00,614
- It 's kind of you to help me.
- I'm a kindly soul.

75
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,529
There. On the sofa will do.

76
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:27,878
Does he always
knock himself out?

77
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,412
Not like this. In the beginning
he almost never drank.

78
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:34,176
- He's scared.
- How do you know that?

79
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:39,550
I've known many pilots. Too much
booze is a sign. Headaches, too.

80
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:43,557
He thinks he's a bad flier because
he hasn't gotten any enemy planes.

81
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:47,663
He's had over 3O missions.
If he were bad, he'd be dead.

82
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:50,994
- He thinks he's just lucky.
- Maybe he is.

83
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:54,933
A man can't hit that hard
and fight jets. Not for long.

84
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,608
I want to help him,
but I don't know how.

85
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:01,006
Fighter pilots don't want to be helped.
They're stubborn.

86
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:04,739
You don't tinker with a man's fear.
He does that for himself.

87
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,110
- Is there anything else I can do?
- Would you like some coffee? It 's hot.

88
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:18,324
Hot coffee? You really were
expecting the guy, weren't you?

89
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,157
Of course.

90
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:39,976
- Nice place.
- Thank you.

91
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:43,177
- You're not in Japan long?
- A few months.

92
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:48,823
- Did you tell me your name?
- Christina. I'm usually called Chris.

93
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:57,400
- More coffee, Major?
- No, thank you.

94
00:10:57,702 --> 00:11:00,569
If only Carl could feel the
war was more important...

95
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,831
that what he's doing
has a bigger meaning...

96
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,670
...I don't think it would be like this.
- The war has a bigger meaning.

97
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:11,247
But it came too soon after the
big one to sell anybody on it.

98
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:15,852
- You're not sold on it?
- I'm air force. I don't have to be.

99
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:19,956
No, I suppose not. A professional
doesn't ask questions.

100
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:23,889
We're not paid to ask questions,
we're not blind sheep either.

101
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:27,963
We can get out, or we can
wangle any sort of duty.

102
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,829
I'm over age for combat,
but I managed to get here.

103
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:34,903
- You wanted combat?
- Sure.

104
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:39,440
- Why? Do you like the war?
- It 's the only war I've got.

105
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:44,438
- I see.
- I doubt that you do see.

106
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:50,688
Why? I've seen men going to
Korea from World War II...

107
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:55,723
trying to recapture a feeling of
importance the other war gave them.

108
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:59,954
I know the kind of men you mean.
It isn't like that with me.

109
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:05,101
The war permits me to do
what I do best: Fight planes.

110
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,131
- What about you?
- What do you mean?

111
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:12,776
I bring a drunk home for a
mysterious girl, a very pretty girl.

112
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:18,142
I discuss my private business
and all I get in return is coffee.

113
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,913
But I thought you knew...
I mean, when you came into the cafe.

114
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:28,923
I'm sorry, Major.
I'm Lt. Abbott 's wife.

115
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:31,618
But he said he was
going to meet...

116
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:35,229
No, I didn't know it.

117
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:39,494
I guess I've been stupid.
I hope I haven't also been rude.

118
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:41,704
No, you haven't.

119
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,536
Well... in any case,
thanks for the coffee.

120
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:54,081
- Will he stay sober tomorrow?
- Who will stay sober?

121
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,286
- Who are you?
- A man with egg on this face.

122
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:02,652
It 's Major Saville, Carl.

123
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:07,655
Yes! Major... surely.

124
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:12,392
What happened? I haven't
been in any trouble, have I?

125
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:15,868
No, no trouble, lieutenant.
Good night.

126
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:20,773
- I'll see you tomorrow on the plane, sir.
- Sure. Tomorrow.

127
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:29,312
- Good night, Mrs. Abbott.
- Good night, Major. And thanks again.

128
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,289
How are you?

129
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,993
I'm sorry, honey.

130
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,759
I got with a bunch of guys.
You know how it is.

131
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,734
I ran into Major...
what 's his name?

132
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,740
- Saville.
- That 's right. Saville.

133
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:59,016
He's a big man. He and lmil...
old buddies. Killers!

134
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:11,651
What do you know?
Saville!

135
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:16,989
- The major with the confetti?
- Yes, that 's Cleve. Come on.

136
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:21,054
- Hello, Cleve.
- Colonel lmil!

137
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:23,426
- I'm still Dutch.
- Thanks, Dutch.

138
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:28,037
This is Monkey Moncavage. Maybe
you've heard of him. He has 11 Migs.

139
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,608
It 's a well know name.
Glad to meet you.

140
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,937
- Pleasure, Major.
- Knock it off!

141
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,774
- Knock it!
- This is Cleve Saville.

142
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:43,886
We flew together when a pilot
had a hangover for breakfast.

143
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,386
He's a big hunter.
He's the Iceman.

144
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:50,823
He's worth knowing, but don't fly
with him unless you want action!

145
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:55,095
Come to my office.

146
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,632
You're gonna like it here.
It 's only <i>2</i>4 miles to the shower!

147
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:04,573
This is my home
away from home.

148
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:07,771
We've seen worse.

149
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:12,315
- This junk is heavy.
- Do you really need that?

150
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:15,816
It 's a little flash.
It makes me look younger.

151
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:19,115
I've got to keep up
with these jet jockeys.

152
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,694
There's a lot of good men
lost in this stinking war.

153
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:30,765
- Did anybody tell you it 's stinks?
- Nobody, but everybody.

154
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:34,705
No guts.

155
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:40,170
It 's a war you can't feel.
There is nothing simple about it.

156
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:46,339
Except dying. That 's always simple.
I forget what this war's about.

157
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:51,611
- More?
- Not for me, thanks.

158
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:55,621
They tell you crummy these
Chinese Mig pilots are?

159
00:16:55,826 --> 00:17:00,092
We have statistics.
They loose thirteen to our one.

160
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:04,530
Sure, thirteen to one.
What they don't tell you...

161
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:07,363
is that when one is good,
he's too good.

162
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,973
Casey Jones, for instance.
You heard of him, haven't you?

163
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:13,336
- You're kiddin'.
- I'm not kiddin'.

164
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:16,138
A Chinese pilot
named Casey Jones?

165
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:19,145
His plane has the
numbers 7-11 on his fuselage.

166
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,251
Don't ask me why.
Maybe he's a crap shooter. Look.

167
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,253
The Migs are based in Red China,
here across the Yalu River.

168
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:31,793
We've got orders never to
cross the Yalu, but they can.

169
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:33,691
- Still?
- Still.

170
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:38,232
They fly strung out in a line.
Bandit men, they call them.

171
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:43,965
If a bandit train takes off with
Casey Jones at the throttle...

172
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:47,611
one of our air groups can
count on losing two pilots.

173
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:50,940
I've lost seven good men
to that China boy...

174
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:54,876
seven good men
and a couple of aces too.

175
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:58,920
Old Casey hasn't been around
lately, but he'll be back.

176
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:04,023
So never underestimate the Mig pilot.
You're liable to run into one.

177
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:07,528
It sounds interesting.

178
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:13,100
I thought it would be. Would you
wring out an 86 in the morning?

179
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,902
If you think it 's necessary.

180
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:21,067
Not for me. But I guess you
haven't been up for a while.

181
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:25,772
No diplomacy, please. If you want
to see me fly an 86, I'll show you.

182
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:29,415
No offense. Routine.

183
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:33,048
- Sure.
- Glad to have you with us.

184
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:36,789
Dutch... good night.

185
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:52,675
- Major Saville?
- I'm Saville.

186
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,242
I'm going to fly with
you this morning.

187
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:58,279
- I know.
- My name is Corona. Like the cigar.

188
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,780
- Glad to know you.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:03,681
- My call is Cobra, right?
- Right.

190
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:08,791
- You'll fly the one marked FU-14O.
- Shall we get on with it?

191
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:13,589
- You had much time in an F-86?
- Enough, I think.

192
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,134
You'll need it. There'll be a
surprise waiting for you up there.

193
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:21,304
What 's that?

194
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:26,408
Col. Moncavage went up a while ago.
He'll test you in mock combat.

195
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,842
- Dutch's orders?
- He gets his kicks with surprises.

196
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:35,910
- Thanks for telling me.
- I'm a friend to Man.

197
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,952
<i>K- 13</i>, <i>this is Cobra</i>.
<i>Ready to go with two</i>.

198
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:48,563
You're clear for take-off, Cobra.

199
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,791
Glasses, man.

200
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:31,240
- Will this be exciting?
- That 's what I'm gonna find out.

201
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:33,702
It would've been
great 1O years ago.

202
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,141
Ten years is long ago.
Where are they?

203
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:38,281
Right up there.

204
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:15,383
Bogey at five o'clock, Cobra.

205
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,417
Moncavage is getting
into position.

206
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:21,022
<i>Moving to six o'clock</i>.
<i>Watch yourself</i>.

207
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,526
I'll break left
and take him off.

208
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:16,944
He did it! He pulled a high-speed
scissors and got on his tail!

209
00:22:56,954 --> 00:22:59,946
Get out of there, Saville.
Get out of there!

210
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:04,723
<i>You're too close</i>.
<i>Saville</i>,<i>do you read me?</i>

211
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:10,060
Break off.

212
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:12,933
<i>Break off!</i>

213
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:22,135
<i>Maj. Saville</i>, <i>this Col. Moncavage</i>.
<i>Break off!</i>

214
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:25,406
<i>Sorry</i>,<i>colonel. I didn't know</i>
<i>it was you. Moving out</i>.

215
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:37,191
The Iceman cometh.

216
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:57,747
Aren't you too old
to be playing games?

217
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:02,544
- Maybe I'm retarded.
- Lf you're nice...

218
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:05,313
I'll give you a squadron
after you've been indoctrinated.

219
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,522
- All I need is four planes.
- All right, then Flight Command.

220
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:15,862
How long will indoctrination take?
I'm pretty smart.

221
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,700
It 's usually three weeks...

222
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:23,066
but we give a bonus for old age,
maybe just two weeks for you.

223
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:45,561
How many hours did
you have in an 86?

224
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:49,324
- I said "enough".
- Enough is enough.

225
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:53,333
When you pick your flight would
you pick me? If you can stand me.

226
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:57,268
- I'm sort of obnoxious.
- I've got a pretty strong stomach.

227
00:24:57,474 --> 00:25:01,604
You sure made a fool
out of the Colonel.

228
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:13,585
Will you cash this, please?

229
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:16,186
Thank you.

230
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:38,713
- Hello, Major Saville.
- Hello, Mrs...

231
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:47,152
Thank you.

232
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:56,689
- There. Now we'll star over again.
- Hello, Major Saville.

233
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,801
- How are you, Mrs. Abbott?
- Chris.

234
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:03,461
Four dolls. You must
have many girls at home.

235
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:06,108
No, my brother
has many girls.

236
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,074
- Next, please.
- That 's you, Major.

237
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,506
Air Express, please.

238
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:17,715
You are back in Kyoto very soon.
Hasn't it only been ten days?

239
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:21,880
Several of us came to pick
up some planes to fly back.

240
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:26,654
- I see. How's Carl?
- He's fine, I suppose.

241
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:29,298
US$ 3.3<i>5</i>, please.

242
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,029
- US$ 3 and...
- 3<i>5</i> cents. 1,173 yen.

243
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:45,513
- Carl's fine. Don't worry.
- Thank you.

244
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:49,584
It was nice seeing you again.
Goodbye.

245
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:52,078
Chris?

246
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:54,348
Look...

247
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:58,584
I have nothing to do.
If you are free, could we have lunch?

248
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:00,956
Thank you. But I can't.

249
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:04,961
- There are things I must do.
- What?

250
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:09,199
You're right.
I haven't anything to do.

251
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,302
Do you know of an interesting
place where we can go?

252
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:15,034
I can't recommend
my hotel's food.

253
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,376
There is a place I like very much,
but it 's some distance.

254
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:22,650
- I have the time if you have.
- We'd need a car.

255
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,013
- Rent one right there.
- I'd better warn you.

256
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:29,625
- It will probably be pre-1941.
- That 's all right. So am I.

257
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,776
Carl's in Kyoto, isn't he?

258
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:55,041
I guess I'd better admit it.
Yes, he came in with me.

259
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:59,780
Don't feel bad. I would have
known it sooner or later.

260
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:07,121
I gather he often acts like this.
You like being stepped on?

261
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:09,799
I'm trying to understand it.

262
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:13,669
Wouldn't it be easier to
go back to the States?

263
00:28:13,937 --> 00:28:19,136
That wouldn't answer anything.
Let 's not talk about it now.

264
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,935
All right.

265
00:28:57,214 --> 00:29:02,413
Staying in the service after the
war took the least resistance.

266
00:29:02,786 --> 00:29:04,686
I chose foreign duty...

267
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:09,086
teaching pilots in France, Turkey
and Greece... marking time.

268
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:11,261
Until another war.

269
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:15,795
Until another something.
It just happened to be another war.

270
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:18,662
Now...

271
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:22,296
...let 's talk about you.
- What would you like to know?

272
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:25,236
Just start somewhere
and end somewhere.

273
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:29,000
All right.
I lived in Oslo, Norway.

274
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:32,909
I was 16 when the war in
Europe ended. I had no family.

275
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:37,644
There was a little money so
I went to Paris to study art.

276
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:41,287
My paintings looked like
a bad cross between...

277
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:45,120
Rembrandt and Picasso.
I went to NY to study art.

278
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:47,229
My paintings improved.

279
00:29:47,431 --> 00:29:52,164
It looked like a cross of
Grandma Moses and Salvador Dalí.

280
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:54,997
I met Carl.
He was very charming.

281
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:58,570
- We were married and lived happily.
- Did you?

282
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,368
For a while.

283
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:07,342
Carl got his wings only after
World War II was over.

284
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:13,781
He was called back for this war.
I came to Japan to be close to him.

285
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,721
When I met him here I didn't know him
and he didn't know me.

286
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,622
That happens to
some men in a war.

287
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:23,891
They look at death so much,
soon it 's all they see.

288
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:29,467
That 's the reason I don't go home.
Some time he might need me here.

289
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:33,507
After the war, if he lives,
maybe we can start over again.

290
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:40,111
- When will you form you flight?
- Within a few days.

291
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:43,616
- Can you pick your fliers?
- To some extent.

292
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:49,216
- Choose Carl.
- He won't be safer with me.

293
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:54,862
It isn't that. He thinks he's the
only one who is frightened.

294
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:58,159
This is the problem between us.

295
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:03,738
He thinks I expect him to be a hero.
To be in your flight...

296
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,569
Cleve Saville's flight,
might give him confidence...

297
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:10,747
bring him closer to what
he thinks he should be.

298
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:14,981
You needn't say yes or no.
Just think about it.

299
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,620
He will give you his best.

300
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:28,996
What are you thinking?

301
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,392
I was being envious
of your husband.

302
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:37,298
It 's late.

303
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:40,302
All right.

304
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:17,772
- What now, Mrs. Abbott?
- Whatever, Major Saville.

305
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:33,094
I deliberately invited that,
didn't I?

306
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:38,728
- It seemed right.
- I thought so too.

307
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:45,535
It has been an altogether
lovely day.

308
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,801
I'm very grateful.

309
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,072
Do you want me to go now?

310
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:58,417
Yes. I've taken enough
advantage of you.

311
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:02,820
- Advantage?
- Just that.

312
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:06,588
And if I don't go?

313
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:11,761
I'm off balance.
Don't press me too hard, please.

314
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:17,895
- Good night, Chris.
- Good night.

315
00:33:31,254 --> 00:33:32,881
Cleve?

316
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:37,690
Forgive me.

317
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:42,730
Forgive you?
Mrs. Abbott, I'm in love with you.

318
00:34:03,987 --> 00:34:05,454
Hello, Lieutenant.

319
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:11,755
Hello, Major. I think I can get to
the house by myself this time.

320
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:14,463
I've just been out
with your wife.

321
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:20,960
It does her good to get out once
in a while. I'm busy at the office.

322
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:25,469
- We leave at 6:OO a.m.
- I'll be there if I have to crawl.

323
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:29,236
- I can crawl pretty fast.
- I'll bet you can.

324
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:56,371
Surprise!

325
00:34:57,073 --> 00:34:59,473
You're not surprised.

326
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:05,044
- Did the killer Cleve tell you?
- Accidentally.

327
00:35:05,248 --> 00:35:09,651
He didn't know I hadn't seen you.
Why should he lie for you?

328
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:14,253
That 's right.
Nobody owes me anything.

329
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:18,120
Very friendly of Saville to
pay attention to my wife.

330
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:21,523
We met by accident
and have lunch.

331
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:25,659
What do you think of him?

332
00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:30,872
- Must you drink now?
- What do you think of him?

333
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:39,709
What 's the matter?
You must have some idea.

334
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:44,148
- Is it so important?
- Maybe. What do you think of him?

335
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:48,351
I think he's a very lonely man.

336
00:35:48,558 --> 00:35:53,222
Lonely?
He doesn't need anybody.

337
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,160
Imil calls him "the Iceman".

338
00:35:56,366 --> 00:36:00,063
He's like death: No feelings,
no nerves, no fear...

339
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,397
Why do you tell me this?

340
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:07,405
I don't know.

341
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:09,975
Forget it.

342
00:36:10,513 --> 00:36:11,775
Carl.

343
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,675
Do you think I'm comparing
you with Major Saville?

344
00:36:16,886 --> 00:36:18,649
Aren't you?

345
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:22,086
- I don't know. I might be.
- Sure.

346
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:26,954
I couldn't blame you.

347
00:36:27,163 --> 00:36:30,997
I've tried not to interfere.
I've tried to understand...

348
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:34,728
but you've got to let
me mean something.

349
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:39,807
I want to be your wife again, even
for the few hours you can spare me.

350
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:42,671
You've got a big problem, haven't you?

351
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:46,841
It isn't a big problem,
but it 's our problem.

352
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:54,914
That 's right.

353
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:58,393
I guess you're right.

354
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,258
I'll think about it.
I swear to God...

355
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,502
I'll try to think about it.

356
00:37:31,194 --> 00:37:35,995
- Major. You're in and off in a hurry.
- I have a different kind of contract.

357
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,133
They're paying me by the hour.

358
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:42,671
How do you like that?
Steady as a rock. No nerves.

359
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:47,104
- Maybe they're numb.
- Maybe they're dead.

360
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:50,780
- Evening, sir.
- Hi, Corona, Abbott.

361
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:54,648
How does it happen? I'm to fly
with such select company...

362
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:58,787
...with you, Major, and Corona.
- Col. Imil made up the flight.

363
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:01,320
- Will you join us, Major?
- Thanks.

364
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:10,691
- Gently. Don't rock the boat.
- Are all those yours?

365
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:16,500
It isn't fair to stack up another
man's beer cans. I have integrity.

366
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:20,540
I'm the most accomplished
beer stacker in the squadron.

367
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:22,973
I don't have many
Migs to my credit...

368
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:27,582
but I can match my can beer
stack up against anyone's.

369
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:33,346
You say Dutch made
up the flight, Major?

370
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,046
That 's right.

371
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:39,056
I thought my wife might have asked
you to honor me with your command.

372
00:38:39,262 --> 00:38:42,720
- Why should she?
- She's got my interests at heart.

373
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:48,962
She believed: "To keep in sickness
and in health, until death..."

374
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:55,206
She believes a soldier's wife
should follow her man into battle.

375
00:38:55,411 --> 00:38:59,006
I'm not interested in what
you think about you wife...

376
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:02,343
but in what happens to
me in the Yalu River...

377
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:05,350
with a drunk pilot
flying my wing.

378
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:08,786
If you want to fly,
don't drink another beer.

379
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,988
- What if I don't want to fly?
- I'll be happy to oblige you...

380
00:39:15,198 --> 00:39:17,689
by reporting your
alcohol content to lmil.

381
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:22,899
I guess I don't owe my
wife a vote of thanks.

382
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:33,280
- Good night, Major.
- Good night, Lieutenant.

383
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:41,351
I've met his wife a few times.
She's all right.

384
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:47,894
There's only one thing I can
say fot that guy: He's got guts.

385
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:52,898
Everytime he takes off on a mission,
he's scared, but he goes anyway.

386
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:55,593
That 's what counts...
when you go anyway.

387
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:59,935
Nobody makes you fly.
He could dog it. Nobody cares.

388
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:01,906
Nobody cares but Abbott.

389
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:07,547
- Give me some cigars, will you?
- Yes, sir.

390
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:10,817
What 's your name?

391
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,545
I've been buying cigars here for
weeks and you don't know my name?

392
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:16,281
- Charlie!
- I ought to be shot at sunrise.

393
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:18,426
Pell. P-E-L-L.

394
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:22,120
- Pell. Eight cigars.
- What do you mean? Six.

395
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:25,563
Six. You can't
blame for trying.

396
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,361
- Major Saville?
- That 's right.

397
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:31,335
- I'm Ed Pell.
- What about it?

398
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:34,977
- I'm assigned to your flight.
- Meet Lt. Corona. Same flight.

399
00:40:35,178 --> 00:40:37,373
- How are you?
- Glad to know you.

400
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:40,542
- When do we get a mission?
- We have the morning mission.

401
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,241
Briefing at <i>5</i> o' clock.
Don't you ever read the schedule?

402
00:40:43,453 --> 00:40:47,719
I just left Indoctrination. <i>5</i> is
all right with me. "George".

403
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:50,358
- What?
- "George".

404
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:55,161
"Tom" and "George". "George" means
"okay" and "Tom" means "not okay".

405
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,663
- Right, pal?
- You got it, man.

406
00:40:58,201 --> 00:40:59,532
You're not experienced, eh?

407
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:04,196
Enough to know rude young guys
with big cigars in their faces.

408
00:41:05,808 --> 00:41:07,776
You're the ace from
World War I?

409
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:10,707
I got my wings in the
Battle of Gettysburg.

410
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:13,381
Man, that 's real "George"!
A cigar?

411
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,608
- No, thanks.
- How about you that?

412
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:21,282
- You want a Corona, Corona?
- It 's gonna be a long winter.

413
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:23,356
Not so good, eh? "Tom".

414
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:25,220
- Where you from?
- Peoria.

415
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:28,761
- Peoria, what?
- Illinois. What do you think?

416
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:31,729
I didn't know. I was asking.

417
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:35,199
I'm sorry, but everybody
is picking on me.

418
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:40,240
- Do I look like I have bugs on me?
- Have you an itch?

419
00:41:41,878 --> 00:41:43,607
A silly question
gets a silly answer.

420
00:41:43,813 --> 00:41:46,941
- Sir.
- Sir. Am I gonna fly on your wing?

421
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,813
- You're on Corona's wing.
- I could be safe in the infantry.

422
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,013
I'm really good, Leader.
You'll give me a shot at a Mig, eh?

423
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,192
- You'll get a shot.
- You guys are all right...

424
00:41:57,393 --> 00:41:59,725
we'll murder them.

425
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:06,457
Thanks, Major. Good night.
We'll jive at <i>5</i>, eh?

426
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:08,398
- Good night, Lieutenant.
- Later.

427
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:30,318
You're too wide,
Cobra Four. Bring it in.

428
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:33,552
Yes, sir, Major.

429
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:45,703
That 's your position.
Stay there.

430
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:49,002
A wing man must cover his leader.
Don't forget.

431
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,341
Yes, sir, Major.
Whatever you say.

432
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:57,685
Why can't the Migs come to us
sometime? We always chase them.

433
00:42:57,887 --> 00:42:59,821
<i>They can bail</i>
<i>out near home</i>...

434
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:03,890
Stop talking, Cobra Two.
This line's for business.

435
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,890
We're coming over enemy territory,
Cobra Flight. Test your guns.

436
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:24,479
C<i>obra Flight</i>, <i>fuel check</i>.
C<i>obra Two</i>,<i>3OO gallons</i>.

437
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,708
C<i>obra Three</i>,<i>320</i>.
C<i>obra Four</i>,<i>295</i>.

438
00:43:30,386 --> 00:43:33,583
We'll make one more sweep
to the river and then go home.

439
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:38,856
Four bogeys at 3
o'clock, Leader!

440
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:43,664
You're sure? We know of no
bandit activity in this area.

441
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:47,427
<i>- Leader</i>,<i>I see them too</i>.
- Roger. I see them now.

442
00:43:47,637 --> 00:43:52,574
4 bandits on parallel course. Maintain
present heading. Drop your tanks.

443
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,445
What are we waiting for?

444
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:06,321
Cobra Lead,
I can't drop my tanks.

445
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:09,289
I'll decoy, Abbott.
Follow me down.

446
00:44:27,443 --> 00:44:30,776
<i>- Three</i>, <i>what are we waiting for?</i>
<i>- Let's go</i>,<i>Pell</i>.

447
00:45:10,253 --> 00:45:11,845
Get away, Cobra Four!

448
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:23,058
I got one! Do you see him?

449
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:25,899
Affirmative, Cobra Four.
I see him.

450
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:28,294
Where is Corona?
Where is number 3?

451
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:33,800
Just hold still.

452
00:45:54,063 --> 00:45:55,894
I'm hit! Cover me, somebody!

453
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:22,350
The Migs are crossing the river.
Break off. Are you okay, Cobra 3?

454
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:27,519
I'm burned up, freezing to death
and down to 1<i>5</i>O gallons of fuel.

455
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,062
Let 's go home!

456
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:42,539
- Cobra Four? Where are you?
<i>- Fouro'clock wide</i>,<i>Lead</i>.

457
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:45,077
What are you doing out there?
Get back into formation.

458
00:47:01,897 --> 00:47:04,092
You won't forget
my confirmation?

459
00:47:05,434 --> 00:47:07,902
You'll get your mark.
You'll get your Mig.

460
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:10,334
<i>Cuckoo</i>,<i>Daddy-o</i>.

461
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:16,108
I'm losing power.
I must be hit in the engine.

462
00:47:16,312 --> 00:47:19,281
Abbott, see if you can
persuade Pell to go home.

463
00:47:19,482 --> 00:47:23,145
<i>Roger</i>,<i>Leader. Cobra Four</i>,
<i>close it up and let's go home</i>.

464
00:47:30,626 --> 00:47:35,290
My pressure is fluctuating.
My controls are stiff. Look me over.

465
00:47:42,171 --> 00:47:45,038
<i>You've got some holes behind</i>
<i>your gear and in yourtail</i>.

466
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:47,471
<i>We'll drop down</i>
<i>and head for home</i>.

467
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:21,069
Blow your canopy off
and eject over the base.

468
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:30,975
She won't blow. I'll have to fly
her down. Somebody can chop me out.

469
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,579
<i>May Day</i>.
<i>This is Cobra Leader</i>.

470
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,280
Go ahead.

471
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:40,326
<i>K- 13</i>,<i>Cobra Three is coming in</i>
<i>shot upwith a jammed canopy</i>.

472
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:44,989
- We have a Mayday!
<i>- Did you read me</i>,<i>K- 13?</i>

473
00:48:45,734 --> 00:48:49,033
We'll be ready for you.
Bring him in on the alternate runway.

474
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:53,698
Get those trucks running!
Tower, tell Dutch we have a May Day.

475
00:49:02,685 --> 00:49:05,677
- Who is it?
- Corona. He's going to try to land.

476
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:07,617
- What 's his fuel?
- We don't know.

477
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,554
Tower, this is Cobra Leader.
Do you see us?

478
00:49:12,962 --> 00:49:14,691
I've got 'em.

479
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:22,100
We see you. Send Corona down.
You land on the main runaway.

480
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:30,278
- You're by yourself, Cobra Three.
- Aren't we all? Okay, Leader.

481
00:49:30,479 --> 00:49:32,470
<i>Good luck</i>,<i>Seegar</i>.

482
00:49:37,786 --> 00:49:42,917
You look about right. Your gear's
down okay. Speed okay. Relax.

483
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:46,284
Don't anybody get excited.
I always walk away.

484
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:53,896
Get your nose down, Corona!
Ease it down!

485
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:58,296
Drop the nose!

486
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,170
My controls are locked!

487
00:50:21,797 --> 00:50:26,666
All I want to know is this: Where
were you when Corona needed cover?

488
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:30,635
He was cutting through Major's
line of fire chasing his Mig.

489
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,399
- I didn't see the Major's plane!
- Why did you leave your element?

490
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:36,669
- I asked Corona for permission.
- I didn't hear that.

491
00:50:36,879 --> 00:50:39,109
You're trying to bug me
and I'm not going to take it!

492
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:41,476
At ease, Lieutenant!
I said, at ease!

493
00:50:41,717 --> 00:50:43,912
Did you hear Pell
ask permission?

494
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:47,919
Because he didn't hear
doesn't mean I didn't ask.

495
00:50:48,123 --> 00:50:52,082
All right, that 's all.
You and Lt. Abbott can go.

496
00:50:52,294 --> 00:50:56,788
- I'll talk to Major Saville.
- I want to hear anything said about me!

497
00:50:56,999 --> 00:51:00,628
Are you too stupid to understand
you've been dismissed?

498
00:51:00,836 --> 00:51:03,464
- Okay!
- What did you say?

499
00:51:04,673 --> 00:51:07,141
Yes, sir.
I've been dismissed.

500
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:16,909
- What do you think about him?
- I can't use him.

501
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:21,287
Look at this record.

502
00:51:22,591 --> 00:51:25,116
"Air to ground gunnery:
First in his class.

503
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:29,559
Air to air gunnery: First.
Tactical combat: First.

504
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:34,725
First... first..." And on his
first mission he gets a Mig.

505
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:37,098
- At the cost of one of ours.
- That could've been...

506
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:40,798
a misunderstanding.
Maybe Pell did ask permission.

507
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,170
He's a liar.

508
00:51:42,378 --> 00:51:45,211
I can't ground a man
on what we only think.

509
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:48,647
It 's your decision.
I don't want him in my flight.

510
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:54,050
Nobody else will want him either.
There's another way to handle this.

511
00:51:55,758 --> 00:51:58,056
Make Pell your element leader.

512
00:51:58,394 --> 00:52:01,921
Then you've got no worries.
Somebody else can cover him.

513
00:52:02,564 --> 00:52:06,625
You want me to praise him?
Say: "You killed your leader...

514
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:09,360
...l'll make you leader"?
- Nobody's praising him.

515
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:13,837
I've got one thought: Get Migs.
That 's my job.

516
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:16,978
This little stinker
can get Migs!

517
00:52:17,312 --> 00:52:19,940
If he doesn't get killed first,
he'll be an ace.

518
00:52:20,149 --> 00:52:22,845
I won't stand in his way.

519
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:26,453
Let somebody else wipe his nose,
not me... not my flight.

520
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:31,115
Yes, in your flight.
I couldn't find a better place!

521
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,723
Most of these boys are risking their
lives because it has to be done.

522
00:52:36,932 --> 00:52:41,960
But you're different. You like the risk.
It 's how you get your kicks.

523
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:46,073
When you risk your life it 's
to see if it 's your turn to die.

524
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:50,678
Let 's not pretend you care about
the death of another pilot.

525
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,507
I remember you
from the old days.

526
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:56,776
You were just like this boy.
Way out, all by yourself.

527
00:52:56,985 --> 00:53:01,513
You're two of a kind, you and Pell.
You can handle him.

528
00:53:01,724 --> 00:53:04,022
Make him your element leader.
That 's an order.

529
00:53:09,832 --> 00:53:12,027
That 's all, isn't it?

530
00:53:13,702 --> 00:53:17,968
Yes, sir. Thanks for the
review of my past history.

531
00:53:18,173 --> 00:53:21,108
Past history?
Current events.

532
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:25,406
Men like you don't get
any better, just get older.

533
00:53:25,614 --> 00:53:27,445
As you say, Colonel.

534
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:42,960
Major! How about it?
Did you sink me?

535
00:53:44,399 --> 00:53:47,630
Thanks. You're all right.
I thought you'd defend me.

536
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:49,633
- You did?
- Sure.

537
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:52,102
I figured you were a guy who
would take care of his men.

538
00:53:52,307 --> 00:53:54,366
- I am.
- I know.

539
00:53:56,011 --> 00:54:00,414
And that poor guy, Corona?
Tough, eh? How about that?

540
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,315
- How about that?
- What was that for?

541
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:07,887
For "that poor guy, Corona".

542
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:14,495
- Should I said I lied?
- That might do for a starter.

543
00:54:15,864 --> 00:54:20,267
Okay, I'm lying.

544
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:22,835
Corona burned on account of me.

545
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:27,572
Now, you tell me something.
How will it help for me to admit it?

546
00:54:27,776 --> 00:54:31,212
- You think it 'll help Corona?
- No, but It helps me.

547
00:54:31,413 --> 00:54:36,180
You're my new element leader.
I didn't want any doubts about you.

548
00:54:36,385 --> 00:54:40,583
I'm stuck with you, but if you
fly with me you'll fly right...

549
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:45,522
unless you want a lump of hot
lead in the back of your head.

550
00:54:45,727 --> 00:54:49,561
You dig, Daddy? "George"?

551
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:53,092
Yes, sir.

552
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:55,566
Major!

553
00:54:57,806 --> 00:55:02,607
- You have nothing to worry about.
- I'll buy that when I see it.

554
00:56:56,091 --> 00:57:00,084
You're right, that does look
like two other painters.

555
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:03,389
It 's fine for me to say that,
but not for you.

556
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:05,998
You're not answering
your phone.

557
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:10,365
I knew you were here. I thought
it wouldn't be wise to see you.

558
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:13,507
You could've told me
that on the telephone.

559
00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:16,910
Perhaps that 's why
I didn't answer it.

560
00:57:17,446 --> 00:57:20,176
You're very attractive,
Mrs. Abbott.

561
00:57:20,382 --> 00:57:24,045
Thank you, Major.
Is Carl all right?

562
00:57:24,252 --> 00:57:28,780
- He's not in Kyoto.
- I haven't heard from him.

563
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,816
He's my wing man.

564
00:57:33,028 --> 00:57:36,259
That was nice of you.
He wasn't pleased?

565
00:57:36,465 --> 00:57:39,127
He suspected you
had helped him.

566
00:57:40,202 --> 00:57:44,935
- I don't seem to do anything right now.
- Maybe you ask too much of yourself.

567
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:49,440
I have that same jalopy parked
outside. Shall we use it?

568
00:57:51,113 --> 00:57:53,411
This folder it 's a...

569
00:57:53,648 --> 00:57:57,140
it 's a"what to see" folder.
Put out by the Air Force.

570
00:57:57,386 --> 00:58:00,844
It says there's a lake near
here with scenery around it...

571
00:58:01,056 --> 00:58:05,425
boats and things like that. Perhaps
you might want to look at that.

572
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:10,564
No. It 's not necessary. I'll
go with you. Give a minute to dress.

573
00:58:13,168 --> 00:58:16,535
- Am I being foolish?
- No!

574
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:43,219
There you are.

575
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:48,026
They frighten away the bad
spirits and please the good ones.

576
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:51,493
In the East, they have
a saying for everything.

577
00:59:52,601 --> 00:59:56,469
"In my house when the
wind sings, love dwells".

578
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:11,712
This should have happened
before I met Carl.

579
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,946
Now it 's out of time,
out of place.

580
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:19,526
The time is always now,
the place is always here.

581
01:00:20,128 --> 01:00:25,156
- But not like this. Not like this!
- Is there any other way?

582
01:00:26,234 --> 01:00:31,365
- I don't know.
- Would you give him up?

583
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,007
No.

584
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:39,738
But you said yourself your life
was going nowhere. So is mine.

585
01:00:40,148 --> 01:00:42,844
I can't desert Carl.

586
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:47,317
- Then what 's left for us except...
- All right...

587
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:53,821
all right, if it will mean
anything to you at all...

588
01:01:00,368 --> 01:01:03,030
No, you're right.

589
01:01:03,238 --> 01:01:06,730
It 's out of time,
out of place.

590
01:01:13,548 --> 01:01:15,448
Cleve!

591
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,710
Will you...

592
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:25,255
A woman is a strange
and wonderful thing.

593
01:01:26,094 --> 01:01:29,552
I'll wager you'll ask
me to look after Carl.

594
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:40,498
I'll look after him, Chris.

595
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:47,212
Good night.

596
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:09,068
Hail to the Ace of Aces,
the Achilles without a heel.

597
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:11,068
How are you?

598
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:15,608
I used you absence to
a good advantage.

599
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:19,075
I haven't had a drink of water
in three days, and I feel fine.

600
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:20,771
Good.

601
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:23,308
Did you hear about the
return of Casey Jones...

602
01:02:23,518 --> 01:02:27,579
starring Col. Moncavage
and six orientals?

603
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:30,917
Yeah, I heard about it. How do
you know it was Casey Jones?

604
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,924
He had the same 7-11
painted on his fuselage.

605
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:36,029
He took Moncavage
out with one pass.

606
01:02:36,231 --> 01:02:40,634
He got close and
exploded him, like that.

607
01:02:40,835 --> 01:02:43,269
His wingman killed Johnson and
the rest of our birds came home...

608
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:46,372
on a wing and a curse.

609
01:02:49,344 --> 01:02:53,838
Would you do a favor
for an old friend?

610
01:02:54,049 --> 01:02:55,812
Maybe. What is it?

611
01:02:56,017 --> 01:03:00,147
If we run into Casey Jones,
would you let me take him?

612
01:03:02,057 --> 01:03:06,653
- You and Pell have got enough.
- That 's not the point.

613
01:03:06,928 --> 01:03:10,694
- You think I'm not good enough, right?
- No, I don't think you're good enough.

614
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:13,390
So don't you get any ideas.
You stay on my wing.

615
01:03:13,601 --> 01:03:16,263
Thanks, pal. I love you dearly.

616
01:03:17,205 --> 01:03:19,730
See my wife?

617
01:03:20,275 --> 01:03:24,473
- She called on you, I guess.
- No, it was the other way around.

618
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:29,309
- It 's a nice gesture. Thanks.
- Think nothing of it.

619
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:32,281
- Cleve.
- Yeah.

620
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,488
You want to compare notes?

621
01:03:41,062 --> 01:03:45,590
So... the Iceman has got
a melted spot, eh?

622
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:50,103
But aren't we a bit confused?
Wife's lover slugs husband.

623
01:03:50,305 --> 01:03:53,274
Oughta be the other way around,
shouldn't it?

624
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:56,806
Wouldn't you be worried
flying beside me?

625
01:03:57,011 --> 01:04:02,005
All I've got to do is drop
back and press the trigger.

626
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,618
That 's all you've got to do.

627
01:04:05,286 --> 01:04:10,622
Don't worry. I have another idea.
I'll make you a deal, Cleve.

628
01:04:10,825 --> 01:04:15,125
I get a chance at Casey Jones if
we meet him... you get my wife.

629
01:04:15,964 --> 01:04:21,197
Up and even.
What do you say, old Cleve?

630
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:26,105
- Excuse me, Major.
- What is it?

631
01:04:26,307 --> 01:04:29,037
Col. Imil wants to see all
Flight Commanders.

632
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,109
Thank you.

633
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,571
Well, Cleve?

634
01:04:34,783 --> 01:04:38,651
What 's it like in that
tortured mond of yours?

635
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:43,183
Exclusive.
It 's reserved only for me.

636
01:05:04,212 --> 01:05:06,271
I'll show you what I mean.

637
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:09,348
The enemy has cut
through this bulge.

638
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:12,281
We have 18,OOO
men in this pocket...

639
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:17,515
Marines, Blackwatchs, the Turks and
the Greeks. They'll hold the pocket.

640
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:22,695
Sometime about O3OO hours,
a flock of C-119's will leave...

641
01:05:22,897 --> 01:05:25,957
to parachute supplies and
reinforcements into the pocket.

642
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:31,230
We'll use all our planes to give
them the most protection we can.

643
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:34,966
The Migs will be swarming
up there like bees.

644
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:38,077
It 's no accident that Casey Jones
has reappeared.

645
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:41,476
They're probably using
all their best pilots.

646
01:05:41,683 --> 01:05:45,710
We must stop them.
That 's all. It 's simple.

647
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,549
You'll get your time over
target in briefing. Goodnight.

648
01:09:17,131 --> 01:09:20,567
Viper and Rattlesnake
go to the Chinnampo area.

649
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:30,304
Cobra Flight, break off.
That 's the Sunanju River.

650
01:09:30,912 --> 01:09:32,004
Roger, Phyton.

651
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:51,195
<i>Keep it close</i>,<i>Four</i>.

652
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:52,991
I'm having engine trouble.

653
01:09:53,501 --> 01:09:56,299
We won't risk it.
Break off and go home.

654
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:58,938
<i>Roger</i>,<i>Leader</i>.
<i>Good hunting</i>.

655
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:13,047
- Fly spare, Pell. Don't get into trouble.
- Roger, Leader. I'm a cautious kid.

656
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:24,992
- Cleve, did we make a deal?
- No chatter. Maintain silence.

657
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:29,864
- This is the day. I fell it.
- Knock it off.

658
01:10:38,112 --> 01:10:42,310
- Planes at one o'clock low!
- I've got them.

659
01:10:42,517 --> 01:10:45,918
- Phyton, this is Cobra.
<i>- Go ahead</i>.

660
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,318
Bogeys at <i>2</i>O, OOO feet
coming into target area, heading 1-4-O.

661
01:10:50,725 --> 01:10:54,593
See what you can cut out of them.
We'll take on the rest.

662
01:10:55,029 --> 01:10:58,590
Roger, Phyton.
Cobra Flight, drop tanks.

663
01:12:32,026 --> 01:12:36,087
Cobra Two! Come in, Two!
Where are you, Abbott?

664
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:40,264
He was hit, but he bailed out.
Cleve, above you! It 's the crap shooter!

665
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:55,092
Phyton, this is Cobra.

666
01:14:55,336 --> 01:14:58,794
- I read you, Cobra. Go ahead.
<i>- Do you need us?</i>

667
01:14:59,006 --> 01:15:03,875
We've had a tactic shoot here.
The remaining Migs have fled.

668
01:15:04,078 --> 01:15:06,342
The drop is under way.

669
01:15:15,156 --> 01:15:18,922
- Pell, where did Abbott eject?
<i>- To the north</i>,<i>I think</i>.

670
01:15:19,126 --> 01:15:22,027
Let 's take a look.
Swing around to the left.

671
01:15:32,406 --> 01:15:35,500
Leader, I only have
14O gallons of fuel left.

672
01:15:35,709 --> 01:15:39,338
I have 17O. I'll look awhile.
You break off and go home, Pell.

673
01:15:39,613 --> 01:15:42,241
Rescue can't send a chopper in
this far.

674
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,180
<i>- Did you hear me</i>,<i>Pell?</i>
- Yes, sir.

675
01:15:45,386 --> 01:15:48,480
<i>- Then you heard me say</i>,<i>go home</i>.
- Breaking off.

676
01:18:50,471 --> 01:18:53,304
Easy, Carl. I've got you.

677
01:22:37,331 --> 01:22:39,162
I followed you,
so court-martial me.

678
01:22:39,366 --> 01:22:41,857
Get out of that yellow gear.

679
01:22:44,037 --> 01:22:45,902
He got it bad, eh?

680
01:22:46,306 --> 01:22:50,140
- Can you use that automatic?
- I'm a killer, man.

681
01:22:50,344 --> 01:22:53,609
You go on ahead of us.
That way, to the south.

682
01:22:53,814 --> 01:22:57,011
- Let 's make a stretcher.
- We must get out of here first.

683
01:22:57,217 --> 01:22:59,515
Come on, let 's go.

684
01:23:08,662 --> 01:23:10,186
- Who's next?
- Mrs. Abbott.

685
01:23:10,397 --> 01:23:12,490
Send her in, please.

686
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:16,460
You may come in now.

687
01:23:18,705 --> 01:23:20,866
This it Lt. Abbott 's wife.
Major Dark.

688
01:23:21,074 --> 01:23:24,066
Won't you sit down?

689
01:23:26,246 --> 01:23:28,373
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

690
01:23:28,582 --> 01:23:33,451
I've known other wives who've
had this appointment. I know why.

691
01:23:34,588 --> 01:23:38,319
- Is Carl dead?
- He's missing.

692
01:23:38,525 --> 01:23:41,119
- How long has it been?
- This it the fifth day.

693
01:23:41,328 --> 01:23:44,320
He was been parachuting
into enemy territory.

694
01:23:44,798 --> 01:23:46,766
He's alive?

695
01:23:47,134 --> 01:23:51,730
If he wasn't hit and his fall
was good, he may be all right.

696
01:23:51,939 --> 01:23:55,067
However, if he is,
he's almost certainly a prisoner.

697
01:23:55,275 --> 01:23:58,472
I know that 's not very comforting,
the Red prison camps...

698
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:01,944
being what they are, but there
is a chance that he is alive.

699
01:24:02,082 --> 01:24:04,277
Is there no way to find out?

700
01:24:04,484 --> 01:24:07,715
The information we
receive from the Reds...

701
01:24:07,921 --> 01:24:10,719
through neutral channels
is seldom accurate.

702
01:24:10,924 --> 01:24:14,860
If his name isn't on the prisoner list
that doesn't prove anything.

703
01:24:15,062 --> 01:24:16,461
I see.

704
01:24:16,663 --> 01:24:20,394
Did you know Lt. Pell
or Major Saville?

705
01:24:20,601 --> 01:24:25,300
- Saville was the flight commander.
- I know Major Saville.

706
01:24:25,672 --> 01:24:29,802
They were searching for your husband.
They are also missing.

707
01:24:31,745 --> 01:24:36,648
- That was my fault.
- I don't think that 's quite possible.

708
01:24:37,684 --> 01:24:40,380
I asked Major Saville
to look after Carl.

709
01:24:40,587 --> 01:24:46,457
Of course. But that 's a phrase that
we all use: Looking after someone.

710
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:51,820
I don't think it would be just
a phrase to Major Saville.

711
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,592
Thank you, sir.

712
01:24:54,801 --> 01:24:57,895
If we get any news,
I'll get in touch with you immediately.

713
01:24:58,105 --> 01:24:59,094
Thank you.

714
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:01,407
Mrs. Mason.

715
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:08,377
This is Lt. Mason's wife.
Major Dark.

716
01:25:08,582 --> 01:25:11,210
Won't you sit down?

717
01:25:12,819 --> 01:25:14,787
Cigarette?

718
01:26:46,813 --> 01:26:49,577
- Take it.
- Man, we could start a war.

719
01:27:08,635 --> 01:27:11,331
Keep a close watch.

720
01:27:23,049 --> 01:27:25,017
Eat this.

721
01:27:27,587 --> 01:27:31,751
- Where's yours?
- I've had mine. Eat it.

722
01:27:51,444 --> 01:27:53,969
They must make this
from Stalin's socks.

723
01:27:55,315 --> 01:27:57,545
- Cleve.
- Yeah.

724
01:27:58,418 --> 01:28:00,943
None of us are going to
get out of here unless...

725
01:28:01,154 --> 01:28:02,917
Unless what?

726
01:28:03,356 --> 01:28:08,453
Unless you and Pell let them find
me and go on by yourselves.

727
01:28:08,662 --> 01:28:11,529
They don't take
wounded prisoners.

728
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:15,468
You'd get a gun butt right
between the eyes. Now eat it.

729
01:28:36,957 --> 01:28:41,792
Let 's get out of here before they
star tracking us in the mud.

730
01:28:41,995 --> 01:28:43,792
I got it.

731
01:28:59,846 --> 01:29:01,905
Let 's go.

732
01:29:16,796 --> 01:29:20,562
Set him over here, Pell.
Forward a little bit.

733
01:29:29,442 --> 01:29:32,275
- How is he?
- I don't know.

734
01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:37,282
Look! We're not going to
move outta here for a while.

735
01:29:37,484 --> 01:29:41,682
I'll stand the first watch. Why
don't you sack out for a few hours?

736
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:46,054
"George".

737
01:30:08,715 --> 01:30:12,116
Have you any of those
Chinese butts left?

738
01:30:31,404 --> 01:30:33,599
Where are we?

739
01:30:33,807 --> 01:30:38,870
Lmjim Baptist Mission.
We're close to the lmjim River.

740
01:30:42,482 --> 01:30:48,387
That means... That means
we have a long way to go yet.

741
01:30:49,356 --> 01:30:51,984
Not as long as it was.

742
01:31:05,171 --> 01:31:07,401
I'm not going to make it.

743
01:31:09,309 --> 01:31:12,540
You've stopped bleeding.
You'll make it.

744
01:31:16,349 --> 01:31:20,115
The crows could be pecking
at me in that tree right now.

745
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:22,513
You could be in Kyoto...

746
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:28,189
and she's be free.
Why did you do it, Cleve?

747
01:31:31,998 --> 01:31:36,094
"I could not love thee,
dear, so much...

748
01:31:36,703 --> 01:31:40,730
Ioved I not honor more."
Is that it, Cleve?

749
01:31:42,442 --> 01:31:46,674
You have a soul under
that tough hide.

750
01:31:51,851 --> 01:31:53,614
Cleve.

751
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:12,698
"The pure in heart".

752
01:32:13,606 --> 01:32:16,074
Who would guess it?

753
01:32:19,846 --> 01:32:23,077
You don't belong in
this stinking world.

754
01:33:14,767 --> 01:33:18,703
Bandage... have you
got a bandage?

755
01:33:29,816 --> 01:33:32,376
- What 's up?
- They're friends.

756
01:33:57,243 --> 01:33:59,939
We don't know what you're
saying, but that sound great.

757
01:34:07,453 --> 01:34:10,149
He's trying to say
they're Christians.

758
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,585
A Bible!
How about that?

759
01:34:12,792 --> 01:34:15,022
We understand.

760
01:34:15,361 --> 01:34:18,057
We... understand.

761
01:35:09,082 --> 01:35:11,676
- What 's happening?
- We'd better get out of here.

762
01:35:21,094 --> 01:35:23,153
Let 's go!

763
01:35:37,143 --> 01:35:39,236
Over here.

764
01:36:43,943 --> 01:36:47,538
Look! If you want to do something,
we'll do it my way.

765
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,110
This way.

766
01:37:04,497 --> 01:37:06,328
See this hand grenade.

767
01:37:10,002 --> 01:37:11,264
Now!

768
01:37:35,261 --> 01:37:37,195
- Where'd you take it?
- Arm.

769
01:37:37,697 --> 01:37:40,029
- All right, let 's go.
- Easy.

770
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:42,426
Easy.

771
01:38:04,223 --> 01:38:06,316
How about that?

772
01:38:07,059 --> 01:38:09,755
How about that?

773
01:38:15,067 --> 01:38:17,331
You ready, kid?

774
01:38:45,798 --> 01:38:48,995
Can you pull this
thing by yourself?

775
01:38:50,069 --> 01:38:52,435
I'll go on ahead.

776
01:38:53,005 --> 01:38:57,635
You know, Pell?
You would be a nice guy...

777
01:38:57,844 --> 01:39:00,472
if you'd shave once in a while.

778
01:40:06,145 --> 01:40:08,238
Mother of Athens!
You're Greeks!

779
01:40:08,447 --> 01:40:12,679
- There are you going?
- Right here, Sargeant.

780
01:40:12,885 --> 01:40:14,853
Is the boy in the cart alive?

781
01:40:15,054 --> 01:40:18,820
Yes, he's alive.
Have you a cigarette?

782
01:40:22,762 --> 01:40:27,165
- Is that boy sick, too?
- No. He just fell asleep.

783
01:40:47,987 --> 01:40:51,218
Yes, Mrs. Abbott,
would you please follow me?

784
01:40:52,658 --> 01:40:57,618
You may have 1O minutes with him.
You must not encourage him to talk.

785
01:41:03,669 --> 01:41:07,571
Lt. Abbott? Your wife's here.

786
01:41:07,773 --> 01:41:09,536
- Hello, honey.
- Hello, Carl.

787
01:41:09,742 --> 01:41:13,200
- I'll be back when your time is up.
- Thank you.

788
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,048
Sit down, honey.

789
01:41:16,682 --> 01:41:19,014
Not there.

790
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:31,221
I'm being taken to San
Francisco next week.

791
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:35,025
- I know. They've told me.
- What will you do?

792
01:41:35,234 --> 01:41:38,897
- Don't try to talk.
- Chris... what will you do?

793
01:41:42,908 --> 01:41:47,368
I've been in a dark place.

794
01:41:48,848 --> 01:41:50,941
Lying here...

795
01:41:52,718 --> 01:41:57,382
...l've come into the daylight again.
- What are you trying to say?

796
01:42:00,092 --> 01:42:02,925
I'm trying to say that...

797
01:42:03,596 --> 01:42:08,363
I remember how it was
with us before the war.

798
01:42:08,567 --> 01:42:12,264
I want it to be
that way again.

799
01:42:24,684 --> 01:42:27,812
I've waited until...
too late to say that, haven't I?

800
01:42:41,867 --> 01:42:43,994
Got a match?

801
01:42:47,707 --> 01:42:51,700
- You cuttin 'em up again, pal?
- Yes, man. I got my tenth.

802
01:42:52,478 --> 01:42:55,641
- When're you coming back?
- I'm in a weakened condition.

803
01:42:55,848 --> 01:42:57,873
I might even arrange to die.

804
01:42:58,084 --> 01:43:01,645
Isn't he the fang?
The Old Skipper sure is the fang.

805
01:43:01,987 --> 01:43:04,353
How do you talk to him
without an interpreter?

806
01:43:04,557 --> 01:43:07,993
I use smoke signals.
What 's "the fang"?

807
01:43:08,194 --> 01:43:12,722
- I forget, you don't get around.
- Knock it off.

808
01:43:12,932 --> 01:43:17,232
You're getting a medal for Casey
Jones, to add to your collection.

809
01:43:17,436 --> 01:43:18,801
It 's gonna make me top heavy.

810
01:43:19,004 --> 01:43:21,529
Don't object.
Somebody must be a hero.

811
01:43:21,741 --> 01:43:26,041
- Am I in your new flight, Skipper?
- You've earned your own flight.

812
01:43:26,245 --> 01:43:31,615
Not me. I'm scared. I want to
be in a safe flight. Like with him.

813
01:43:31,817 --> 01:43:34,285
- Suit yourself.
- How about it, Skipper?

814
01:43:34,487 --> 01:43:37,149
Don't call me "Skipper",
you read that.

815
01:43:37,356 --> 01:43:40,951
- Surely, daddy-o.
- Blow.

816
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:44,559
Blow? "George"!
Later.

817
01:43:47,733 --> 01:43:50,930
I have to ask you a question.

818
01:43:51,137 --> 01:43:54,072
I have to ask it. What happened?

819
01:43:54,273 --> 01:43:58,869
- Didn't Pell tell you?
- He said you're both shot down.

820
01:43:59,078 --> 01:44:03,242
- Pell was. I wasn't.
- Pell was lying? That 's all right.

821
01:44:03,449 --> 01:44:05,508
Anybody can run out of gas.

822
01:44:05,718 --> 01:44:08,516
I didn't run out of gas.

823
01:44:09,321 --> 01:44:13,052
Orders are to get yourself and
you plane back if possible.

824
01:44:13,259 --> 01:44:16,558
A man could be court-martialed
for disobeying.

825
01:44:17,696 --> 01:44:19,789
I could have returned safely.

826
01:44:19,999 --> 01:44:23,958
I had to ask you, but you didn't
say have to tell the truth.

827
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:28,266
I don't want any favors, Dutch.
I don't deserve them.

828
01:44:29,141 --> 01:44:31,803
You know...

829
01:44:32,011 --> 01:44:35,276
You think you got a man dead to rights,
then he throws you a curve.

830
01:44:35,481 --> 01:44:39,918
You, for instance.
I thought I had you all figured out.

831
01:44:40,119 --> 01:44:42,144
Now, I'm not so sure.

832
01:44:42,354 --> 01:44:45,016
Maybe a man is never what
you think he is.

833
01:44:45,224 --> 01:44:48,057
Maybe he isn't even what
he thinks he is.

834
01:44:48,661 --> 01:44:53,724
Anyway, I'm accepting Pell's report.
If you consider that a favor, too bad.

835
01:44:54,333 --> 01:44:56,699
Here's your matches.

836
01:45:18,157 --> 01:45:20,455
- Hello, Chris.
- How are you?

837
01:45:20,659 --> 01:45:25,028
I'm fine. We're unveiling
the arm in about ten days.

838
01:45:26,165 --> 01:45:28,565
- You saw Carl?
- Just now.

839
01:45:28,968 --> 01:45:31,129
Then you know he's
being sent home.

840
01:45:31,337 --> 01:45:35,068
I know. Will you go
back to Korea?

841
01:45:35,374 --> 01:45:38,502
This is the only war I have.

842
01:45:40,012 --> 01:45:43,448
- When are you leaving?
- As soon...

843
01:45:45,317 --> 01:45:48,309
I'll leave as soon as
I can, I suppose.

844
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:53,116
- You suppose?
- As soon as I can arrange passage.

845
01:45:56,762 --> 01:46:01,426
There's the warning bell for
the visitors. You must leave.

846
01:46:02,001 --> 01:46:03,229
Cleve, if I...

847
01:46:03,435 --> 01:46:06,302
Whatever you're about
to say, don't say it.

848
01:46:06,505 --> 01:46:10,032
Thanks. I was about
to be very childish.

849
01:46:12,511 --> 01:46:14,945
Goodbye, Mrs. Abbott.

850
01:46:15,648 --> 01:46:18,583
Goodbye, Major Saville.

851
01:47:37,162 --> 01:47:40,154
