00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,640
Now, fall in, featherbrains.

320
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,260
Fall... in!

321
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,640
I thought I'd seen it all.

322
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,230
For the next six weeks,

323
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,400
your tails belong to me.

324
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,240
You'll learn to march like birds,
fly like birds, and fight like birds.

325
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,280
I will make birds of you turkeys,
even if it kills you.

326
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,950
Except you.
You won't last a week.

327
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,250
Permission to die trying, sir.

328
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,130
Hmpf. It's like this, ladies.

329
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,420
You will shape up,and you will shape up fast,

330
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,340
or I will personally drum you out of the corps!

331
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,970
Funny you should...
I would love to get drummed out.

332
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,140
I was gonna bring it up
if you hadn't, so...

333
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,180
Leave him alone. He helped me to...
Pipe down, pipsqueak!

334
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm more interested in having you
all drop and give me 50!

335
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,650
Courtesy of your short
little friend here.

336
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,360
[Groaning]

337
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,400
[Grunting]

338
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,240
Training at last.

339
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,660
[Lofty] I say, old bean,
wouldn't it be more sporting

340
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,910
if the chap who actually
committed the infraction... Ooh!

341
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,920
Gentlemen, welcome to
the Royal Homing Pigeon Service.

342
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,920
[Growling]

343
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,340
For the last time,what was your mission?

344
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,220
And where are these
messages coming from?

345
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,930
Ha!
Very well.

346
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,190
Have it your way.

347
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,810
[Laughing]

348
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,520
You want us to pluck out his feathers?

349
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,030
And to clip his wings?

350
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,110
Hurt his feelings?

351
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,370
[Laughing]
[Von Talon] No, no, no.

352
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,540
Worse. Much worse.

353
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,500
We have ways of making you squawk.

354
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,340
[Gasping]
[Music playing]

355
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,760
[Yodeling]

356
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,100
What kind of birds are you?

357
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,350
[Yodeling continues]

358
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,310
[Screaming]

359
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,980
Must resist yodeling.
[shouting]

360
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,120
(Rule, Britannia

361
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,330
Britannia rules the waves)

362
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,670
One, two, one, two.

363
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,420
And halt.

364
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,260
Now fall out and report
to the nursing dock.

365
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,800
[Gasping]
Nurses!

366
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,640
Whoa, look at her.
Hello, nurse.

367
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,020
Well, I've been waiting for you.

368
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,440
Do you have something for a brave pigeon
about to go into battle? Eh, darling?

369
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,860
It just so happens
I do have something for you.

370
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,660
Oh, did you hear that?
[Whooping]

371
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,570
Is this what you had in mind?
[Gasping]

372
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,200
Ooh, it's awfully big.
[Giggling]

373
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,170
You're kind of short for a nursing dove.

374
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,420
Look who's talking.

375
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,920
I'd say you're kind of short for a carrier pigeon.

376
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,470
I'm Valiant, by the way.
All right, then, Valiant.

377
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,090
I'm Victoria.Ooh.

378
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,140
I know you lads have had a tiring day.

379
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,020
What you need is a nice,relaxing shower.

380
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,020
[Screaming]

381
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,860
[Screaming, groaning]

382
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,700
[Laughing]

383
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,200
Then I'll treat you to a fancy dinner.

384
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,460
[Sneezing]

385
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,420
Mmm.

386
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,010
[Belches]

387
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,680
We'll get you a feather cut.
[Gasping]

388
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,980
Set you up with some uniforms.

389
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,070
Oh, beg your pardon.

390
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,120
Did that hurt? Did that hurt?

391
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,540
That's it.

392
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,370
Ah!
[Growling]

393
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,830
[Muttering]

394
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,340
Then we'll all turn in for a good night's sleep.

395
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,550
[Gasping]

396
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,090
Ew.

397
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,970
So this is where the smelly, rotten
bits of disgusting refuse are dumped.

398
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,680
And our sleeping quarters
would be where?

399
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,940
[Tailfeather] I'll never sleep in here.

400
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,230
[Whistling]

401
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,520
Oh, ho.

402
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,150
Well, this isn't so bad. Oh!

403
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,200
Oh, just like home.

404
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,830
[Shouting]

405
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,710
[Groaning]

406
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,540
I've had enough.
[Gasping]

407
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,800
Speak!

408
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,470
Lieutenant Mercury,
Royal Homing Pigeon Service,

409
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,140
4-1-2-1-4-4-4-4-4-4-6-9-7.

410
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,730
Oh. Bring me the truth serum.

411
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,100
Coming up. Right away.

412
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,270
[Laughing]
Come on, come on, come on.

413
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,150
One shot of this,
and we will know everything.

414
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,570
I'll never talk.

415
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,990
Never! Never!

416
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,700
[Snoring]

417
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,250
[Bugsy snores]
[Flies wheeze]

418
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,420
Wakey, wakey!

419
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,390
You birdbrains are Squad F.

420
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,560
You know what that means?

421
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,810
Squad fantastic?

422
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,100
Squad formidable?
No.

423
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,730
Philosophical?
No!

424
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,190
It means you are the flyers...
[whooping]

425
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,360
...of the future.

426
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,860
[Whooping, grunting]

427
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,410
The far future.

428
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,750
But my job, somehow, is to make you
the carrier pigeons of today.

429
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,330
Ooh. Ha, ha, ha.

430
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,380
[Groans]

431
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,630
Good maneuver.

432
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,550
It might help if you kept
your eyes open.

433
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,220
Better get you back to your nursing dove.

434
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,760
Thanks, Bugsy.

435
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,050
You must really like it here,

436
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,850
because this is the third time
this week you've been to see me.

437
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,190
I wish you'd be more careful.
Don't you worry.

438
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,850
Where I come from, danger
is our business. Oh, yeah.

439
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,730
We spit danger in the eye.

440
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,070
If they can dish it out,
well, I can take it.

441
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,070
And where do you come from?
West Nestington.

442
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,950
That's near Nestington.
It's, um...

443
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,160
It's to the west of it, actually.
[Giggling]

444
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,750
Oh, Valiant.

445
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,870
Well, I have to...

446
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,830
...return to my duties, so...

447
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,170
Goodbye.

448
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,300
Valiant, wait.
[Screaming]

449
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,140
[Groans]

450
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,140
As homing pigeons, it's our duty
to transport messages...

451
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,480
...in the worst of conditions:
Wind, rain, sleet, snow.

452
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,070
Bombs exploding, bullets flying.

453
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,490
As if that weren't enough,
Mother Nature has the audacity

454
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,700
to create a little something called...

455
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,240
...the falcon.
[Gasping]

456
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,580
Twenty pounds of pigeon-eating muscle,
measuring five of your wingspans.

457
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,870
They like to blindside their prey

458
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,420
at speeds in excess
of 200 miles per hour.

459
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,880
But not to bite, not yet.

460
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,510
The first strike is merely for impact.

461
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,970
They'll let you drop a bit,
making sure you're defenseless,

462
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,390
then scoop you up
in their razor-sharp talons.

463
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,770
[Grunts]

464
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,690
And in the dark of the night,
you'll have but a split second

465
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,020
to recognize friend from foe.

466
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
Friend or foe?
Foe!

467
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,820
No, you idiots. It's a pigeon.

468
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,030
Friend or foe?
Foe. No, friend.

469
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,870
Friend, or maybe...
No! It's a foe.

470
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,290
[Bugsy] Ah, yes, yes.
Friend or foe?

471
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,170
Friend, friend.
Oh, yes, my friend.

472
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,300
[Laughter]

473
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,390
Ninety-nine, one hundred.

474
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,970
[Groaning]
One hundred and one.

475
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,060
[Grunting]
One hundred and two.

476
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
[Grunting]

477
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,310
To survive his mission,
a pigeon must have the strength

478
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
to carry his message capsule.

479
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,460
He must have the speed
to fly like the wind.

480
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,670
[Screaming]

481
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,170
[Whooping]

482
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,470
Evasive action.
He must have the agility...

483
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,060
Circle.
...to outmaneuver the enemy.

484
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,720
Figure eight.

485
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,810
[Sighing]

486
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,480
And he must have
the endurance to battle the elements,

487
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,190
flying long distances
over raging seas.

488
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,160
Whoa!

489
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,040
[Humming]
[Clearing throat] Me again.

490
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
Valiant.

491
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,330
Oh! Oh, my favorite.

492
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,880
How did you know?

493
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,220
Mmm.

494
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,810
The parrot says,
"How about we do a loop the loop?"

495
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,520
I said, "I can't do a loop the loop."

496
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,650
[Laughing]

497
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,780
He says, "Why ever not?
I say, "Why, I'm afraid of heights."

498
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,200
He says, "You?

499
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,990
Afraid of heights? That's ridiculous."
[Growling]

500
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,660
"Maybe to you, mate, but not to me."
[Snoring]

501
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,450
[Mercury laughing]

502
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,500
That's it, that's it.
Come on. Go on.

503
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,170
Afternoon, Monty.

504
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,840
Hello, Guts. What news?
Not good, I'm afraid.

505
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,140
We just lost Squadron E over Belgium.
[Sighs]

506
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,260
That means these new recruits
are our only chance.

507
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,060
Whoa!

508
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,560
They'll have to leave tomorrow.
You can't be serious.

509
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,230
They haven't even finished
their training.

510
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,560
Attack formation accomplished, sir.
[Cheering]

511
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,230
Yes! Whoa...

512
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,440
[screaming]
[Thud]

513
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,450
Ooh.
[Groaning]

514
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,780
Sorry, but those are the orders.

515
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,370
Have them ready at 1800 tomorrow,
Monty, old boy.

516
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,080
Cheers.

517
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,500
Commander Gutsy's here, so...

518
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,000
So... I suppose
you'll be shipping out soon.

519
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,300
I know, I know.I can't wait.

520
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,590
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

521
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,840
Well...

522
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,050
I'd like to be part
of what you come home to.

523
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,060
I don't care if you're a hero.
Just concentrate on the getting back.

524
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,650
[Sighing]

525
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,400
Ow!

526
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,360
You need to understand
something, lads.

527
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,200
Our losses have been heavy.
Catastrophic.

528
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,580
You're all we've got.

529
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,460
And so, today,we fight for our country.

530
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,090
Tomorrow our feathers may be plucked
from our lifeless bodies,

531
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,590
our innards spread like jam on toast

532
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,260
and our bones fed to rabid weasels.

533
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,970
But never mind that.

534
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,270
On this day, in this place,

535
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,530
let it forever be known
that you pigeons did your part

536
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,820
in the heroic battle for...

537
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,700
S... Seeds!

538
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,490
Freedom! Right.

539
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,200
You will be Commander Gutsy's
support wing.

540
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,330
[Gasping]
I expect you to do whatever it takes

541
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,540
to ensure the success
of his mission.

542
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,300
Chaps, the message
we have been sent to carry

543
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,300
is of the almost importance.

544
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,800
The outcome of the war
could well depend on it.

545
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,600
We pigeons have never been entrusted

546
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,680
with a more critical
or dangerous mission.

547
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,230
May you fly straight,
and may your instinct guide you home.

548
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,030
What did Gutsy mean
by "highly dangerous"?

549
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,320
I don't know, but I can tell you this.

550
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,870
I am a bird of principle.

551
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,290
[Slurping]

552
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,710
And my number one principle is,

553
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,420
don't get involved with anything
called "highly dangerous."

554
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,500
[Slurping]

555
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,050
And I will never violate
my core beliefs.

556
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,590
Do not ask me to violate
my core beliefs.

557
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,930
You're talking to the wrong pigeon.
[Belches]

558
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,260
Sir, point of clarification, please.

559
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,600
Regarding the dangerous mission.

560
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,100
I've got a doctor's note.
Zip it, stinky.

561
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,390
Yeah, sure, I understand.

562
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,270
And I truly regret that I have
but one life to give for my country.

563
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,900
I'd love to die. Love to die.

564
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,110
Can't. Not Sunday. Bad for me.
Are you finished?

565
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,530
Not quite. Listen, maybe I'm not
that conscientious, but I do object.

566
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,580
Get back to the barracks!

567
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,250
Now!

568
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,960
Do I still have to go
on the dangerous mission?

569
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,210
Now!Yep.

570
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,880
take that as a, "Yes, I do."
Now!

571
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,890
Hey? Hey!

572
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,560
Where are you going?
Shh. Keep it down, mate.

573
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,480
I got some serious flying ahead.
Flying?

574
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,730
What do you mean?
Flying to where?

575
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,650
Back to old Trafalgar Square.

576
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,110
You're not leaving.
You'll break up the team.

577
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,280
Team? I'm not a team player.

578
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,660
Old Bug Buster plays solo.

579
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,370
Bigger question is why are you staying?

580
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,870
Why am I stay...
Because it's my duty. It's our duty.

581
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,290
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Sorry.

582
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,750
Have I missed something?
Did we start this? No.

583
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,590
Did we make those?

584
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,300
Or those?

585
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,090
I've seen them fall, mate,
and it's not a pretty sight.

586
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,720
The truth is...

587
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,430
...I'm scared, all right?

588
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,190
Don't tell them that,
cause I'll deny it.

589
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,900
Well, I'm scared too.

590
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,820
What in come with me, yeah?

591
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,990
Trafalgar Square'll be ours.
Come on.

592
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,280
We didn't make
Trafalgar Square either.

593
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,530
Where do we go when
they start dropping bombs there?

594
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,740
No, no, I'm staying.
I'm doing my bit.

595
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,870
Yeah. They're lucky to have you, mate.

596
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,880
Anyway, keep your wings dry, yeah?

597
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,300
[Banging]Ow! Ow!

598
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,260
Ow! Ow!
What's happening?

599
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
Shh.What's going on?

600
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,720
It's time for me to fly the coop,
all right?

601
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,390
So... I guess this is... farewell.

602
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,480
All right?
Where are you going?

603
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,440
You can't just leave, Bugsy.

604
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,770
[Sighing] Look...

605
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,570
I've got urgent business
to take care of, and...

606
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,610
Look, I'd better catch the wind
while it's blowing. All right?

607
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,330
Look me up
when you get back, yeah?

608
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,330
You know where I'll be.

609
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,430
Gentlemen, take your places.

610
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,100
Our mission is to be dropped
behind enemy lines

611
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,600
in occupied France,

612
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,190
to make contact
with the French Resistance

613
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,440
to get a vital
top-secret message

614
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,990
and bring it back here
by sundown tomorrow. Good luck.

615
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,030
The fate of the freedom-loving world
depends on us.

616
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,080
[Whistling]

617
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,250
Oi!

618
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,250
Hey, hey, hey, Bugsy!

619
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,500
You can't go without me.

620
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,590
I couldn't let you get all the glory.

621
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,030
Good luck, lads.

622
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,460
Hey, Bugsy.

623
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,130
Thanks for coming back.
Ah. I'll tell you the truth.

624
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,710
It's the first worth while thing
I've ever done.

625
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,840
We're gonna be fine.
Right, Lofty?

626
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,510
Ah, yes, I...
[groaning]

627
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,680
Indubitably. Birds of a feather
and all that. What?

628
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,760
Ha-ha.

629
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,770
Right, Lofty, old mate.
We stick together.

630
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,440
Hey, Tailfeather, can you believe
we're the ones they picked

631
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,610
to send on the most important
mission in World War II?

632
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,770
Yeah!

633
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,150
Me too!

634
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,530
[Laughing]

635
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,030
Truthfully,
I'm not a good singer anyway.

636
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,620
Always off-key. [laughing]

637
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,250
Enough already!

638
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,210
You've been jabbering for days.

639
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,210
Who gave me the serum?

640
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,250
You want me to talk?
OK, I'm talking.

641
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,090
I'm glad you did this.

642
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,920
Homing pigeon racket
is all well and good,

643
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,260
but it's a stiff upper beak
rubbish all the time.

644
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,510
I've got feelings.
I want to express them.

645
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,600
Like, I always used to think
my favorite color was blue,

646
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,270
cause it's for boys...
[growling]

647
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,770
Shut up!Shut up!

648
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,520
[Groaning]

649
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,610
I demand better treatment.
The mice don't treat me like this.

650
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,780
Those Resistance chappies,

651
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,690
with their fabulous view
over the harbor.

652
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,240
The last time I was in the attic
in St. Pierre...

653
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,780
St. Pierre?

654
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,670
All the truth serum is genius.

655
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,630
Cover his cage.

656
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,750
I'm curious.
What is your favorite color?

657
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,510
Pink!

658
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,220
Not like a hot pink or a pastely pink.

659
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,310
Just a kind of... pink pink.
You know what I mean.

660
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,060
None of the rinky-dink pinks.

661
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,980
[Squealing]
Uh, excuse me?

662
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,860
[Embarrassed chuckle]
I like pink too.

663
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,990
[Flak exploding]

664
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,200
Come on. Chin up, Valiant.

665
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,370
Stiff upper beak.

666
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,040
Gentlemen, get ready to drop.

667
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,330
Are you ready to drop?
Oh...

668
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,710
I think I've dropped already.

669
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:42,050
It's OK to be scared, fellows.
I'd be worried if you weren't.

670
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,060
It won't get better,
but you'll get used to it.

671
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,980
[Whimpering]

672
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,440
Go, go, go!

673
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,730
[Screaming]

674
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Oh, my!

675
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,820
It's jammed!
Oh...

676
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,830
Sir, let me help you.

677
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,620
No. Go now!
That's an order!

678
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,370
Yes, sir.

679
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,840
[Explosion]

680
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,260
Come on, Gutsy.Get out of there.

681
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,600
Oh, come on.

682
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,270
[Explosion]

683
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,500
Hello? Hello?

684
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,410
A little help, chaps?
Hold on.

685
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,670
We'll get you out now.
Cheers.

686
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,210
A bit of a tenuous landing, that,
but I daresay it could've been worse.

687
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,250
Look out.
Oh, my.

688
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,380
Sorry, Lofty.

689
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,010
Not to worry, old chap.

690
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,260
Hmpf. I say.
Bit of a muddle, this.

691
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,640
[Chuckling] But at least
we're all in one piece.

692
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,890
Not quite all.
Where's Gutsy?

693
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,400
He was still in the plane.
What do you mean he was still in the plane?

694
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,320
His cage got stuck.
I... I don't think he got out.

695
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,950
Ah.that's it.
We're dead. We're finished.

696
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,780
It's been a good run.
Nice knowing you.

697
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,410
You're quite mistaken.
I'm sure he made it out.

698
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,700
Gutsy always makes it out.
He's going to come and find us

699
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,660
and give us the plans
for the mission.

700
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,790
[Explosions]

701
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,550
Then, who has the back up plan?

702
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,130
You want the backup plan?
Um, we die.

703
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,760
That's the backup plan.
But I'm not ready to die.

704
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,680
Am I? No one's asked me.

705
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,890
So many books to read.

706
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,350
Regrets. Why? Why?
That's it. We're all dead.

707
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,110
Everyone, be quiet. Quiet!

708
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,110
We need a plan.

709
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,990
The plan is...

710
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,870
...is to find a safe location
to plan the next move.

711
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,990
You heard the bird.

712
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,750
So, our plan is to, uh...

713
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,420
...make a plan.

714
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,460
[Sighing] Come on.

715
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,680
France is spooky.

716
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,930
Vive la France!
Shh. Quiet.

717
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,060
Did you hear that?
There's someone in there.

718
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,940
Somebody better go
and have a look.

719
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,990
All right. I'll go.

720
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,460
[Screaming]

721
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,050
All right, you turkeys, let's go.

722
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,390
Valiant, just pull yourself together.

723
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,060
There's nothing in here.
Unless you're counting guns, bombs,

724
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,730
All the falcon. Pigeon-eating falcons.
Pigeon-eating falcons?

725
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,690
Oh.
[Screaming]

726
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,940
Oh! Ooof.

727
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,860
Let's get you out of the grail.

728
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,360
Thattaboy.
Come on. Here we go.

729
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,530
Thanks, guys.
Vive la France!

730
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,330
[Pigeons whimpering]

731
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,250
Pardonez-moi,
my pigeon friends.

732
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,460
You are the RHPS, no?

733
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,670
Um, yes, sir.

734
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,670
French Resistance,
Mouse Division.

735
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,590
Oh. Well, am I glad to see you,
I'll tell you.

736
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,050
How did you find us?

737
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,300
Well, there was the plane
and the explosion.

738
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,390
And the screaming and the pleading.
Um...

739
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,060
More screaming,
the begging, the crying,

740
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,230
the whining, whinging,
yelling, boohooing.

741
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,860
[Clearing throat]
Enough about that.

742
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,570
Definitely. Yep.

743
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,400
Uh, allow me to introduce myself.

744
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,030
I am Charles De Girl.

745
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,820
[Laughing] De Girl?

746
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,620
Why do they call you De Girl?

747
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,490
Because I am a girl.

748
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,710
The one and only girl.
[Whistling]

749
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,830
Oh, oh, oh,
I like France.

750
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,290
Do you speak French?
Well, um, mais oui.

751
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,340
Does ooh, la, la
mean anything to you?

752
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,220
Or va-va-voom?
Oh, yeah.

753

Does bonjour...
All right.

754
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,010
Look, we don't have time for this.

755
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,520
You have a message, we have a mission.
Let's get on with it.

756
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,100
Not so fast, monsieur.

757
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,480
This is Rollo.

758
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,900
He is an expert in sab...

759
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,780
[whispering] Sabotage.

760
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,990
Sabotage!

761
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,360
[All shouting]

762
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,030
[Laughing]

763
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,580
Rollo, not now!

764
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,950
No! Down! Rollo, stop!

765
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,910
[Breathing heavily]

766
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,750
Pardon.

767
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,380
Now, monsieur, before you
continue on your mission,

768
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,840
it is our national custom to...
Break the bread?

769
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,470
And cut the cheese.

770
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,680
Thank you, but we just
don't have time to eat.

771
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,350
And anyway, we're birds.
We don't eat cheese.

772
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,190
[Coughing] We don't?

773
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,850
About that message?
We will take you to it.

774
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,480
But the road is dangerous
and guarded by the enemy falcon.

775
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,820
[Coughing and gasping]

776
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,160
But this cannot be a problem
for highly-trained pigeons.

777
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,530
That is why you are Squad A, oui?

778
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,990
[Coughing]
The thing is, you see...

779
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,290
Squad B?
Not Squad B.

780
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,080
Squad C?
[Pigeons chuckling]

781
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,750
So then you are Squad D.

782
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,800
[Laughing] Just between us,

783
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,010
Squad D was never really
all it was cracked up to be.

784
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,680
I will not lie to you.

785
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,140
You will definitely be eaten
by the falcons.

786
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,810
[Bugsy belches] Wow.

787
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,560
That was some fine fromage.

788
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,560
Can you burp on cue?
Yeah.

789
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,270
I can burp on all the letters,
not just Q.

790
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,730
Watch this. [burps] A.

791
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,530
[Burps] B. [burps] C.

792
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,820
Shh. Be silent.

793
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,820
The falcons.

794
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,700
[Loud belch]
Oh.

795
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,200
Oh! I say.

796
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,080
[Clearing throat] Excuse me.

797
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,710

[Sniffing] Mmm.

800
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,720
Come on.

801
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,940
[Gasping] Falcons.

802
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,570
All clear.

803
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,420
Wow.

804
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,850
[Gasping] Stop that!

805
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,850
Oh, Squad F!

806
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,480
We are here. This is invigorating.

807
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,740
The attic. There it is.
Fly, English pigeons, fly.

808
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,280
[Passes gas]
Oh! Oh, dear.

809
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,410
Sorry, love.
Dirty bird.

810
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,950
Lofty Pigeon, at your service.

811
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,700
Hold on, mademoiselle.

812
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,210
Oi,he's heavy, this one.

813
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,580
There they are.

814
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,630
[Screaming]
Faster!

815
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,960
Yes! Sabotage!

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,970
To the right!

819
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,810
Over there.
I am going to get you!

820
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,560
[Growling]

821
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,400
Aha!
Whoo!

822
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,440
[Screaming]

823
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,450
Hold on, my dear.

824
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,450
[Moaning]

825
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,660
This is it.

826
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,840
I must do the secret knock.

827
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,050
Who is it?
De Girl.

828
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,010
We must do the secret password.

829
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,720
Jacques, there is no time!

830
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,550
Baa, baa, black sheep,
have you any?

831
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,310
Oh... Wine?

832
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,180
No, no, no.
That is yesterday's password.

833
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,270
Cheese?
No!

834
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:52,190
Seeds? Petunias?

835
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,980
Falcons! Jacques, just let us in.

836

Let me give you le message.

839
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,620
You can give me le massage.

840
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,870
Can we make sure it's
a full-body massage?

841
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,210
Message.

842
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,540
The message that is to go to London.

843
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,420
Our freedom depends on it.
[Banging]

[Banging]
[Falcons shouting]

845
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,800
And, uh, who will carry it, then?

846
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,430
You.

847
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,770
Wait. I'll take it.

848
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,600
Bugsy?
Extraordinary.

849
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,860
You said you weren't a team player?
We'll see, won't we?

850
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,070
Good luck, Bugsy.
May you fly straight.

851
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,360
And let our instincts guide us home.

852
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,820
[Fingers snap]

853
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,700
Pardon.

854
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,330
Goodbye and good luck, pigeons.

855
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,300
OK. Oh, farewell.

856
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,430
Mmmm...

857
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,930
Absolutely charmed.

858
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,140
[Shouting]

859
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,850
Just, uh, one tiny thing.

860
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,810
How are we gonna get out of here?

861
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,690
We're trapped!
Oh, oh.

862
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,780
Oh, I've had an idea.
I've had an idea!

863
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,240
[Growling] Where are they?

864
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,820
Whoa!

865
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:39,880
[Cackling]

866
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,220
Let's go.

867
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,850
Hey, it worked like a charm.

868
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,900
They'll be teaching that one
at the academy.

869
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,730
I hope the others are OK.
Don't count on it.

870
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,070
[Screaming]
Shh.

871
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,610
Evasive action.

872
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,540
Let's go.

873
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,010
[Screaming]
Get your claws off of him.

874
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:33,350
Ow!
I said let go!

875
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,930
I'm the one you want.

876
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,770
Oh, oh... Yee-ha!

877
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,570
You can do better than that,
you English pigeon.

878
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,780
[Screaming]
Bugsy!

879
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,340
Bugsy!

880
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,180
Dinnertime. [laughing]

881
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,860
Bugsy!

882
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,700
It was not easy, Herr General.

883
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,870
But I have...
[sputtering and spitting]

884
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,870
...captured their leader.

885
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,500
Leader?

886
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,170
Well, perhaps assistant leader?

887
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,840
[Groaning]
[Indistinct English]... Herr General.

888
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Get on with it!

889
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:53,840
Oh, oh. May I present you with...

890
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,430
...the message, Papa?

891
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,890
Oh, oh.

892
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,480
The high commander will be pleased.

893
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,780
[Laughing]

894
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,490
There will be medals.

895
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:16,200
Und photographs.
Commemorative stamps.

896
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,120
[Laughing]

897
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,620
I will personally
deliver it to him.

898
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,130
They must be desperate, indeed,

899
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,970
to give the message to this
putrid-smelling reject.

900
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,340
[Fly whimpering]

Oh, Oh, no.

Dennis... You've squished...
It was my favorite.

903

[Sobs]

904
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,100
I am. That's exactly...

905
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,230
I'm putrefied, stinky, rotten.

906
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,650
Eat me, you'll be sick for a week.

907
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,690
Hmm. Take him away.

908
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,820
No, no. Listen, you can't.

909
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,780
I,I've got a doctor's note.
I've got a feather condition

910
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,200
Wait.

911
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,660
On second thought,
he may prove useful.

912
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,870
Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

913
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,880
[Kissing, spitting] Oh, thank you.

914
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,380
You're very wise.
What do you like?

915
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,670
Cards? We can play cards.

916
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,050
Find the pebble.
I've got a lovely voice.

917
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,060
(There'll be bluebirds over

The white cliffs of Dover )

919
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,770
That probably annoys you.
You don't want that one.

920
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,730
I was thinking more along the lines
of a celebration dinner.

921
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,990
Celebration dinner.
Brilliant idea. I cook well.

922
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,860
Not I cook well.
I won't be in it.

923
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,490
I can make dinner.
Bread crumbs. You'll love...

924
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,490
Oh! You haven't tried my
bread crumb birdseedy thing.

925
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,500
[Chuckles] No.

926

Pigeon under glass, with a lovely
Liebfraumilch reduction.

What did you do to him?

931
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,480
[Laughing]

00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,690
[Mutters] Pink...
You all right, mate?

933
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,030
Huh? Wait a minute there!

934
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,120
It's the feng shui.
That little bell should be over there.

935
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,490
Um, OK. Yeah.
[Giggling]

936
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,040
[Sighing] Who was I kidding?
I don't belong here.

937
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,170
[Exhaling] I've let everyone down.

938
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,460
Bugsy wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for me.

939
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,350

You made it.

Chaps.
It's Gutsy.

00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,780
You're alive!
What happened? Tell us what happened.

944
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,070
Plane exploded. Chute gave out.

945
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,700
Free-fall 3,000 feet.
Set upon by a pack of wolves.

946
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,040
Flew through barbed wire.

947
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,710
Picked up some shrapnel
from a stray grenade.

948
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,460
Fought my way to the rendezvous,
and here we are.

949
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,380
Right. We can dispense
with the chitchat.

950
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,880
I'm guessing the falcons
have acquired the message.

951
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,220
Yes, sir.
Where's Bugsy?

952
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:23,260
He sacrificed himself to save me.
The falcons got Bugsy and the message.

953
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,220
Which way did they go?
That way.

954
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,310
Oh, no.

00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,080
Let's find a way out of here.

963
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,170
Where there's a will, there's a way.

964
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,340
Right. You chaps sit tight.

965
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,260
I'll fly in, avoiding the various clever
booby traps, and deadly ambushes,

966
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,300
then subdue any resistance
and secure the message.

967
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,140
Absolutely.
Gutsy by name, gutsy by nature.

968
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,740
I will bathe.

969
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,160
Bring me my best cape.
Yes, Herr General.

970
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,130
Da, da, da, duh

971
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,590
[shouting] Ow.

972
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,970
Join the army, you said.
I didn't.

973
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,100
You did.
It was your idea.

974
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,390
I've had enough of this.
Not listening.

975
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,940
Quiet. Shh.

976
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,310
I'm afraid it's not as simple
as I thought.

977
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,990
This is a highly-fortified bunker,
stuffed to the gills with enemy falcons.

978
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:05,610
There's only one opening,
scarcely big enough for a hummingbird.

979
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,450
It's down the barrel of that gun.

980
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,790
No, gentlemen,
I'm afraid it's hopeless.

981
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,380
I'll do it.

982
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,760
Valiant!
No!

983
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:55,790
Nein, nein, nein. Dummkopf!

984
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,750
[Grunting]

985
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,730
[Humming]

[Gasping]

987
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,400
Bugsy. [gasping]

988
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,490
Oh!

989
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:27,360
[Sighing]

990
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,910
[Distant voices]

991
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,670
Oh, oh, oh.
I'm too young to die.

992
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,430
I can't believe...
Hey!

993
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,800
Eh? Valiant.

994
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,850
Bugsy.
Shh.

995
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,020
[Von Talon humming]
Hey. The message.

996
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,690
It's in there.

997
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,190
[Gasping]

998
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,490
Herr General, a cape for you.

999
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,620
No, no, red.

1000
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,620
Red says "strong and decisive."

1001
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,710
Red it is.
Yes, Herr General.

1002
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,790
Yes, that's what I'm here for.

1003
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,540
No, no, wait.

1004
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,550
The blue with the eggshell trim.

1005
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,970
As many capes as you like, General.

1006
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,430
They're coming.
Gotta have this. Gotta have that.

1007
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:34,140
Valiant, get down.
[Banging]

1008
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,230
How many capes does someone need?
I'm sick of capes.

1009
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,740
I hate capes.
I hate capes!

1010
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,710
Ah. Um...

1011
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,830
Here goes. [gagging]

1012
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,380
Oh. Ugh.

1013
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:12,130
[Gulping, coughing, hiccupping]

1014
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,100
I'll get you out of here, Bugs.

1015
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,310
It's no use.
He took the key with him.

1016
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,140
Complete the mission.
But, Bugsy.

1017
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,560
I,I can't.
Forget about me.

1018
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,810
You've got the message.
Now get out of here.

1019
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:27,150
No. Bugsy.
Go.

1020
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,570
Don't do it.

1021
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,250
[Von Talon humming]

1023
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,880
[Gasping] Uh...
Underlingk?

1024
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,890
Ja, Herr General?

1025
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,010
My beak wash.

1026
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,890
Ja, Herr General.

Ja, Herr General?

1030
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,370

01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,780
Ja, Herr General.

[Continues humming

1033

[Von Talon laughs]
Oh, I am magnificent.

1034
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:30,710
Of course, you can have as many
capes as you like, General.

1035
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,130
They're coming.
Huh?

1036
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:33,970
Oh!

1037
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,180
Get him! Stop him!

1038
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,520
What's going on?
Bugsy!

1039
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,060
Oh, yes! Brilliant!

1040
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,980
Come on. Last chance.
Get up. Get up!

Oh.

1042
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,490
What is that repulsive odor?

1043
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:00,950
Ahem! Not to rush you or anything.
We gotta go. Come on!

1044
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,750
Well done, my lad.

1045

You're from Squad A, right?
It's a long story.

1046
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:11,380
I'll tell you later.

Valiant, you made it.
Well done.

1054

My dear chap.
And the message?

1055
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,030
Oh, yes, sir.
Safe and sound. [hiccups]

Good man.
Thank you, sir.

Right, lads.
We have a message to deliver.

This is where it ends.

1105

You are nothing
but a lowly wood pigeon.

You are no match
for a falcon ruler.

Valiant? You've made it?

Valiant Pigeon. [panting]

1125
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,930
Sir, I have a message to deliver.

[Gagging]

1127
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,340
Certainly, yes.
Just one moment.

1128
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:56,300
Gentlemen, a change of plan.
We now land in Normandy.

1129
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:59,890
A change of plan
Normandy. Repeat: Normandy.

[Sarge] Well done, son.

1132
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:09,270
This could mean promotion.
I'm proud of you.

1133
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,690
You're a credit to the service.
Thank you, sir.

1134
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,440
Ow!
It's been a... I'm sorry!

1135
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,820
Sorry, sorry.

1136
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,490
Valiant.
Well done, old boy.

1137
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,740
I knew you'd do it.

1138
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,030
Well done, mate.

1139

(Bye, bye, bye, baby)
Ahoy there, Valiant.

1142

Bug juice, on the house, of course.

1143
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,590
(Don't cry, baby)

1144
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,350
I'm the hero around here.

1145
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:45,270
I'm the hero. Do you want to see...
Will you shut up?

1146
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,350
I was doing all right
till you came over.

1147
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,390
[Both grunting]

1148
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:53,690
Hello, handsome.

[Singing continues]

1150
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,790
Whoa!

1151
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,410
Shall we shake a tail feather?
Certainly.

1152
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,670
Oh, Sergeant.

1153
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,040
Valiant, maybe you and I could, uh...

1154
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,840
Sorry, but I'm not available.

1155
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:20,970
[Clearing throat]
I can't stress enough how available I am.
