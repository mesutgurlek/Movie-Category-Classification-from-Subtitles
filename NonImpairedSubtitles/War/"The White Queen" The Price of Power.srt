1
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:02,589
You are a girl
from the House of Lancaster,

2
00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:05,410
and you live in a country
that is divided.

3
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:07,699
You may not fall in love
with a York king

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,061
unless there is some profit in it
for you.

5
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:15,899
Will you marry me?

6
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:17,059
Yes.

7
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,159
Warwick is the Kingmaker,

8
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:21,639
you can be very sure
he will make the queen as well.

9
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:26,039
She's my queen of choice and I...
Of choice?! Have you gone mad?

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,999
He is a pretender.
He has taken the throne by force.

11
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:32,559
He is the king and those who speak
against him are guilty of treason.

12
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,159
Now, let us make a son,
to scotch the Lancastrian threat.

13
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,679
It is an honour to meet you,
Duchess Cecily.

14
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:41,039
I am not happy about this marriage.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,159
I could put his brother, George,
upon the throne in his place.

16
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:47,119
The King has done
what he should not.

17
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:48,319
Elizabeth.

18
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:51,121
There are many who will be cursing
our luck and wishing us to fall.

19
00:00:51,548 --> 00:01:21,510

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

20
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:50,679
So, our new queen
is not only Lancastrian

21
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:53,839
but now we have
half of Burgundy out in force.

22
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:54,999
Why?

23
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,961
Because she is related to them!

24
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:02,199
But, Issy, we like her better
than the old bad queen, don't we?

25
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:05,801
And now we must crown her
before her belly grows too fat.

26
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,321
Elizabeth.

27
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,361
Are you afraid?

28
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,041
Edward will help me know what to do.

29
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:39,759
They say the whole of London
will be out.

30
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:41,041
Except one.

31
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,599
Edward's mother has refused to come.

32
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,719
I don't think you'll miss her.

33
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,561
It's one less foot to trip me up!

34
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,519
Lord Warwick.

35
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,321
Is the woman dressed and ready?

36
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:58,121
She's not made queen yet.

37
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,719
My new sister.

38
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,041
You're as beautiful
as a queen should be.

39
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:20,481
I pray your child is a son, so he
may follow my brother on his throne.

40
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,159
Thank you, Richard. George.

41
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,241
I am very grateful for your kinship.

42
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,241
Where... Where's Edward?

43
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,721
At the Abbey.

44
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:36,481
He is to watch the coronation from
behind a screen, as is the custom.

45
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,319
My daughters will escort you.

46
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:41,479
They have been trained
for such occasions.

47
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:44,759
The Queen has her own sisters
to attend her.

48
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:47,921
Your daughters may join
in the procession behind us.

49
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:54,759
Hold your head high, Elizabeth.

50
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,879
God has chosen you in this

51
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,999
and your brothers and I will be
with you every step of the way.

52
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,281
But now, you are holding my arm
too tightly and I may faint.

53
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,599
You may not faint
because I need you.

54
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,481
You will always be my Elizabeth.

55
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:12,281
I am so very proud of you.

56
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:19,959
Anne, you goose!
Stop staring like an idiot!

57
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,999
She is so beautiful.

58
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,799
Yes, but the King should have
married the French princess

59
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,079
as Father had arranged.

60
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,401
Just play your part.

61
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,201
It will not be for very long.

62
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:13,721
God save the Queen!

63
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,921
Elizabeth!

64
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,601
Elizabeth!

65
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,679
That isn't mother.

66
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:51,919
It's her, Richard.

67
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:55,201
She's just in her coronation robes,
that's all. Oh.

68
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:28,441
I here present unto you, Queen
Elizabeth, your undoubted queen.

69
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:32,799
Wherefore, all you
who are come this day

70
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,959
to do your homage and service,

71
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:37,919
are you willing to do the same?

72
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,561
God save the Queen!

73
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,959
Let the anointing of this oil

74
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:46,879
increase your honour

75
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,681
and establish you for ever.

76
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,801
God save the Queen!

77
00:07:57,241 --> 00:08:00,359
We offer up the sceptres
and the ring,

78
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,759
to our one and mighty queen.

79
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:05,041
God save the Queen!

80
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,961
Mother! Mother!

81
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,401
Oh, my boys!

82
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,759
Are you Queen now, Mother?

83
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:16,399
Yes, Richard. But before that,
I shall always be your mother.

84
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,279
May we sit with you at dinner?

85
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,119
I'm sorry, not today.

86
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:23,441
But later, I shall come and
see you both to bed myself.

87
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,119
Queen Elizabeth?

88
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:28,601
Your court awaits.

89
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:44,521
You all look so very similar,
you Rivers girls.

90
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,279
You look like beautiful fish!

91
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:50,039
I'm not sure I should like to be
a fish! Hello.

92
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:54,281
George does try to be so charming
but he doesn't always get it right!

93
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,359
Last time we saw you, Richard,

94
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:02,759
you fell off your horse at our
father's castle, do you remember?

95
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:05,319
Our father taught King Edward
and put him on the throne

96
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,721
and so now, King Edward must...

97
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,239
What?

98
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:13,281
So he did,
and Edward loves him for it.

99
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:17,801
There's a seat here, Anne,
if you'd like it.

100
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:34,119
Lords and Ladies of the court,

101
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:37,001
Queen Elizabeth of England.

102
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:13,481
I did not think
it would be this grand, Edward.

103
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,759
It is to silence those who say
that our marriage is not valid.

104
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,921
Who?! Who says that it is not?

105
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,399
Ah!

106
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:23,519
Your mother?

107
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:26,121
The people were denied
a royal wedding.

108
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:29,399
And so we have given them

109
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:31,721
a coronation
worthy of the Lord himself.

110
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:36,359
She does not even know
how to behave!

111
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,839
How would you behave
if you were queen?

112
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:40,359
Not like that!

113
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:42,879
I would not whisper with the King!

114
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:44,759
I would be a queen of stone.

115
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:46,521
I would have dignity and no emotion.

116
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,481
She doesn't even seem ashamed!

117
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,161
Desperate for this banquet
to end...

118
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,199
Edward, you must attend
to the peace treaty with France.

119
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,959
I have kept it from your door
this week as much as I could but,

120
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,919
now that Charles of Burgundy
has been befriended

121
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:10,359
and France has been left out,

122
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,719
it cannot wait.

123
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:13,199
I will attend to it tomorrow.

124
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:16,079
But now, cousin, feast with us,

125
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:18,919
for we have won everything
that we set out to

126
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,441
and I wish to see you happy.

127
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,481
How is it that I've allowed you
to wear so many clothes?

128
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,039
I cannot think.

129
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,121
What's the point of being king if I
cannot keep you naked all day long?

130
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:43,359
We shall have to change
this room, Edward.

131
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:45,801
It's too odd to have
Margaret of Anjou's things about us.

132
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:48,161
Change it as you wish.

133
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:53,119
Shall we be safe, you and I,
upon our thrones?

134
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,879
While Henry is at large,
there's always a chance

135
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:58,479
of a Lancastrian uprising to put him
back on the throne.

136
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,361
Or his son, Edward.

137
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,679
But when we have our son, we will be
safe, for we will have an heir.

138
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,999
And your own men, do you trust them?

139
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:09,199
Lord Warwick?

140
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:10,241
Him of all.

141
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:16,719
I know he's brusque and has found it
hard to deal with our marriage

142
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:19,321
but he will learn
to love you as I do.

143
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:21,681
He already does.

144
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,641
You should ask his girls
to be your ladies!

145
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:30,841
Make them your favourites.
It will please him.

146
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:35,919
And his agreement with France?
Will you make that, too?

147
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,241
I'll decide tomorrow...

148
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:39,921
because now,

149
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,721
I cannot think at all.

150
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,799
Argh.
Now what am I to do with these?

151
00:13:56,801 --> 00:14:00,081
It's not as though Margaret of Anjou
will return for them.

152
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:04,281
Mother!?

153
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,161
I never thought it would be me
doing this.

154
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:13,521
I was her closest friend,
when I was her lady at court.

155
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,319
But these are different times.

156
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,079
You are Queen of England now

157
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,441
and you will never make
the same mistakes that she did.

158
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:26,121
I cannot burn it
or they'll strangle us for witches.

159
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,879
That is interesting, Baron Rivers.

160
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:32,879
Your advice may well be
worth thinking about.

161
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:35,319
We are here to serve you,
Your Grace.

162
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,361
Edward?

163
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:39,041
We'll meet soon.

164
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,439
My lord.

165
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:46,959
I've drafted out the terms

166
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,319
of England's peace treaty
with France as discussed

167
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,679
and the French Ambassador's
confirmed

168
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,919
he will be able to attend the autumn
hunt, where both parties can sign.

169
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,161
There's no hurry, Warwick.

170
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,961
There are some other players
in the game who I may speak to.

171
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,719
Other...?

172
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:05,001
I've invited Burgundy, as well.

173
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,839
You've invited the enemy of France?

174
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,119
I wish for them

175
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,919
to lift their restrictions
on the sale of English cloth,

176
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:16,039
and they are
my wife's own relatives,

177
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,761
so I can hardly leave them out.

178
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:20,721
Lord Warwick?

179
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:29,199
I know that I was not your choice
of wife and queen for Edward.

180
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:32,759
But I hope that we may join in
friendship as we share love for him.

181
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,079
You hope for that, Your Grace?

182
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:40,681
And also that your daughters will
join my household as my ladies?

183
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,081
Burn her.

184
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:49,479
We'll have no truck with a queen
who thought to rule her husband

185
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,281
and rule England through him.

186
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:55,681
We've no need for scheming women.

187
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,759
I know your loyalty to Warwick,

188
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,721
but surely, if he's gone
this far already, Edward...

189
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,121
Edward?

190
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,679
Your father and brothers
have just told me

191
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:18,721
that Warwick has a secret deal
with the King of France.

192
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,519
Louis has promised him a territory

193
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,841
in exchange
for my alliance with France.

194
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:29,439
Now, this was once dependent upon me
marrying the Princess Bona

195
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:33,639
but now rides upon this
so-called peace treaty.

196
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:35,881
So, Warwick is plotting against you.

197
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,961
Not so much against me
as... for himself.

198
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:44,239
But he should not have
kept it from me.

199
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:48,441
So I shall treaty with the side
I think is most useful.

200
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:03,559
He does not see Warwick's danger.
Even now.

201
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,999
He's clouded by how much
he loves him.

202
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,281
Then you must do the thinking
for him.

203
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,441
Warwick is against the King.

204
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:14,201
He wants power for himself.

205
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,919
Now, if Edward doesn't stop him,
then you must.

206
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:21,599
Because otherwise, Warwick
will be king-making again.

207
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:25,161
And this time it won't be
Edward's head that wears the crown.

208
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:30,081
And then we all will be in danger.

209
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,519
Come.

210
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:42,561
Come on.

211
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,479
Hup. Hup.

212
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,521
Hup.

213
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,161
Hup. Hup.

214
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:55,439
Well done, John!

215
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,001
Well done, John!

216
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:07,319
He'll have a fight on his hands
against my brother, George.

217
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:10,041
He has none of Richard's chivalry
and he doesn't like to lose.

218
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,319
Burgundy's here, then.

219
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:25,479
The Rivers run so deep,
any man could be drowned in them.

220
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,961
My own mother's been washed away.

221
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:31,241
You could do better?

222
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:46,959
Edward, the French Ambassador's
feeling slighted

223
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:49,279
in favour of Charles of Burgundy.

224
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:51,399
Oh, cheer up, Warwick.

225
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,479
The bigger threat
is still my cousin Henry.

226
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:56,239
Lancaster will not give up
their hopes for him.

227
00:18:56,241 --> 00:19:00,201
While Henry is at large, there will
always be some army to support him.

228
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:09,319
Charles has suggested
a marriage between himself

229
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:12,639
and Margaret of York. He seems very
keen. Mother! Shhh. Not now.

230
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,319
Your mother is right, Elizabeth.

231
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,079
We must build a powerful
royal family around you

232
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:20,639
to protect you,
and marriages are the way to...

233
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,401
Well done, George!

234
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:30,039
Good hunting, brother.

235
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:34,079
As your prize, I shall
confer on you the title...

236
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,281
Earl of Richmond!

237
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,121
And I was hoping for your crown.

238
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:43,839
Lady Margaret Beaufort
won't be happy.

239
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:45,359
Richmond is her son's title!

240
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,519
Yes. But he is nephew
to the old King Henry.

241
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,881
So, I must strip it from him.

242
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,199
They have stripped my son
of his title!

243
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,799
They have stripped him
of "The Earl of Richmond"

244
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,519
and given it to that second
York boy, George. I've been told.

245
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,319
You are my husband,
you must get it back for him!

246
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,839
It is his ancestral title
through his... Margaret.

247
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:25,399
Margaret,
the Yorks rule England now,

248
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:28,401
and Edward may give the peerages
to whoever he sees fit.

249
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,159
Is it not enough that I am not
allowed to raise my child myself?

250
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,879
That he must be raised
by his uncle Jasper?

251
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:41,479
He is nephew to King Henry,
in line as Lancastrian heir.

252
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,239
He should not be treated
as though...

253
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,639
Look, you must not boast of this
too loudly, it is the very...

254
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:49,721
It is the very reason
why the King must keep him down.

255
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,801
His uncle Jasper
would not let this happen!

256
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,759
He would write to Edward
and defend my poor boy!

257
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,921
He would feel his pain, as I do!

258
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,439
I shall go to little Henry myself
and explain to him about his title!

259
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:09,279
No, it'll mean nothing to him.
The boy is barely five-years-old.

260
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:12,199
It means something!
It means the world.

261
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,881
It is all he has!

262
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:22,639
Have you eaten anything today? No.

263
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:25,241
You are looking very thin again.
I'm fasting.

264
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,839
You cannot live on fresh air alone.
I live on prayer.

265
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:31,121
And God shall give me sustenance.

266
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:40,881
Lord Warwick?

267
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,999
Your daughters
have not been brought to me.

268
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,399
I requested them for my household.

269
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:51,881
My daughters are to wed, Your Grace,
and so sadly, must decline.

270
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,201
The King is aware.

271
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:06,719
Ah.

272
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:08,519
I was thinking,

273
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:10,039
our little Annie

274
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,041
should wed Viscount Bourchier.

275
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:18,319
And little Katherine could marry
the Duke of Buckingham?

276
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,839
Warwick has refused his daughters
to me mother.

277
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:24,159
It is a snub
and I do not know what I should do.

278
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:25,201
He hates me.

279
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:29,039
But Edward still thinks
we can be friends!

280
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,279
Then what should I do?

281
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:33,359
Accept his hate or battle through it?

282
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:35,119
You should do neither.

283
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,719
You should do as Edward says and
make your family strong by marriage,

284
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,039
so you can weather an attack
from anyone.

285
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,321
Now, your brother, John...

286
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:47,239
What spells are you two weaving?

287
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,559
Father!

288
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:51,879
Ah, the goddess of love
is busy with her work, I see!

289
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:55,279
There is no love in this, Richard.
Only business.

290
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:57,241
You see how Mother changed her tune?

291
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:02,479
When she set her heart on you,
the lowly squire,

292
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,599
she caused quite the scandal,
saying true love was enough.

293
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,399
It was worth it.

294
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:10,641
For I have the most beautiful
lady in the kingdom.

295
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,839
And I the handsomest, kindest,
most loving man.

296
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:18,641
Who has just been made Treasurer!

297
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:22,199
Richard! Then Warwick's uncle
has been set aside?

298
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,519
Edward is unhappy with him
over France.

299
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:27,079
And Anthony has
Admiralty of the Fleet

300
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:30,559
and Lionel will be
Bishop as he's always wanted.

301
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:31,959
Richard!

302
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:33,039
Yes, yes.

303
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,479
Go and fetch the midwife.

304
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:38,481
I think our first York prince
wishes to join the world.

305
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:41,839
That's it, come on, push.

306
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:43,881
Push-push-push.

307
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:47,481
That's it. That's it.

308
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:51,761
Good girl, shh.

309
00:23:57,961 --> 00:23:59,599
Give him to me, Mary?

310
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,641
Let me hold him.

311
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,841
It's a girl.

312
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,001
A little girl.

313
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,639
Where is he?
The Queen is not ready.

314
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:16,281
Let me see him! I am king.
You cannot keep me from my son.

315
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,839
It's a girl, Edward.

316
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:21,321
It's a girl.

317
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:31,841
Mind the head. Take the head.

318
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,479
She is a beautiful girl.

319
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:41,399
We will love her very well.

320
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:44,281
We shall have boys, Edward.

321
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,439
Sons and heirs.

322
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:48,881
They shall come. I know.

323
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:55,121
You are so very lovely, Elizabeth.
I could not do without you.

324
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:30,041
It's a girl!

325
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:37,881
The Queen has had
a little baby girl for Edward.

326
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:44,799
It makes little odds
that he has no heir

327
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:46,559
when she has taken all the nobles

328
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:48,719
and there's no-one left
for ours to wed.

329
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,719
Ah, but...

330
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:54,639
I have found
the biggest prize of all,

331
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:57,199
and the King

332
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,201
will give me anything I want for it.

333
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:24,599
My Lady.

334
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:25,879
Stafford.

335
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,079
Lord Tudor.

336
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:28,119
Are you well?

337
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:29,359
We are in fine health.

338
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:30,999
Shall we ride in?

339
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,721
Jasper, how is my Henry?

340
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:37,161
He's thriving.
You'll barely know him.

341
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,519
Henry?

342
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:44,119
Henry!

343
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:46,039
Come to your mother.

344
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,761
Come on, you must remember me?

345
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:51,081
Go on, Henry.

346
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,041
Lady Mother.

347
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:06,879
Henry, I miss you very much
and I would have come sooner,

348
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:10,081
but I have been made to live
very far away from you.

349
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:13,839
It is punishment for my loyalties.

350
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:17,359
Henry, the wicked York king,
has taken your title.

351
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:20,079
But we will get it back for you.
We will.

352
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:23,321
Do not fill his head with nonsense,
Margaret, he will not get it back!

353
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,199
He should be playing in the sun
with other children,

354
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:28,879
not cooped up here,
like some invalid!

355
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,279
There are no families
of breeding near enough

356
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:34,039
for a suitable companion.
Well, perhaps little Henry

357
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,759
could show me the stables
and the horses while we're here?

358
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:37,841
May I?

359
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,041
Go on.

360
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:46,319
Come now. Come and see our horses.
We have names for all of them.

361
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,521
I expect you're a very good rider.
Yes.

362
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:01,361
Tell me he is good to you?

363
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:06,081
Tell me that, at least. He, er...

364
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:10,801
I have an allowance.

365
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:13,681
I, er...

366
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:16,399
I buy books.

367
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:19,521
I read the Gospel.
He's teaching me to read in Latin.

368
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,561
I missed you, Margaret.

369
00:28:27,321 --> 00:28:29,039
More than I can tell. Don't.

370
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,801
You must not.

371
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,279
I've received a letter
from my brother.

372
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:45,279
My nephew is to be betrothed
to the Queen's sister, Katherine,

373
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:47,279
and we are called to London
for the wedding.

374
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:50,639
The Duke of Buckingham...
to a common country girl?!

375
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,801
I will not go.
You will, Margaret.

376
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,841
And you will be gracious.

377
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:03,719
Your mother will be there.
It will be a chance to see her, too.

378
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:06,041
You've not seen her
since we married.

379
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:11,161
Shall we?

380
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:23,639
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

381
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:24,801
Amen.

382
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:38,041
Look at my little sister, Katherine,
with her sulky new husband, the Duke.

383
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:50,159
Who would have thought
so happy an occasion

384
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:52,599
would have made so many
so miserable?!

385
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,399
Lord Warwick isn't even here.

386
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,881
So much the better.

387
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:02,799
Congratulations, Your Grace,
on your first York princess.

388
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,879
She is not a boy though,
so you have no heir.

389
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:09,119
I shall have many more,
Duchess Cecily,

390
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:10,721
and the next one shall be a boy.

391
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,161
Edward? What is that?

392
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:26,519
King Henry!

393
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:31,279
My Lords. Our one time king, Henry,
and now, our prisoner.

394
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:33,679
He was roaming
the fields of Northumberland

395
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:35,959
but I have ridden out
and captured him.

396
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,559
And you have brought him in!
No, Richard!

397
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:41,479
Then let us take vengeance for our
father he murdered! You will not!

398
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:44,039
He is an anointed king.

399
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:47,961
And how should we be any better
if we match him in his butchery?

400
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:56,921
He is a traitor
and an enemy to my rule.

401
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:03,521
But God has brought him to us to
show that my reign is just and true.

402
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:08,479
We shall keep cousin Henry
in the Tower apartments

403
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:12,201
and show him a mercy
that he denied our father.

404
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:16,001
Go in God, cousin.

405
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,599
I'm once again indebted to you,
Warwick.

406
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:32,641
I serve you, Edward, as ever.

407
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,879
Might I have a word with Your Grace?
Of course.

408
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:42,799
God bless him, poor Henry...

409
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,199
Warwick is up to something, Mother.

410
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:47,121
Can we ever trust him?

411
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:02,041
Girls, I have something to tell you.

412
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:09,201
You must keep it a secret for now.
Do you promise? Yes, Lady Mother.

413
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:13,039
Your father is asking
King Edward for the royal dukes,

414
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:16,121
his brothers, to be given
in marriage to the two of you.

415
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:21,121
You will marry George.
And I shall have Richard!

416
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:24,679
See how Anne is blushing!

417
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,919
You cannot think to like him?

418
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:30,119
He's got such funny eyes
and he's so serious.

419
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:33,919
Stop it, Issy! She, of course,
will try to stop it.

420
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:36,479
But the King will not refuse
your father,

421
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,439
not if he asks him to his face.

422
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,601
Not now, after bringing Henry in.

423
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,599
And the two of you will
be royal duchesses.

424
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:48,201
You will outrank
the King's own mother.

425
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:57,041
I am to marry Richard.

426
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:03,281
Your Grace.

427
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,319
However could they bring poor
King Henry in like that?

428
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:21,519
You must not call him "King",
my love. He is the king
in the eyes of God.

429
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,119
They have sinned to
take his throne away from him!

430
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:27,719
Complaining, Margaret?
Good evening to you, Lady Beauchamp.

431
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:30,719
Lady Mother.
You know my son, don't you?

432
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:34,439
Richard Welles
is Margaret's half-brother.

433
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:36,239
He's my pride and joy.

434
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:39,039
As my son would be
if you'd let me keep him with me.

435
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:42,959
Ever the drama, Margaret.
..I see she has not changed at all.

436
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:44,801
Ladies.

437
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:55,079
Henry is my son! He is mine!

438
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:57,999
And you have remarried.
A man I did not want to.

439
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,839
A man you forced upon me.
A man I did not choose.

440
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:02,681
Oh, Margaret. This again.

441
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:06,599
You are a girl, you do not choose.

442
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:08,959
You live the life
your mother chooses for you,

443
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:11,001
or your husband does.

444
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:15,359
Then why could you not
have chosen Jasper Tudor?

445
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:17,479
Oh, I've seen your
puppy eyes for him

446
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:20,241
since long before his brother
withered of the plague.

447
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:24,799
Then why choose Stafford?
I thought he was a better match.

448
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,241
And I do not care if you are happy.

449
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:40,921
Hello.

450
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:45,039
There were too many
commoners in there.

451
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,561
And all of them want marriages.

452
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:51,481
Isn't that what you want, Isabel?

453
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,441
George.
Brother.

454
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:11,921
Edward, there you are!

455
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:17,881
So what did Lord Warwick want?

456
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:24,561
My brothers for his girls.
For Isabel and Anne?

457
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,481
I said I would think about it.

458
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,759
Edward?

459
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:34,359
If Warwick's daughters
are married to your brothers,

460
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,719
they will share the biggest
fortune in the kingdom

461
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:38,479
and have royal blood
upon both sides.

462
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:41,119
Do you imagine they will not
come against you if you grant it?

463
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:43,719
Damn it, Elizabeth!
Warwick is not the enemy.

464
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:45,719
He is a friend
and I have disregarded him.

465
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:48,719
And I am resolved to sign the treaty
with Burgundy against France...

466
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:51,679
Shh. No! And it will be two years
of his life that have been wasted.

467
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:53,239
I must give him something.

468
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,079
Then give him something.

469
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,641
But not this.

470
00:35:57,681 --> 00:36:02,481
You must show him you are
your own man, and king now.

471
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:06,681
He may not grow too powerful
and come against you.

472
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:13,601
You're right.

473
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:16,639
Of course you are.

474
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,001
Perhaps he won't mind so much.

475
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:22,679
He's usually happy with more land.

476
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:26,241
I could offer him more of Wales,
take it away from Jasper Tudor.

477
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:43,761
Am I so bad
not even you may love me?

478
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:48,001
Tell me of your plan for me?

479
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:52,401
Tell me there is a purpose?

480
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:55,241
Give me a sign, Lord.

481
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:59,521
Tell me at least that my son
may have a destiny!

482
00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:21,799
Margaret? I've been
looking for you all night.

483
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:23,841
What have you been do...

484
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:30,599
Come on.

485
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,521
We are leaving.

486
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:28,639
Where's the Countess?
Your Grace.

487
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:31,201
Bring her in here!

488
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:35,239
But how?

489
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:37,599
How could he refuse you?

490
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:39,679
He promised they would be married.

491
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:42,719
The King has lost his mind,
he's thinking with his breeches

492
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,759
and all for some
little country whore!

493
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:48,959
Do you think it may be witchcraft?
It could be for no other reason!

494
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:52,439
This is what you get when you put
the Devil on the throne of England.

495
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:55,119
And now he is to sign
this deal with Burgundy

496
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:56,999
which will make me
look a fool to France

497
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,641
which is precisely what she wanted!

498
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,919
Well, she will not win this!
We will bide our time.

499
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:06,559
She has no son yet.

500
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,401
She will NOT win!

501
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,961
What will happen to us, Issy?

502
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:23,841
Well, Father will find us
someone else, I suppose.

503
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:27,799
Couldn't you marry
the Prince of France?

504
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,479
He's not yet married.

505
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:31,599
What use is a Prince of France?

506
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,679
We must get ourselves
in the line of succession here.

507
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:37,999
Everything that has happened,
Annie, is her fault.

508
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,961
She has ruined our matches and...

509
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:45,201
we are insulted.

510
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:49,361
She is another bad queen,
just like the last one.

511
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,161
Tell me about
the old bad queen, Issy?

512
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:00,161
What was she like again?

513
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:07,841
The bad queen called herself
Margaret of Anjou...

514
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:15,319
but really she was a she-wolf
and she rode at the head of an army

515
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:21,719
of naked, wild men and everything
in their path turned to ice!

516
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:27,399
They carried the sleeping king
forward in a big glass coffin,

517
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:31,319
and while he slept
the she-wolf tore apart England

518
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:33,361
with her terrible ambition!

519
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,401
She murdered our grandfather...

520
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:41,761
and she tried to spear Father
with a roasting spit!

521
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:49,239
But one day, Father and King Edward

522
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:54,079
fought a battle against her,
uphill, in the snow.

523
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:57,121
It was the bloodiest battle ever...

524
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:02,479
and she lost so she
blew away like a blizzard

525
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:06,001
into the cold, cold north.

526
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:11,119
And Edward became the king.

527
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:13,399
"Hurrah! Hurrah!"

528
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:15,279
And her son? The Prince of Ice?

529
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:16,919
Ah, yes.

530
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:19,319
Prince Edward is an ice boy.

531
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:23,041
He cut off two men's heads
when he was only seven years old!

532
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:28,479
But he isn't really Henry's boy,

533
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:31,719
because the king
was always sleeping.

534
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,641
So they say that his father...

535
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,881
is the Devil!

536
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:44,521
Thank you, Issy.

537
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:51,041
Don't worry, Annie.
Father will think of something.

538
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:55,041
Father always has a plan.

539
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:13,559
The King has chosen Burgundy

540
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:16,441
and Warwick's secret deal
with France is over.

541
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:23,119
The King's sister, Margaret,
will marry our very own cousin,
Charles of Burgundy.

542
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:27,999
So Warwick is escorting Margaret
to her wedding in Burgundy?

543
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,001
Ah, he's a nursemaid!

544
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,879
So now he won't
get his land in France.

545
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:37,521
And you, Elizabeth, must have sons.

546
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:03,801
Look at your hair.

547
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:07,799
Mary?
Mother!

548
00:43:07,801 --> 00:43:09,761
Lizzie? Could you hold Mary?

549
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:21,161
Your Grace!

550
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:31,921
We shall never get there if we must
stop every three minutes, girls!

551
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:34,959
Where's Father?

552
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:38,601
I told you, he's travelling his
kingdom. We're riding to join him.

553
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:46,039
Elizabeth.
Father! What are you doing here?

554
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,839
We are to ride with you.

555
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:51,039
There is a rebellion,
a Robin of Redesdale.

556
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:54,079
That's a fanciful name
for some petty rebel, Father.

557
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:56,279
Ed will stamp it all
out in a heartbeat.

558
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:57,999
Someone is paying the men,
Elizabeth.

559
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:00,519
They have strong, new boots
and this is Warwick's country.

560
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:04,759
Warwick? What threat is Warwick to us
now? This is no joke, Elizabeth.

561
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:06,559
It is certain.

562
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,199
There are thousands of men-in-arms
under Warwick's orders.

563
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:11,161
He is king-making again.

564
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:21,641
Oh, Issy. You look beautiful.

565
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:26,479
Do you think George
will adore me, Annie?

566
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:28,481
The way that the King does her?

567
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,959
I am sorry that Father
could not get Richard for you.

568
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:37,079
It is not him I was concerned with.

569
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:39,201
Just, I did rather
want to be a duchess.

570
00:44:45,761 --> 00:44:48,121
Come. Let's get this done.

571
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,199
Annie.

572
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:55,241
Annie, please don't leave me.

573
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,641
Mother! Mother!
My boys!

574
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:15,519
I knew that Warwick was angry

575
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:18,359
but never did I imagine he would
raise his own army against me!

576
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:20,359
He has betrayed me!

577
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:24,039
And so has George, for now I hear
he has married Isabel

578
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,919
against my clear command!

579
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:28,719
Warwick's plan must be to put George
upon the throne instead of me.

580
00:45:28,721 --> 00:45:31,559
God damn them both! But are you
sure that is what they are doing?

581
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,359
I am sure of nothing!

582
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:36,079
We have always stood shoulder
to shoulder on the battlefield.

583
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:39,119
At the battle of Mortimer's Cross
there were three suns in the sky.

584
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:40,639
Three suns!

585
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:42,879
Everybody said it was
a sign from God for me,

586
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:44,839
Richard and George,
the three Sons of York.

587
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:46,559
So how can one brother betray
the others?

588
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:49,199
With Warwick, the man you
thought of as your greatest friend.

589
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,959
And who else betrays
us with them, huh?

590
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,999
Our mother is not here, she's surely
gone to attend their wedding.

591
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,959
George is her darling, after all.

592
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,719
Why would she back George
instead of you?

593
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,439
The old story.
Whether I am my father's son.

594
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:04,439
Whether I am legitimate!
George is saying that I am a bastard

595
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:06,719
and that would make him
the true York heir.

596
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:11,481
Damn him! We will go and scotch
this snakes' nest before it comes
out of the ground.

597
00:46:14,681 --> 00:46:16,399
Annie! Annie!

598
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:17,839
What is it?

599
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,039
Was George bad to you?

600
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:22,279
Has he hurt you?

601
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:26,559
Yes, but no more than
Mother said I should expect.

602
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:28,999
That's not it.

603
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:31,041
It's very much worse, Annie.

604
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:35,281
My wedding was never for me at all.

605
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:40,681
It was a sign from Father that
men should rise against the King.

606
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:47,801
George.

607
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:59,359
Go to the city of Norwich.
Be a queen. Look unconcerned.

608
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:02,319
I just cannot bear that this
is happening. You must take care.

609
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:03,959
Please, all of you.

610
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:06,001
Father, stay safe.

611
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:09,999
Elizabeth, trust no-one.

612
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:13,521
Show them you are queen.
We will be back soon.

613
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:57,001
Your Grace.

614
00:48:52,281 --> 00:48:55,039
Still no word?

615
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:57,119
Warwick's got past our look-out.

616
00:48:57,121 --> 00:48:58,879
His army's coming to besiege us.

617
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:00,639
Ride to the protection of London.

618
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:02,839
Go, Edward!
We'll stay and hold him off!

619
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:04,799
TO ARMS!

620
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:06,921
Quickly! Quickly, men!

621
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,081
Lord Warwick's back!

622
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:57,081
He's done it. Father has the King!

623
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:13,439
"Dearest wife,
prepare yourself for bad news.

624
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:15,881
"I am prisoner, held by Warwick.

625
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:21,759
"I am unhurt but
you are in very grave danger

626
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:24,799
"as Warwick will
come after you if he can.

627
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:26,999
"Your father
and brothers have escaped

628
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:29,199
"and will be on their way to you.

629
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:31,159
"You must hasten to London.

630
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,239
"You must raise the city
and arm the Tower for a siege.

631
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:37,481
"For if George has a son,
we are lost.

632
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,479
"I love you with all of my heart.

633
00:50:40,481 --> 00:50:44,039
"The one and only,
King of England.

634
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,081
"Edward."

635
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:54,079
Anthony! Thank God!
We must go to London! Sister.

636
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:56,959
Warwick has captured Edward
and he's coming after me. Elizabeth.

637
00:50:56,961 --> 00:51:00,599
Are Father and John with you? Edward
said we must go to London. Sister!

638
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:03,641
Our father... and John...

639
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:07,281
they're dead.

640
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,159
No. They were beheaded.

641
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:15,919
There was no charge, no trial,
only the word of Warwick.

642
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:18,639
No! Edward said...
You, you all escaped!

643
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:22,119
There was an ambush.
They were waiting on the road ahead.

644
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:26,279
No, Anthony! No, God!
No! Say it's not true, Anthony!

645
00:51:26,281 --> 00:51:28,401
NO!

646
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:00,639
Jasper! Morning, Margaret.

647
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:03,079
You have heard?
They've snatched him!

648
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:04,879
Like the crown from the top
of the maypole.

649
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:07,719
I do not know what they intend,
but I shall write to George

650
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:11,279
and tell him he can name his price
if it will return my son his title.

651
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:13,361
My husband must not know.

652
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:18,759
My Lord. Stafford.

653
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:22,721
Take me to Henry, Jasper. I have
something marvellous to tell him.

654
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:26,001
Come.

655
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,319
My Lord. Henry.

656
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:31,761
Yes.

657
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:41,559
Today is a special day

658
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:44,159
because I have something
important to tell you.

659
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,199
I have known this for a long time

660
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:49,241
but I have waited until I was sure
to tell you both.

661
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:57,159
You will be king.
Have you lost your senses, Margaret?

662
00:52:57,161 --> 00:52:59,959
God has told me in a vision, Henry.

663
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:01,961
He said that you are His Chosen One.

664
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:07,239
And you will be
King Henry Tudor of England.

665
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:09,199
Ignore what your mother
just said, Henry,

666
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:11,919
for it is treason and she
would surely lose her head for it.

667
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,119
You had a vision?
And I have prayed upon it.

668
00:53:15,121 --> 00:53:17,999
But now, the old York poison
splits their House in two

669
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:20,681
I know God has spoken to me truly.

670
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:23,319
I will not hear this!

671
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:25,999
Elizabeth makes only little
witches for the burning

672
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:28,319
and perhaps the other
Yorks will be as cursed.

673
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:31,639
And when they are,
we will be waiting with my boy

674
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,921
for his chance upon the throne.

675
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:40,719
God has said you will be king

676
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:43,801
and you must hold that
in your heart.

677
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:47,599
And when you are crowned king,

678
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,879
my mother will kneel to me

679
00:53:49,881 --> 00:53:52,161
and she will call me
"Margaret Regina".

680
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,121
What kind of a monster is he?

681
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:04,679
No charge, no trial,
no chance for a defence?

682
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:07,559
It was an execution.
And I shall have his head for it!

683
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:09,921
Warwick cannot go unpunished!

684
00:55:11,081 --> 00:55:14,399
I cannot bear it, Mother.
Your father knew the risks.

685
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:17,201
God knows, it wasn't
his first battle.

686
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:22,161
He sent me this
before they killed him.

687
00:55:24,441 --> 00:55:27,199
He tells me to be happy,

688
00:55:27,201 --> 00:55:29,481
sends you his love.

689
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:36,921
John is such a loss to me.

690
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,121
He had his whole life ahead of him.

691
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:48,439
When you raise a boy
and he becomes a man,

692
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:52,199
you start to believe
that he is safe

693
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:54,479
and that you are safe
from heartbreak.

694
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:56,599
I should have known.

695
00:55:56,601 --> 00:56:00,079
I have the Sight,
I should have seen it.

696
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:02,641
Edward's mother will know this pain.

697
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:06,999
She will know the loss
of her son George. I swear it.

698
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:10,961
You have lost a son and so shall she!
What should that achieve?

699
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:15,559
It will not bring them back.
And there will be war again.

700
00:56:15,561 --> 00:56:17,799
They still have Edward!

701
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:22,161
I must avenge my father and my
brother or God knows I shall go mad!

702
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:25,919
I've tried to do it differently.

703
00:56:25,921 --> 00:56:29,761
I tried to do what Edward asked
and make them all my friends.

704
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:34,761
But now I want them dead.

705
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:43,121
Tear off a corner.

706
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:48,681
Write their names on it in blood.

707
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:52,081
Heat the charm,
keep it in the darkness.

708
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:57,241
Do it by the riverside
on the waning moon.

709
00:57:42,601 --> 00:57:47,761
Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick.
I curse you.

710
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:55,601
George Plantagenet, Duke
of Clarence, I curse you too.

711
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:11,521
By my will, you both shall die.

712
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:47,979
