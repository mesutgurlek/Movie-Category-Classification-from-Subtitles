1
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,013
Aw, shit.

2
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,379
Ionian column.

3
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,532
Fifth century BC, is it not?

4
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,773
No, it happens to be
third century BC, Doric.

5
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,809
So you're off the mark by a couple
of hundred years, you ignorant bastard.

6
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,249
Leutnant Braun...

7
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,296
one never kills a cook.

8
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,929
Especially an Italian cook.

9
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,899
On this occasion we will spare
Signor Rotelli.

10
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,619
And hang this man in his place.

11
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,019
Franz, ein Stuhl unter dem Vogel.

12
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,375
Und ein Seil.

13
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,936
Attention!

14
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,257
Professor Blake.

15
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,174
What is this
incessant compulsion to escape?

16
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,048
Is a habit I picked up as a soldier
during your first world war.

17
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,131
As a civilian, where would you be

18
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,213
if the benevolent arm of the Führer's
Antiquarian Reclamation Unit

19
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,736
had not rescued you
from your various internment camps?

20
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,336
I most certainly would not be
looting Greece of all her art treasures.

21
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,888
Sergeant Judson?

22
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,050
In what swamp of despair would you be

23
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,258
if your circus-bred skills of climbing
and rigging had not enticed me

24
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,730
into plucking you from your prison camp
in the Fatherland?

25
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,698
As for you, Bruno Rotelli,
if you were not a cook...

26
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,090
- I'm not a cook.
- God knows, that is true.

27
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,217
I'm a racing driver, sometimes I sing.
Things...

28
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,738
I've a feeling your defection to the Allies
musve been taken as a mixed blessing.

29
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,940
We have three dead archaeologists here
who cannot be replaced.

30
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,410
Note that did not deter Sergeant Mann
from shooting them.

31
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,855
In the interests of peace and harmony...

32
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,295
Harmony ain't whas about to happen.

33
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,576
Well, Major Hecht, I am pleased to see

34
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,016
you are conducting
a summary trial of these criminals.

35
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,013
- Have you decided on punishment?
- I was about to, Major Volkmann.

36
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,056
Oh, please, proceed.

37
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,930
As I was saying, to deter you from further
disrupting the mission of this unit

38
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,092
you shall be confined
to your sleeping quarters.

39
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,136
This camp exists for one purpose,

40
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,132
to exhume priceless
archaeological relics.

41
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,053
Anyone who interferes will pay dearly.

42
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,928
I suggest you confine them in here.

43
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,572
- Remove the grating.
- Open it.

44
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,653
Jump in, men.

45
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,809
In the SS, we play no favourites.

46
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,856
Put the dead men in with them.

47
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,776
- Do you wish me to give the order?
- Herr Major,

48
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,332
let me remind you that,
in this camp, I am in command.

49
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,299
You're quite right.

50
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,610
I have exceeded my authority.

51
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,535
Have they located the transmitter?

52
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,375
No, sir. It takes 30 seconds to get a fix
and the Greeks never transmit that long.

53
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,573
Bitte! Please...

54
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,050
Ah, please come. This way, please.

55
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,090
Don't do that.

56
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,328
You don't care
about any of this, do you?

57
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,615
I care that your Resistance heroes

58
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,296
have turned five girls into whores
so they can spy on the Germans for you.

59
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,333
You know we have a date for
an Allied naval invasion of the Aegean.

60
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,730
- Who's invading us this time?
- How do I know?

61
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,415
- The British? The Americans?
- The Germans are neater.

62
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,890
- From a madam's point of view.
- Hm.

63
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,892
They just hang old men
in the village square.

64
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,655
The Resistance,
it has a specific target to take now.

65
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,450
All right.

66
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,100
Yes, the submarine refuelling depot.

67
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,255
- Real coffee, where did you get it?
- Lieutenant Braun.

68
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,938
And how did you get it?

69
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,576
Follow me.

70
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,294
Heil Hitler.

71
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,736
Gesundheit. I hope is not catching.

72
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,771
- Oh, Charlie!
- Mamma mia, che meraviglia!

73
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,616
Hey.

74
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,576
- What are they doing down there?
- Prisoners who tried to escape. Come.

75
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,050
They told me we were going
to a country club.

76
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,336
Zurück, nein.

77
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,216
Enter.

78
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,769
- Ah, the Americans.
- Charlie Dane. This is Dottie Delmar.

79
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,899
- Major Otto Hecht.
- Great likeness. Great likeness!

80
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,299
- Louis Armstrong. When the saints...
- Yes, are you a jazz lover?

81
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,055
From King Oliver on.
Fancy looking junk you got there.

82
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,573
It is a fifth-century Aegean vase.

83
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,290
I woulïve sworn it was fourth century.
Looks expensive.

84
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,219
- You were shot down over the Adriatic?
- Thas right, on our way to a USO show.

85
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,336
I see you are a swimmer.

86
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,135
- Do you swim underwater?
- What did you have in mind?

87
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,691
We need someone to explore
the coastline for ancient art treasures.

88
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,930
I'm your man, Major.

89
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,693
Aptly put.

90
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,817
And you, Mr... Dane?

91
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,130
What is your speciality?

92
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,053
I'm a stand-up comic,
I do schtick, tell jokes.

93
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,858
I'm afraid there's no place

94
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,455
in the Antiquarian Reclamation Unit
for a comedian.

95
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,056
- But there is for a schvimmer?
- Even if she were not a swimmer

96
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,734
she would not be entirely useless.

97
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,288
Well, thank you, Major.

98
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,693
Major Volkmann, in his next sweep,
will be wishing to interrogate you.

99
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,817
- Is he another jazz lover?
- He is a major...

100
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,051
...in the SS.

101
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,339
Oy. I could catalogue your art collection,

102
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,333
write biographies of jazz immortals,
tune up the motorcycles.

103
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,857
- I do mending, washing...
- Come. We shall see how things go.

104
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,774
I can teach dancing. Limber them up
after all that goose-stepping.

105
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,695
- And Gershwin's An American in Paris...
- The Third Reich forbids Gershwin.

106
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,736
And not a moment too soon.

107
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,335
- Sergeant?
- Herr Major.

108
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,615
What took him so long?

109
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,612
Sergeant, you will take Mr Dane
to barrack seven

110
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,410
and escort Miss Delmar to the guests'
quarters next to the carpenter's shop.

111
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,219
- Jawohl, Herr Major.
- Jawohl.

112
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,215
- I hope you won't mind the banging.
- She never has.

113
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,693
Charlie!

114
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,539
They got a lot of loot in there. This Kraut
could have a good thing going.

115
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,135
- Not everyone's as crooked as you are.
- You wanna bet?

116
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,095
You will stay here.

117
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,093
I'll meet you downstairs in the bar
just as soon as I freshen up.

118
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,172
Work! Please. Come.

119
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,372
- Who is it?
- Is Zoe.

120
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,258
The kite is up.

121
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,369
Braun's trying to locate the radio again.

122
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,213
He'll never find it
where he's been looking.

123
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,734
You can change all that.

124
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,573
Thas a commitment
I'm not prepared to make.

125
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,616
Then stop complaining about it.

126
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,533
- Climb back to your monastery.
- Oh, I intend to.

127
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,375
Is that part of your plan?

128
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,333
Now, look, er... You forget I said that.

129
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,059
'Achtung, Gefreiter Müller,
das Licht in Baracke B ausschalten.'

130
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,008
- Who is it?
- Otto Hecht.

131
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,009
- Do I know you?
- I am the commandant.

132
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,096
Sorry.

133
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,571
I have a tough time with names
but I never forget a face.

134
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,133
Well, my dear Miss Delmar,

135
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,178
I see you adapt quickly
to new situations.

136
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,857
- Everything in its proper place.
- Oh, I always like to make things homey,

137
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,250
- travelling a lot, the way we do.
- We?

138
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,808
You and Charlie?

139
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,097
No, no. We. We in show business.

140
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,217
Charlie and I just met
on this aquacade gig.

141
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,691
Aquacade? That is an American word
I am not knowing.

142
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,252
Is, er... Is sort of like
a wet Busby Berkeley routine.

143
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,697
Only it gives the farmers a chance
to see a lot of floating boobs.

144
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,089
Boobs?

145
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,540
Would you like to sit down?

146
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,656
Thank you.

147
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,935
- Please.
- Oh, no, go ahead.

148
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,694
- Why don't we, er, drink to something?
- All right.

149
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,570
Like, er...

150
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,209
- Like peace for the world.
- Oh.

151
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,056
- Prost.
- Cheers.

152
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,095
Say, whas gonna happen to us?

153
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,218
To you... nothing.

154
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,133
I'm not so sure about
your Jewish friend.

155
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,371
- How do you know he's Jewish?
- In the Third Reich,

156
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,690
they assume everyone is Jewish...

157
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,248
unless proven otherwise.

158
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,379
You have, erm... nice thighs.

159
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,692
Thanks.

160
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,778
I would like to, er...

161
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,659
So whas stopping you?

162
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,496
- I anticipate that you might.
- Oh.

163
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,129
I may look dumb, but I'm not stupid.

164
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,419
Something wrong?

165
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,138
You are not responding.

166
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,610
Honey, you said you wanted to...

167
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,294
I didn't say I did.

168
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,975
Well, I, er... do think
that under the circumstances

169
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,212
you might cultivate a... little warmth.

170
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,019
Good night.

171
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,297
Aren't you going to take your wine back?

172
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,860
That would not be
the act of a gentleman.

173
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,578
And blackmail is, huh?

174
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,016
Only if it succeeds.

175
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,056
Good night.

176
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,533
- Where's the tunnel, Professor?
- What?

177
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,090
Come on, someone's always digging
a tunnel for escape.

178
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,217
- Not here.
- Thas a relief.

179
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,768
Is not such a terrible spot
to sit out the war.

180
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,091
No, and our Austrian commandant
feels the same way.

181
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,819
- What is it?
- Thas about 200 BC,

182
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,573
is a miniature of some household god.

183
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,778
- Probably off a lady's bedside table.
- How do you know that?

184
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,328
I come from a long line
of archaeologists.

185
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,413
You see, when the sun never set
on the Empire, we looted with impunity.

186
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,812
Treasure from Egypt, porcelain
from Peking, golden masks from Persia.

187
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,778
- Isn't that Hechs racket?
- Oh, our commandant?

188
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,658
He used to be a dishonest
art dealer in Vienna,

189
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,492
so he has to be more careful.

190
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,730
The ordinary finds do go to Berlin,

191
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,449
but anything of real value
goes to his sister in Switzerland.

192
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,293
What else?

193
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,497
This looks like one you found yesterday.

194
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,536
Ha, yes, how clever of you.

195
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,453
They were made in sets of two,
husband and wife.

196
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,850
How come everything
is under the camp?

197
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,170
This was one beautiful
temple of Neptune

198
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,899
and people came
to leave valuable offerings.

199
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,538
'Prisoner Dane... '

200
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,772
- What happens if we run out of stuff?
- We won't. We take precautions.

201
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,216
'Prisoner Dane, report
to the commandans office.'

202
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,212
Put him back to bed.
Now you see him, now you don't.

203
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,849
Very neat. So, tell me,
where's the real heavy stuff?

204
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,057
- Well, Charlie...
- You! Dane.

205
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,734
Major Hecht. Come.

206
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,575
If he could only stand up
by himself without relying on me.

207
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,419
Are you still here?

208
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,173
Is not a bad life. Got a match?

209
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,613
- I'm so sorry.
- Schwein!

210
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,929
- Hi, Fräulein!
- Give 'em hell, baby.

211
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,533
Oh, beautiful woman, Sergeant.
Your mother?

212
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,896
- My wife.
- Ah, nice dainty quality about her.

213
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,053
You're a man of exceptional taste,
Sergeant. Exceptional taste.

214
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,740
Charlie?

215
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,776
Major.

216
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,696
Nice view.

217
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,938
Have you ever been to Hollywood?

218
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,491
- I've played a few bits there.
- Do you know... Ann Sheridan?

219
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,094
Do I know Ann Sheridan?

220
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,896
No.

221
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,098
Miss Sheridan is what they
call the... oomph girl, is she not?

222
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,136
All the time.

223
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,418
- What is "oomph"?
- "Oomph"?

224
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,412
Is the icing on the strudel, Major.

225
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,334
That, then, is the area I would
like to be discussing with you.

226
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,775
In the matter of Miss Delmar.

227
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,455
Your status here does not permit you
connubial privileges.

228
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,215
- So far.
- Consider it a closed door.

229
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,771
However, there is no reason
that we all must suffer.

230
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,851
Certainly not.

231
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,058
- Idle machinery rusts.
- Precisely.

232
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,179
Now, given the uncertainty
of your position here...

233
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,411
I thought you might need
a social director, you know,

234
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,652
a bingo club, teach the tango,
put on shows - I do a fabulous Jolson.

235
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,935
You ain't heard nothin' yet!

236
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,410
You, er... You have my permission.

237
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,970
Terrific, you'll have
the grooviest camp in the mountains.

238
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,133
Now, er...
Back to the question of oomph.

239
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,769
- I thought that was going fine.
- On the surface, yes.

240
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,011
But, er... Uh-uh.

241
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,139
Oh. Well, is hard
for some ladies to fake it.

242
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,178
Well, she could look upon it as, er...

243
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,216
...theatre.

244
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,728
I don't know, Major.
A jazz lover like you stooping to this.

245
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,380
The spoils of war, my friend.

246
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,850
Have the girls heard anything
about those two Americans?

247
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,500
No, what about them?

248
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,094
They may have been
planted by the Germans -

249
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,809
I'm waiting now
to hear from Allied intelligence.

250
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,460
We may have to kill them.

251
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,895
- Yes?
- Is Zoe.

252
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,535
If he's from the prison camp,
you take him.

253
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,736
- Is Braun.
- Braun.

254
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,653
- With or without his truck?
- With.

255
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,698
Don't get upset,
you don't have to be jealous of him

256
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,250
- when he's with his truck.
- Is the truck that upsets me.

257
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,814
Hechs got his girl
and he doesn't seem to mind at all.

258
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,856
He minds.

259
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,730
I don't trust him.

260
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,017
Telling bad jokes doesn't make
a man a collaborator.

261
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,853
- I thought for the finale...
- It would be nice

262
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,330
- if Dottie sang Lili Marlene.
- You got it, babe.

263
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,332
- How's business?
- Berlin is satisfied.

264
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,899
Are you?

265
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,972
We've found some things
of historical interest.

266
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,416
You would not be here
if thas all there was to find.

267
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,130
- I'm not sure thas a compliment.
- Bubula, from me, is a compliment.

268
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,979
The real treasures are up there.
In a monastery on Mount Athena.

269
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,812
- Triptychs.
- Triptychs.

270
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,098
Icons, jewelled, carved in gold.

271
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,569
Byzantine masterpieces.

272
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,458
- And, of course, the plates.
- What plates?

273
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,296
Gold plates.

274
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,213
Two-headed eagles in bas-relief

275
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,656
commissioned by
Constantine VI in 790 AD.

276
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,413
Worth how much?

277
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,014
- 10 million.
- Marks?

278
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,295
- Swiss francs.
- But thas two...

279
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,019
- Thas two million bucks!
- Yes.

280
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,458
And, when we win this war,
I will liberate those treasures.

281
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,496
You won't win this war.

282
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,089
Well, then I am quite sure that you

283
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,455
will liberate them.

284
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,091
- I enjoy your company... Bubula?
- And I love you too, Otto.

285
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,297
Thanks for the airing - and the smoke.

286
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,539
Is that you, Otto?

287
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,850
Who else?

288
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,095
You.

289
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,576
Out.

290
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,490
Slowly.

291
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,569
Sergeant, I'm taking this Greek in
for a curfew violation.

292
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,935
- You drive.
- Sir.

293
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,331
- Get in the car.
- But I was just...

294
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,376
Get in the car!

295
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,135
Die Bremse ist kaputt.
Ich kann den Wagen nicht halten.

296
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,814
Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant!

297
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,858
Wir rennen ins Munitionslager.

298
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,249
Ich kann den Wagen nicht halten.

299
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,174
Ahh!

300
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,457
She will leave you and then

301
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,008
Come back again

302
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,375
A pretty girl...

303
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,451
Oy gevalt.

304
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,974
Did you ever make it with a German girl?

305
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,051
- No, not yet.
- Don't.

306
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,096
Charlie?

307
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,736
- Nous?
- You're in the club.

308
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,893
Smashing! I'll need two parking spaces,
a foursome on Sunday mornings -

309
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,936
I'm a singles man on the course.

310
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,739
- Don't you ever give up?
- What do you want me to do?

311
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,175
Kill.

312
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,617
- So there is going to be a tunnel?
- No, Charlie.

313
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,533
We're gonna break in, not out.

314
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,054
I don't get it.

315
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,378
- We're going to take over the camp.
- Whose cockamamie idea is that?

316
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,089
- The Greek Resistance.
- If we live to take this camp over,

317
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,933
- what will we do with it?
- They'll let us know.

318
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,057
Now, here's the camp.
The explosives are there.

319
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,019
- And your job...
- I think I'll resign from this club.

320
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,852
I don't think you wanna do that.

321
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,373
- Wait a minute, Otto.
- Is Charlie.

322
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,616
Oh.

323
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,260
- Sorry.
- You win a few, you lose a few,

324
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,490
you seem to be travelling first class.

325
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,299
Oh, come on, I'm just not a tragic figure.

326
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,770
I make do, you above all people
should understand that.

327
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,772
- Dig, dig, dig.
- I'm not attacking you.

328
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,772
Is the way we are,
thas why we're partners.

329
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,818
Well, hear this, partner.
We're joining the army.

330
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,733
- Is our army here?
- No, their army's here,

331
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,618
we're gonna hit them
and take over the camp.

332
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,578
Oh, yeah? What will they
be doing in the meantime?

333
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,016
They'll be watching you strip.
We'll put on a show for them.

334
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,297
Oh, do I have to take
my clothes off for Germans?

335
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,178
Today Otto, tomorrow the world.

336
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,410
Ha, ha.

337
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,572
- Does anyone have to get hurt?
- Probably. So what?

338
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,174
Because Otto's been very good to us.

339
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,933
Well, maybe you should tell...

340
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,932
Tell him, give him
a little advanced notice.

341
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,013
- You wouldn't still be here without him.
- I'll keep it in mind.

342
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,053
What are you guys
going to do afterwards?

343
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,132
Climb to the monastery
and do a little select looting

344
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,176
before your friend gets it all.

345
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,933
Hm, thas my baby.

346
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,649
Hey. Charlie.

347
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,812
You want to kiss and make up?

348
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,618
How about just kiss?

349
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,459
You don't have to play
tough guy with me.

350
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,096
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

351
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,172
- Can you make it?
- How quickly they forget.

352
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,330
There's two million bucks up there.

353
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,379
For that kind of money
I'd climb the Empire State Building.

354
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,614
You saw that Braun was drunk,

355
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,534
- why did you not help him?
- I tried to, but I was afraid of him.

356
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,090
Prior to my command,
had a woman ever been executed here?

357
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,092
- No, sir.
- Hm. We need to set a dramatic example.

358
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,536
- This one will be the first.
- She's only a prostitute

359
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,576
being serviced by our troops.

360
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,616
It may not upset the locals.

361
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,329
A housewife would be upsetting,
it implies virtuous women can be next.

362
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,775
- When do you want it done?
- Immediately.

363
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,816
And put this on the loudspeakers -

364
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,018
if Braun's murderer does not surrender
within the next 48 hours

365
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,139
ten more citizens
of Karya will be shot, hm?

366
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,854
'Achtung! Achtung!

367
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,650

369
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,692

00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,296

Einwohner erschossen.'

372
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,051
You didn't have to kill Braun.

373
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,530
I'll be the judge of that.

374
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,135
I almost paid him off.
He was satisfied with it.

375
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,529
We cannot rely on that indefinitely.

376
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,612
Are we going to kill
the two Americans next?

377
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,772
No, they've been cleared.

378
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,250
How merciful.
And do your superiors know

379
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,810
what personal reason
you had for killing Braun?

380
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,937
What kind of a man do you think I am?

381
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,976
We'll find out now.

382
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,612
Are you going to let them shoot
ten more people to save your own skin?

383
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,737
- No one will be killed.
- I don't believe you.

384
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,050
You'll see.

385
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,096
There's a plan.

386
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,092
Will you give yourself up
if it doesn't work?

387
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,338
No.

388
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,094
You're a pig!

389
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,695
Zoe's death will be avenged.

390
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,773
I hope so. Because if I have to,
I'll turn you over to Volkmann myself.

391
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,334
Exquisite. Absolutely exquisite.

392
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,092
Thank you, Professor.

393
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,219
And it does confirm our theory about
the disparity of the time line in this dig.

394
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,177
That is second-century BC.

395
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,013
90% of the rest of the finds
are from the Christian era.

396
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,618
You're right. We've run into the antique
collection of a first-century Greek.

397
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,009
Is a sobering thought, isn't it?

398
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,651
2,000 years ago some rich merchant
looked upon that as ancient times.

399
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,179
- Thank you, Professor.
- Good night, Major.

400
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,536
Oh, I shall tell Sergeant Mann
you are free to drop in

401
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,612
- whenever you feel like it.
- Thank you.

402
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,939
All right. Pick them up.

403
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,776
- Whas that?
- Gift from the Resistance to the Krauts.

404
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,613
- Whas it for?
- A little herb that grows around here.

405
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,816
They call it Socrates' Revenge.

406

00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,852
Looks like... early Harrods.

00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,700
Get out of here.

434
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,692
- Nein, nein.
- Fritz, relax. Is only a walk.

435
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,056
Watch the ball, watch the ball.

436
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,700
Now, I put it in this hand like this, right?

437
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,568
Ah! But look... the ball is gone.

438
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,013
Whoo!

439
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,139
So she says to the bartender,
"I didn't mind the first two guys,

440
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,814
"but the one in the fur coat
was a little rough

441
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,334
"and I think he ought to cut his nails."

442
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,971
You see, she thought the bear
was another guy, wearing a fur coat.

443
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,739
And now, gentlemen,
the lady we've all been waiting for,

00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,137
When I was in pigtails

453
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,211
My mama done told me

454
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,372
Hon

455
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,773
A man's gonna sweet-talk

456
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,533
And give you the big eye

457
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,415
- But when the sweet-talking's done
- Oh, come on, guys!

458

Come on, get your hands
out of your pockets.

00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,455
Hear that lonesome whistle

- A-whoo-ee, a-whoo-ee!

471
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,737
- Les hear it, guys! Yeah!
- A... whoo-ee...

472
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:01,092
- A-whoo-ee, a-whoo-ee
- Oh, yeah!

473
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:06,860
A-whoo-ee, a-whoo-ee

474
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,819
Sergeant, will you sit down?
You'll find yourself on the Russian front.

475
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,495
Hey, wer hat meine Hose geklaut?

476
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,332
You wanna see some more?

477
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,972
Catch!

478
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,455
Hope they don't kill us.

479
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:49,130
Thank you. You'll never know how much
we appreciate your cooperation.

480
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,257
Now, les hear it for Sergeant Mann.

481
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,014
Sergeant, Sergeant...

482
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,694
Sergeant Mann, you are one cool cat.

483
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,011
Now, Sergeant, can I correctly assume

484
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,730
that there is no way on earth that I can,
with a simple wave of my fabric,

485
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:11,940
remove your automatic
from your holster into my hand?

486
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,373
Am I correct?

487
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,179
- There's no way.
- Shoo-bop she-boop.

488
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,615
- And I'll be damned.
- Bravo, bravo!

489
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,577
That ol' black magic has me...

490
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,332
...in its spell

491
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,571
Hands on your heads.
Commandant, give the order

492
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,333
to surrender arms
or you'll be the first to go.

493
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,290
Surrender your weapons.

494
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,649
Professor, I hope you know
what you're doing.

495
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,456
All of you.

496
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,609
Those weapons flew...

497
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,898
...at the supersonic speed of 3,300km/h.

498
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,890
And had a range of 200km.

499
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,613
You can see from these Allied pictures

500
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,613
their... devastating effect
on the city of London.

501
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,615
Yes, thas enough.

502
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,452
Pull the curtains.

503
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,496
And our new weapon
has even greater significance.

504
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,731
When directed at Allied ships
it could do in moments

505
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,211
what conventional coastal artillery
could not achieve in days.

506
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,736
That is all, gentleman.
Unless there are any questions?

507
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,857
Have some more tea,
help yourself to the biscuits.

508
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:04,700
- Why do anything to Major Hecht?
- For one thing, he's invaded my country.

509
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,658
- What is it with this woman?
- She's right.

510
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,449
We need Hecht to ensure Volkmann
doesn't find out what happened.

511
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,496
Maybe I can persuade him?

512
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,731
I doubt ill work,
but you have my permission to try.

513
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,336
Permission? I didn't do all this fighting
just to change from Krauts to Greeks.

514
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,978
What fighting?

515
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:27,929
How long do you think ill take
Volkmann to find out, even with Hecht?

516
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,693
- We have other plans.
- So do I.

517
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:36,173
- Oh, really? What would they be?
- I want to climb up to that monastery.

518
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,898
- Really? Why?
- I'm an art lover.

519
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,416
- We all are, but there are priorities.
- Wait a minute...

520
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,617
You don't think we can climb
all the way up there

521
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,214
without Volkmann's troops noticing?

522
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,291
We, Rotelli?

523
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,178
You too? You're an art lover?

524
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,448
Nat, I want a word with Major Hecht.

525
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,974
Something like "better luck next time"?

526
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,214
- That was very well done.
- Thank you.

527
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:17,578
Obviously we need Volkmann to go on
thinking everything's in order here.

528
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,209
- Obviously.
- So, we want you to tell him that it is.

529
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,889
You are assuming that
because a man steals from his country

530
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,936
he will also betray it?

531
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,217
No, that would make any tax fiddler
a potential traitor.

532
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,768
- Then let me ask you this.
- Mm-hm.

533
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:39,490
How would you feel
if the shoe was on the other foot?

534
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,140
Fortunately, is not.

535
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,936
I'll make it easy for you.

536
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,615
If you don't help us, Zeno will kill you.

537
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,933
You are allied with him.
Will you share that responsibility?

538
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:01,018
- With difficulty.
- And there's no other alternative?

539
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,093
- What happened?
- Nothing yet.

540
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,252
He's making up his mind.

541
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,290
Thank you.

542
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,258
It would have been a frightful waste.

543
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,572
You all know Otto, he's really a good kid.

544
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,298
Not that good.

545
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,815
What is it you wish me to do?

546
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,371
In 18 hours, Volkmann intends to shoot
ten people. That will not happen.

547
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,372
And the Germans will be
put out of action on this island.

548
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,735
Just like that?

549
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:19,211
I've discussed it with the professor
and he agrees is feasible.

550
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,292
- Then we can go to the monastery?
- Charlie!

551
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,293
- You sure got a one-track mind.
- Our mission is to take the village

552
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,292
and the refuelling depot,
so that German submarines

553
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,178
cannot function
against the Allied invasion fleet.

554
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,728
After that, I don't care what you do.

555
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,733
Except, and listen very carefully,
gentlemen,

556
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,654
the treasures of Athena
are the property of the Greek people.

557
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,699
We shall begin by infiltrating
the brothel in the village.

558
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,176
I find it disgusting, Major Hecht,

559
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,297
but I'm sure you don't wish
to see your so-called soldiers

560
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,416
expire of terminal priapism.

561
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,456
Permission granted.

562
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,936
Done.

563
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,414
Now is up to you.

564
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,616
Imagine that Austrian antique dealer

565
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,818
wanting his country club guards
to visit a whorehouse before breakfast!

566
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,369
Leutnant, have the men dismount.

567
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,812
Absteigen!

568
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,209
- Absteigen?
- Absteigen.

569
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,892
- Herr Major?
- Ja?

570
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,414
There will be executions this morning,

571
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,652
therefore Major Volkmann asks
that your men be present and armed.

572
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:39,449
Please inform the Herr Major
that we shall be delighted

573
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,008
to lend our presence to the occasion.

574
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,620
Im Laufschritt, marsch!

575
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,936
Dreht rechts!

576
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,974
- Hey, Zeno.
- Yes?

577
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,813
- So long as we're here...
- The voice of Italy.

578
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,336
Go downstairs,
take the prisoners into the basement.

579
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,496
Abteilung, links um!

580
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,648
Blake will be attacking
the oil depot soon.

581
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:29,494
Rotelli, you and your men
take up your positions.

582
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,535
Remember, short bursts, Charlie.

583
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,498
Not rat-tat-tat-tat like
in the gangster movies.

584
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,775
- Yes, sir.
- The barrel heats up.

585
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,215
Rat-tat-tat. Not rat-tat-tat-tat.

586
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,333
- Whas he telling him?
- Whas he telling him?

587
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,251
That he likes matzo ball soup.

588
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:43,736
Ganze Abteilung - Halt!

589
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:47,210
Rechte Reihe einen Schritt vor.

590
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,530
Links um.

591
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,613
Linie bilden.

592
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,210
Waffen entsichern.

593
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,571
'Eagle four, Eagle four,
this is Swordfish.

594
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,935
'Position X-ray 42, yellow grid.

595
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:21,330
- 'Will give you ETA later.'
- Eagle four to Swordfish.

596
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,332
Channel nets will be open,
use tanks one and two.

597
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,056
Lhre Papiere, bitte.

598
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,497
- Alert the frogmen to prepare for entry.
- Yes, sir.

599
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:13,330
Is it safe?

600
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,456
There's no one at the oil pumps,
so we should be all right

601
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,690
until the next submarine shows up.

602
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,570
- Herr Hechs too close to him.
- Thas his problem.

603
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,732
- Beeilt euch.
- Ja.

604
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,493
Kommt von dem Wagen runter.
Los, dalli.

605
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,338
Eleana, you take over.
We're going downstairs.

606
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,576
Los, an die Wand.

607
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,651
Legt an!

608
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,050
Oh, Christ.

609
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,131
Rat-tat-tat. Rat-tat-tat-tat.

610
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,412
Get to the radio!

611
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,816
Get him!

612
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,050
Stop that man!

613
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,170
Hey, my name is Alison

614
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:26,411
My husband is Al,
we come from Alabama...

615
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:30,377
I assume that everything
went well in the village.

616
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:35,050
- For your country or mine?
- For mine.

617
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,700
Oh, there's no such thing
as country, Major.

618
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,294
Only rivers, mountains,
houses and people.

619
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:45,454
- Country is an abstraction.
- You don't really believe that, do you?

620
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:49,339
- No.
- Thank you for trying.

621
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,009
- You seem to be in good shape here.
- I'm not sure. Look.

622
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,217
Here's today's log.
Now, what does this entry mean?

623
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:02,697
There is a U-boat out there somewhere,
coming in for refuelling.

624
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:34,051
- Whas in here?
- The key to the monastery.

625
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,898
What does it say?

626
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:55,894
"Athena. Goddess of war,
wisdom and music."

627
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,369
Like you, a very confused goddess.

628
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,610
- What does that mean?
- Wait a moment.

629
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:12,889
Looks like, er...

630
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,292
- Looks like is pretty good here, huh?
- Not a bad show.

631
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:19,655
Element of total surprise, what?

632
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,810
Dig him.

633
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,414
When do we hit the monastery
and get rich?

634
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,697
There's a problem -
Volkmann may have radioed for help.

635
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,135
- Where to?
- Where is the problem.

636
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:33,496
Thas why Zeno's dragging his heels,
or so he says.

637
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:36,731
The Allied invasion here
has been advanced 30 days.

638
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:39,414
Thas a week from today.

639
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,695
And I'm to act immediately.

640
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:49,415
- Charlie! Rotelli! Up here!
- Whas our Greek mother want now?

641
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,776
Coming, Mother.

642
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,736
I've got good news.

643
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,175
Volkmann - he didn't transmit anything.

644
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,330
Or if he did, nobody was listening.

645
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,810
- How do you know?
- How do I know?

646
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,976
This is how I know.

647
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:13,257
Allied intelligence in Turkey
monitors this area.

648
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:16,650
So, we're staying out here
till the invasion, huh?

649
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,856
Well, we could, er...

650
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,977
have lots of time
to climb to the monastery.

651
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,699
You certainly change
your mind fast, Zeno.

652
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,771
The last I heard it was out of bounds.

653
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:29,772
"The treasures are the property
of the Greek people."

654
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:31,816
- They are.
- Thas right.

655
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:36,132
Listen, the first troops that land here,
regardless of race, creed or colour

656
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,176
are gonna steal everything.

657
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,216
It might as well be us.

658
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,054
- You feel the same way?
- Monks will be conned by someone.

659
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,933
- Rotelli?
- I agree with both.

660
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,013
All right. We'll have to climb up

661
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,570
carrying heavy weapons and explosives.

662
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,810
For a bunch of monks?

663
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:04,258
Well, they may have taken the treasure,
buried it and sealed it.

664
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,969
I understand dynamite,
but why the fancy hardware?

665
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:10,858
There's still a war going on, Charlie.

666
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,579
You know something,
I don't really trust you.

667
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:18,254
But I'm more greedy than I am cautious.

668
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:21,935
- When do we start?
- Right now, if you'd like.

669
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,772
Eh?

670
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:58,896
- What have you got?
- Submarine surfacing. Zone three.

671
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:04,657
- 20 degrees southwest of the depot.
- 'This is Swordfish, ETA 13:13.

672
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:07,208
- 'Over.'
- Tell him we have a fuel leak.

673
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,450
- They won't believe it.
- Tell him!

674
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:12,213
'This is Swordfish, do you read me?

675
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,378
'Eagle four, this is Swordfish... '

676
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,576
Swordfish, Swordfish, Eagle four.

677
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,779
Can't believe some people
do this for fun.

678
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:31,773
'Will proceed to Eagle six
as alternate. Over and out.'

679
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,816
How will I immobilise this place?

680
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,449
There are some things
you must find out for yourself.

681
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,820
We have a few limpet mines.

682
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,891
- Dottie?
- Hm?

683
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:49,292
Five metres... Can you get down
about 18 feet without equipment?

684
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,656
Well, I guess so.
Anything for the war effort.

685
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,494
First open the barrels, then set the mines

686
01:20:57,580 --> 01:21:00,094
and I hope there are
no underwater surprises.

687
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,979
- Hey, whas all that?
- It looks like transmitting equipment.

688
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:13,849
- For a bunch of monks?
- Wonder what they do with it?

689
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,896
Maybe a morning talk show.

690
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:19,814
"This is Brother Zoltos speaking to you
on orthodoxy at high altitudes."

691
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,539
The Germans must have
an installation in there.

692
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,769
Oh-ho-ho.

693
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:27,739
- At least try to sound surprised.
- Are you saying...

694
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,890
He's saying you took us up here

695
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,733
for reasons that are not to do
with what we're after.

696
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:34,811
- Right.
- So am I.

697
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,936
All right.

698
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,976
Is a communications centre.

699
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,939
When they find out something is wrong
down there, they'll radio for help.

700
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,976
We have to knock it out.

701
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:49,019
- How many man are in there?
- Oh, there can't be too many.

702
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:53,969
- You've worked out some sort of plan?
- Ah, carefully.

703
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,016
We ought to throw you down there.

704
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,297
- Then you won't get your golden plates.
- My golden plates...

705
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:01,336
If something happens to me...

706
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:04,969
In 20 years when the Germans are selling
Volkswagen all over the world,

707
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:07,016
I'm going to be very angry.

708
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,894
- It can't be for one of us.
- Shh!

709
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:37,258
- Hey, maybe is your agent, huh?
- Really? No.

710
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:45,369
Jawohl. Ja, alles normal hier.

711
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,054
Ja, ja, geht in Ordnung. Ja, gut.

712
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,456
Jump! Jump!

713
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:20,649
Ha. Nice of them
to make it easy to climb down.

714
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,897
Make sure you only touch it
with your boots.

715
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:32,175
Now...

716
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:46,898
Halt!

717
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:30,572
- Zeno, my silencer doesn't fit.
- Shut up!

718
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:32,651
My silencer doesn't fit!

719
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:52,009
Is this your idea of not too many?
One, two, three, four...

720
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,091
There's a whole army down there!

721
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,735
- Take off the lid.
- Hexaclyde II?

722
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:59,414
- Sounds like a stain remover.
- Thas close.

723
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,698
When they wake up
there'll be a change of management.

724
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,810
Hold your breath.

725
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:38,415
Natürlich.

726
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:43,858
Dankeschön.

727
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,858
The radio's dead, sir.

728
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:06,857
'... zu Hause.
Die Kinder fragen jeden Tag... '

729
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:10,171
Depot, this is Athena, come in.

730
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,012
Call the air base at Crete.

731
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:24,056
Crete, this is Athena, come in.

732
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,296
Whas next?

733
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,695
Not too many now, are there?

734
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:41,738
I can't raise Crete either, sir.

735
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:51,813
- Les go.
- For the treasure?

736
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:54,255
- Oh, yes.
- Great.

737
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:08,374
- Check the antenna.
- Yes, sir.

738
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,297
Halt! Halt!

739
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,898
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.

740
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,575
- Lantz.
- Sir?

741
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:40,252
Put the garrison on alert.

742
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,889
- Supervise the manning of all stations.
- Sir.

743
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:51,372
Zeno, are we getting
close to the treasure yet?

744
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,972
- Schroeder speaking, sir.
- Phase one.

745
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:49,612
- Is that where they keep the treasure?
- Quiet.

746
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,214
You lied! You lied to us!

747
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,940
Zeno, whas going on?

748
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,655
With tap shoes, they could do music hall.

749
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:15,696
For once, will you shut up?

750
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,536
You lied to us. You liar!

751
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,971
You son of a bitch.

752
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:08,097
Well, now you know
what you're really doing up here.

753
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:11,809
You'll be a hero, Charlie.
Big decorations.

754
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:15,370
We're going to stop the invasion fleet
being blown out of the water.

755
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:17,496
So the invasion is on.

756
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:21,896
In a few days.

757
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:27,292
I don't get it. What are they doing
with that thing now?

758
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:30,258
I wouldn't worry
about your share of the loot.

759
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:34,219
- Zeno can be trusted.
- I'm not worried about that, Professor.

760
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:36,860
I am worrying about what else
he has got them into.

761
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:39,408
Nothing they can't get out of,
I assure you.

762
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:31,332
OK... Les stop that thing
and get out of here.

763
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:37,016
Hold it! You hit that liquid oxygen,
you blow us all back to the village.

764
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,295
Oh, sorry.

765
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:49,577
Nat, the opening in the wall, the cross...

766
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:54,257
Thas the missile room.
Throw these in as far as you can.

767
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:23,173
All right. If I get clear, follow me.

768
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,456
Come on, come on!

769
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,616
Holy cow!

770
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:13,450
OK, where's the gold plates?

771
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:16,179
- Can't you ever stop?
- Never.

772
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:20,410
Would you mind if we liberated
a few monks first?

773
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,616
Go find them, will you, Nat?

774
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:29,656
OK, Nat, you find the monks,

775
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:33,892
you're an equal partner
along with Otto and the professor.

776
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:44,779
Zeno, where is the treasure?
Where are the gold plates?

777
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:49,374
At the end of the tunnel to the right.

778
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:02,455
Ah, quickly. Move, move, quick.

779
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:55,338
You get the feeling
someone's been here before?

780
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:42,812
This place is programmed
to self-destruct and the timer is running.

781
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,850
Did you hear that, Charlie?

782
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,498
Charlie, we gotta go.

783
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:52,574
- Charlie, the place is gonna blow up.
- Leave me alone. I gotta get this open.

784
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:31,856
Charlie!

785
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,658
Good timing.

786
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,531
Heil Hitler.

787
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:36,733
Now you can get out
of the brothel business.

788
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:39,493
I don't know.

789
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:42,890
With the Germans gone,
you'll have to - Greeks...

790
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:44,936
they don't pay.

791
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,416
They don't have to.

792
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:55,335
I only hope your treasures survived
the total destruction of the monastery.

793
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:58,412
Without question.
Because they are hidden

794
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:01,651
in the so-called... house of pleasure.

795
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:06,090
- In the?
- You don't have to actually tell me,

796
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:08,455
just point me in the general direction.

797
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:11,816
We don't want the treasures,
we only want to copy them.

798
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:03,695
And if I'm getting close, you say,
"Charlie, you're getting hot."

799
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:05,736
But if I'm not, say, "Cold."

800
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:20,853
May I see them?
I assure you I only want to look.

801
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:24,057
- I intend you to, Professor.
- Thank you.

802
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:33,298
- I'll be your representative in New York.
- I'll be your representative in Roma.

803
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:37,259
- Another drink?
- None of this will be possible.

804
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:21,736
Oh, Otto, take me inside.

805
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:26,416
I've always wanted to see where people
go when they want to...

806
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,570
Hm. How typical of nice girls.

807
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:30,616
Oh!

808
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:34,696
Charlie!

809
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:37,736
Charlie, we've been looking for you.

810
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:40,414
We've got to celebrate,
the war's almost over.

811
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,855
Whas to celebrate, for Goïs sakes?

812
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:46,694
We haven't found any treasure
and it looks like I'm losing my partner.

813
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:50,534
You're not so much losing a partner
as gaining one.

814
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:53,214
- You're going to join my act?
- No.

815
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:55,939
I hope that you both will join mine.

816
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:58,170
Please, let me explain.

817
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:02,014
Switzerland ain't just cuckoo clocks,
chocolates and watches.

818
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:06,059
I have there treasures I have looted...
erm, collected from all over Europe.

819
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:11,260
My plan is, we will make flawless copies
which you can sell in America.

820
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:13,217
Even sell some back to the Greeks.

821
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,894
I could start a mail order,
sell to muzeums,

822
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:19,689
- Dottie could do door-to-door soliciting.
- Oh, I'd like that.

823
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:23,455
We will not be selling to muzeums,
les stick to my area.

824
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:26,577
Being an antiquarian, this is something...

825
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:30,699
You can handle the muzeums.
We should incorporate - give us a name.

826
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:32,293
Golden Oldies.

827
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:35,929
Chutzpah Incorporated!
What a team!

828
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:00,700
Gentlemen, over here,
let me show you.

829
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:04,659
This building was the headquarters
of the Greek Resistance.

830
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:08,255
It is now a state muzeum,
housing Byzantine treasures,

831
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:11,730
including the famous plates
from Mount Athena.

832
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:16,177
I've been living that fever,
through knocking at the door

833
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:20,731
Cos being a fever
don't make your body rock

834
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:23,937
I'm only asking one thing I deserve

835
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:29,372
And I want to place an order
on the future in reserve

836
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:33,612
Got a feeling to guide me
and I've only just begun

837
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:37,932
And a notion inside me
that the best is yet to come

838
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:42,616
And it keeps me reaching out
for something more

839
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:47,057
Cos I never had the chance
to think it possible before

840
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:51,452
Keep tomorrow for me,
don't let anyone use it

841
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:55,852
Keep tomorrow for me, now
I've come this far I don't wanna lose it

842
01:52:55,940 --> 01:53:00,058
Keep tomorrow for me,
don't let anyone use it

843
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,416
Keep tomorrow for me

844
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:08,619
My beggin' and stealin'
has come to nothing more

845
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:12,932
Than hopin' and dreamin',
don't you open up the door

846
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:17,138
And you're in for
something better than today

847
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:21,896
Just give me the beginning,
in the end I'll find a way

848
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:26,178
Keep tomorrow for me,
don't let anyone use it

849
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:30,776
Keep tomorrow for me,
now I've got this far I don't wanna lose it

850
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:34,978
Keep tomorrow for me,
don't let anyone use it

851
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:39,497
Keep tomorrow for me,
now I've got this far, so don't refuse it

852
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:54,452
Keep tomorrow for me,
don't let anyone use it

853
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:58,931
Time is all I need
I don't wanna lose it

854
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:03,298
Keep tomorrow for me,
don't let anyone use it

855
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:07,737
Time is all I need
Please don't lose it, use it

856
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:12,052
Keep tomorrow for me
Don't let anyone use it

857
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:16,258
Time is all I need

858
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:20,618
Keep some time for me

859
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:25,251
Time is all I need
Please don't lose it, use it

860
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:29,492
Keep tomorrow for me,
don't let anyone use it

861
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:32,458
Time is all I need
