<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>Medieval England...</i>

2
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,317
<i>the early years of</i>
<i>the reign of Edward I.</i>

3
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,878
<i>A troubled land in those days.</i>

4
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:34,256
<i>Her great feudal fortress castles,</i>
<i>born in that uneasy time...</i>

5
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,318
<i>stand now as stately</i>
<i>monuments...</i>

6
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,696
<i>to how unyielding were the enmities</i>
<i>that caused their building.</i>

7
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,167
<i>More than two centuries</i>
<i>have passed...</i>

8
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,727
<i>since the Norman conquests have</i>
<i>brought the last infusion...</i>

9
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,138
<i>of what was one day</i>
<i>to be English blood.</i>

10
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,872
<i>Yet, the bitterness between the Norman</i>
<i>conqueror and the Saxon conquered...</i>

11
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,278
<i>lay still unhealed.</i>

12
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,045
<i>It had separated the neighboring</i>
<i>great houses of Bulaire and Gurnie...</i>

13
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,078
<i>by far more than the scant</i>
<i>few miles that lay between them...</i>

14
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,556
<i>in those days that began</i>
<i>with the death of Rauf...</i>

15
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,423
<i>Earl of Lessford and</i>
<i>Lord of the House of Bulaire.</i>

16
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,805
You there.
What's your business?

17
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,979
- I was sent for by the earl's man of law.
- And what might your name be?

18
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,647
They call me
Walter of Gurnie.

19
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,157
I should have known
you're his son by the look of you.

20
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,059
You had a good man to father you,
I'll say that. You'd best come this way.

21
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,792
Saxons of any breeding won't find much
welcome here now that he's dead.

22
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,652
- What do you want here?
- He wants to see Simeon Bautrie,
the earl's man of law.

23
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,255
Oh, so you're the lad
from Oxford.

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,563
- I'll take you to him.
- Thank you.

25
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,448
- Walter, my lad.
- Simeon, I'm glad to see you.

26
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,509
You've grown.
Thickened out anyway.

27
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,987
Did you find
your grandfather well?

28
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,787
Well, l- I didn't stop at home.
I came straight here.

29
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,056
I thought-Well, I was afraid
that he'd forbid my coming.

30
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,689
My grandfather never
stopped hating him.

31
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,995
You'll not have eaten then.
Sit down, lad.

32
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,534
I keep bite and sup handy.

33
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,211
Fall to, lad.

34
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,641
Tell me, young scholar...

35
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,481
what have they taught you
in this Oxford of yours?

36
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,421
Oh, numbers.
Ma- Many things.

37
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,482
- I can read as well as you, Simeon Bautrie.
- And write too?

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,825
Yes, I know a little Latin
and some Greek too.

39
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,864
And French too, perhaps?

40
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,595
No, I'll not learn
that Norman tongue.

41
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,639
Let them learn ours.
Two hundred years since they came here...

42
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,697
and their court still
clatters with that foreign-

43
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,972
Easy, lad, easy.
You forget this is a Norman house now.

44
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,036
Do you want to
get us hanged?

45
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,916
Simeon, tell me,
why did you send for me?

46
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,889
Reason enough.

47
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,017
- You're in the will.
- By name?

48
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,254
I mean, he acknowledges me
as his son?

49
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,025
<i>Yes, he says you're his son.</i>
<i>I knew he would.</i>

50
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,625
But don't count on
too much from it, lad.

51
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,897
Tell me.
You knew my father well.

52
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,372
He loved my mother,
didn't he...

53
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,001
more than he loved
that Norman... woman he married.

54
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,705
<i>He loved me too.</i>

55
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,748
<i>I know he did.</i>

56
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,283
I remember once
when I was little...

57
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,979
I admired a pair of boots
he was wearing.

58
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,319
They were black
with gold leopards.

59
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,915
He said that he'd
get me a pair like them.

60
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:31,726
He never did, of course,
but I knew that he wanted to.

61
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,062
If he could have done
what he wanted, he-

62
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,363
he would have made
things different, wouldn't he?

63
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,165
Your father, Walter,
bore a stout lance in battle...

64
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,210
and he was gentle enough
of heart, there's truth in that.

65
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,612
Yes, I think he loved
your mother best...

66
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,946
and that you were
the son he wanted.

67
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,387
<i>But it may be too that he's done you more harm</i>
<i>than good by mentioning you in the will.</i>

68
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,324
There's no love here for Saxons
of any breeding now.

69
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,520
They gave their allegiance
to your father...

70
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,029
and well that Norman wife
of his knows it.

71
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,532
She's already thrown a score of them
into her dungeons...

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,125
hostages against trouble.

73
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,229
So I'll not have you come charging into
this business with all your emotion.

74
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,874
You can be present at
the reading of the will...

75
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,674
but only if you'll stand
well back in the hall.

76
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,274
If my lady sees you,
she'll do you harm if she can.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,052
<i>[Fanfare]</i>

78
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,301
- [Speaking French]
<i>- Oui.</i>

79
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,365
Begin.

80
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,839
In the name of God, amen.

81
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,884
This is the last will
and testament of Rauf...

82
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,852
Earl of Lessford
and Lord of Bulaire.

83
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:06,187
First, he gives and bequeaths his soul
unto the Lord God Almighty...

84
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,625
<i>and to all saints...</i>

85
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,357
<i>and his body to be buried</i>
<i>in the chapel of his castle at Bulaire.</i>

86
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,267
Item- He wills that
all such manors, lands and rents...

87
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:21,363
which were descended unto him by way
of inheritance, shall remain unto his heirs...

88
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,037
namely, Eleanor, his wife,
and Edmond, his lawful son.

89
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,342
Item.

90
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,780
He wishes to acknowledge
a known truth...

91
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,217
that he had another son,
who, for lack of his name...

92
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,848
is known as Walter of Gurnie,
and for whom he had affection.

93
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,793
To this said Walter of Gurnie...

94
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,093
he bequeaths his black boots of
Spanish leather with the golden leopards.

95
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,232
<i>Further,</i>
<i>and of most importance...</i>

96
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,932
it was his wish to will this son's life
into the service of our king...

97
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:59,410
<i>confident that he will make a fitting and</i>
<i>honorable place for himself in such service.</i>

98
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,681
Item-

99
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,446
<i>He gives and bequeaths to</i>
<i>the high altar of the chapel of Bulaire...</i>

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,217
<i>- the chalice-</i>
- There's no more in that will
concerns that nameless lout!

101
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,123
<i>- Let him take what was given him and leave.</i>
- Why should I?

102
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,289
Shall I crawl out on my hands and knees
because some Norman tells me to?

103
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:22,494
- Watch your Saxon tongue!
- And I'll serve no Norman king either.

104
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:26,197
I'm a Saxon. He had no right
to hand me over to a Norman tyrant.

105
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,072
- This is treason!
<i>- [Lady] And may you hang for it, Walter of Gurnie.</i>

106
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,305
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>By your leave, my Lady of Lessford.</i>

107
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,359
There's something here, I think,
that touches on a matter...

108
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,091
with which I am
very much concerned.

109
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,292
I should like to
question this young man.

110
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,235
You have no need to ask,
Your Majesty.

111
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,036
It would seem that the prospect
of entering the service of your king...

112
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,077
does not altogether
fill you with pleasure.

113
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,774
I'd like you to tell me freely
why this feeling is so bitter.

114
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,288
You may speak up, lad.

115
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,323
As you see, I came
this way while hunting...

116
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,418
<i>so let us say that for the moment</i>
<i>I am not your king...</i>

117
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,157
so we talk as
between two men.

118
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,426
There'll be no penalty
for the truth.

119
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,025
You're a Norman,
that's reason enough.

120
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,430
But it's not.

121
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,373
It's over 200 years
since the conquest.

122
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,603
Surely Saxons and Normans
should have found a way...

123
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,340
to live together
in that time.

124
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,383
Your father did not feel as you do.
He was a Saxon.

125
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,044
He knew that if this
bitterness was not healed...

126
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,748
it would be
the worse for England.

127
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,623
This is a problem that must be
dealt with one way or another.

128
00:09:54,694 --> 00:10:00,326
Tell me, when you refuse me
your loyalty because I am a Norman...

129
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,960
have you not considered that
I have no choice in the same matter...

130
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,869
that I must be king
for Norman and Saxon alike...

131
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,874
whether I like it or not?

132
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,673
Do you Saxons not owe something
besides hatred to the same cause?

133
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,340
What do I owe the Normans?

134
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:21,011
We lived at Gurnie when the Normans
were no better than wolves of the sea...

135
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,318
and it was a better Gurnie then
before they came to rob us.

136
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,824
She's a Norman...

137
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,190
and she robbed me
of my name.

138
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,822
She robbed my father of the chance
he had to have a Saxon son.

139
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,332
<i>It was her doing</i>
<i>that I never knew my father.</i>

140
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:40,065
He willed me into the service of a Norman,
but he can't make me serve them.

141
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,473
I have heard nothing in this
that touches my problem.

142
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:53,075
This seems to me to be a matter
between a son and his father.

143
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,782
I would not like the lad to be hanged
merely because he has been hurt.

144
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,417
It is our wish
that he be let go free.

145
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,804
Do you suppose this house could give
a traveler rest? Let's say if he was born here?

146
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,279
- Master Walter!
- It's good to see you, old Will.

147
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,816
You've grown, and well too.

148
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,875
Come in. Come in.

149
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,055
You're home again.

150
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,860
I hoped you'd come by suppertime.
I laid a place for you.

151
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,761
You knew I'd left Oxford then.

152
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,699
Aye. We have a guest who came
from Oxford. About you, I think.

153
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,534
- Who's that?
- Bacon. Friar Roger Bacon.

154
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,438
Oh. Friar Bacon. He was
a teacher of mine. I'd like to see him.

155
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,305
I'll tell him, Master Walter.

156
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,640
Will-

157
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,909
Uh, what did he say when
he found I'd left school?

158
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,511
- My grandfather, I mean.
- You know him, Master Walter.

159
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,113
He never says anything.
He just looks.

160
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,126
- Well, how is he?
- You saw that pile of iron in the moat?

161
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,128
Yes, I did.
I meant to ask.

162
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,187
We have gone into trade.

163
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,790
A belted knight
of Gurnie in trade...

164
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,200
dealing in armorers'
iron and swine.

165
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,570
And just like he does everything else,
not a word to anyone.

166
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:00,442
One morning, the horses were gone
and the swine came.

167
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,447
And then the iron.

168
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,279
And when they wanted to know
where he wanted it put...

169
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,583
he told me to have them
put it in front of the gate.

170
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:14,183
They didn't know what he meant,
but I did.

171
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,664
If we were going to be in trade,
put it out where the world could see.

172
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,860
If there's a price
to pay, pay it.

173
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,996
And when he walks by it...

174
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,404
he looks neither to
the right nor to the left.

175
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,537
I'll call Friar Bacon,
Master Walter.

176
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,917
<i>[Man] I trust this reception</i>
<i>is not planned for me.</i>

177
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,625
Oh, Friar Bacon.
L- I couldn't help doing that.

178
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,101
When I was very little,
that was my measure of growing up...

179
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,138
when I could wield
that sword.

180
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,140
I could wish I'd given you
so much of feeling about your books.

181
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,870
Perhaps you would not have
given them up so readily.

182
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,846
Oh.

183
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,913
What happened
concerning your father?

184
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,923
Was it all you hoped for?

185
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:55,293
No.

186
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,259
Will you return with me then?

187
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:05,334
I, uh-
I don't know.

188
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,398
Never mind.

189
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:10,502
There'll be time to talk of that later,
perhaps with your grandfather.

190
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,412
[Chuckles]
That won't be so easy.

191
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:16,951
Why not?

192
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,388
Well, you see, my grandfather and I only
talk to each other through someone else.

193
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,856
It, uh- It makes
discussion difficult.

194
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:25,894
You mean
you don't speak?

195
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:29,021
Generally we talk
through old Wilderkin...

196
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:32,897
but I should warn you that it may
very well be you if no one else is here.

197
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:36,570
No, you mustn't think
that he's unkind.

198
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:40,574
It- It's just an oath he took after
the great quarrel with my father.

199
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:48,549
Well, perhaps I ought to tell you
a little bit about it to make it clear.

200
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:53,145
My father was betrothed to my mother
before he went on his crusade...

201
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:58,454
but when he was returning, he fell ill
of a wound-very nearly died of it.

202
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:01,758
They cared for him
in a Norman house.

203
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,731
Well, after a long time,
when he was well again...

204
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,759
he married the daughter of that house,
the one who had nursed him.

205
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,328
It was out of
gratitude, I suppose.

206
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,431
He didn't know that I'd been born.
How could he?

207
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:17,968
As soon as he found out,
he came straight here.

208
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:23,245
And then there was a quarrel,
so bitter that I can still remember it.

209
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,651
My grandfather swore that he would
never speak to my father again...

210
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:29,247
nor to anyone else
of his blood.

211
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:31,849
That included me,
of course...

212
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,895
although he didn't
mean it that way.

213
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:38,626
I've often thought that
he was sorry for it afterward.

214
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,897
But my grandfather, you will find,
is a man who does not take an oath...

215
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,303
- nor anything else, lightly.
- I see.

216
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:48,639
I, uh- I think that
I should tell you something-

217
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,942
<i>[Man] Wilderkin! Is our supper ready,</i>
<i>and is our guest here, Wilderkin?</i>

218
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:55,108
<i>[Will]</i>
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

219
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:10,290
Uh, Wilderkin, tell my grandson
that I'm pleased to see him...

220
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:12,697
and to see that he's grown
the shoulders of a man.

221
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:16,226
- My lord wishes me to tell you-
- Tell my grandfather, Wilderkin...

222
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:18,966
that I'm glad to see him,
and that I hope the shoulders...

223
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,168
are broad enough to be
of service to him soon.

224
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:25,202
- My lord, Master Walter says-
- Well spoken, Wilderkin. Well spoken.

225
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,373
<i>Ah, and our guest!</i>

226
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,816
- Welcome to our table, Friar Bacon.
- Thank you, my lord.

227
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:37,057
Ah. Pig.

228
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:41,357
Not the best of meats to offer a guest,
Friar, but it's stout and it fills the belly.

229
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,662
Uh, Wilderkin, ask my grandson what
he thinks about our venture into trade...

230
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:48,032
- a course of which no doubt he's aware.
- My lord asks-

231
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,162
Tell my grandfather,
Wilderkin...

232
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:53,366
that I think he has adopted
a courageous and knightly course.

233
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:55,933
Ah, well spoken again,
Wilderkin.

234
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:58,206
Well, now let's fall to.

235
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,874
<i>Talk comes easier</i>
<i>on a full belly.</i>

236
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,110
<i>The Normans haven't</i>
<i>changed that yet.</i>

237
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,053
A pair of boots...

238
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,249
and the privilege of wearing
an iron collar for a Norman king.

239
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:11,554
- Ask him what else he expects.
- My lord says-

240
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:15,722
Tell my grandfather l- I had hoped
there would be some help for Gurnie in it.

241
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:18,766
Tell my grandson
he was a fool to think it.

242
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:21,462
Tell him he can help Gurnie best
by returning to his studies...

243
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:24,369
where he can learn to be
a better man than his father was.

244
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:29,103
Tell my grandfather that...
I'm not going to return to school.

245
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:33,876
Tell him that I think my place is here
with him at Gurnie, if there is to be a Gurnie.

246
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:37,112
Ask him by what right he thinks
at all in such a matter.

247
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:40,018
Ask him who's the best judge
of what he'll need...

248
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:42,454
to hold this house
against the Norman thieves.

249
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:44,958
- Ask him if he thinks l-
- Tell my grandson that-

250
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:48,052
- My lord, will you permit me?
- On whose side will you speak?

251
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,429
- On no one's side, my lord.
- I warn you, Friar...

252
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,196
that if what you say
is not on my side...

253
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:57,500
I shall pay but little heed
to the fact that you're my guest.

254
00:18:57,572 --> 00:19:00,507
I journeyed here, my lord,
to urge the same point as you-

255
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:03,339
the return of
your grandson to Oxford.

256
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:07,279
<i>Few scholars have come to me with such</i>
<i>an aptitude for learning as your grandson.</i>

257
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:10,944
It would be a personal
and bitter failure to me if I lost him.

258
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,419
What good is it?

259
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:16,082
How can you fight the Normans
with-with books?

260
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:20,219
Walter, if I was young and had
no sure place to put my life...

261
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:24,095
I could think of nothing better than
to give it for the search for knowledge.

262
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:28,159
The strength in knowledge, it can
win victories that the sword cannot.

263
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:33,606
<i>There's so much we need to know</i>
<i>and so few people to seek it out.</i>

264
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:36,143
England will need it someday.

265
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:40,545
<i>She needs it now.</i>
<i>Just a handful of books in all our land.</i>

266
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:45,712
Painfully written,
painfully read by only too few.

267
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:50,588
There is in every land knowledge
that we need to add to our store.

268
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:55,289
I've heard of Cathay, a country they say
where no Englishman has been...

269
00:19:55,363 --> 00:20:00,858
<i>an old country,</i>
<i>fabulously rich not only with gold...</i>

270
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:03,734
<i>but with the knowledge</i>
<i>of many ages.</i>

271
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,932
I've heard that they know
of a substance...

272
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,498
which when it touches a spark...

273
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:11,569
disappears in
a blinding flash of light.

274
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:16,640
That they have instruments which help them
to travel by sea and land without becoming lost.

275
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,686
Do you believe
those old wives' tales?

276
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:20,721
Yes, and more.

277
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:23,758
Walter, what a challenge
when you're young.

278
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:26,316
What better thing can a man
ask of life than that?

279
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,598
I don't know...

280
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,363
but it's a- it's
a soft blow to strike.

281
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:37,735
If I'm gonna leave
him here alone, l-

282
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:40,104
I want to strike
a better blow than that.

283
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,479
Let him go.
He has been hurt.

284
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:49,415
He'll think better
after he has slept.

285
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,311
<i>[Clattering]</i>

286
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:08,262
You! What are you
doing down there?

287
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:30,891
- What do you want here?
- Who are you?

288
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,122
- It's the grandson of the old lord.
- Nobility then. I don't like it.

289
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:37,494
Tris. Tris Griffen. You're no thief.
What are you doing here?

290
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:41,235
- Go on. Let him up.
- But he's Saxon.

291
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:48,767
Tris, we've played
too often on these walls.

292
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:52,108
I know you and- and you, Dicken.
You're not thieves.

293
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,047
- What are you doing here?
- Well, it's bad enough.

294
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:58,142
We had no trouble with Bulaire castle
while your father was alive.

295
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:02,315
But now the Norman woman has thrown
a dozen Saxons in her dungeons as hostages.

296
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,156
- Yes, I saw them.
- Well, we're gonna get them out.

297
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:08,752
Out of Bulaire? How?

298
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,128
Well, don't think too little
of the strength of this.

299
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,133
She has a beautiful
long arm.

300
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,692
Oh, but not against
stone walls, Tris.

301
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,601
I told you
he'd be on their side.

302
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:20,106
Who said I was on
Norman side in anything?

303
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:24,168
- Who's your leader?
- Well, I am, in a manner of speaking.

304
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,645
- Well, we all are.
- Well, you-

305
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,309
You might stand a chance
if you could get inside the gate.

306
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:31,545
What's your plan?

307
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,179
Well, that's the hard part,
the thinking.

308
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:38,021
- Well, maybe I can get you in.
- Look, this isn't your quarrel, Walter.

309
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:40,926
Give me a few men. I may be able
to get them in the miller's gate.

310
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,792
I know the signal.

311
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:45,890
If we can get the drawbridge down
from the inside, you might stand a chance.

312
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:51,530
If we can't, you're still on the outside safe,
to hunt me down if I've betrayed you.

313
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:55,337
All right, you can go with us.
Come on. Get your weapons.

Stay where you are!

320
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:22,045
Any man coming out of that door
will meet a shaft coming in.

You down there,
whoever you are.

324
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,269
I must ask you
to disperse...

325
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:45,039

to submit it in the proper fashion.

[Tris]
We'll present it now.

We'll give you five minutes
to yield the prisoners.

328
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:53,176
For every minute more, we'll hang a man
of the household from the battlements.

329
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:56,547
Wait there.

330
00:25:57,692 --> 00:26:00,957
Well, that's the end
of your problem.

His new Norman master
has no belly for fighting.

332

I'll go see about
my problem now.

333

deadly harm comes of this night's work.

Well, we can't stay here.

You're lucky.
I have my grandfather to tell, and tonight.

349
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:03,509
Why did you want the boots
so much, Walter?

350
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:09,252
Well, they were all I had on the side
of sayin' my father loved me...

they'll keep my feet warm.

It's a letter,
Tris, from my father.

Ask my grandson when it was the part of
Gurnie men to run from Norman trouble.

Tell my grandfather, please,

And... he said you were
to have this standing cup.

Good luck,

- To Cathay?
- Well, where's that?

like it there.

Now, don't talk
too lightly about it, Tris.

the chances are all you'll get out of it...

is that in the end you'll be hung
by a Mongol instead of a Norman.

Well, if it comes to that, I'd sooner give

We're looking for the biggest merchant with
the biggest caravan to the farthest places.

Look, we've come a long way
to see your master himself.

It will be difficult.
I don't want to disturb him without a reason.

of my day must show me a profit.

It is a caravan of gifts...

We understand that
small caravans...

440

too often disappear
in the wild country they pass through.

00:34:58,842 --> 00:35:01,936

<i>of everything-</i>

444
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:04,981
<i>silks, jewels, women.</i>

445
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:08,507
I had to find 81 of the most
beautiful women of this land.

446
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,511
<i>And because it is</i>
<i>all for the Khan...</i>

447
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:17,959
it will travel under the protection of the army
of the great General Bayan himself.

448
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:20,758
<i>Bayan of the Hundred Eyes.</i>

449
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,664
<i>Does that sound</i>
<i>safe enough for you?</i>

450
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:25,827
A caravan of nothing but gifts.
It's strange. L-

451
00:35:25,903 --> 00:35:28,565
It isn't
strange at all.

452
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,732
You see, the Khan begins
his war against China-

453
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:32,742
Cathay, as you call it.

454
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,907
<i>He will have the spoils of the oldest</i>
<i>and richest country in the world.</i>

455
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:40,177
I will be his friend.

456
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,017
I will help him to, uh,
dispose of the wealth of ages.

457
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:48,923
<i>I will be the richest</i>
<i>merchant in the world.</i>

458
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:52,451
Well, young travelers,
are you prepared to, uh, pay well...

459
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,497
to travel in such company?

460
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:58,331
Well, we thought we might put ourselves
to hire as guards for such a caravan.

461
00:35:58,402 --> 00:36:01,235
Christian guards.
It would invite attack.

462
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,603
<i>Is that the best you can offer?</i>

463
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:07,701
You've wasted my time.
I warned you. Search them!

464
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:12,010
If there is nothing of value, cut off
their hair to make a pillow for my feet.

465
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,346
<i>I will have something</i>
<i>for my trouble.</i>

466
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:16,352
I have already
made such a search.

467
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,354
There was only
this of value.

468
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:20,356
I kept it
for just such a moment.

469
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:27,520
It's not much profit,
but it is enough to save my honor.

470
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:29,862
- Throw them out.
- Oh, yes, sir.

471
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:32,367
This way.

472
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,210
What did you do that for?
Why did you lie to him?

473
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:53,416
Sometimes they call me
"the bird who feathers his nest"...

474
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,254
because they say that
I steal from everyone.

475
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:58,317
<i>It is not true, of course.</i>

476
00:36:58,395 --> 00:37:03,492
But let us say that I'm in a position to take
a smaller profit than my kindly master.

477
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:07,503
<i>I go with the caravan.</i>
<i>I'm in charge of it.</i>

478
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,903
Perhaps I will take you.

479
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:13,067
<i>It will cost me nothing</i>
<i>to provide you with equipment.</i>

480
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:17,273
It will be his.
How much gold do you have?

481
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:19,508
There isn't much left...

482
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:22,677
and you're not exactly giving us
good reason to trust you with what there is.

483
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:25,916
Who is this Bayan general,
the one with all the eyes?

484
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:30,221
Oh, he's the greatest
soldier in the world.

485
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:35,789
The great Khan borrowed him
from Persia for his war against China.

486
00:37:35,866 --> 00:37:38,494
He will conquer
the world one day.

487
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:40,366
And, uh,
where is he camped now?

488
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,928
Three days from here
with his army.

489
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:48,807
I wouldn't consider offering
your services to Bayan.

490
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:52,280
His men are trained
to love killing.

491
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,513
They would enjoy cutting
a Christian's throat.

492
00:37:56,587 --> 00:38:02,184
I'm afraid you have no choice
but to... deal with me.

493
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:04,318
How much gold have you?

<i>What kind of a country</i>
<i>is this?</i>

495
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:21,202
- Good.
- How soon can we get started?

496
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:24,714
Two dawns from now.
You're lucky you found me.

they're for you
for the journey.

500
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:09,251
This one they call her "the singer"
because she makes horrible noise all the time.

501
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:14,127
<i>The other will bite you</i>
<i>whenever she cannot kick you.</i>

502
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:17,031
You'll have to find a place
to sleep in your tent...

503
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,091
<i>where it doesn't leak.</i>

Good day,
young sirs.

509
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:37,251
I'll toss you whether
you get sung to or bitten.

510
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:41,620
- Wet or dry?
- Wet.

511
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:44,320
It's dry.

512
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:29,494
Mahmoud, I don't know why
they didn't build me to fit a camel better...

513
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:31,632
or build a camel
to fit me better.

514
00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:37,707
Well, I found out some of it
from our nest-feathering friend.

515
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:40,341
That mighty general is camped
right over that hill with his army.

516
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:42,749
We're camped here
so that wild crew of his...

517
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:45,151
doesn't get a look at
the women we brought with us.

518
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:47,782
We're not traveling today
because he's holding games...

519
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:50,156
some sort of tournament
on the plain.

520
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:53,890
And I also found out another thing-
why they call him Bayan of the Hundred Eyes.

521
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:56,797
- Thought maybe he had that many.
- No, they say he can see everything.

522
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:00,428
Tomorrow he'll know how
every man performs in the games.

523
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:03,996
- There'll be all kinds- horsemanship, archery, all-
- Archery?

524
00:41:04,074 --> 00:41:07,669
- Oh, that interests you, huh?
- Yes, it's a little cold for fine work...

525
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:09,678
though the light
should be good.

526
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:12,078
- What are their bows like, do you think?
- Bone and steel.

527
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:14,743
- The finest in the world.
- Ah, wait till they hear Sarah talk.

528
00:41:14,818 --> 00:41:17,378
But they won't,
my impulsive friend.

529
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:19,684
The last thing we want
to do is to attract attention...

530
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:21,690
so you leave Sarah
right where she is.

531
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:24,158
It wouldn't hurt
just to take her along.

532
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:27,685
- Well, you won't take her off your shoulder.
- She wouldn't make any trouble.

00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,481
I asked the bowman.
With accuracy?

592
00:48:01,554 --> 00:48:03,988
I've seen him bring down
three ducks with four shafts.

593
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:07,458
It's light. Light and strong.
Comes from the wood or the way it's made?

594
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:09,495
From both, my lord.
From the yew, and from skill...

595
00:48:09,562 --> 00:48:12,224
- in shaping the bow to take advantage of the grain.
- What's it called?

596
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:14,323
- It's called a longbow.
- He calls it Sarah, my lord.

597
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,335
- Sarah. That's a woman's name.
- Yes, my lord.

598
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:19,667
You'll have reason to love your Sarah
even more after today.

599
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:22,037
She... saved
your skull, you know.

600
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:25,475
- Yes, I've just been telling him about that, my lord.
- The shaft should pierce armor.

601
00:48:25,545 --> 00:48:27,979
- Yes.
- You've seen it tried? You.

602
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:31,278
Steel-tipped, it will
pierce anything, my lord.

603
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:33,842
I think this is the finest
weapon in the world.

604
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,718
She can reach out that long arm
of hers and meet the enemy...

605
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,349
before he can get close enough
to strike a blow against her.

606
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:41,859
With her, an English yeoman
stands as tall as any man.

607
00:48:41,928 --> 00:48:43,862
He's the greatest soldier
in the world.

608
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,694
I take it
you're English then?

609
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:49,064
Yes, my lord.

610
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:54,637
I've seen you English hacking away
at the Saracens in your crusades.

611
00:48:54,707 --> 00:48:57,267
Each man his own fortress
in his great armor...

612
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,277
so weighed down
he can't move.

613
00:48:59,345 --> 00:49:03,247
It's very stupid.
But this... is not so stupid.

614
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,284
We'll talk about it.
Do you play chess?

615
00:49:05,351 --> 00:49:07,717
- Sorry, no.
- Oh, I do, my lord.

616
00:49:07,787 --> 00:49:10,756
- How well?
- Well, four moves soundly.

617
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,485
Four sound moves is more
than any man in this army can do.

618
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,857
- We'll play in my tent tonight.
- With pleasure, my lord.

619
00:49:15,928 --> 00:49:17,919
Oh, how do we
find your tent?

620
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:21,763
Scholar, if any man in my army
can't tell you where my tent is...

621
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,894
our poetic young bowman
can use him as a target.

622
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:37,509
Maybe your Sarah did us a good turn
after all. Come on. We'll take her home.

623
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,881
You can make up
a sonnet to her as we go.

624
00:49:39,952 --> 00:49:42,614
- Oh, go swallow your tongue.
- Why, Tris!

625
00:49:48,227 --> 00:49:50,218
Over there.

626
00:49:51,264 --> 00:49:53,198
Let me see
that bow of yours.

627
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,962
You'll find
the game's ready.

628
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:59,004
I always, uh,
make the first move.

629
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:07,335
About this, uh-
this bow of yours.

630
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:10,075
- Could you make another one like it?
<i>- If I had the wood.</i>

631
00:50:10,149 --> 00:50:13,607
A sound game. Thoughtful.
It lies in wait for the attack.

632
00:50:13,686 --> 00:50:15,916
It won't win against
an attack, of course.

633
00:50:15,988 --> 00:50:19,185
It's just the kind of game I want,
young scholar. Pawn to king's bishop four.

634
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:21,192
Play it.

635
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,093
- Can you train men in the use of such a bow?
- Yes, my lord.

636
00:50:24,163 --> 00:50:26,097
Then the right wood
can be found.

637
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:28,099
Uh, as a scholar...

638
00:50:30,136 --> 00:50:32,070
you permit no weakness
in the attack.

639
00:50:32,138 --> 00:50:34,299
Good. As a scholar
you know something of your country's...

640
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:36,034
military theory
and practice.

641
00:50:36,108 --> 00:50:38,099
I have a-

642
00:50:38,177 --> 00:50:40,338
I have a certain knowledge
of those things, my lord.

643
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,506
War is my trade.

644
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,812
<i>At least I'm good enough to know</i>
<i>no war was ever won...</i>

645
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:47,114
<i>that was fought in the same way</i>
<i>as the war before it.</i>

646
00:50:47,186 --> 00:50:50,280
Why, I've made a weapon of speed.
Speed.

647
00:50:50,356 --> 00:50:53,382
<i>No man should wear armor so heavy</i>
<i>that he can't move quickly...</i>

648
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:55,927
to save himself or to pursue
his enemy and destroy him.

649
00:50:55,995 --> 00:50:59,328
That's why I like this bow of yours.
It's- It's light.

650
00:50:59,398 --> 00:51:02,890
It can reach out to the enemy
and put an end to him.

651
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:05,267
That's the only way you can
ever sleep soundly, you know...

652
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:08,364
when your enemy's
sleep is eternal.

653
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:11,808
Forgive me for distracting you
from your game, but I'm curious.

654
00:51:11,878 --> 00:51:14,506
Why are you young travelers
in this far place?

655
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,344
We came in search of
adventure into this new land.

656
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:20,544
We heard of the greatness of my lord Bayan
and came in search of him.

657
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:24,255
If that's flattery,
I don't like it.

658
00:51:24,323 --> 00:51:27,156
We had to find someplace
to put our lives.

659
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:29,717
Don't you plan to return
to your own country?

660
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,093
We have no country, my lord.

661
00:51:32,164 --> 00:51:34,928
That's a strange thing
for an Englishman to say.

662
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:37,094
Why? A woman?

663
00:51:38,671 --> 00:51:41,196
- No, more than that.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

664
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:43,708
Bowman and scholar,
both without a country.

665
00:51:43,776 --> 00:51:46,244
It's just possible you two
could be of service to me.

666
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,371
I'll think about it.

667
00:51:50,616 --> 00:51:52,550
It's your move.

668
00:52:10,236 --> 00:52:12,170
[Foreign Language]

669
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:14,433
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?

670
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,441
It is bad, very bad.

671
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:20,001
- What is?
- This old tent...

672
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,946
these old blankets
and one little servant.

673
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,576
<i>Steal food, cook-</i>
<i>it's too much.</i>

674
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:28,984
- You need second boy.
- How do we get him...

675
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,920
by the great
kindness of your heart?

676
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,117
Maybe I get him for you.

677
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,286
Maybe some dislike Christians.
I do not.

678
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,796
All right, out with it.
What are you trying to say?

679
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:44,131
Never talk important matters
where you cannot see who listens.

680
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:04,579
I have a message for you,
from the Black Rose.

681
00:53:04,657 --> 00:53:06,591
And who would
the Black Rose be?

682
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:08,786
She is the sister
of my kindly master.

683
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:11,694
- Well, that's fine.
- She wishes to escape.

684
00:53:11,764 --> 00:53:13,698
She say she is
going to England...

685
00:53:13,766 --> 00:53:16,200
and that all
Englishmen are gallant...

686
00:53:16,268 --> 00:53:18,828
and you will be glad to help
one of your own blood.

687
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,896
- Are you trying to say that she's English?
- There is some report...

688
00:53:21,974 --> 00:53:25,432
that her father was English,
a crusader taken prisoner.

689
00:53:25,511 --> 00:53:28,480
- Well, why is she called the Black Rose?
- That's the name...

690
00:53:28,547 --> 00:53:33,075
they've given the clove,
the most precious of the spices.

691
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:37,680
I don't like it, a girl of English blood
being sent to these heathen.

692
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:41,921
- Oh, we don't know she's English.
- She has relatives in Maratha.

693
00:53:41,994 --> 00:53:44,394
The only thing she needs
is to reach them.

694
00:53:44,463 --> 00:53:47,296
I see. And what are you
doing this for?

695
00:53:47,366 --> 00:53:50,893
I'm not troubled that
the lady's in distress.

696
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:53,962
She has
a very large sapphire.

697
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,406
What does she expect us to do
in the middle of Bayan's army?

698
00:53:56,475 --> 00:54:00,809
The bird who feathers his nest
never leaves things to chance.

699
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,182
I have a very well-made plan in which
I will do all that's dangerous, if you're afraid.

700
00:54:06,252 --> 00:54:08,482
Afraid? We'd do more for
English blood any day...

701
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:10,488
than you'd do for
an overgrown sapphire.

702
00:54:10,556 --> 00:54:15,323
Oh, that's good.
I'll tell that to the Black Rose.

703
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:33,539
Master, the strange one's
here again.

704
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:35,546
Oh?

705
00:54:39,752 --> 00:54:41,811
This is
your second boy.

706
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:44,515
- His name is Mahomet.
- Well, you can take him back.

707
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:47,218
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Very strange.

708
00:54:47,293 --> 00:54:50,990
Last night, the camels
run through the tents of the women.

709
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:54,760
They have to take a time for the search.
The Black Rose is missing.

710
00:55:04,203 --> 00:55:06,797
Go on. Get her out of here.
They'll find her when they search...

711
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:10,205
and they'll drag us over the hill like
they did that camel driver the other day.

712
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:14,769
- Go on, Mahmoud. Go on. Back to your work.
- Yes, master.

713
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:20,308
I'm no fool. Yesterday, I bought
a slave boy for the Englishman.

714
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:22,615
That boy disappeared...

715
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:25,020
and everybody thinks
this is the boy.

716
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,853
<i>And I did something else.</i>

717
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:30,486
One of the camels
that run away was saddled.

718
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:33,656
When they find that camel,
they will believe...

719
00:55:33,732 --> 00:55:36,997
the Black Rose
tried to escape on it and was hurt.

720
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:39,867
- It's very simple.
- Well, get her out of here!

721
00:55:39,938 --> 00:55:43,374
Perhaps I will call out
that I've found her here now.

722
00:55:43,442 --> 00:55:46,138
<i>No one would believe</i>
<i>your story.</i>

723
00:55:46,211 --> 00:55:50,841
<i>Perhaps you would like</i>
<i>being staked out for vultures.</i>

724
00:55:53,385 --> 00:55:57,412
- Well, I found the camels.
- And we have a new second boy too.

725
00:55:57,489 --> 00:56:01,323
He's all yours, Tris.
He has beautiful, big eyes.

726
00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:09,030
Very simple, young sirs.
She will do whatever you tell her to do.

727
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:11,194
You understand that?

728
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:14,262
You know what'll happen to all of us
unless you do exactly as you're told?

729
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:16,534
Oh, yes, most kind grandeur.

730
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:21,375
Oh. Oh, where did-
Never mind. Mahmoud!

731
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:24,438
- I wish to say that I am very grateful.
- Yes, I know all about that.

732
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:26,507
This new second boy
will stay here to help you...

733
00:56:26,585 --> 00:56:28,746
but you'll still be first boy,
you understand?

734
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,721
Master, we don't need second boy.
This boy no good.

735
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,985
- I can do everything.
- You'll do as you're told.

736
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:37,051
Get him out of here.
Get him some breakfast, and put him to work.

737
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:39,757
Yes, master.
Second boy will eat when I'm through.

738
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:41,560
<i>Now, go!</i>

739
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:48,899
Oh, it's not gonna work.
What are we gonna do now?

740
00:56:50,442 --> 00:56:53,206
I guess the only thing to do
is just to sit here...

741
00:56:53,278 --> 00:56:55,212
and wait for
the ax to fall.

742
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,716
<i>- [Hoofbeats]</i>
<i>- [Shouting, Whooping]</i>

743
00:57:05,824 --> 00:57:07,758
Well, the old pirate's right
after all.

744
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:10,590
And there's that
saddled camel.

745
00:57:20,205 --> 00:57:22,605
<i>He's the offspring</i>
<i>of a sore-eyed camel driver!</i>

746
00:57:22,674 --> 00:57:25,507
<i>- He wanted to beat me!</i>
- Quiet! Get her into the tent.

747
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:30,771
- Do you know who she is?
- Mahmoud has struck a great lady.

748
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:32,942
- Mahmoud should be whipped.
- Never mind about that!

749
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:35,612
Do you know we'll all be killed
if anybody finds out she's here?

750
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:38,019
I will tell no one.
Mahmoud would die first.

751
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,116
I want you to get into that tent and pretend
as though nothing had happened.

752
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:47,962
- Can we trust him?
- We'll either trust him or slit his throat.

753
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:49,967
- I am glad he knows.
- Why?

754
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:52,560
Because now there is
no more need of pretending...

755
00:57:52,638 --> 00:57:56,039
and I can be in the tent with you
the way that it was meant to be.

756
00:57:56,108 --> 00:57:58,303
- Now, look, Mahomet-
- I suppose he told you...

757
00:57:58,377 --> 00:58:00,845
that I am English and that
I am to go to England.

758
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:04,313
- Yes, we know that.
- There is so much I must know about England...

759
00:58:04,383 --> 00:58:06,715
if I am to go
to live there.

760
00:58:06,785 --> 00:58:10,915
Do you think they would like me?
What is it like there?

761
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,356
Are all the people
as beautiful as you are?

762
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,655
Ask him.
He's the beautiful one.

763
00:58:17,729 --> 00:58:21,722
Oh, no! I think you are
much more beautiful than he is.

764
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,064
<i>You look just</i>
<i>as I've always known-</i>

765
00:58:24,136 --> 00:58:26,934
Mahomet, there's no time for talking.
This is very serious for all of us.

766
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:29,132
Put that turban back on,
button yourself up...

767
00:58:29,207 --> 00:58:31,141
and get ready to play
second boy again, understand?

768
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:33,143
- Yes, but l-
- I don't wanna talk about it.

769
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:35,145
<i>- Just do as I say, and quickly too.</i>
- Yes, most kind, but-

770
00:58:35,213 --> 00:58:37,272
All right, then do it!

771
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:57,818
I never saw anyone look less like
young gallants going off on a great adventure.

772
00:59:57,896 --> 01:00:01,423
- How does the lady feel about it?
- The lady, my lord?

773
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,333
Hmm. What's her name?
Sarah?

774
01:00:04,403 --> 01:00:08,169
Oh. I think she'll like
what lies ahead, my lord.

775
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,142
We're making some kinsmen for your Sarah
so she won't be lonely.

776
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,735
I've given orders to find
that wood of yours, bowman.

777
01:00:14,813 --> 01:00:16,906
There's something to
interest you, young scholar.

778
01:00:16,982 --> 01:00:19,314
With that
direction-finding chariot...

779
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:21,443
<i>we can strike straight through</i>
<i>any storm without getting lost.</i>

780
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,182
<i>We can leave the trade route</i>
<i>and travel across country.</i>

781
01:00:24,256 --> 01:00:26,190
- Was that made in China?
- Mmm.

782
01:00:26,258 --> 01:00:28,852
- Well, how does it work?
- Inside, there's a box.

783
01:00:28,927 --> 01:00:30,986
In the box there's a needle that points
always in the same direction.

784
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:33,462
What makes the needle
behave in such a manner?

785
01:00:33,532 --> 01:00:35,762
Well, if you don't know, scholar,
I won't worry about it.

786
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:38,302
I need the time to make war.
Look.

787
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:42,534
- There's India. We'll conquer that someday.
- India?

788
01:00:42,607 --> 01:00:45,041
We're done with China,
we'll have to conquer something.

789
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:49,012
<i>No doubt your scholar's mind</i>
<i>inquires into a plan for India.</i>

790
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,344
But China first!

791
01:01:17,943 --> 01:01:20,104
<i>[Animal Howling]</i>

792
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:25,841
It looks like they believed
his trick with the camel.

793
01:01:25,917 --> 01:01:27,942
The men they left to search
have joined us here.

794
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:32,217
There doesn't seem to be any sign
of a search of the camp. Where is she?

795
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:35,987
In there, out of sight.

796
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:43,193
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking this ugly stain off my face.

797
01:01:43,268 --> 01:01:45,736
- Put it right back on again.
- No. It's very ugly.

798
01:01:45,804 --> 01:01:49,706
And I mustn't be ugly
when I eat here in the tent with you.

799
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:54,040
- Mahomet-
- Maryam. There.

800
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:57,104
- Where did you get that?
- I needed it.

801
01:01:57,182 --> 01:02:00,242
And I got some clothes too
to wear when I eat here.

802
01:02:01,686 --> 01:02:03,677
Mahmoud!

803
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:08,016
- Yes, master.
- Mahmoud, did you steal these things?

804
01:02:08,093 --> 01:02:10,027
Mahmoud see, Mahmoud take.

805
01:02:10,095 --> 01:02:12,359
Suppose they searched this camp?
There's to be no more stealing.

806
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,898
All the women steal
from each other.

807
01:02:14,966 --> 01:02:17,366
- There's to be no more stealing.
- But if great lady wishes-

808
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:20,404
You'll do as I say no matter
what great lady wishes.

809
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:23,238
<i>- Maryam, I want you to put</i>
<i>that stain back on your face.</i>
- No.

810
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:26,272
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean no!

811
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:28,832
<i>There is no danger.</i>

812
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,970
If they were going to search the camp,
they would have done this by now.

813
01:02:32,046 --> 01:02:35,982
And no one will come near our tent
because we are Christians.

814
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:39,110
Everything is happening
the way it said in the miracle...

815
01:02:39,187 --> 01:02:44,056
only I must take the stain off my face
so the rest of the miracle can happen.

816
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,355
Miracle? What miracle?

817
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:49,658
I've been very ashamed because
I almost stopped believing in it...

818
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:52,825
when I found out
I was going to be sent to the Khan.

819
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:56,200
But when I saw you, I knew
it must have been working all the time.

820
01:02:56,271 --> 01:02:59,468
Uh, Maryam, I've never been
part of a miracle before...

821
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,406
so I don't know much
about it.

822
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:04,877
But what makes you think a miracle is
telling you to take that stain off your face?

823
01:03:04,946 --> 01:03:10,077
I've known about it ever since
I was a little girl. My father told me.

824
01:03:10,151 --> 01:03:12,483
I wanted very much
to go to England...

825
01:03:12,554 --> 01:03:15,250
because I thought
how wonderful it must be in a country...

826
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:18,918
where all the people were like him-
gentle and very tall and beautiful.

827
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:23,157
<i>He wanted to take me there,</i>
<i>but he couldn't because he was a prisoner.</i>

828
01:03:23,231 --> 01:03:28,396
So he said that we should have
to ask God to help me.

829
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:32,269
And maybe if we believed very hard,
there would be a miracle.

830
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,332
Oh, I like the God that
would do miracles like that.

831
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:38,345
So I believed very hard.

832
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:42,247
My father gave me this before they
killed him to help me with the miracle.

833
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:46,348
He said that someday,
a tall, beautiful Englishman...

834
01:03:46,421 --> 01:03:48,355
would come riding
over a hill...

835
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:51,051
and would think that I was very beautiful,
so he would help me.

836
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:54,788
<i>So when I saw you, I knew</i>
<i>God sent you to be part of the miracle.</i>

837
01:03:54,862 --> 01:03:58,593
Only how are you to see
that I am beautiful...

838
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:00,793
if I've got
that ugly stain on the face?

839
01:04:02,604 --> 01:04:04,538
That's very nice, Maryam,
and l-

840
01:04:04,606 --> 01:04:07,006
I wish it was a miracle,
because that's just what we need.

841
01:04:07,075 --> 01:04:10,067
But I'm afraid we can't count on it
because miracles just don't happen like that.

842
01:04:10,144 --> 01:04:12,305
Oh, but it has happened.

843
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:15,406
Tall, young Englishmen
do not ride across this country.

844
01:04:15,483 --> 01:04:19,146
But you were here just when
the miracle needed you.

845
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,316
So I know the rest of it will happen
just the way my father said the miracle.

846
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:26,758
Well, miracle or no miracle,
I'm not gonna get us hanged.

847
01:04:26,828 --> 01:04:30,059
Now, unless you do as I say, I'm gonna
send you back to the women's tent.

848
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:33,760
No. We'll do
just as the miracle said...

849
01:04:33,835 --> 01:04:37,100
or- or I will tell them
I'm here.

850
01:04:37,171 --> 01:04:40,197
All they will do to me is send me back
with the other women.

851
01:04:40,274 --> 01:04:42,742
But they won't be so kind
with you, I think.

852
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:50,307
Now I think you will look
to see if you think I am beautiful.

853
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:56,350
All right, all right.
You're beautiful.

854
01:04:56,424 --> 01:05:00,485
Now I think you will help me
to take this ugly stain where I cannot see?

855
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:48,334
<i>Don't tell me you've never</i>
<i>seen men hanged before.</i>

856
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:51,640
- What did they do, my lord?
- See that pass there?

857
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:54,876
<i>We ride through there today. We could</i>
<i>fight our way through, but we haven't time.</i>

858
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:56,917
So this is a warning.
If there's trouble...

859
01:05:56,984 --> 01:05:59,578
I have twice as many
of these fellows as prisoners.

860
01:05:59,654 --> 01:06:01,212
<i>- I'll hang them too.</i>
- I see.

861
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:04,053
You see,
but you don't like it, do you?

862
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,650
I forget your
English gallantry in war.

863
01:06:06,728 --> 01:06:10,596
I suppose different people
believe in different things, my lord.

864
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:13,657
Well, not such foolish things,
Englishman.

865
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:17,728
No. What I can't touch
doesn't exist.

866
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,503
You conquer,
or somebody conquers you.

867
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:26,411
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

868
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:28,415
I thank you for
reminding me, my lord.

869
01:06:28,483 --> 01:06:31,350
I like you, scholar.

870
01:06:31,419 --> 01:06:34,047
I like the way you speak your mind.
I must reward you.

871
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:51,037
You do not feel like talking,
Walter?

872
01:06:51,105 --> 01:06:53,039
No.

873
01:06:54,442 --> 01:06:57,240
That's too bad.

874
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:59,472
I hoped you would begin
telling me about England.

875
01:07:01,182 --> 01:07:04,447
What is it like there?
Is it very beautiful?

876
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:08,580
- I don't know.
- Do you think it's beautiful, Tris?

877
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:11,887
Yes, I think
it's beautiful.

878
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:15,690
The most beautiful place
in the world.

879
01:07:15,763 --> 01:07:18,493
It smells good.

880
01:07:18,566 --> 01:07:22,263
The forest,
the English soil.

881
01:07:22,336 --> 01:07:26,397
It's clean.
The rain washes it that way, I suppose.

882
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:29,932
It's so clean,
it's fragrant with it.

883
01:07:30,011 --> 01:07:32,172
I think it's the most
beautiful country in the world.

884
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:37,012
Why, Tris!

885
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:40,781
Well, I wish I was there,
that's all.

886
01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:43,517
Bayan was right about
that poet business.

887
01:07:43,591 --> 01:07:45,957
And a homesick poet too.

888
01:07:46,027 --> 01:07:49,121
Oh, it must be very beautiful
if he feels so about it.

889
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:50,858
He only remembers the good part.

890
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:53,765
I like him
for feeling like that.

891
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:55,962
Don't you ever feel
like that about it?

892
01:07:57,405 --> 01:08:01,398
That's the way
my father felt about it.

893
01:08:01,475 --> 01:08:05,809
Oh, I think you feel so too,
only you don't want to say so.

894
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,873
Tell her about
the Normans, Tris.

895
01:08:11,419 --> 01:08:14,946
I don't like you
to feel like that, Walter.

896
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:19,721
I think to feel like that,
you must have loved it very much...

897
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:23,389
and- and been hurt...
by something.

898
01:08:27,668 --> 01:08:30,831
- I don't like her.
- Who?

899
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,000
The girl in England
you loved that hurt you.

900
01:08:35,076 --> 01:08:37,636
There wasn't any girl.

901
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:43,277
Oh, you'll be glad-

902
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:45,649
You'll be glad to go back
in England, won't you, Walter?

903
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,814
That's one thing I won't have to worry about.
I won't be going back.

904
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,983
But where will you go then?

905
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:53,492
You'd better ask
Bayan general about that.

906
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:56,826
I'll be with him, with the victor,
if our luck holds out.

907
01:09:01,135 --> 01:09:03,330
- What's the matter, Mahomet?
- [Sniffling]

908
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:11,836
Mahomet, what's the matter?

909
01:09:13,748 --> 01:09:17,775
It hurts to think of England
if you will not be there.

910
01:09:17,852 --> 01:09:19,786
It's not the way
the miracle said.

911
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:24,424
Oh, l-
I'm sorry, Maryam.

912
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:27,757
I forgot about that miracle.

913
01:09:27,828 --> 01:09:29,796
But it'll be all right,
you know.

914
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:34,426
You'll find yourself a hill and another
Englishman to come riding over it.

915
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:37,437
He'll be a Norman probably,
but that won't make any difference.

916
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:41,168
We'll make as much of your miracle
come true as we can.

917
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:44,803
- It'll be all right.
- I wish you didn't feel so.

918
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:47,712
I will be Mahomet again
if it will make you feel not like that.

919
01:09:47,782 --> 01:09:49,716
I don't mind the stain.

920
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:51,718
It-

921
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:53,720
Well, why don't you
say something?

922
01:09:53,788 --> 01:09:56,655
You're the one that started all this,
you and that poetry.

923
01:09:56,724 --> 01:09:58,783
You're the one
that's in the miracle...

924
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:01,453
and you look
very beautiful there too.

925
01:10:32,193 --> 01:10:35,856
We've come a long way
to see that, scholar.

926
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,660
Cathay.

927
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:40,997
There it lies.

928
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:46,201
Play the real game with me, scholar,
and the best game.

929
01:10:46,273 --> 01:10:49,538
<i>Play as you've never played.</i>
<i>Think. I have a new plan for war.</i>

930
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:53,046
Find a flaw in it if you can.
It's a plan for China.

931
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:57,710
Many men have tried to conquer China,
but she swallowed them all.

932
01:10:57,785 --> 01:10:59,650
Strike a blow into
a great, soft pillow.

933
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,382
The pillow gives with the blow,
and the force is spent.

934
01:11:02,456 --> 01:11:05,186
You can't conquer
geography.

935
01:11:05,259 --> 01:11:07,557
Occupy a country,
and what happens?

936
01:11:07,628 --> 01:11:10,722
Your soldiers become jailers, and you're
that much weaker. What do we do?

937
01:11:10,798 --> 01:11:12,789
<i>Think, scholar.</i>
<i>We don't occupy at all.</i>

938
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:16,496
We strike and strike on.
Destroy.

939
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,731
Strike at the very heart
of China- Kinsai.

940
01:11:18,806 --> 01:11:21,206
Destroy the government.
Destroy the will to resist.

941
01:11:21,275 --> 01:11:23,300
- But suppose they get behind you, my lord?
- Let them.

942
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:25,572
It's for that I have made
a new weapon of speed.

943
01:11:25,646 --> 01:11:27,580
- But your lines of supply-
- We won't use any.

944
01:11:27,648 --> 01:11:29,582
We'll live off the country.
Think deep, scholar.

945
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:32,710
There's supposed to be a weakness
in every plan. Find this one.

946
01:11:32,787 --> 01:11:35,585
My lord has spoken often
about winning battles and losing wars.

947
01:11:35,656 --> 01:11:37,590
Even if you win,
each battle will weaken you.

948
01:11:37,658 --> 01:11:39,922
We'll only fight one battle here
when the Khan's army arrives.

949
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:42,724
Then we'll wait for the news
of our victory to spread.

950
01:11:42,797 --> 01:11:47,097
If we lose, well, we'll be
very little men as history is written.

951
01:11:47,168 --> 01:11:50,103
But, scholar,
if we gain China...

952
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:52,105
gain its strength
and wisdom-

953
01:11:52,173 --> 01:11:54,971
They have an iron tube there that shoots fire.
It's just a toy now...

954
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:59,206
but someday it may help us
to crumble the walls of Rome.

955
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,441
- Rome?
- Mmm.

956
01:12:01,515 --> 01:12:04,279
- Rome is a long way, my lord.
- So is England.

957
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,013
Not too long. How would you like
to visit your island again, Englishman?

958
01:12:07,088 --> 01:12:11,252
<i>This time as a conqueror to do</i>
<i>what you like with those that conquer you.</i>

959
01:12:12,827 --> 01:12:15,387
Think deep, scholar.

960
01:12:15,463 --> 01:12:18,523
We may win the greatest game
in the world.

961
01:12:24,918 --> 01:12:28,217
What's the matter, bowman?
Can't you sleep?

962
01:12:28,288 --> 01:12:31,189
I was thinking of-
Do you think he can do it?

963
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,028
I don't know.

964
01:12:35,095 --> 01:12:37,029
I think maybe he can.

965
01:12:37,097 --> 01:12:40,225
I was thinking,
the way he talked...

966
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:44,430
maybe we were fighting
on the wrong side.

967
01:12:47,441 --> 01:12:50,467
- Tris?
- Yeah?

968
01:12:50,544 --> 01:12:53,206
- Do you wanna turn back?
- Well, what do you want to do?

969
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,511
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

970
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:59,143
I'm sick of lost causes.

971
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:02,780
If he conquers the world, at least
we'll be on the winning side for a change.

972
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:04,790
What's wrong with
going back with him?

973
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:08,726
It's the only way you'll ever see that England
of yours that smells so good to you.

974
01:13:08,796 --> 01:13:12,425
- Yes, I know.
- We'd better get some sleep, bowman.

975
01:13:29,516 --> 01:13:32,076
[Shouting, Whooping]

976
01:14:02,049 --> 01:14:05,041
Tris, you haven't got
yourself hurt, have you?

977
01:14:05,118 --> 01:14:09,987
- No, I'm all right, I suppose.
- I saw you at the beginning.

978
01:14:10,057 --> 01:14:12,617
You and your bowmen
against those fire tubes.

979
01:14:12,693 --> 01:14:14,991
They sounded like
the anger of God.

980
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:17,053
I think perhaps
they were.

981
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:21,089
They're killing every man,
woman and child in the district.

982
01:14:21,168 --> 01:14:23,329
Like harvesters going
through a field of grain.

983
01:14:23,403 --> 01:14:26,167
They'd pull their heads forward
by the hair for the ax.

984
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:30,677
Not one left alive,
like harvesters cutting wheat.

985
01:14:30,744 --> 01:14:33,941
<i>What's the matter, Englishman?</i>

986
01:14:35,182 --> 01:14:37,912
We won today.

987
01:14:37,985 --> 01:14:39,919
But you have no joy in the victory.
Why?

988
01:14:39,987 --> 01:14:42,114
<i>It's the business of battle.</i>

989
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:45,989
It's very simple.
Kill the enemy.

990
01:14:46,059 --> 01:14:48,527
A soldier must like to kill.

991
01:14:48,595 --> 01:14:52,156
No man can follow me
who hasn't the belly for that.

992
01:14:52,232 --> 01:14:55,463
Go back to your tent now
and think about it.

993
01:14:55,536 --> 01:14:58,801
Think hard.
You have a choice to make.

994
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:05,473
That's right. We'd better
go to our tents.

995
01:15:05,546 --> 01:15:07,980
It was a victory,
wasn't it?

996
01:15:08,048 --> 01:15:09,982
The bows did well.
The general was pleased.

997
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:13,315
Let's go to our tents
and think about it, Walter.

998
01:15:16,089 --> 01:15:18,683
[Chattering, Shouting]

999
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:33,636
I was afraid for you.
I was very afraid for both of you.

1000
01:15:33,707 --> 01:15:36,198
Nothing could happen
to us.

1001
01:15:36,276 --> 01:15:38,710
It isn't the way it went
in the miracle, don't you remember?

1002
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:41,577
- I know, but-
- Isn't that so, Tris?

1003
01:15:41,648 --> 01:15:43,582
Yes, that's so.

1004
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:46,983
- I will be glad when-
- That's right, Maryam.

1005
01:15:47,054 --> 01:15:48,988
You mustn't forget
the miracle.

1006
01:15:49,056 --> 01:15:51,923
A tall, young Englishman
came riding over a hill, didn't he?

1007
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:55,393
A knight.
A knight in shining armor.

1008
01:15:55,462 --> 01:15:59,421
You should have seen him today, Maryam.
He looked almost like a knight.

1009
01:15:59,499 --> 01:16:02,935
<i>An English knight.</i>
<i>A sword and shining armor.</i>

1010
01:16:03,003 --> 01:16:06,939
You'd have been proud of him.
He looked more beautiful than ever.

1011
01:16:07,007 --> 01:16:10,670
Except those knightly vows. You didn't think
to say those over, did you, Walter?

1012
01:16:10,744 --> 01:16:13,611
- What's the matter with you?
- Your father would have been proud of you.

1013
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,046
Your grandfather too.
He was a credit to them.

1014
01:16:16,116 --> 01:16:19,779
The way you looked anyway.
Why don't you ever wear your father's boots?

1015
01:16:19,853 --> 01:16:22,344
You'd look well in them.
Where are they?

1016
01:16:22,422 --> 01:16:24,754
I'll get them for you,
and you can put them on.

1017
01:16:24,825 --> 01:16:27,692
There was a letter too.
You'd better read it again. What did it say?

1018
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:30,855
- Something about honor.
- Tris!

1019
01:16:30,931 --> 01:16:33,866
Keep your hands off-

1020
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,925
Tris!

1021
01:16:39,773 --> 01:16:41,798
- Walt, I'm sorry. L-
- What's the matter with you?

1022
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:45,504
I don't know you anymore, quarreling,
short-tempered all the time.

1023
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:47,513
You're not the Tris
I used to know.

1024
01:16:47,581 --> 01:16:49,606
- Let's get away from here, away from all-
- For what?

1025
01:16:49,683 --> 01:16:53,141
- I can't help them anymore.
- Well, if you don't like it,
you don't have to stay here.

1026
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:56,053
What do you want to do?
March with them on England?

1027
01:16:56,123 --> 01:16:58,057
I don't owe England anything.

1028
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:01,720
I think it's very foolish
to speak of that anymore.

1029
01:17:01,795 --> 01:17:03,592
I think you'd better
go back to England.

1030
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:07,327
<i>I don't think you have what he was</i>
<i>talking about- the belly for it.</i>

1031
01:17:07,401 --> 01:17:11,132
- I think you're the one-
- No, I'm all right. I'll stay right here.

1032
01:17:11,204 --> 01:17:15,197
<i>If you don't want the same thing,</i>
<i>it's all right too. I'll help you get out of here.</i>

1033
01:17:15,275 --> 01:17:19,177
And it all fits together nicely. You can take
her back with you wherever she wants to go.

1034
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:22,010
No. If you are going to stay here,
I will stay here too.

1035
01:17:22,082 --> 01:17:24,812
That's very nice, Maryam,
but it just doesn't work that way.

1036
01:17:24,885 --> 01:17:27,718
It's been all right up to here,
but it wouldn't be from now on.

1037
01:17:27,788 --> 01:17:31,519
<i>- Where are you going?</i>
- You can't just walk out of here without a plan.

1038
01:17:31,591 --> 01:17:34,059
I'm gonna find out
how to get to China.

1039
01:17:37,931 --> 01:17:41,958
What's the matter with him, Maryam?
What are we gonna do?

1040
01:17:42,035 --> 01:17:44,230
I don't know.

1041
01:17:44,304 --> 01:17:47,501
But he doesn't mean
everything he says.

1042
01:17:47,574 --> 01:17:51,908
I think he doesn't
really know what he wants.

1043
01:17:51,978 --> 01:17:55,209
But I don't know
what to do about it.

1044
01:17:55,282 --> 01:17:57,409
<i>[Animal Howling]</i>

1045
01:18:03,724 --> 01:18:07,455
Well, you're leaving just in time.
I found out that much.

1046
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:11,861
We move again tomorrow.
Bayan's army turns south into China...

1047
01:18:11,932 --> 01:18:15,231
and the caravan of gifts
goes north to the Khan.

1048
01:18:15,302 --> 01:18:18,465
That means that from now on,
we camp right in the middle of the army...

1049
01:18:18,538 --> 01:18:20,472
and you'd never have
a chance to get away.

1050
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:24,738
You'd better
try it tonight.

1051
01:18:24,811 --> 01:18:26,745
Yes, I guess
we'd better do that.

1052
01:18:26,813 --> 01:18:29,805
I'd head
straight south first.

1053
01:18:29,883 --> 01:18:32,113
Then cut across
to Kinsai.

1054
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:34,244
From there,
the river runs to the sea...

1055
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:37,757
and you might stand a chance
of getting back that way.

1056
01:18:37,824 --> 01:18:41,260
- Yes, we'd better do that too.
- Where's Maryam?

1057
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:44,697
In there.

1058
01:18:55,408 --> 01:18:59,504
We are going tonight, Walter.
I heard what you said to Tris.

1059
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:02,275
Yes.

1060
01:19:02,349 --> 01:19:04,874
You want to say
good-bye to me?

1061
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,454
Well, yes.

1062
01:19:08,522 --> 01:19:11,218
I'm glad it's hard
for you to say.

1063
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:17,363
Tris-Tris will take
good care of you, Maryam.

1064
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:20,763
You can depend on Tris.

1065
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:23,564
And l- I hope
you like England.

1066
01:19:25,806 --> 01:19:30,800
He'll feel much happier
when he can smell it again.

1067
01:19:30,877 --> 01:19:36,110
And, uh, tell him-
Oh, never mind.

1068
01:19:36,183 --> 01:19:39,414
You know, Walter,
I can go or I can stay.

1069
01:19:39,486 --> 01:19:42,319
Whatever you want.

1070
01:19:44,224 --> 01:19:48,251
No. No, you'll like
England better.

1071
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:59,837
I'll- I'll be up
with the column...

1072
01:19:59,906 --> 01:20:01,965
so they won't get suspicious
for some time.

1073
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:04,704
You'll need a good start.

1074
01:20:04,778 --> 01:20:07,611
Well, it looks as though
it might be a nice day for a ride.

1075
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:10,844
I'll go and see
about the horses.

1076
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:50,989
So it was you, Englishman.
Was it your curiosity as a scholar?

1077
01:20:51,057 --> 01:20:55,016
<i>- Or did you know you were</i>
<i>steering us off our course?</i>
- I knew, my lord.

1078
01:20:55,095 --> 01:20:59,429
Why? You realize the penalty
for such a thing.

1079
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:03,367
Why take such a risk to do me an ill turn?
Why do me an ill turn at all?

1080
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,866
Move the column south and east
for as far as we've gone off the trail.

1081
01:21:09,943 --> 01:21:12,468
When we camp tonight,
bring him to my tent.

1082
01:21:20,687 --> 01:21:23,679
Well, what's the matter?
We got away, didn't we?

1083
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:26,817
They can't track us
in the dark.

1084
01:21:26,893 --> 01:21:31,694
You've got a part of your miracle.
You're going to England.

1085
01:21:34,134 --> 01:21:37,433
I don't want
to go anymore there.

1086
01:21:37,504 --> 01:21:40,530
I know, Maryam.
I know.

1087
01:21:40,607 --> 01:21:44,634
So there was a woman in it.
I might have known.

1088
01:21:44,711 --> 01:21:48,807
A woman and a bowman
who didn't like war.

1089
01:21:48,882 --> 01:21:51,749
Why take such a risk for the girl?
You must love her very much.

1090
01:21:51,818 --> 01:21:55,754
- No, my lord.
- The gallantry again.

1091
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:58,824
I didn't mean
to be gallant.

1092
01:21:58,892 --> 01:22:01,725
If my lord Bayan hadn't been quite
so observant, I wouldn't be here now.

1093
01:22:01,795 --> 01:22:04,730
Why didn't you come to me about her?
I would have given her to you.

1094
01:22:04,798 --> 01:22:07,790
- What's one woman more or less?
- It didn't occur to me, my lord.

1095
01:22:07,867 --> 01:22:11,359
No, of course not.
It would have spoiled the gallantry.

1096
01:22:11,438 --> 01:22:14,464
Well, it's worth something...

1097
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:17,874
to be willing to die
for something.

1098
01:22:17,944 --> 01:22:22,677
There's a way you may have a chance for
your life. A few men have come through it.

1099
01:22:22,749 --> 01:22:27,049
I'll send you to the rope walk
in the morning. Good night, scholar.

1100
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,179
Good night, my lord.

1101
01:22:47,407 --> 01:22:50,103
Now, you understand,
Englishman.

1102
01:22:50,176 --> 01:22:52,838
As long as your feet touch the rope,
no one can strike you...

1103
01:22:52,912 --> 01:22:55,039
except the two men
with the pig bladders.

1104
01:22:55,115 --> 01:22:57,811
They can hit only
below the line.

1105
01:22:57,884 --> 01:22:59,875
Now begin.

1106
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:14,526
[Chattering, Shouting]

1107
01:24:22,435 --> 01:24:26,030
Let him go!
Let him go!

1108
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:30,770
Take him to his tent.

1109
01:25:04,878 --> 01:25:09,144
You are very tough
for an Englishman.

1110
01:25:09,215 --> 01:25:11,046
<i>Come in.</i>

1111
01:25:20,326 --> 01:25:23,295
Well, my lord, am I a-
a prisoner or what?

1112
01:25:23,363 --> 01:25:28,062
You paid for what you did.
Your back should tell you that.

1113
01:25:29,802 --> 01:25:32,828
But... I'd like to be
doing something, my lord.

1114
01:25:32,906 --> 01:25:35,841
You miss the bowman,
don't you?

1115
01:25:35,909 --> 01:25:41,677
I have a mission of some importance
for you when you're ready for it.

1116
01:25:41,748 --> 01:25:44,080
- I'll take it now, my lord.
- Hear it first, scholar.

1117
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:47,142
- You saw our Chinese visitors?
- They brought this tribute to avoid battle.

1118
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:51,088
It won't be so easy nearer Kinsai,
but our war has been going well.

1119
01:25:51,157 --> 01:25:54,354
We only had to fight once.
Since you've been sick, we've taken four cities.

1120
01:25:54,427 --> 01:25:56,418
Perhaps I should
remain in bed.

1121
01:25:56,496 --> 01:25:58,623
Mmm.
Now Kinsai.

1122
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:01,098
There are those in the government
who want peace...

1123
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:03,226
but they haven't much influence
with the old empress.

1124
01:26:03,303 --> 01:26:07,501
But, scholar, suppose I sent you
to Kinsai as a traveler of rank...

1125
01:26:07,574 --> 01:26:11,032
a student from another land, and you
told what you've seen of our strength.

1126
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:13,044
Yes, but will
the empress hear <i>me?</i>

1127
01:26:13,112 --> 01:26:17,139
Find the heads of the peace party.
They'll see that you're heard.

1128
01:26:17,217 --> 01:26:20,618
You can refuse to go if you want to.
The risk is great enough.

1129
01:26:20,687 --> 01:26:23,815
No, I'll go, my lord.

1130
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:26,552
It's settled then.

1131
01:26:26,626 --> 01:26:28,958
Scholar?

1132
01:26:29,028 --> 01:26:34,364
Maybe I'm a little sorry
I thought of this journey for you.

1133
01:26:34,434 --> 01:26:36,368
But be sure of this.
If they kill you...

1134
01:26:36,436 --> 01:26:39,963
I'll kill 10 of them
for every hair on your head.

1135
01:26:42,775 --> 01:26:47,235
I have a strange feeling
I may not see you again.

1136
01:26:47,313 --> 01:26:49,338
If that's true,
I'll miss you, scholar.

1137
01:26:53,659 --> 01:26:55,524
I don't miss many men.

1138
01:26:55,595 --> 01:26:59,929
Well, for your sake,
I'll try not to get killed.

1139
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:35,163
You will come with me.

1140
01:27:35,234 --> 01:27:37,600
- What is it? L-
- We have been waiting for you.

1141
01:27:59,892 --> 01:28:03,794
- What is this place?
- It is the palace of her unlimited magnificence.

1142
01:28:03,863 --> 01:28:08,698
Her kindly splendor,
the dowager empress of China.

1143
01:28:08,768 --> 01:28:11,396
Well, what am I doing here?

1144
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:15,668
I do not know entirely.
You will wait.

1145
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:19,735
<i>[Laughter]</i>

1146
01:28:26,786 --> 01:28:29,584
Bow.
Bow profusely.

1147
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:55,246
Now are there two of them,
or are there not?

1148
01:28:55,314 --> 01:28:57,714
Are their skins fair,
or have you no eyes?

1149
01:28:57,783 --> 01:28:59,717
Is there such a prophecy,
or is there not?

1150
01:28:59,785 --> 01:29:02,117
<i>Is it your duty to know</i>
<i>such things, or is it not?</i>

1151
01:29:02,188 --> 01:29:04,122
Do not argue with me
more in this matter.

1152
01:29:19,038 --> 01:29:22,906
- You will come with me.
- But what is this all about- a prophecy?

1153
01:29:22,975 --> 01:29:26,240
No harm will come to you.
Far from it.

1154
01:29:26,312 --> 01:29:28,303
Please.

1155
01:29:36,689 --> 01:29:38,680
This is your house.

1156
01:29:40,059 --> 01:29:42,687
It has been prepared for you.

1157
01:30:14,026 --> 01:30:16,324
Tris!

1158
01:30:16,395 --> 01:30:19,922
Tris!

1159
01:30:22,101 --> 01:30:24,365
What are you doing here?

1160
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:34,711
- Where's Maryam?
- Well, she must be a captive here somewhere.

1161
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:37,010
Now I just left her
to find out about a boat.

1162
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:40,018
- But how did you get here?
- Well, I didn't even get to the river.

1163
01:30:40,086 --> 01:30:43,954
Some people laid hold of me before
I got started. Don't you know where we are?

1164
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:48,687
We're somewhere in the palace,
because I was just talking to the emp-

1165
01:30:48,761 --> 01:30:51,457
Oh, wait a minute.
Maybe we'll find out now.

1166
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:09,838
Good day, young sirs.
I have come to welcome you.

1167
01:31:09,915 --> 01:31:12,884
We'd be very grateful
if you'd tell us what all this means.

1168
01:31:12,952 --> 01:31:15,750
It means that the prophecy
of the two birds...

1169
01:31:15,821 --> 01:31:18,016
of the fairest color
has been fulfilled.

1170
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:21,025
It is a very old one.

1171
01:31:21,093 --> 01:31:23,721
It's said that
in a time of great peril...

1172
01:31:23,796 --> 01:31:27,732
two birds of the fairest coloring
would appear...

1173
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,861
and the clouds of disaster
would roll away like the mist.

1174
01:31:31,937 --> 01:31:36,101
<i>We were urging</i>
<i>Her Royal Grandeur to think of peace.</i>

1175
01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:39,372
She was about to yield...

1176
01:31:39,445 --> 01:31:42,881
when word was brought her
of a stranger...

1177
01:31:42,948 --> 01:31:45,781
who was very fair of skin.

1178
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:48,979
Such a thing
has never been seen here...

1179
01:31:49,054 --> 01:31:51,818
and it reminded her
of the prophecy.

1180
01:31:51,891 --> 01:31:57,193
She said that there must be another,
so guards were posted.

1181
01:31:57,263 --> 01:31:59,754
<i>Now that you are both here...</i>

1182
01:31:59,832 --> 01:32:03,131
she is sure the prophecy
has been fulfilled...

1183
01:32:03,202 --> 01:32:05,136
and she will talk
no more of peace.

1184
01:32:05,204 --> 01:32:08,139
Hmm. Well, what are we
supposed to do here?

1185
01:32:08,207 --> 01:32:13,804
You will live here to ensure a continuance
of the good fortune you have brought.

1186
01:32:13,879 --> 01:32:15,813
For how long?

1187
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:19,749
I have told you,
this will be your home.

1188
01:32:19,819 --> 01:32:22,583
You mean
we're prisoners?

1189
01:32:22,655 --> 01:32:26,557
The chains that bind you are golden ones.
But I would not try to leave.

1190
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:29,287
Now, look.
I can't just sit here.

1191
01:32:29,361 --> 01:32:31,522
I came to talk
to the empress about peace.

1192
01:32:31,597 --> 01:32:35,829
- You tell her that I come
from the Bayan general himself.
<i>- It is too late.</i>

1193
01:32:35,901 --> 01:32:40,429
Her Excellent Kindness is certain
that you were sent by the gods.

1194
01:32:40,506 --> 01:32:43,998
<i>So now,</i>
<i>we have nothing to fear.</i>

1195
01:32:44,076 --> 01:32:49,139
The gifts are meant to fit
your station as gods.

1196
01:32:49,215 --> 01:32:52,742
<i>And I'm commanded to tell you</i>
<i>that if you have any desire...</i>

1197
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:55,184
you have only
to express the wish.

1198
01:32:57,022 --> 01:32:59,889
Well, if that's true,
there is something I'd like to have done.

1199
01:32:59,959 --> 01:33:02,723
There's a girl. She was with my friend
when he was taken prisoner.

1200
01:33:02,795 --> 01:33:05,992
If you know where she is,
I'd like to have her brought here at once.

1201
01:33:06,065 --> 01:33:09,831
I will send someone
to carry out your command.

1202
01:33:13,305 --> 01:33:16,001
This house is called...

1203
01:33:16,075 --> 01:33:19,169
the Abode of Everlasting Felicity.

1204
01:33:19,245 --> 01:33:23,045
I hope it does not fail
that name for the young gods...

1205
01:33:23,115 --> 01:33:27,677
and the young gods
do not fail their obligation...

1206
01:33:27,753 --> 01:33:31,985
to a people that
they have committed to war.

1207
01:33:37,463 --> 01:33:40,193
I think he'd like
that one better.

1208
01:33:44,069 --> 01:33:47,561
Oh. What's this?

1209
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,609
Oh, I think
he'd like that too.

1210
01:34:00,953 --> 01:34:03,513
<i>- [Maryam] Walter! Walter!</i>
- Not now, Maryam. Go away.

1211
01:34:03,589 --> 01:34:05,557
- But I have to show you.
<i>- What?</i>

1212
01:34:05,624 --> 01:34:08,491
Oh, look. It's beautiful.
They are made of silk to go on legs.

1213
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,585
- I'll see them later.
<i>- All right, Walter.</i>

1214
01:34:10,663 --> 01:34:13,154
But it's wonderful!

1215
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:15,200
Well, I don't see what
you're so particular about.

1216
01:34:15,267 --> 01:34:20,102
It took me a half an hour to convince
four girls they weren't going to bathe me.

1217
01:34:22,975 --> 01:34:24,943
<i>[Chuckling]</i>

1218
01:34:34,286 --> 01:34:37,414
- Where is he, Tris?
- I don't know.

1219
01:34:37,489 --> 01:34:41,721
He said he was going to find out if the gods
could still have anything they asked for.

1220
01:34:41,794 --> 01:34:44,957
Did he talk to you, Tris?
About himself, I mean.

1221
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:47,021
No, not exactly.

1222
01:34:48,634 --> 01:34:51,194
But I think he's sorry
he was angry with you.

1223
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,034
- So he ran away from the
Bayan general to be with you.
- No.

1224
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:57,542
Oh, you shouldn't say
such things.

1225
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:00,510
He's here,
and he's not angry anymore.

1226
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:02,877
And he comes
to go with us to England.

1227
01:35:02,948 --> 01:35:06,213
You really have learned
to believe hard enough, haven't you?

1228
01:35:06,285 --> 01:35:07,718
Yes.

1229
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:12,519
No. He came on a mission
of some kind for Bayan.

1230
01:35:12,591 --> 01:35:16,049
I didn't want to talk to him about it.
You know how he is.

1231
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:19,393
You can make him say things
he doesn't mean.

1232
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:22,832
There's one thing. He can't do anything
about it while we're shut in here.

1233
01:35:22,901 --> 01:35:26,359
And there's something else too.
It's about these.

1234
01:35:26,438 --> 01:35:29,965
He got very interested.
He said they weren't written by hand...

1235
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:31,976
and they're not
on sheepskin.

1236
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:36,344
It's something to do with soaking wood
and making this out of it.

1237
01:35:36,415 --> 01:35:39,213
And using these.

1238
01:35:40,919 --> 01:35:43,285
[Groans]
I tried to figure it out.

1239
01:35:43,355 --> 01:35:46,381
But he says he knows a man in England
who would gladly give his life...

1240
01:35:46,458 --> 01:35:49,120
to know of such a wonder,
so there must be something to it.

1241
01:35:49,194 --> 01:35:51,128
Only they don't know
about it over there.

1242
01:35:51,196 --> 01:35:54,029
- And then last night-
- Well, you could look a little happier, bowman...

1243
01:35:54,099 --> 01:35:56,465
sitting right in the middle
of the wealth of ages.

1244
01:35:56,535 --> 01:35:58,799
And here's some more for you.
You know, I was right.

1245
01:35:58,871 --> 01:36:01,897
I thought if they have books, they must
set down matters of science in them...

1246
01:36:01,974 --> 01:36:04,169
like the direction needle
and how to make the books.

1247
01:36:04,243 --> 01:36:07,644
<i>And look what else I have.</i>
<i>What do you think this is?</i>

1248
01:36:07,713 --> 01:36:09,977
This is that powder
that disappears in a flash of light.

1249
01:36:10,049 --> 01:36:12,950
It's what they use
in the fire tubes.

1250
01:36:13,018 --> 01:36:16,510
And if you-
If you close it in somewhere-

1251
01:36:20,225 --> 01:36:22,853
Now, look.

1252
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:46,377
You see that? Bayan was right.
There's the wealth of ages.

1253
01:36:46,452 --> 01:36:49,649
<i>He'd rather have that</i>
<i>than all the jewels in China.</i>

1254
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,087
Do you know what you just heard?

1255
01:36:52,157 --> 01:36:56,218
They don't know it yet, but you just heard
the walls of Rome begin to crumble.

1256
01:37:15,881 --> 01:37:19,840
The young gods already know, of course,
the news that we have just received.

1257
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:22,409
No. What news?

1258
01:37:22,488 --> 01:37:26,982
The armies of Bayan have taken
four cities since you came here.

1259
01:37:27,059 --> 01:37:30,426
One that resisted
exists no more.

1260
01:37:30,496 --> 01:37:33,260
Soon, that army
will be before our walls.

1261
01:37:33,332 --> 01:37:35,266
But the young gods
have done nothing.

1262
01:37:35,334 --> 01:37:38,360
Well, what can we do?

1263
01:37:38,437 --> 01:37:41,565
- It wasn't our idea to be gods.
- Nor was it mine.

1264
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:44,438
I'm in
an unfortunate position.

1265
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:48,105
If anything happens
to the young gods...

1266
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:52,708
I will die very quickly
for I am responsible for them.

1267
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:56,413
But I will also be among the first
whom Bayan will kill...

1268
01:37:56,488 --> 01:37:59,252
if the city resists.

1269
01:37:59,324 --> 01:38:02,293
So if I must die...

1270
01:38:02,361 --> 01:38:06,923
I will take the way that
will save the city from destruction.

1271
01:38:06,999 --> 01:38:11,333
You're trying to say, I imagine,
that if you have to die...

1272
01:38:11,403 --> 01:38:15,635
you prefer the choice that may convince
the empress that we're not gods.

1273
01:38:15,707 --> 01:38:18,073
Say if we were found
very mortally dead.

1274
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:21,169
That is possible.

1275
01:38:21,246 --> 01:38:26,013
If you have a better remedy,
I would find it quickly.

1276
01:39:00,752 --> 01:39:04,779
- Walter?
- Huh?

1277
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:06,847
What's the matter?

1278
01:39:06,925 --> 01:39:09,860
I couldn't sleep, Walter.
I want to talk. Please wake up.

1279
01:39:11,964 --> 01:39:14,364
Oh, can't it wait until morning?

1280
01:39:14,433 --> 01:39:17,425
No. I don't know
if I can say it now...

1281
01:39:17,502 --> 01:39:23,463
but if I think of it anymore
I won't be able to say it at all, I think.

1282
01:39:30,315 --> 01:39:33,648
All right.
What is it?

1283
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:38,782
If it's true what he said, that we shall
never leave here until- until we die...

1284
01:39:38,857 --> 01:39:42,527
then- then-

1285
01:39:42,661 --> 01:39:44,458
Go on.

1286
01:39:46,264 --> 01:39:49,290
I know it's true
that you do not love me...

1287
01:39:49,367 --> 01:39:51,460
but if this other
is also true...

1288
01:39:51,536 --> 01:39:54,403
then you can never find
anyone else to love.

1289
01:39:54,473 --> 01:39:57,408
- Isn't that so?
- Yes, l- I suppose so.

1290
01:39:57,476 --> 01:40:01,845
Well, then,
I was thinking.

1291
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:03,904
Since you cannot love
anyone else...

1292
01:40:03,982 --> 01:40:07,145
and since it may be
a very short time that we are here...

1293
01:40:07,219 --> 01:40:12,054
maybe you could pretend
for a little while that you loved me...

1294
01:40:12,123 --> 01:40:14,284
like it was in the miracle.

1295
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,051
Oh, I would like it
very much...

1296
01:40:18,129 --> 01:40:20,393
and you wouldn't have
to pretend very hard.

1297
01:40:20,465 --> 01:40:24,231
But if you did pretend for a while,
maybe it would get to be true...

1298
01:40:24,302 --> 01:40:26,668
since there is no one else.

1299
01:40:30,909 --> 01:40:32,843
You're strange.

1300
01:40:32,911 --> 01:40:38,713
But the house is called
the House of Everlasting Felicity...

1301
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:42,913
and I would rather be with you
even for a- for a little while...

1302
01:40:42,988 --> 01:40:45,183
and even if
you only pretended...

1303
01:40:45,257 --> 01:40:49,819
than to have all the rest
of my miracle or anything.

1304
01:40:53,431 --> 01:40:56,127
Maryam.

1305
01:40:59,204 --> 01:41:01,069
What's the matter?

1306
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:05,366
Wake up, Tris.
I think he loves me.

1307
01:41:05,443 --> 01:41:11,382
Oh, that. Why do you have to pick
on a time like this to find it out?

1308
01:41:12,751 --> 01:41:14,412
Maryam?

1309
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:16,215
- Maryam-
- Where have you been?

1310
01:41:16,288 --> 01:41:17,880
- Can you sew?
- Yes, a little.

1311
01:41:17,956 --> 01:41:20,322
Good. Now, I want you
to take these coats...

1312
01:41:20,392 --> 01:41:24,192
and sew as many of those jewels as you can
into the linings, and do it quickly as possible.

1313
01:41:24,262 --> 01:41:27,857
- Did you find a way to get away from here?
- Yes, I have.

1314
01:41:27,933 --> 01:41:30,868
<i>You know, I thought our friend last night</i>
<i>was pointing at something.</i>

1315
01:41:30,936 --> 01:41:35,373
So I took a look around. Now, there was
a door that was heavily barred before.

1316
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:39,069
Now I could open it. There was a room
behind and a passage leading to the river.

1317
01:41:39,144 --> 01:41:41,078
I followed it.
There are boats on the river.

1318
01:41:41,146 --> 01:41:45,776
<i>Now, the attack must be close because</i>
<i>a lot of people are leaving down the river.</i>

1319
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,809
What-What I don't like
about it is it's all too neat.

1320
01:41:49,888 --> 01:41:52,083
Now, I tried to think
like our Chinese friend.

1321
01:41:52,157 --> 01:41:54,523
Just letting us get away
isn't good enough.

1322
01:41:54,593 --> 01:41:58,529
<i>But if we were killed doing it just when danger</i>
<i>threatened, we wouldn't look very godlike...</i>

1323
01:41:58,597 --> 01:42:00,531
and he could easily
convince the empress that...

1324
01:42:00,599 --> 01:42:02,863
we hadn't just returned
to our celestial paradise.

1325
01:42:02,934 --> 01:42:06,870
It would give him a chance
to save his city and his skin.

1326
01:42:06,938 --> 01:42:08,997
What do you think,
Tris?

1327
01:42:09,074 --> 01:42:11,201
Well, he didn't give us
much choice.

1328
01:42:13,144 --> 01:42:18,275
Well, we'd better wait until night.
We'll stand a better chance at the river.

1329
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,341
Come on. Get ready.

1330
01:42:28,627 --> 01:42:32,961
- Well, the light's going. It won't be long now.
- No.

1331
01:42:39,638 --> 01:42:41,970
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Yes, almost.

1332
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,338
- Well, hurry up.
- Yes, Walter.

1333
01:42:49,314 --> 01:42:54,013
I'm sorry, Maryam, that we got you
into this, having you brought here.

1334
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:56,485
<i>- It-</i>
- I'm glad you did it, Walter.

1335
01:42:58,056 --> 01:43:03,255
- Well, hurry up.
- Yes.

1336
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:11,266
That's-
That's yours, Tris.

1337
01:43:11,336 --> 01:43:14,396
If we get out of here,
you'll be a rich man with what's in there.

1338
01:43:14,472 --> 01:43:16,804
How does it feel?

1339
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:19,673
Of course, I suppose by rights
it should be Bayan's...

1340
01:43:19,744 --> 01:43:22,645
the spoils of China,
but there'll be plenty for him.

1341
01:43:22,714 --> 01:43:24,648
- Walter.
- What?

1342
01:43:24,716 --> 01:43:26,809
- Look, I've been thinking.
- Well, don't.

1343
01:43:26,885 --> 01:43:29,376
- It only leads to trouble.
- No, no. I've gotta say it.

1344
01:43:29,454 --> 01:43:33,857
What happens? I mean, when we do
make it to the other side of the river?

1345
01:43:33,925 --> 01:43:37,224
- Well, maybe we better wait till we get there.
- No. What I mean is-

1346
01:43:37,295 --> 01:43:39,763
Look, I've been putting
some things together.

1347
01:43:39,831 --> 01:43:44,894
Things about making books. Things like
you said that man would give so much to know...

1348
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,996
in matters of science like
the direction-finding needle.

1349
01:43:49,074 --> 01:43:51,542
Well, l-I thought
to an island...

1350
01:43:51,609 --> 01:43:55,306
you know, it might be useful
for a trade and to defend itself.

1351
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,245
But-

1352
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:04,512
What I was really thinking, I wish
it was you that was taking her back.

1353
01:44:04,589 --> 01:44:08,355
It'd be better that way.
I wish it was you.

1354
01:44:19,404 --> 01:44:21,838
Well, Bayan was right
about one thing.

1355
01:44:21,906 --> 01:44:25,069
You're a poet, bowman,
and a good one.

1356
01:44:25,143 --> 01:44:28,271
But he was wrong
about another thing.

1357
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:30,473
"What you can't touch
doesn't exist," he said.

1358
01:44:30,548 --> 01:44:34,484
He didn't know that you could smell
those English oaks of yours from here...

1359
01:44:34,552 --> 01:44:36,918
did he, bowman?

1360
01:44:36,988 --> 01:44:40,754
Oh, no one could say it
better than you, Tris.

1361
01:44:40,825 --> 01:44:44,022
And l- I wish I felt
the same way.

1362
01:44:46,765 --> 01:44:49,757
Probably I'm sorry
that I feel that Bayan...

1363
01:44:49,834 --> 01:44:54,066
is the best thing that I have to follow,
but that's the way it is.

1364
01:44:54,139 --> 01:44:59,668
I'd lie to you, Tris, if I were sure
we weren't going to get through.

1365
01:44:59,744 --> 01:45:03,202
But if we do, I won't stand out there
and tell you that I'd take it back.

1366
01:45:05,517 --> 01:45:09,783
I'm glad that it didn't end
in the tent, you and I...

1367
01:45:09,854 --> 01:45:14,621
bitter and- and angry.

1368
01:45:14,692 --> 01:45:17,422
Felicity means something
after all, maybe.

1369
01:45:19,597 --> 01:45:22,259
I hope we don't make it.

1370
01:45:22,333 --> 01:45:25,666
I hope you don't ever
get to the river.

1371
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:32,372
Walter!
I finished, Walter.

1372
01:46:34,806 --> 01:46:37,707
Well, that's one way
we won't get out.

1373
01:46:44,449 --> 01:46:46,383
This was open.
Well, this is it.

1374
01:46:46,451 --> 01:46:49,614
That door is not as high
as the walls of Rome.

1375
01:46:49,687 --> 01:46:52,485
Why don't you get your friend Bayan
to crumble it for you.

1376
01:46:53,825 --> 01:46:55,383
Here they are.

1377
01:46:57,495 --> 01:47:00,430
- Can you hold them for a while?
- We'll find out.

1378
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:02,489
- I'm gonna try it.
- What?

1379
01:47:02,567 --> 01:47:04,865
The walls of Rome.

1380
01:47:11,009 --> 01:47:13,273
<i>[Arrows Flying]</i>

1381
01:47:50,148 --> 01:47:52,981
- Give her to me a minute.
- You couldn't hit anything. Give it to me.

1382
01:47:53,051 --> 01:47:55,485
And take her
back out a bit.

1383
01:48:07,265 --> 01:48:09,256
Tris!

1384
01:48:19,978 --> 01:48:22,572
Tris!
Are you all right?

1385
01:48:23,715 --> 01:48:25,649
You all right?

1386
01:48:25,717 --> 01:48:28,584
Our friends will be back soon.
Now get her down to the boat.

1387
01:48:28,653 --> 01:48:32,453
- Hold onto me. You take-
- Stop being a hero.

1388
01:48:32,523 --> 01:48:36,289
How will you keep them back?
Throw a diamond at them?

1389
01:48:36,361 --> 01:48:38,090
Go on.
Get her down to the boat.

1390
01:48:55,546 --> 01:48:57,741
<i>[Voices Clamoring]</i>

1391
01:49:02,353 --> 01:49:04,617
Hold this clear of the bank.
We'll be right back.

1392
01:49:13,398 --> 01:49:15,389
Walter!

1393
01:49:33,618 --> 01:49:37,418
- Come on.
- I said I hoped we'd never get to the river.

1394
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:40,890
Well, maybe I don't have to.

1395
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:43,620
What are you talking about?

1396
01:49:43,694 --> 01:49:47,027
You have to get back to England,
don't you remember?

1397
01:49:47,098 --> 01:49:50,158
Come on. You can't just lie there.
Let me help you.

1398
01:49:50,234 --> 01:49:52,600
Leave them alone!
They're mine!

1399
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:55,332
You get onto your walls of Rome
and leave me alone.

1400
01:49:57,942 --> 01:50:00,911
Look at you.

1401
01:50:00,978 --> 01:50:03,879
You haven't got the belly
for it either, have you?

1402
01:50:03,948 --> 01:50:06,917
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

1403
01:50:08,586 --> 01:50:12,215
Books,
the walls of Rome...

1404
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:15,348
<i>and the miracles...</i>

1405
01:50:17,128 --> 01:50:19,119
<i>and-and the oaks.</i>

1406
01:50:19,197 --> 01:50:23,463
I don't know.
They're just so... green.

1407
01:50:31,342 --> 01:50:34,402
What are you talking
like that for? What-

1408
01:50:37,148 --> 01:50:39,082
What are you trying to do,
die on me?

1409
01:50:42,887 --> 01:50:45,617
Tris, come on.

1410
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:48,386
Come on, Tris.
Come on.

1411
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:56,366
Come on.
Come on, Tris.

1412
01:51:00,304 --> 01:51:02,238
Come on, Tris.

1413
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:31,268
[Knocking]

1414
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:34,837
We don't use
this door anymore.

1415
01:51:34,906 --> 01:51:38,501
- If you've come to trade, you'll have to-
- Old Will, couldn't I use it?

1416
01:51:40,511 --> 01:51:42,809
You're playing tricks at me.

1417
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:46,507
It is.
It's Master Walter.

1418
01:51:46,584 --> 01:51:48,643
- I'm glad to see you.
- Come in. Come in.

1419
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,389
Come in, Master Walter.

1420
01:51:58,629 --> 01:52:01,621
Well, it looks the same.

1421
01:52:01,699 --> 01:52:04,634
And I have the same questions to ask.
How's Grandfather?

1422
01:52:04,702 --> 01:52:08,889
He'll never say it,
but he's missed you sorely.

1423
01:52:10,591 --> 01:52:13,822
Once we hoped that
we might see you again.

1424
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:16,055
The king's men
came looking for you.

1425
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:19,930
There were very strange men with them
such as I had never seen before.

1426
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,231
- They said that they had a message to give you.
- What message?

1427
01:52:23,304 --> 01:52:27,263
I don't know, Master Walter. They said
they would only give it to you when you came.

1428
01:52:28,476 --> 01:52:30,637
I'll tell him.

1429
01:52:57,505 --> 01:53:01,942
<i>- [Grandfather] You lie, you old villain.</i>
<i>- I swear it, my lord.</i>

1430
01:53:02,009 --> 01:53:03,476
- He's here.
- Walter, my lad.

1431
01:53:03,544 --> 01:53:05,910
- Grandfather.
- Where have you come from?

1432
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:10,917
We thought-Wilderkin, tell my grandson-
I've spoken to him.

1433
01:53:10,985 --> 01:53:12,919
- My lord-
- You let me speak to him.

1434
01:53:12,987 --> 01:53:16,115
- My lord, l-
- What are you standing there for?
I've broken my knightly vow.

1435
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:18,454
Wilderkin, tell my grandfather
that it was my fault-

1436
01:53:18,526 --> 01:53:21,518
Tell my grandson that-
Oh, what's the good?

1437
01:53:21,595 --> 01:53:23,893
When a vow's broken,
you can't put it together again.

1438
01:53:23,964 --> 01:53:25,898
Perhaps the good bishop
could tell my lord-

1439
01:53:25,966 --> 01:53:29,197
What have I got to do with the bishop?
I can set myself my own penance.

1440
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:32,831
- I'll-Well, never mind. I'll think of one.
<i>- Yes, my lord.</i>

1441
01:53:32,907 --> 01:53:37,401
Then-Then I can talk to him
as much as I want, can't I?

1442
01:53:45,386 --> 01:53:51,086
- We've no need of you. Go on about your business.
- Yes, my lord.

1443
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:53,183
Yes, my lord.

1444
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:57,930
So the- the needle that
points in the same direction...

1445
01:53:57,998 --> 01:54:02,367
and those books,
I left in London to be sent to the king.

1446
01:54:02,436 --> 01:54:04,370
And as they might need
some explanation...

1447
01:54:04,438 --> 01:54:07,874
I left word that
they could find me here.

1448
01:54:07,942 --> 01:54:11,878
And then l-
I came straight here to see you.

1449
01:54:13,113 --> 01:54:17,880
But l- I wish I had
something more to tell you.

1450
01:54:17,952 --> 01:54:22,821
It- It all ought
to add up to something.

1451
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:25,916
I've seen Cathay.
But what of that?

1452
01:54:25,993 --> 01:54:30,555
For all my talk,
there's been no help for Gurnie in it.

1453
01:54:30,631 --> 01:54:32,690
And maybe-

1454
01:54:32,766 --> 01:54:37,226
Maybe if I'd stayed here,
he'd still be in his forest...

1455
01:54:37,304 --> 01:54:39,363
looking down a shaft
at some king's stag.

1456
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:42,307
Well, l-

1457
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:46,039
I should have the answers, lad,
if you're troubled.

1458
01:54:46,113 --> 01:54:49,276
I'm old enough.
But if I were you, I'd-

1459
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:52,148
<i>My lord. They're here, my lord.</i>
<i>The king's men-at-arms.</i>

1460
01:54:52,219 --> 01:54:56,622
- They wish to see Master Walter.
- Bring them in, man. Bring them in.

1461
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:59,181
We're ready for them.

1462
01:55:02,796 --> 01:55:06,823
There is a man at Oxford who can best
tell you about the importance of the books...

1463
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,030
and the manner in which
they are made- Friar Bacon.

1464
01:55:11,105 --> 01:55:13,369
As for the rest, l-
I thought perhaps...

1465
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:17,501
the direction-finding needle might
prove useful on the sea that surrounds us.

1466
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:21,708
I don't know. However,
it's all set down in the books...

1467
01:55:21,782 --> 01:55:23,841
and your men of science
can read about it there.

1468
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:27,785
I am not inclined to believe
all this about the fire tubes.

1469
01:55:27,855 --> 01:55:32,258
- I think the young man saw a dragon.
- Perhaps I did.

1470
01:55:41,368 --> 01:55:44,098
You have told us much
and well, young Saxon.

1471
01:55:44,171 --> 01:55:46,696
All but the most
important part.

1472
01:55:46,774 --> 01:55:49,504
I've- I've told you
all I know, sire.

1473
01:55:49,576 --> 01:55:52,602
All but why
you have done these things.

1474
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:55,080
I remember you well,
young Saxon.

1475
01:55:55,149 --> 01:55:59,779
You refused to enter my service.
You were very outspoken about it.

1476
01:55:59,853 --> 01:56:04,620
If you remember, I asked you a question then
about this matter of Saxon and Norman.

1477
01:56:04,692 --> 01:56:08,355
I have some feeling the answer
may lie here, if we can find it...

1478
01:56:08,429 --> 01:56:10,761
somewhere in this service
you have tried to do us.

1479
01:56:14,368 --> 01:56:16,802
- I didn't do it for you, sire.
- For whom then?

1480
01:56:18,706 --> 01:56:21,038
For him.

1481
01:56:21,108 --> 01:56:24,635
He- He wanted it that way,
l-I think.

1482
01:56:24,712 --> 01:56:29,740
- The bowman?
- Yes, sire.

1483
01:56:29,817 --> 01:56:32,183
Why did he wish it, then?

1484
01:56:34,421 --> 01:56:37,015
I don't know.

1485
01:56:37,091 --> 01:56:42,256
It was something he felt that-
I don't know what it was.

1486
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:45,457
Bayan used to say that
nothing existed...

1487
01:56:45,532 --> 01:56:48,865
except what you could touch.

1488
01:56:48,936 --> 01:56:52,201
But it did for him.

1489
01:56:52,272 --> 01:56:54,740
What he felt
was as clear to him.

1490
01:56:54,808 --> 01:56:57,743
He'd- He'd sit there,
and it-

1491
01:56:57,811 --> 01:57:01,508
Well, it was like
a fragrance to him.

1492
01:57:01,582 --> 01:57:04,278
It had to be.
He died for it, didn't he?

1493
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:09,482
Do you think it could be that he discovered
he was English first and Saxon second?

1494
01:57:12,593 --> 01:57:14,561
L- I don't know.

1495
01:57:14,628 --> 01:57:18,689
Saxons can feel like this
underneath the bitterness.

1496
01:57:18,766 --> 01:57:22,964
They can work with a king who would
like to be English first and Norman second.

1497
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:29,307
There are some points I would like to dispose of
in your case, and in that of the bowman.

1498
01:57:31,111 --> 01:57:35,775
As I remember it, there was some question
of a name amongst other things.

1499
01:57:35,849 --> 01:57:38,750
It is our wish you remain here
until I return.

1500
01:57:52,099 --> 01:57:58,004
As you knelt Walter of Gurnie,
rise Sir Walter Fitzrauf.

1501
01:57:59,807 --> 01:58:05,768
And it is our wish that your shield
shall bear a longbow as part of your arms.

1502
01:58:07,714 --> 01:58:10,547
And as the first act
of your knighthood...

1503
01:58:10,617 --> 01:58:13,017
you shall place this bow,
the finest I could find...

1504
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:16,522
<i>above all other</i>
<i>of your arms at Gurnie...</i>

1505
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:21,050
since in its presence no man will be able
to live less well for England...

1506
01:58:21,128 --> 01:58:23,062
than did Tristram Griffen.

1507
01:58:27,434 --> 01:58:31,928
You will place this upon it
as a tribute from me to a brave man.

1508
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,656
We have been sent
a long way to see you...

1509
01:58:55,729 --> 01:58:58,254
if you are the one
my lord Bayan called the scholar.

1510
01:58:58,332 --> 01:59:00,664
Bayan?

1511
01:59:02,202 --> 01:59:06,104
If you are that one, I have something
I am ordered to give you.

1512
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:16,577
"To my friend,
Walter the scholar."

1513
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:21,087
<i>[Bayan's Voice] "Bayan of the Hundred Eyes</i>
<i>sends greetings and a message.</i>

1514
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:24,590
<i>"I think that I understand why</i>
<i>you did not return to me...</i>

1515
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:26,922

1516
01:59:26,994 --> 01:59:29,758

1517
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:33,391

1518
01:59:33,467 --> 01:59:35,492
<i>"wherever I may find them.</i>

1519
01:59:35,569 --> 01:59:38,697
<i>"The tall bowman died well...</i>

1520
01:59:38,772 --> 01:59:43,300

<i>well for me if that had been necessary.</i>

1521
01:59:43,377 --> 01:59:48,246
<i>"Therefore, I send you something I believe</i>

1522
01:59:48,315 --> 01:59:52,775
<i>"She will be wearing a coat you will recognize.</i>
<i>It has a very fine lining.</i>

1523
01:59:52,853 --> 01:59:56,949

1524

- Maryam!

1525
02:00:01,295 --> 02:00:05,629
She is not to see you until
you tell us that the gift is welcome.

1526
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:08,190
My lord was afraid
you might have tired of her.

1527
02:00:14,408 --> 02:00:16,342
Maryam!
