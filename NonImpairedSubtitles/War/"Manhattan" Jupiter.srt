1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:01,251
Previously on "Manhattan"...

2
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:03,253
Because on July 4th, 1945,

3
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:06,907
we're going to test the
gadget in our own backyard.

4
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:09,910
The Army manipulated
us, you and I, Charlie.

5
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:11,694
We have to stop this train.

6
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:13,196
He doesn't just want a seat at the table.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,815
He wants to shut down the project.

8
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:18,568
If you thought you were racing
the Nazis to a super weapon,

9
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,820
your ignorance has been engineered.

10
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,906
I gave up my one shot at history

11
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,457
so you could get us a seat at the table.

12
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:28,077
You excited to incinerate 20,000 kids?

13
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,130
I think Frank Winter sabotaged the pretest.

14
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,833
This test is the start of a whole new era,

15
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:37,720
like Auro's interplanetary cruise
ship crash-landing on Jupiter.

16
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:40,556
- Are you a spy, Jim?
- Uh, Jeannie, wait!

17
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:42,225
Jim! I'll handle this.

18
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,728
I'm not going to Trinity.

19
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:47,146
I'm grateful for the opportunities

20
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,731
you've given me here, Charlie,

21
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:51,901
but I've had enough death for one lifetime.

22
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:54,687
- Where's Joey?
- He's on his way to Brooklyn.

23
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:58,441
Juanita's driving him. He's
going to live with my parents.

24
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,193
Keeping him safe from you,

25
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:01,861
just like you should have been
kept safe from your father!

26
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,863
You think I won't get in
the car and bring him back?

27
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:06,582
Your test is in 24 hours.

28
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:08,584
You think I don't know
which way you'll drive?

29
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:12,372
You, a guy who went to
a second-rate law school,

30
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:16,042
is getting orchestra
seats to physics history?

31
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:17,760
You and Perseus

32
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:19,379
are going to go out
there on your own.

33
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,180
You built the circuits.

34
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,716
You can wire them to go
off at any time you like.

35
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:27,136
You want to kill the scientists.

36
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,973
You want to kill my friends.

37
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,442
Paul?

38
00:01:32,476 --> 00:01:34,227
We need to talk about Jim.

39
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:42,785
Last car leaves the blast zone

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,405
at zero minus 30 minutes.

41
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,156
They test the firing switch...

42
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,543
Two hours earlier. I know.

43
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,412
So you rig the detonator

44
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:54,213
to go off when Isaacs hits the switch.

45
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,417
The bomb fizzles and scatters plutonium

46
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:59,802
halfway to El Paso.

47
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,971
Killing all the staff on the ground.

48
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:07,810
I think we should stick
to the original plan.

49
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:10,229
Hold off till everyone evacuates.

50
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,815
Just... just you and me now, right?

51
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,818
The decision is ours.

52
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:19,022
We're not the directors of this play.

53
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,575
- We're the actors.
- What's your part?

54
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,444
Make sure I do mine?

55
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,917
But where's the proof, Paul,

56
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,252
besides some baseball hat?

57
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,588
Meeks was the most
devoted member of my group.

58
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,256
I practically had to
crowbar him out the door

59
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,509
to attend his own mother's funeral.

60
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,296
What?

61
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,283
- Operator. -
Yeah, outside line, please.

62
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,620
Fairview, 89091.

63
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,907
 Hold, please.

64
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:14,327
Hello?

65
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,797
Yes, hello.

66
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,332
Who am I speaking with?

67
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:21,918
This is Edith Meeks.

68
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:27,140
I'm very sorry to
trouble you, ma'am.

69
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,310
Is Jim Meeks your son?

70
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,845
Yes, he is.

71
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,314
Are you a friend of Jimmy's?

72
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,985
No, I... I was his teacher.

73
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:43,022
He's going to wind up
in the electric chair.

74
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:44,824
God, Frank, Colonel Darrow finds out,

75
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,527
he won't make it that far, believe me.

76
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,495
- Who else knows?
- No one.

77
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,664
And as soon as it's out of
the bag, he's beyond our help.

78
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,033
A spy in the hand is worth 10 in the grave.

79
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:56,335
We can flip him double agency.

80
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,121
The Soviets have been doing it for decades.

81
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,922
We've just joined the game.

82
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:01,541
We?

83
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:04,377
I may have picked up some extracurriculars.

84
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,049
Listen to me, all right?

85
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,135
Intelligence boys will
play poker with a spy,

86
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,352
but not with a saboteur,

87
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,221
so we have one chance to save him.

88
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:18,107
We'll get to Jim before
he gets to the bomb.

89
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:19,809
We're looking for Dr. Frank Winter.

90
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,811
Is this his desk?

91
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,396
Where's Frank Winter?

92
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,364
Damn it. Helen.

93
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,202
I may have dabbled in some
extracurriculars myself.

94
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,987
Why did you think I came to you first?

95
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:39,295
They're my friends, the scientists.

96
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,080
Well, they're also mass murderers.

97
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:42,965
You can do better.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,718
Where the hell is my Trinity pass?

99
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,587
- Will you pull over?
- What?

100
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:49,088
Pull over?

101
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,016
The goddamn pass has got to be in here.

102
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,158
The pass has got to be
back here somewhere.

103
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:18,167
Go ahead.

104
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,703
"Batter my heart,
three-personed God,

105
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,922
for you as yet but knock.

106
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:26,956
Breathe, shine and seek to mend,

107
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,345
that I may rise and stand.

108
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,299
Overthrow me, and bend Your force

109
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,350
to break, blow, burn,

110
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:40,389
and make me new."

111
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,608
Members of the Special
Engineering Division,

112
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:46,395
report to position K to
initiate evacuation proceedings.

113
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:51,651
Hey! Wait!

114
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:53,819
Charlie! Just wait, please!

115
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,423
So, the dawn, the dawn of the atomic age

116
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,243
being ushered in by a Jewish cardsharp

117
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,245
whose family crash-landed
on the American shore...

118
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,080
- You shouldn't be down here.
- Less than 50 years ago.

119
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,298
No, just one quote. One quote.

120
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:16,142
Liza.

121
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,513
Fritz, you're here.

122
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:24,483
You were right. Work helps.

123
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,436
So does beer and crying,

124
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,988
but...

125
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,658
Jeannie would have wanted me to be here.

126
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,997
I warned them about the storm.

127
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,917
They don't care.

128
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:44,370
They won't even let me in the command tent.

129
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,876
But they'll let you in, right?

130
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,796
What do I tell them?

131
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,986
Whoa! Charlie! Charlie!

132
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,271
Fritz! You're here.

133
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:03,472
Yeah.

134
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,142
I'm glad. Grab a radio.

135
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,394
Make sure the circuit cables
don't short out in the rain.

136
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:09,895
Whoa, whoa, we're supposed to meet

137
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,897
10 weather conditions
before we pull the trigger.

138
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,151
Visibility over 45 miles,
humidity below 85%...

139
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,786
Yeah, I read the report.

140
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,572
But you got to talk to the
Colonel, delay the test.

141
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:22,992
The Colonel and I aren't
on the best of terms.

142
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,578
Ready to go.

143
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,630
Look, at any given moment

144
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,166
there are 3,000 thunderstorms
somewhere on the planet.

145
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,801
No, no. This one is special.

146
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:35,087
Gulf air at 17,000 feet,
two inversion layers...

147
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:38,057
They're not going to
call the game for rain.

148
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,975
Let's just hope it blows over.

149
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,312
It'll blow radioactive fallout
from Roswell to Socorro.

150
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:44,814
I'm sympathetic. The Army isn't.

151
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:46,849
Either way, I take responsibility.

152
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:53,522
Hey. Where you been?

153
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,857
You all right, pal?

154
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,609
Yeah, I got a...

155
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,911
I got a flat tire on the way up.

156
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,162
Oh.

157
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:01,497
I'm supposed to check the...

158
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:03,165
The detonator circuits.

159
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,284
I think they already took care of it.

160
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,038
So it's, it's happening?

161
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,507
Right now?

162
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,543
In the face of reason
and safety precautions.

163
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,796
Welcome to Jupiter.

164
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,478
From Oppenheimer.

165
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,118
_

166
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:51,464
You want a volunteer to climb
a 100-foot steel lightning rod?

167
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,082
- Yes.
- To babysit Shiva, the god of death,

168
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,834
in the middle of an electrical storm.

169
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,253
Well, maybe the Japs can
spare a kamikaze pilot.

170
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,805
- I want one guy.
- I, I don't have a man to spare.

171
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,174
- You don't have a man to spare?
- What is it that you want?

172
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,894
This is a war. I don't
care about one guy!

173
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:08,063
- Right.
- I'll do it.

174
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,648
No way.

175
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:10,983
If the Colonel wants to
double-check the detonators,

176
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,518
he can do it himself.

177
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,153
We're concerned about the
possibility of sabotage.

178
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,905
It's just a precaution.

179
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:18,324
No wife, no kids. I'll do it.

180
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,360
- I'll do it.
- No, you're more valuable on the ground.

181
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:24,246
Jim, you don't have to.

182
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:25,581
It's okay.

183
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,700
It should be someone you trust.

184
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,968
Hey! Hey, you!

185
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,523
Boy Wonder said to give you this.

186
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,059
Start the clock.

187
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,647
Zero minus 150 minutes.

188
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,149
Begin the evacuation...

189
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,117
By 0430 hours,

190
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:03,953
every tent including this one

191
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:07,156
will be collapsed and loaded for transport

192
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,375
to the 10,000-meter perimeter.

193
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:15,080
And if anyone sees Dr.
Frank Winter on the premises,

194
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,082
arrest him.

195
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,168
If he resists,

196
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:23,219
you have the authority to
use all necessary force.

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,215
Guys, in one hour, this
site is a ghost town.

199
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,417
Anything you want to salvage, grab it now.

200
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,419
It won't be here come tomorrow.

201
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,228
Helen!

202
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:16,063
- Oh!
- Jesus!

203
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:20,234
What are you doing here?

204
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:23,521
You think I'd miss Trinity?
I got money on this thing.

205
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:26,240
You're not the only one
who's betting against me.

206
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:29,610
I took the over. 18 kilotons.

207
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:33,697
We'll be lucky to hit 10.

208
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,785
You and Frank built this bomb.

209
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:40,254
I have no doubts about
how destructive it will be.

210
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:43,090
Your signature's all over
that mess of wires, too.

211
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:16,707
In case you set the
atmosphere on fire tonight

212
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:17,992
and this is good-bye...

213
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:20,327
- Helen.
- No, I...

214
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,631
I don't blame you...

215
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,418
for choosing your family.

216
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:31,138
Dr. Prins, come with us, please.

217
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:33,974
- She's with me.
- She's here on a stolen pass, sir.

218
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:39,096
We got her.

219
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,772
Patch me through!

220
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,860
Hello?

221
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:55,196
Wake Joey up. Put him on the phone.

222
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,115
Who... who is this?

223
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,835
Put my son on the phone, Miriam.

224
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,870
Charlie?

225
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:04,338
Joey's not here, Charlie.

226
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:06,006
You're bluffing the wrong guy.

227
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,510
She didn't give me a chance
to say good-bye to him.

228
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,512
Your daughter tell you that?

229
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:14,849
Charlie, is something wrong?

230
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:16,767
I think you better sleep it off, Chaz.

231
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,552
So help me God.

232
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:19,770
When it's done,

233
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:23,357
I'm coming east in a goddamn B-29.

234
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:25,192
And when I...

235
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:29,196
Max, just...

236
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:33,784
tell Joey that I

237
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:35,819
can you tell Joey I love him?

238
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:38,706
Can you do that?

239
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,911
Max?

240
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:29,590
- Jim?
- Ah!

241
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,376
Frank?

242
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:33,711
Frank.

243
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:35,129
You're not...

244
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,847
You're not supposed to be up here.

245
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:38,432
What are...

246
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:40,768
I'd feel better if you pointed that thing

247
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:42,803
away from the atomic bomb.

248
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:49,360
I called the house in Bangor, Jim.

249
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:50,978
I talked to your mother.

250
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:59,236
Why did you call my mother?

251
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:00,821
Well, if you have a hypothesis,

252
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:02,656
you check your assumptions, right?

253
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:07,411
I don't want to hurt anybody.

254
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:10,297
Well, you picked the wrong line of work.

255
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:11,966
But I will.

256
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,251
Jim, I'm not here to stop you.

257
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,887
I'm here to help you.

258
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:19,673
Zero minus 90 minutes.

259
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:22,810
- It's the 90-minute rocket.
- Who knows you're here?

260
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:24,678
Do you really think
they'd be running the clock

261
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
if anyone knew I was
standing up in this room?

262
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:30,317
- What do you want, Frank?
- The same as you.

263
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:31,685
I've been trying to put this thing

264
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:33,487
back in the box for over a year.

265
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:35,489
You remember the petition?

266
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:39,109
The faked intelligence on the German bomb?

267
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,694
I'm the one that blew the whistle.

268
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:44,331
That was... that was different.

269
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,916
I sabotaged the pretest.

270
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,868
The pretest? The pretest was a fluke.

271
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,537
- One of the detonators...
- Was mislabeled.

272
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:54,341
Strand three, cap six.

273
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,545
Jesus.

274
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:10,187
You remember what you
said to me the day we met?

275
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:14,392
You wanted to switch
majors, to medicine, right?

276
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:19,366
Because you thought physics
was just too abstract.

277
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:23,401
You were going to leave the
world better than you found it.

278
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,239
That's what I'm doing.

279
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:31,295
Well, I can help.

280
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:33,080
It's already done.

281
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,583
You sure you don't want a second opinion?

282
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:39,086
You climbed a hundred-foot
tower to check my work?

283
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:42,506
My guess is you, uh...

284
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:45,175
You rewired the firing system, right?

285
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:47,978
You botch the timing, you get a big bang,

286
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:49,346
but no chain reaction.

287
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:52,516
The plutonium scattered, gone.

288
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,770
That's certainly how I would have done it.

289
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:00,190
You reattach the trigger line?

290
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,775
Of course.

291
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:03,777
And you used silver wire,
not tungsten or Nichrome?

292
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,780
I took Intro to Thermal
Physics... from you.

293
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:11,952
And you grounded the capacitor bank, yes?

294
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,255
Because if you didn't,

295
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:19,209
a red light goes off in Charlie's tent

296
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,295
and up come the geniuses.

297
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:27,798
Well, uh, there's no...
There's no grounding strap.

298
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:35,392
We're sitting on top of
100 feet of steel, Jim.

299
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:38,228
It's frontier medicine.

300
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,063
You learn to work with what you've got.

301
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,817
Will you toss me a wrench?

302
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,487
Shit.

303
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:56,606
Thanks.

304
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:03,504
Somehow this thing looked better on paper.

305
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:35,011
What time is it?

306
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,429
There's a call at the switchboard.

307
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,349
Your husband wants to speak with you.

308
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:43,351
Well, tell him that I will
speak with him in the morning...

309
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:46,356
if there is one.

310
00:19:46,358 --> 00:19:48,608
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good night.

311
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,828
So how'd they sell you, the Russians?

312
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,831
Nobody sold me anything.

313
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:47,217
It was too big for one country to sit on,

314
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:49,052
even the good guys.

315
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:52,255
Is that what we are?

316
00:20:52,257 --> 00:20:56,009
You hear what Charlie
told the Target Committee?

317
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,060
He said we should drop it
on a city full of civilians,

318
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:03,850
maximize collateral damage.

319
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:06,653
Someone has to stand up,

320
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,440
save the world from the guys
who are saving the world.

321
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:21,951
Hello?

322
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:26,206
Hi, Charlie. Uh...

323
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:28,625
How are you doing up there?

324
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:32,545
I was just, uh, rechecking
the firing system.

325
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:35,098
We're clearing Site B in 30 minutes.

326
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,799
- You get to the lifeboats.
- Copy that.

327
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,051
I'm leaving the tower in 30 minutes.

328
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:39,435
All right.

329
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:46,860
All personnel must clear
the area in 30 minutes.

330
00:21:46,894 --> 00:21:50,813
I repeat, all personnel must
clear the area in 30 minutes.

331
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:59,289
Dr. Oppenheimer.

332
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:01,908
I wasn't supposed to be here, I know,

333
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,244
but as a member of the
original implosion team,

334
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,079
I thought...

335
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,497
We call it Little Boy,

336
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:10,083
but it's not a boy at all, is it?

337
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:11,918
"Profligate, but ultimately dependable."

338
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,721
That describes every woman I know.

339
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:16,256
Sir?

340
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:18,308
The components for the uranium bomb

341
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:20,677
have been loaded onto the USS Indianapolis.

342
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:24,514
We're going to use Little Boy?

343
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:26,099
Without even testing it?

344
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,850
We know it will work,

345
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:30,520
which is more than I can say for...

346
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:35,024
For reasons of which you are well aware,

347
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:37,026
Frank Winter has been relieved of his post.

348
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,365
You're the new head of the group.

349
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:48,037
Thank you, s...

350
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,541
Sir, I, uh...

351
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,343
I'll return to the Hill
the second the test is over.

352
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:55,962
No, you're leaving for Tinian Island

353
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:57,797
to prepare for delivery to the target.

354
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,018
Buy a slicker. It's monsoon season.

355
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:16,816
All personnel must clear from Site B

356
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,785
by 0430 hours.

357
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:21,571
I repeat, all personnel
must clear from Site B

358
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:23,456
by 0430 hours.

359
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,158
Why don't you go ahead and start down

360
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:28,161
and I'll finish everything up here?

361
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,797
There's a car behind the munitions shed.

362
00:23:30,831 --> 00:23:32,799
Key's in the ignition.

363
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,917
All right, I'll meet you down there.

364
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:38,921
I'm not leaving.

365
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:43,593
What?

366
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:46,813
It'll be over in a thousandth of a second.

367
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:48,398
Less.

368
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:50,683
I'm not scared.

369
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:06,616
Why don't you finish up?

370
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:21,064
I told the Army

371
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:23,850
setting off an atomic explosion

372
00:24:23,884 --> 00:24:26,069
in an exposed valley

373
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:29,055
in a state where the weather
changes every 10 minutes

374
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:32,358
is worse idea than the
Bolshevik revolution!

375
00:24:37,114 --> 00:24:40,366
Now what the hell is that, huh?

376
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:42,485
Balloons one through eight, do you read?

377
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:44,654
It's on every channel.

378
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:46,072
Maybe the storm picking up the signal

379
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:49,659
from an FM station or a practical joke.

380
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:52,879
Not a funny one. No signal, no kaboom.

381
00:24:52,913 --> 00:24:56,132
You tell your Colonel
to stop the clock now!

382
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,501
Shit.

383
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,891
Go on and check the power
on the I.S. You got it?

384
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:07,260
You've got 20 minutes to fix this!

385
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:10,179
Then we restart the countdown
with or without radios!

386
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:12,565
Why don't you worry about
evacuating the blast zone?

387
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,017
- I'll make the technical decisions.
- Do we have a problem?

388
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,653
My wife, Jean Tatlock, take your pick.

389
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,739
I'm still the commanding officer.

390
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,407
I give the order.

391
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:23,826
Yeah? Well, my letter
should take care of that.

392
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:25,278
What letter?

393
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:27,280
The one I put in the mail
to the Secretary of War.

394
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:29,699
You think Stimson cares
about a dead Communist?

395
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:31,334
No. That's why I sent him

396
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:33,002
your falsified German intelligence,

397
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:35,705
the lies about Magpie that
you sold to the president,

398
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,507
with Frank Winter's math attached

399
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:40,927
in case he's curious
about how you forged it.

400
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:43,379
Enjoy the fireworks.

401
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:51,521
Whew!

402
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:54,140
Well...

403
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:55,274
you got your wish.

404
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:57,527
Act of God.

405
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:59,145
We can't start the countdown again

406
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:02,064
until they get the
communication system back up.

407
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:04,150
But maybe that will be enough
time for the wind to calm down.

408
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:06,068
- How long will it take?
- Who knows?

409
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,321
They've got to radio for a radio expert,

410
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:12,158
but since there is no radio...

411
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,910
They should have invited Frank.

412
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:15,378
What?

413
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:18,748
He got a job in a radio
shop after the first war.

414
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,750
Once he wired up our chimney
flue into a giant antenna

415
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:25,555
so he could listen to a
boxing match in Chicago.

416
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:28,007
Huh.

417
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,979
Um, Liza...

418
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:37,013
I heard some things about Frank.

419
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:41,737
You know the pretest? The explosives test?

420
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:44,106
I know that it failed.

421
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:49,612
They think that Frank was responsible.

422
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:53,950
Responsible?

423
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:57,620
He made it fail on purpose, they say.

424
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:02,875
Fedowitz. Dr. Isaacs needs you.

425
00:27:02,926 --> 00:27:05,011
You are listening to the Voice of America,

426
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:08,514
broadcasting live from San Antonio.

427
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:11,934
We're picking up a radio signal from Texas?

428
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:14,387
San Antonio must be 600 miles from here.

429
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:16,022
Must be one hell of an antenna.

430
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:18,274
"Hell of an antenna." You idiot.

431
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:50,890
Jesus. Dance music?

432
00:27:50,924 --> 00:27:54,010
I'm surprised they're not
playing John Philip Sousa.

433
00:27:57,347 --> 00:28:00,816
Do you ever think what else we could
have done if we put our minds to it?

434
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:04,851
We could invent flying cars,

435
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:06,856
send a man to the moon.

436
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:14,447
Jim, you're a scientist,

437
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:17,450
so think this through rationally.

438
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,669
Whoever it was that sent
you on a suicide mission...

439
00:28:19,703 --> 00:28:22,171
No, they sent me on a homicide mission.

440
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:25,091
The plan... their plan
was to blow the thing up

441
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,126
before the staff evacuated,

442
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:28,878
kill the whole brain trust.

443
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,298
So you already saved lives today.

444
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,016
You changed the plan.

445
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:35,551
Change it again.

446
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:37,887
- Save yourself.
- It's too late for that.

447
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:39,605
You're a Soviet spy.

448
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,476
If you die up here sabotaging
America's super weapon,

449
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:45,811
they're going to follow the bread crumbs.

450
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:47,363
And then what?

451
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:53,536
One bullet.

452
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:58,124
One bullet in Sarajevo. 17 million dead.

453
00:28:58,158 --> 00:28:59,709
That was the First World War.

454
00:29:01,378 --> 00:29:03,379
If you die in this room, Jim,

455
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:04,580
you won't end the second.

456
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:06,215
You will start the third.

457
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:09,135
We'll invade Japan.

458
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:10,252
Not to fight the Japanese,

459
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:11,754
but to throw out the Russians.

460
00:29:11,756 --> 00:29:15,057
And from there, Korea, Manchuria,

461
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:17,226
casualties in the hundred-million range,

462
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,513
and it'll drag on for years.

463
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:24,100
And by then both sides
will have one of these.

464
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:26,068
More than one.

465
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:28,354
We cannot let anyone believe

466
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:30,740
that a Soviet spy was responsible.

467
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:34,610
They'll never believe
that it was an accident.

468
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,583
They have to think it was me.

469
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:05,780
- Hello.
- It's a little late.

470
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:08,783
Well, it's not late. It's early.

471
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:11,953
They call it a day pass
for a reason, ma'am.

472
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:13,838
Either way, this one's expired.

473
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:17,175
Oh.

474
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:19,377
Well, Colonel Darrow gave me permission

475
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:21,963
to attend services at the
Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe

476
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:23,965
whenever I felt called to worship.

477
00:30:24,016 --> 00:30:27,018
Surely you have it written down somewhere.

478
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:35,860
And would you mind giving this
back to him when he returns?

479
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,206
Thank you.

480
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:53,828
I am the only story that
doesn't end in Truman and Stalin

481
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:56,214
strangling each other
over a negotiating table.

482
00:30:56,248 --> 00:30:58,049
I'm no secret agent.

483
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:01,002
I'm just a shell-shocked old
crank who had a change of heart.

484
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,054
You don't get it, okay? I
can't go back down there.

485
00:31:03,088 --> 00:31:05,006
Oh, God, what are you
punishing yourself for, Jim?

486
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:07,475
Whatever mistakes you made,
there is time to correct them.

487
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:10,228
I don't want more time. I don't deserve it.

488
00:31:10,262 --> 00:31:12,430
Why? Because you passed secrets to an ally?

489
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:14,232
I don't care what you did

490
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:16,150
or what you think you deserve.

491
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:17,435
You changed the plan tonight.

492
00:31:17,437 --> 00:31:18,653
You didn't want to hurt anyone.

493
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:21,355
- That is a good thing.
- Jeannie!

494
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:26,077
Fritz's wife.

495
00:31:29,915 --> 00:31:32,450
She, uh...

496
00:31:32,452 --> 00:31:34,118
She found out.

497
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,181
Where's the 30-minute rocket?

498
00:31:48,717 --> 00:31:50,301
They stopped the countdown.

499
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:54,855
We have to answer that.

500
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,275
No, we can't... I told
them that I was leaving.

501
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:58,693
They don't know anyone's up here.

502
00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:00,061
Do you think it's the wrong number?

503
00:32:00,112 --> 00:32:02,697
Someone knows.

504
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:04,448
First they call, and then they knock.

505
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:07,201
Just tell them you had
to recheck a connection.

506
00:32:08,954 --> 00:32:10,905
Someone has got to answer that phone,

507
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:12,740
and you know it can't be me.

508
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:33,894
Hello, Frank?

509
00:32:41,486 --> 00:32:43,321
What?

510
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:51,996
Hello? Hello?

511
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,532
Hello?

512
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:57,201
Frank.

513
00:32:58,203 --> 00:32:59,837
Liza?

514
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:04,675
- What are you doing here?
- How did you...

515
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,210
Did you short out the radios?

516
00:33:06,212 --> 00:33:07,461
What...

517
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:12,550
Look, who else knows that I'm up here?

518
00:33:12,552 --> 00:33:13,801
No one.

519
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:19,357
Frank...

520
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:21,776
they're saying that you sabotaged the test.

521
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,061
They're saying that you
sabotaged the explosives.

522
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:28,032
I... you're going to get yourself shot.

523
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:33,788
Nobody's going to shoot anyone.

524
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:35,039
Come down.

525
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:39,543
Listen.

526
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:42,546
Listen, I need... I need you...

527
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:45,583
to do something for me, all right?

528
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:48,169
The next car you see,

529
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,004
I want you to get in it

530
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:54,008
and I want you to get
out of the blast radius.

531
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,593
I'm not leaving till you're down.

532
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:57,144
Liza... Liza, listen.

533
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,598
Don't send up the cavalry.

534
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,850
The cavalry will shoot you, Frank.

535
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:06,687
Look, I've made a lot of mistakes.

536
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:10,357
I'm trying to unmake one tonight.

537
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:14,195
I don't know if you're still my wife,

538
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:16,664
but, God, I'm still your husband

539
00:34:16,698 --> 00:34:18,449
and I love you.

540
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:24,205
So just promise me...

541
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:25,873
Promise me you'll leave now.

542
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,428
I'll find my way.

543
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:34,265
Frank?

544
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:38,219
Frank?

545
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,221
Testing, testing.

546
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:43,808
Testing! Testing.

547
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,943
Testing! Testing.

548
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:53,868
That's it.

549
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:57,902
Channel 18 is clear.

550
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:00,875
Evacuate to Site C,

551
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:04,378
zero minus 32 minutes.

552
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:06,297
- Let's go.
- We're good.

553
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:07,915
- 32.
- Okay, well, take care, man.

554
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:13,170
Zero minus 30 minutes.

555
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:14,638
See?

556
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:17,091
There... there's the 30-minute rocket.

557
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:19,176
They restarted the clock.

558
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:26,767
You said that no one knew you were up here.

559
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:29,904
You were never going to go through
with it, were you, Frank? Huh?

560
00:35:29,938 --> 00:35:33,023
You're a son of a bitch, but
you'd never do that to Liza.

561
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:39,330
What are you really doing up here, Frank?

562
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,284
Answer me!

563
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,718
Tropical storm in the desert.

564
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,937
Jazz on the shortwave.

565
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,805
Maybe the universe is
trying to tell us something.

566
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:06,724
Maybe you should listen.

567
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:09,310
Maybe you should stop the countdown.

568
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:11,145
You hear about your husband?

569
00:36:11,196 --> 00:36:13,948
Blew up the pretest,
then swooped in to fix it.

570
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:16,534
- That's a new one.
- It's not too late.

571
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:18,152
We've come this far.

572
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:20,538
If we don't finish the
job, it was all for nothing.

573
00:36:20,572 --> 00:36:22,740
That's what Frank used to say.

574
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:24,542
He tried to bury Little Boy, too.

575
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:27,545
Raided the budget to pay for your research.

576
00:36:30,582 --> 00:36:32,249
Ladies first.

577
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:35,836
Frank...

578
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:39,006
All personnel must leave
the area immediately.

579
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:42,927
All personnel must leave
the area immediately.

580
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:48,983
All personnel must
evacuate Site B immediately.

581
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:53,017
I repeat, all personnel must
evacuate Site B immediately.

582
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:59,493
Fritz! Frank's in the tower.

583
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:00,911
What do you mean? What tower?

584
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:02,830
The "tower" tower? How do you know?

585
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,415
I spoke to him on the phone.

586
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:07,585
- You have to radio it in.
- No, Fritz.

587
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,253
You know what they think he is.

588
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:12,840
Well, is he?

589
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:15,593
Let's go, get on board!

590
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:17,544
I don't honestly know.

591
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:23,050
But I know the Army will shoot him.

592
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:25,052
Jim was up in the crow's nest... Meeks.

593
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:27,388
If Frank was there, he would have seen him.

594
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:29,023
- I'll take care of it.
- Meeks?

595
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:32,393
I'll take care of it.
Give me that radio. Now!

596
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:38,115
J.M., confirm your location.

597
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:40,985
J.M., do you copy?

598
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:43,153
Jim!

599
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:45,239
all vehicles are leaving
Site B immediately.

600
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,825
Get to your assigned vehicles immediately.

601
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:51,712
What the hell is this?

602
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,664
What did you do?

603
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:57,635
I hijacked the radios.

604
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:00,638
To what? To send out a distress call?

605
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,423
- Huh? S.O.S.?
- No.

606
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:05,225
Then what? Huh? What?

607
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,560
You're going to filibuster?

608
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:07,761
You're going to stall for time?

609
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:08,846
I thought if I stopped the clock,

610
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:11,065
I Could...

611
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,433
I could talk you down.

612
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:15,486
Oh, and then you could
rewire the detonators?

613
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:21,859
God, after everything,

614
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:24,611
you are just like the rest of them.

615
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:26,613
You want the Army to drop it.

616
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:30,451
Trust me, Jim, the Army
doesn't give a shit what I want.

617
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:32,536
They're going to drop
this thing either way.

618
00:38:32,538 --> 00:38:35,089
Not if it doesn't work, they won't.

619
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:37,508
There's another one where this came from!

620
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,683
Little Boy is already
headed across the Pacific

621
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:47,685
on the USS Indianapolis.

622
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:53,107
The ship has sailed, Jim.

623
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:54,525
Literally.

624
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:20,718
No, that's...

625
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:23,337
They haven't even tested Little Boy.

626
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:25,005
- How can they be... 
- They don't need to test it.

627
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:26,924
It's a simple machine.

628
00:39:27,926 --> 00:39:29,476
All of this, it's just...

629
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:32,346
It's just legwork, Jim.

630
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:33,764
Somewhere along the line,

631
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:36,183
someone set off a chain reaction.

632
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:39,737
I don't know, maybe it was me

633
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:41,405
the day I knocked on Einstein's door.

634
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:44,358
But it's snowballing, exponential,

635
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:47,578
and nothing you or I do
tonight is going to stop it.

636
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:51,198
Maybe you can live with it.

637
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:55,369
I betrayed my country,

638
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,955
my friends.

639
00:39:57,957 --> 00:39:59,456
And I betrayed Sid Liao...

640
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:03,627
for the sake of this...

641
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:07,598
This thing I don't even believe in anymore.

642
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:11,802
Maybe you knew that already.

643
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:16,223
Sid.

644
00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:20,978
That's exactly what
brought you here, isn't it?

645
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:27,151
All of this... It was for him.

646
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:39,827
God, I keep rationalizing
all the lesser evils,

647
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:43,000
hoping they'll add up to a greater good.

648
00:40:44,836 --> 00:40:47,588
But it's just...

649
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:50,174
It's just bad math.

650
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,176
There's always some variable
you didn't account for.

651
00:40:57,265 --> 00:40:58,849
So I'm through.

652
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:04,822
I'm through trying to predict the future.

653
00:41:04,856 --> 00:41:08,408
I don't know if the world's
better off if the test fails,

654
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:11,829
but I do know that if you
sabotage it, your life is over.

655
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:13,247
And whatever it is you have done...

656
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:15,582
My life is already over.

657
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:19,036
No. No, that's the thing, Jim.

658
00:41:19,038 --> 00:41:22,256
There is a way out.

659
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,041
You're going to cooperate
with the government.

660
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:30,881
What... what the hell is going on?

661
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:33,050
Fritz?

662
00:41:33,052 --> 00:41:35,219
You're supposed to be
in one of the bunkers.

663
00:41:35,221 --> 00:41:38,272
Yeah! We all are!

664
00:41:38,306 --> 00:41:40,274
Jesus!

665
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:44,308
Frank, what are you doing up here?

666
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:47,865
I rewired the detonators...

667
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:52,236
so the test would fail.

668
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:55,072
Somebody had to save the world

669
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:56,573
from the guys who were saving the world.

670
00:41:58,543 --> 00:42:00,661
Jesus Christ, Frank.

671
00:42:00,712 --> 00:42:02,296
I'm not even saying that you're wrong,

672
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:05,332
but if the gadget doesn't
kill you, the Army will.

673
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:10,671
That's what Jim said.

674
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:14,675
He's been trying to talk me
down for the last three hours.

675
00:42:14,726 --> 00:42:16,760
He just didn't have the heart to shoot me.

676
00:42:18,263 --> 00:42:19,897
Frank.

677
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:23,567
You were... you were right, Jim.

678
00:42:26,104 --> 00:42:27,938
I have too much to live for.

679
00:42:31,576 --> 00:42:33,410
Look, we got to get out of here!

680
00:42:33,444 --> 00:42:35,412
We got to get out of the blast zone.

681
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:37,581
Come on! I mean, did you
fix the gadget or what?

682
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:42,035
Come on.

683
00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:45,339
Six hands are better than two.

684
00:42:45,373 --> 00:42:47,541
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

685
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:51,592
Next time, maybe leave
yourself a 30-minute buffer.

686
00:42:56,134 --> 00:42:58,478
Put that gun back in your bandolier.

687
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:00,404
You're not going to need it.

688
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:32,808
Zero minus eight minutes.

689
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:36,949
You've got to take it.

690
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:38,734
Sir.

691
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:40,202
Ambulances are standing by

692
00:43:40,236 --> 00:43:41,987
at their preset locations in Albuquerque.

693
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:44,456
Let's hope they get to
play pinochle all night.

694
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:46,658
Miss?

695
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,161
Has Louis Fedowitz radioed in? Fritz?

696
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,417
Thank you, Juanita.

697
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:01,066
This is L.F.

698
00:45:01,068 --> 00:45:03,869
Point Z. All clear.

699
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:11,994
Give us this day...

700
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,829
Zero minus five minutes.

701
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,914
And forgive us our trespasses

702
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:19,501
as we forgive those
who trespass against us;

703
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:23,305
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

704
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:46,278
All right, everyone stay low to the ground.

705
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Face away from the gadget.

706
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:53,869
What's that noise?

707
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,172
It's frogs.

708
00:45:57,207 --> 00:45:59,875
They come out after the rain.

709
00:45:59,926 --> 00:46:02,461
Zero minus four minutes.

710
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:06,215
I guess even the weather

711
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,467
wanted this thing to happen tonight.

712
00:46:18,394 --> 00:46:20,913
Zero minus three minutes.

713
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:22,731
If that gauge flickers, you hit the switch.

714
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:24,116
You hear me? You kill it.

715
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,651
You don't ask. You kill.

716
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:05,157
Zero minus two minutes, 30 seconds.

717
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:06,608
Jim.

718
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:09,361
What are we going to do?

719
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:12,364
- What?
- What? Up in the tower.

720
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:14,366
Frank. That wasn't him playing Tarzan.

721
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:17,586
That was treason.

722
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,954
I don't know what you're thinking.

723
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:20,339
I know this isn't my decision alone,

724
00:47:20,373 --> 00:47:22,374
but I do not think that
we should tell anyone.

725
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:26,178
I mean, he was just trying
to do the right thing,

726
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:27,846
whatever that is anymore.

727
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,382
I mean, I don't like lying
any better than you do,

728
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:32,601
but I just... I don't see
what the point would be

729
00:47:32,635 --> 00:47:34,803
in letting him rot in a jail cell.

730
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:37,889
Zero minus 90 seconds.

731
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:43,562
It was me.

732
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:48,066
What?

733
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:55,037
It wasn't Frank. It was me.

734
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:58,827
I gave the bomb to the Soviet Union.

735
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:01,997
I Thought...

736
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:05,217
I thought the world would be better...

737
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:06,752
after Sid.

738
00:48:08,421 --> 00:48:11,006
Oh, Jim.

739
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:12,841
- I thought I could...
- Oh, boy.

740
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:14,509
Control the variables.

741
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,595
Zero minus 60 seconds.

742
00:48:16,597 --> 00:48:20,232
It just... it just got away from me.

743
00:48:20,266 --> 00:48:23,819
But if I could take it back,

744
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:26,238
I swear to God...

745
00:48:26,272 --> 00:48:28,023
I'm sorry, Fritz.

746
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:31,076
I never wanted anyone to get hurt.

747
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,080
Wait, who got hurt?

748
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,087
Jeannie.

749
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:51,263
Wait, wait. Jeannie?

750
00:48:51,297 --> 00:48:52,681
What are you...

751
00:48:52,715 --> 00:48:54,800
Zero minus 30 seconds.

752
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:56,885
What do you mean, "Jeannie"?

753
00:48:56,936 --> 00:48:58,186
What do you...

754
00:48:58,221 --> 00:49:00,689
I'm sorry.

755
00:49:00,723 --> 00:49:01,773
I'm so sorry, Fritz.

756
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:03,275
It's just that...

757
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:05,027
- No.
- I'm sorry.

758
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:07,946
- No.
- She was going to tell everyone.

759
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:20,325
Jim?

760
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:23,328
Zero minus 30 seconds.

761
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,330
He deserved the truth.

762
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,403
See you on Jupiter?

763
00:51:12,973 --> 00:51:16,973
