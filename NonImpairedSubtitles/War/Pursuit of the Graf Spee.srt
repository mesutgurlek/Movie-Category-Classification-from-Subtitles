00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,860
On December 13th 1939, 200 miles
off the coast of South America,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,440
the first major naval battle of
World War Two exploded into action.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,780
Against overwhelming firepower,
three British ships took on the

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,720
pride of the German fleet, the
pocket battleship, Graf Spee.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,680
It would become known as the
Battle of the River Plate.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,180
The battle would pit two
great naval officers

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,900
against each other
in a deadly duel.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,700
Graf Spee was commanded by
Captain Hans Langsdorff,

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,500
a decorated hero from
the First World War.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,880
A thousand men owe their
lives to Langsdorff.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,980
Facing him was Commodore Henry
Harwood, a brilliant naval tactician.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,660
He had a happy knack of getting results
by being nice. People trusted him.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,500
As the world watched, the battle
moved ashore in a gripping story

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,660
of deception, and one of the biggest
bluffs of the Second World War.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,060
One of the commanders would be
decorated and return home a hero.

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,040
The other would lose his ship, his
reputation, and eventually his life.

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,140
In this battle we have good versus evil.

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,380
Weak versus strong.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,740
The weak triumph over the strong.

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,500
But the strong is represented by a
good man fighting for an evil cause.

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,460
He pays the price of this
impossible situation.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,060
It's a tragedy that most playwrights
could make a great deal from.

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,520
Tonight, Timewatch re-examines
the evidence and tells

24
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,080
the full story of the
Battle of the River Plate.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,074
-==[ www.OpenSubtitles.org ]==-

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,380
The Admiral Graf Spee was the
pride of the German navy.

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,500
Even before the Second World War had
begun, she was central to secret

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,400
plans for a guerre de corse, a
war against commerce at sea.

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,460
A special ship would
need a special captain.

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,300
The man chosen was one of the best
and most highly respected officers

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,540
in the German navy
- Captain Hans Langsdorff.

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,780
The great thing about Langsdorff was
that he was a very gentlemanly officer.

33
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,780
He was a very old style naval officer.

34
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,160
And he was a very
attractive figure as well.

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,500
Langsdorff came from a family of
lawyers and Lutheran pastors,

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,300
and had been brought up in
a strict moral tradition.

37
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,060
The Christian concept of the
world meant a lot to him,

38
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,960
as did morality.

39
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,480
These were the things which he valued.

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,580
He had thought about
becoming a vicar, which

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,180
the family would have
definitely approved of.

42
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,000
But on reflection, he
decided to join the navy.

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,820
When I reported to Captain Hans Langsdorff,

44
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,000
he struck me as someone who'd
had a humanistic education.

45
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,200
He was somewhat different from the image one
has of an officer in the imperial navy.

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,460
Langsdorff's Graf Spee was
nicknamed a pocket battleship.

47
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,860
It was boasted that she was
bigger than anything faster,

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,620
and faster than anything bigger.

49
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Her newly designed diesel
engines allowed her

50
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
to cruise for 16,000 miles
without refuelling.

51
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,520
Bristling with huge 11 inch guns, she was
capable of sinking ships 15 miles away.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,660
My father must have been really proud and
happy to be on such a beautiful ship.

53
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,640
Not only beautiful to look
at, but great in every way.

54
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,540
On August 21st 1939,

55
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,020
Graf Spee sailed quietly away from
her base in Wilhelmshaven, Germany.

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,940
On board were 1,134 crew.

57
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,460
Her departure was carefully
timed so that she would cross

58
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,820
the main shipping lanes at
night without being spotted.

59
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,260
When Britain declared war
on September the 3rd,

60
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,700
Germany already had an ace
hiding in the Atlantic.

61
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,640
Her orders were to act
as a lone surface raider

62
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,680
and to wreak havoc with
allied merchant shipping.

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,300
Langsdorff's intention was to
create as much chaos as he could.

64
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,440
So he'd sink something somewhere
and then motor away as

65
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,580
fast as he could somewhere
else to give the impression

66
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,500
there was more than one ship, and to
create as much chaos as possible.

67
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,300
In fact, the main aim was not so much
the physical damage that was involved

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,540
in sinking the ships, it was the
whole chaos that was inflicted on

69
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,780
shipping in this broad
area, shipping that was of

70
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,120
crucial importance to Britain's
survival in the war.

71
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,420
On September 30th, Graf Spee sank
the British steamship Clement.

72
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,900
But she got off a radio message
warning that she was being attacked.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,980
News of an unidentified
German raider in the South

74
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,060
Atlantic was met with swift
action at the Admiralty.

75
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,760
With merchant shipping
vital to the war effort,

76
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,460
Churchill made the German
raider his number one target.

77
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
20 warships were dispatched
to hunt her down.

78
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,340
Three of them were under the command
of Commodore Henry Harwood.

79
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,980
Henry Harwood is possibly the
archetypal cruiser Commodore.

80
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,580
He knew the area perfectly.

81
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,260
He'd served there before the war.

82
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,580
He knew it like the back
of his hand, and he had

83
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,900
thought long and hard before
the war about how to deal

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,220
with pocket battleships in general,
when he'd worked at the naval college

85
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,100
at Greenwich, and how to deal with them
in particular in South American waters.

86
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,280
Langsdorff could not have faced
a more formidable opponent.

87
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,620
Henry Harwood was a family man who had
joined the navy as a 15 year-old cadet.

88
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,200
In 1906, he passed out top of his class and
went on to serve in the First World War.

89
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,940
He was quite social.

90
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,660
He enjoyed country sports.

91
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,360
He was a good golfer.

92
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,700
He had a happy knack of getting
results by being nice.

93
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,140
People trusted him,

94
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,140
and his ship's company, I think, always...

95
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,760
realised that he required a high
standard and they gave a high standard.

96
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,940
Serving under Commodore Harwood
was 19 year-old Basil Trott.

97
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,580
He was a great skipper.

98
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,780
He was a great seaman.

99
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,020
He decided that when we left England,
we were going to be an efficient ship.

100
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,060
It didn't matter what time of the
day or night it was, if he was up,

101
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,780
he would think of something for us to do.

102
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,980
Action stations at midnight.

103
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,980
Lower a sea boat and try and pick up a
lifebuoy which he'd thrown over the side.

104
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,420
Lower all the pulling boats
and row them round the ship.

105
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,960
But he also used to stop
the ship in mid-Atlantic

106
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,500
and say, "Hands to
bathe", which was great.

107
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,420
You just dropped whatever you were
doing and leapt over the side.

108
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,180
Anyway, by the time we'd
been in commission six

109
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,940
months, we found he wasn't
really a bad old stick.

110
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,700
Commodore Harwood and Captain
Langsdorff were set on a very

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,160
public collision course, one which
would shape both their destinies.

112
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,180
In a deadly game of cat
and mouse, Langsdorff

113
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,200
continued to hunt allied
merchant shipping.

114
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,300
To cause the maximum confusion
possible, he now also began to

115
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,000
disguise his ship, adding a fake
gun turret and an extra funnel.

116
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,740
He played his sister ships.

117
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,140
In the South Atlantic, he
was the Admiral Scheer.

118
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,580
In the Indian Ocean, he was
the Admiral Graf Spee.

119
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,120
He made the allies think
there were a number of

120
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,660
German raiders around
when there was only one.

121
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,280
He played this game, and
I think he enjoyed it.

122
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,140
Apparently during the
entire trip, he took great

123
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,620
delight in avoiding being
found by the English ships.

124
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,580
To me, doing that seems almost boyish -

125
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,920
even though he was 45 years old by then.

126
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,980
Graf Spee next intercepted
the Newton Beach,

127
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,180
a British merchant ship.

128
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,020
To keep his position secret,
Langsdorff ordered the merchantman

129
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,100
not to use the radio to report
his presence or he'd open fire.

130
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,540
He then transferred her crew to the
Graf Spee, before sinking their ship.

131
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,840
On October the 7th, the
Ashley, carrying 7,300

132
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,140
tonnes of sugar, was
sent to the bottom.

133
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,940
Again, Langsdorff transferred
her crew to the Graf Spee.

134
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,620
He was worried about the fate of
the crews of the ships he sank.

135
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,860
And he would compromise his
own position, in fact,

136
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:49,180
in order to secure the lives
of the crews that he'd sunk.

137
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,620
In fact, one very touching
thing is the way that when

138
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,060
ships would not obey his
orders and still signal,

139
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,980
and he would shoot at them,
he would congratulate the

140
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,000
officers at the end to say,
"You did the right thing."

141
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,740
Throughout October and November,
Langsdorff led the British

142
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,340
a merry dance around the South
Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.

143
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,600
He continued to sink merchant shipping,
but insisted on saving lives.

144
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,900
Hans Langsdorff conducted
an outstanding cruiser war,

145
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,580
which in the form it took, was
unique in naval war history.

146
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,440
Unique, because he fulfilled
his task as a merchant raider.

147
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,800
And yet, during the deployment of the
ship, not a single human life was lost.

148
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,140
Because Graf Spee was a lone raider,
thousands of miles from home,

149
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,420
Langsdorff had strict orders from
Berlin not to attack other warships.

150
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,340
Hitler did not want to risk
losing his prize asset.

151
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,100
But these were orders that
went against the grain

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,960
for an old-school officer
like Langsdorff.

153
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,340
In his heart of hearts, he
considered this somehow insulting.

154
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,560
Which was clearly shown by what he said.

155
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,340
And my father also thought it dishonourable

156
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,160
to attack a much weaker opponent, who
had no chance of defence at all.

157
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,100
Graf Spee had been at sea for three months
and was coming to the end of her patrol.

158
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,280
Langsdorff was eager to
win a significant victory

159
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,460
over a British warship
before returning to Germany.

160
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,260
It is precisely because Graf Spee is
disappearing from the South Atlantic

161
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,180
and it cannot be foreseen when a second
commerce raider can operate here,

162
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,400
that it must be perceived to
have achieved an objectively

163
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,620
significant success
before leaving the area.

164
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,900
You can see from the war diary
that Langsdorff was getting

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,060
very frustrated at just
sinking merchant ships.

166
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,120
He wanted a victory over the
British before he went home.

167
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,420
By early December, Commodore Harwood's
cruiser Exeter, and his two light cruisers,

168
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,680
Ajax and Achilles, were
patrolling the South American

169
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,940
coast between Brazil and
the Falkland Islands.

170
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,120
Harwood, a tactical
expert, had a hunch as to

171
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,300
where Langsdorff might
eventually be found.

172
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,660
The idea had come to him on
a day out with his wife.

173
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,380
At the World Trade Fair,
he was transfixed by a map

174
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,100
which showed the shipping
routes in the South Atlantic,

175
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,260
and how they all focused on the Plate.

176
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,380
And he was so transfixed that
Mother, who was there at the time,

177
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,860
had great difficulty in
getting him away from it.

178
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,220
On December the 2nd, Graf Spee
sank the steamship Doric Star.

179
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,600
But not before she was
able to send the emergency

180
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,980
code signal announcing
she was being attacked.

181
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,020
Excuse me, sir. We've just had a...

182
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,280
For the first time, Harwood now
knew where the German raider was.

183
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,580
I've got here a rough
diagram which Father made

184
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,940
in making his plans for where Graf
Spee was after sinking Doric Star.

185
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,860
And various calculations
of her speed and probable

186
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,780
speeds and range, and
where she'd get to.

187
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,220
And he had three options.

188
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,020
One was to go to Rio, where
he'd get on the 12th,

189
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,380
one to the Plate for the 13th, or to
the Falkland Islands on the 14th.

190
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,500
So, it's quite an interesting little
bit of paper, which he sent home

191
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,900
to Mother, saying, "Keep
it, it is of interest."

192
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,220
Harwood's thinking that Langsdorff
would head for the River Plate,

193
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,800
is one of the most
classic examples of

194
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,380
inspired intuition, I
think, in naval history.

195
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,540
He knew, from his experience, that
the River Plate was a focal point.

196
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,300
That if there was a German raider
in the area, which it looked as

197
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,860
if there was because of
the sinkings, then it was

198
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,420
more than likely he would
come to the River Plate.

199
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,360
There was no code breaking,
there was no intelligence,

200
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,300
this was just inspired
professional instinct.

201
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,060
And he was absolutely right.

202
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,220
On December the 7th, Graf Spee
sank the another merchantman,

203
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
and captured secret documents
that revealed allied

204
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,980
convoys were forming off the
mouth of the River Plate.

205
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,720
It was the opportunity for a major victory
that Langsdorff had been looking for.

206
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,200
He presumed that these convoys were
protected by one or two destroyers.

207
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,360
But he didn't reckon on finding
Admiral Harwood's squadron there.

208
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,060
Graf Spee headed towards the River Plate.

209
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,300
Although neither Langsdorff
nor Harwood knew it,

210
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,620
they were now just 20 miles apart.

211
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,780
There was tension building up in the ship.

212
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,580
I mean, we knew that there was a German
raider and they were a modern ship.

213
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,020
And the equipment we had
was the same sort of

214
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,460
equipment that they had
in the First World War.

215
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,240
It was fairly hit and miss stuff.

216
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,420
It was in the early hours
of the morning, and

217
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,440
the commander was asleep
in a tower cabin.

218
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,760
And when the tops of the
masts could be made out...

219
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,920
..the commander was woken
and the alarm was sounded.

220
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,900
I don't think the sailors,
any of them, got their

221
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,820
breakfast from the galley,
when something was sighted,

222
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,280
and they sounded off action
stations on the bugle.

223
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,140
And I can feel the cold shiver now,

224
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,340
even sitting here, that I felt then.

225
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,620
What's going to happen?

226
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,660
Of course, we're all starting
up, "Whose joke is this?"

227
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,180
The commander's being funny.

228
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,820
We all turned out till
somebody's screaming,

229
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,220
"It's the real thing!"

230
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,860
A messenger went down to
Father in his cabin and

231
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,500
he said, "I think I've
heard that one before."

232
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,480
But nevertheless, he put
his uniform on over his

233
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,560
pyjamas, went up to the bridge,
and was there all day.

234
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,760
He waited for a moment, and then it became
increasingly clear that these were warships.

235
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,680
To begin with, he had assumed
them to be destroyers.

236
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,360
And then he said, very
calmly, ' "OK, let's do it."

237
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,420
The key moment is when Langsdorff
sights three British warships.

238
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,140
He chooses to engage. He
knows that that's going

239
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,860
against his basic orders
not to engage warships.

240
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,761
But he thinks that the
time has come to do it.

241
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,540
He could have got away.

242
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,980
His diesel engines allowed him to
accelerate away in the opposite direction.

243
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,120
He chose deliberately not to.

244
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,700
Had he realised in time that he
was faced with three cruisers,

245
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,400
he certainly would not
have engaged in battle.

246
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,180
It sounds very unfair really,
three ships versus one.

247
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,180
But yet the one ship has the advantage.

248
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,420
And you can see clearly
from here why it does.

249
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,660
It has got six guns that can
fire these huge 670lb shells.

250
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,280
One of these hitting you, you know about
it, as Exeter particularly found out.

251
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,500
Whereas the British ships, the two
smaller ones with the six-inch shells,

252
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,340
they can spew out large
numbers of these, but clearly

253
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,080
the effect of 100lbs hitting
you is going to be a

254
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,820
good deal less than the
effect of 670lbs hitting you.

255
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,600
All the British could hope to do
is to peck their enemies to death.

256
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,580
But Harwood had a brilliantly simple
plan, which now came into its own.

257
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,800
He was convinced that his
smaller ships could beat

258
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,020
a pocket battleship by
using a simple strategy.

259
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,980
He would split his ships into two flanks,

260
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,940
thus forcing Graf Spee to
make choices as to which

261
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,900
side to fire at, effectively
halving her firepower.

262
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,780
Poor old Graf Spee, throughout the Battle
of the River Plate, is firing at one ship.

263
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,380
And then at the other two ships.

264
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,620
One ship, the other two ships.

265
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,660
Its attention is entirely split.

266
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,560
And that worked absolutely brilliantly.

267
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,820
Harwood's tactics of dividing his
ships were revolutionary at the time.

268
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,980
But the plan called for the Exeter
to head straight for Graf Spee.

269
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,260
This exposed her to the full fury
of Langsdorff's 11-inch guns.

270
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,680
In the battle that followed,
Exeter took seven direct hits.

271
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,220
Some of us were directed up to
the bridge area, where a shell

272
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,940
had passed through what was known
as the remote control office.

273
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,220
And the people there were cut to ribbons.

274
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,660
And we had to sort of

275
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,900
really, I suppose, put people together.

276
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,720
You know...

277
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,740
Well, it's difficult just to sort
of talk about it, I suppose.

278
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,020
But there was a body here
and an arm over there.

279
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,600
And you knew that that arm
belonged to that body

280
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,280
because he had the right
buttons on his sleeve.

281
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,940
The Exeter was now a limping wreck.

282
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,120
Amazingly, Graf Spee did
not move in to sink her

283
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,300
and bring Langsdorff the
victory he had sought.

284
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,840
But for Kurt Diggins, the answer
lies in Langsdorff's character.

285
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,140
He didn't pursue the Exeter because the
Exeter had been rendered unfit for combat.

286
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,760
And it's possible that his own personal
attitude played a part here too.

287
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,960
Why sink a ship if it would entail
600 or 700 men losing their lives?

288
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,500
Graf Spee now turned her guns
on Harwood's other two ships.

289
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,420
Seven men were killed on
Ajax, four more on Achilles.

290
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,060
When you hear them land, there's
an almighty percussion.

291
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,660
Because we were down below in the
deck, and as you come down below,

292
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,200
there's a steel hatch,
and the steel hatch

293
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,740
there's around about 2ft
6 square, I suppose,

294
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,300
that we went down through.

295
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,420
And that's with a wired-up
lid, and that clang, stop.

296
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,980
And you were shut in down there.

297
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,020
I often thought afterwards, you know, it
came to you, then there's fear after.

298
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,580
"Hell, what if something had happened? How
the hell were we going to get out of there?"

299
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:12,140
At 7.40, after 80 minutes of
ferocious battle, Harwood ordered

300
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,180
the Ajax and Achilles to break off
the action under a smokescreen.

301
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,300
To Harwood's surprise,
Langsdorff didn't pursue,

302
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,500
but instead turned Graf Spee away.

303
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,180
Accurate British firing had taken
its toll on the German ship.

304
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,080
The impact was recorded by one
of Langsdorff's officers.

305
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,820
Above deck they have punished us severely.

306
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,620
What one sees there is disastrous.

307
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,980
When, from my control station, I
have to go to the command post

308
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,380
or to one of the gun turrets, I have
to cross the chief first aid post.

309
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,080
The floor is running with blood.

310
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,400
It made a huge impression on him.

311
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,900
There's one of those pictures
of him standing there,

312
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,920
his head bare, wearing a coat,
receiving the first reports.

313
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,180
He then walked through the ship and
visited the hospital below deck,

314
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,660
where the injured and also
some of the dead were laid.

315
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,920
And this made a profound impression on him.

316
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,300
Having finished his inspection
of the damage, Langsdorff

317
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,860
decided that his ship
urgently needed repairs.

318
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,160
He headed for the nearest major port,
Montevideo in neutral Uruguay.

319
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,360
It was a move that would
have grave consequences.

320
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,620
Langsdorff telegraphed Berlin
explaining his fateful decision.

321
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,020
36 killed, five seriously
wounded, 53 slightly wounded.

322
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,700
As ship cannot be made
seaworthy for breakthrough

323
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,880
to the homeland with means
on board, decided to go

324
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,160
into the River Plate, at
risk of being shut in there.

325
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,940
With Graf Spee's arrival
in the harbour, the Battle

326
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,660
of the River Plate turned
into the first great

327
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,000
media event of the war, as the world's
press arrived to cover the story.

328
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,020
First on the scene was local
reporter, 22 year-old Hugo Rocha.

329
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,300
The first assignment was to cover the
arrival of the ship on Wednesday night.

330
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,180
It was tremendously impressive. We had
never seen anything like that, especially

331
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,240
inside the harbour.

332
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,900
The second day, I went around
the ship with my photographer.

333
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,160
And my impression was of pity.

334
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,780
Pity. I knew that 36 of them had
died, that many more were wounded.

335
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,400
Most of the crew, I saw them,
were boys, 18, 19 years old.

336
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,420
We were very conscious that we were
suddenly part of the great world war

337
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,420
that had started three
months earlier in Europe,

338
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,420
that we were following
with passionate interest.

339
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,320
And that, suddenly, the
war was happening here.

340
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,020
The following morning, as the
cameras rolled, Langsdorff released

341
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,220
61 British merchant sailors
who had been held captive

342
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,520
on board Graf Spee after
their ships were sunk.

343
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,040
Langsdorff's next task
was to bury his dead.

344
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,780
Hundreds of German citizens
attend the ceremonies at the grave.

345
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,000
Captain Langsdorff watches in silence as the
boys he once commanded find final peace.

346
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,460
This is a good photo of
the Graf Spee, isn't it?

347
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,880
66 years after he first
sailed the seas around the

348
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,300
River Plate, Bob Batt and
fellow veteran Roy Dickey

349
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,080
return for the first time since 1939.

350
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,320
They have come back to
Montevideo for a memorial

351
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,040
service, and to remember
their fallen shipmates.

352
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,460
We actually collected together
62 bodies on that morning

353
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,440
and laid them out on the
forecastle for burial.

354
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,960
And the captain stood there with his
prayer book and read the burial service.

355
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,180
Then he said, "We now commit
their bodies to the sea."

356
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,560
And each one is then gently
allowed to slide over the side.

357
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,200
Reality came home to you that
you'd lost chaps that you knew.

358
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,720
It did come home to you, really.

359
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,080
I remember just watching
those bodies slide down...

360
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,100
..a plank.

361
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,680
Pipes and what have you. No,
it does come home to you.

362
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,100
It's a very moving moment.

363
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,420
I don't think you ever
really sort of get over it.

364
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,320
It's something you like to try and forget.

365
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,540
The morning after the battle, it
was headline news across Britain.

366
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,980
"Here is the news.

367
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,140
"There has been an
important naval engagement

368
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,300
between a German
pocket battleship

369
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,220
"and three British cruisers
in the South Atlantic."

370
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,860
I was at prep school in my last year,
and Stephen was in his first year.

371
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,820
And we were rehearsing a play, in which
fortunately I had a very minor part.

372
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,420
And I remember one of the masters
coming in with the evening papers

373
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,140
and I saw them, and I was very frightened.

374
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,220
But the news was good.

375
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,620
Commodore Harwood had been knighted
and promoted to Rear Admiral.

376
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,580
Churchill obviously and
rightly wanted to make

377
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,380
much of what really was the first
British victory in the war.

378
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,460
And he did this in spades. I mean,

379
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,260
he promoted Father immediately.

380
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,540
He had him made a Knight
Commander of the Bath.

381
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,740
He made the captains
Commanders of the Bath.

382
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,900
And BBC, press, full of it, etc, etc.

383
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,060
It was rather unkind, because Father said,

384
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,540
"Here we were, showered with honours
and the job not completed."

385
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,620
The first half of the story
is a classical naval battle.

386
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,700
The second half of the story is
a story of guile and deception,

387
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,760
and perhaps one of the biggest
bluffs of the Second World War.

388
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,200
In Montevideo, Langsdorff requested a
meeting with the Uruguayan government.

389
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,180
Accompanied by the German minister,
Langsdorff was seeking permission to

390
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,040
stay in the port for two weeks
to complete repairs to his ship.

391
00:30:53,560 --> 00:31:00,300
The Uruguayans eventually agreed to permit
him to stay for a maximum of four days.

392
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,280
Outside the harbour, the
British force was now reduced

393
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,360
to two small cruisers,
the Achilles and Ajax.

394
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,740
Harwood was concerned that
without reinforcements he would

395
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,180
not be able to stop Graf Spee
if she made a run for it.

396
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,980
A plan had to be found to ensure
Langsdorff was kept in Montevideo longer.

397
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,740
The man given responsibility
for this was the

398
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,500
senior British diplomat,
Eugene Millington-Drake.

399
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,500
My grandfather was a great eccentric,
and a very colourful character.

400
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,700
He was known for his enthusiasm for taking
exercise and he was a great sportsman.

401
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,460
And he would walk down

402
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,700
the street and possibly stop suddenly

403
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,600
on the way to the office, and do a
few press-ups or a few stretches.

404
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,820
Millington-Drake quietly recruited
a band of British pensioners

405
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,540
and sent them down to the harbour
to spy on the new arrival.

406
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,340
He then went to meet the
Uruguayan foreign minister.

407
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,740
And in a cunning move, invoked an
international law, called the 24 hour rule.

408
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,940
If a merchant ship sailed, a foreign warship
was not allowed to sail within 24 hours.

409
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,860
And the British used this mercilessly
to try and keep Graf Spee

410
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,640
in Montevideo, much to the disgust
of the Uruguayan government.

411
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,340
Millington-Drake secretly
arranged for a British

412
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,620
merchant ship to leave
Montevideo every day.

413
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,460
Eventually the Uruguayans got
so frustrated that they said,

414
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,140
"You aren't allowed to send
any more ships to sea."

415
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,640
Because they could see how they were
being manipulated by the British.

416
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,460
Undaunted,
Millington-Drake and Naval

417
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,520
Intelligence kept up the
pressure on Langsdorff.

418
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,220
The British knew that their telephone
line was tapped by the Germans.

419
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,840
Well, it's a matter
of some urgency.

420
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,500
A call was deliberately put in
to the ambassador in Buenos Aires,

421
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,240
pretending to arrange for the imminent
arrival of two more heavy British warships.

422
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,760
As anticipated, the call was intercepted by
German intelligence and reported to Berlin.

423
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,060
The British also leaked
the story to the press.

424
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,000
The Germans were convinced
that Harwood had major

425
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,040
reinforcements arriving
in the River Plate.

426
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,460
Millington-Drake had been
pulling the strings again.

427
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,440
He was, as I like to put it...
"The man behind the curtain."

428
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,000
And he was very good at it.

429
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,560
My grandfather would have
loved the cloak and dagger

430
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,700
element of the diplomatic
battle, of the drama.

431
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,340
In particular,

432
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,340
the need to create a lot of false
intelligence which would cause the Germans

433
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,420
to think that there is a huge
force out there waiting.

434
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,460
Langsdorff and his officers became
totally of the view, that if they

435
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,460
went out of the Plate they would run
into a much more powerful force.

436
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,360
The deception had worked brilliantly.

437
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,120
And now time had run out for Langsdorff.

438
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,260
Despite his appeals, the Uruguayan
government insisted Graf Spee

439
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,700
had to leave Montevideo before
eight o'clock, Sunday evening.

440
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,960
A second battle now seemed inevitable.

441
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,260
It was clear from the outset
that whatever was to happen,

442
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,320
were the ship to leave the
harbour and engage in

443
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,480
battle, one way or another
it meant destruction.

444
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,860
Langsdorff signalled Berlin, explaining his
predicament and asking for instructions.

445
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,500
Inside Montevideo, we have Langsdorff,

446
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,940
who is increasingly worried about the
presence of allied capital ships.

447
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,200
Outside the harbour, we have
Harwood, who is only too

448
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,460
aware that those capital
ships have not turned up and

449
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,140
are miles away, and is very, very
concerned that if Langsdorff does

450
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,400
come out he'll be able to get
by him, out into the open

451
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,760
ocean, and he'll be lost,
and he might even get home.

452
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:47,440
On board HMS Ajax, Harwood wrote of
his fears in a letter to his family.

453
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,060
"I have a most difficult
problem to catch him again.

454
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,160
"And if he escapes, all
the good we have done

455
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,260
will be upset. Not
all, but a lot of it.

456
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,740
"The mouth of the Plate
is wide and there are

457
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,220
so many ways out that
it's very difficult.

458
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,260
"Probably another battle, and who knows?

459
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,060
"I hope for the best.

460
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,600
"You'll know by the time you get this."

461
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,620
If the worst happens, bring
my sons up to be men.

462
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,180
Everybody was waiting for the
battle to continue, naturally.

463
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,020
That was the assumption.

464
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,000
It's an unfinished battle.

465
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,820
The Graf Spee cannot remain

466
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,860
in Montevideo. The British
are waiting outside,

467
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,960
the German has to leave the port,
naturally a clash has to occur.

468
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,900
To begin with, nobody knew
what was going to happen.

469
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,620
Is the Graf Spee going to set sail again?

470
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,260
Will the Graf Spee try to
reach another harbour?

471
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,400
Will the ship engage in
battle with the English

472
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,540
ships anchored off the
River Plate estuary?

473
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,460
What is going to happen?

474
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,740
The pressure on Langsdorff
was becoming intolerable.

475
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,300
Again, he signalled
Berlin for instructions.

476
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,900
The reply was not helpful.

477
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,700
He was ordered not to let the
ship fall into enemy hands,

478
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,320
but was given no direct orders
as to what action to take.

479
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,060
Why Langsdorff did what
he did next is one of

480
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,400
the enduring mysteries
of the Second World War.

481
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,720
But Timewatch has, for
the first time, been

482
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,960
given access to Langsdorff's
personal archive.

483
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,080
For 66 years, his daughter
has kept his last letter

484
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,500
home hidden away, secret
even from her own children.

485
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,180
"I am writing this letter on my last
day as commander of this proud ship.

486
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,900
"My decision was not an easy one, but
two rules served as guiding principles.

487
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,740
"Firstly, being prepared to
take on any responsibility

488
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,260
"as long as there was the slightest
chance of harming the enemy.

489
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,380
"Secondly, the dispassionate
consideration not to send my men

490
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,160
"to their deaths unnecessarily,
but to maintain the

491
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,040
ship's honour and the
flag's honour to the last."

492
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,880
The Graf Spee slowly started
moving, just at sunset.

493
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,580
It was very theatrical, you know.

494
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,740
It was a beautiful summer day.

495
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,500
Half the population of Montevideo,

496
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,840
hundreds of thousands of people, was
concentrated along the Ramblas.

497
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,560
Langsdorff's final showdown with
Harwood now seemed inevitable.

498
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,780
But as the crowds watched, most
of her crew was transferred

499
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,920
to tugboats before the pocket
battleship slowly left the harbour.

500
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,660
I remember this precisely.

501
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,380
19.55, 7.55.

502
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,340
The disc of the sun was slowly sinking on

503
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,780
the ocean.

504
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,780
And then

505
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,580
the sound,

506
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,180
an explosion, which at first
it seemed like a cannon.

507
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,340
People thought the battle had started.

508
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,820
Others said, "No, that's
only a smokescreen."

509
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,340
No, actually it was a suicide.

510
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,040
It was a suicide.

511
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,520
The German ship was committing suicide.

512
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,980
Langsdorff, outmanoeuvred,
believed all was lost.

513
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,740
With no clear orders forthcoming from
Berlin, he disembarked the rest of his crew

514
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,240
and scuttled the Graf Spee.

515
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,540
The English have managed to
surround us in such a way

516
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,220
that leaving to engage in
battle with an opponent

517
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,720
overwhelmingly superior to us
would lead to our certain demise.

518
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,360
I think this was the deciding
factor for Langsdorff.

519
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,780
His conscience told him that it was
pointless to sacrifice the lives

520
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,720
of 1,000 young men in pursuit of
a task that could not succeed.

521
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,100
If he sailed, he was facing certain death.

522
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,360
And a death that would
mean dishonour, because

523
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,620
the ship might well
sink in shallow water.

524
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,160
and a lot of his secret equipment,
especially his radar, be captured.

525
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,820
The Battle of the River Plate

526
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,040
was over.

527
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,920
Harwood and his men would
return home as heroes.

528
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,180
Everyone wants to see these men who
gave the Graf Spee such a beating.

529
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,340
A memorable day for Londoners able
to watch the sailors march past.

530
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,340
The sinking of the Graf
Spee was hugely important.

531
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,180
It was the first major naval
victory of the war, and was

532
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,820
immediately used to full effect
by the allied propaganda machine.

533
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,820
And I may add,

534
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,140
that in a dark, cold winter,

535
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:58,200
it warmed the cockles of the British heart.

536
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,360
Langsdorff took his crew across
the River Plate to Buenos Aires.

537
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,580
On arrival, he was branded a coward
by the press for not taking the

538
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,700
fight back to the British, even
though the odds were against him.

539
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,820
When he landed in Buenos Aires,
he came under great pressure

540
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,220
from the press as to why had
he come to Buenos Aires.

541
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,740
And the pressures on the man must
have been absolutely unbearable.

542
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,100
He knew, that on his personal
decision, he had thrown

543
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,460
away one of the Germany
navy's greatest assets.

544
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,820
That instead of a victory,
he'd suffered a defeat.

545
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,580
And it was understandable,
therefore, that he

546
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,440
would decide that there
was only one way out.

547
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,160
Saying goodbye to me in
Montevideo when I was

548
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,580
transferred, he said, "Say
hello to Germany for me.

549
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,000
"Say hello to my family."

550
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,840
There's a lot in that sentence.

551
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,760
That was a truly moving moment for me
when he said this, and said goodbye.

552
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,680
On December the 19th,
Langsdorff gathered his

553
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,940
crew together in Buenos
Aires and assured them

554
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,000
they were now safe and
would be looked after.

555
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,820
That evening, he joined fellow
officers in the senior ratings mess

556
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,360
of the arsenal building where
they had been stationed.

557
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,260
He was said to have been at
ease and in good spirits.

558
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,940
He then retired to his room and
wrote a letter home to his family.

559
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,180
It would be his last.

560
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,540
"Now, deep down inside me
I am happy and content.

561
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,620
"Everything is being prepared
and I have the peace and quiet

562
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,400
"in which to write you this letter,
to bid you farewell and thank you."

563
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,880
"If this is God's will, then
I shall cheerfully meet

564
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,460
my death, despite life
having been so dear to me.

565
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,320
"Because it gave me all
that it had to offer."

566
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,740
Then there are some very
personal lines, and then

567
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,060
in conclusion my father
writes, "Be proud in your

568
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,860
"grief, and prove yourself
to be a true soldier's wife.

569
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,540
"Give my love to Jochan and Inge."

570
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,960
And then his signature.

571
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,600
It still moves me.

572
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:54,320
Some time in the early hours of the morning,
Captain Hans Langsdorff shot himself.

573
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,140
The captain of the pocket
battleship Graf Spee was

574
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,780
buried with full naval
honours in Buenos Aires.

575
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,520
His officers and crew were
joined by Argentine armed

576
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,260
forces in forming a guard of
honour through the streets.

577
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,540
German and Argentine dignitaries
stood next to representatives

578
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,120
of the British merchant sailors
whose lives Langsdorff had spared.

579
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:34,660
The Battle of the River Plate was the first
great media event of the Second World War.

580
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,380
The world looked on as Langsdorff
made his fateful decisions.

581
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,140
Many branded him a coward for not leaving
Montevideo with all guns blazing.

582
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,540
I think, in a way,

583
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,500
Langsdorff was more
heroic doing what he did

584
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,100
than going out and immolating himself
at the hands of the British.

585
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,220
Because Langsdorff was very conscious
that the young men in his crew should

586
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:07,000
not pay the price for his error, for
his disobedience, for his mistake.

587
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,220
I maintain that Langsdorff's
decision was the

588
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,900
correct one at the
time, that it was the

589
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,040
correct one later on, and that it
remains the correct one today.

590
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,080
A thousand men owe their
life to Langsdorff.

591
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,820
But Langsdorff was only
one of many victims.

592
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,900
A total of 108 men lost
their lives that day.

593
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,180
66 years later, survivors from both sides
joined together in a cemetery in Montevideo

594
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,100
to remember those who fell in
the Battle of the River Plate.

595
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,100
They shall grow not old, as we
are that are left grow old.

596
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,700
Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.

597
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,860
At the going down of the sun and in
the morning, we will remember them.

598
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,120
We will remember them.
