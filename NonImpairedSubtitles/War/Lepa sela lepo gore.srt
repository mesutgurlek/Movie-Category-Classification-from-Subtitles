117
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:35,965  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

131
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:53,405  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

139
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,995  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

This roadhouse hasn't been
touched by the war.

144
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:56,843  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

148
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:10,236  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Want Uncle Velja to shoot one
over your sniveling head, eh?

149
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:14,321  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

151
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:20,919  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hey there all you

154
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,243  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But she only likes
the seriously wounded,

155
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:32,121  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

156
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:54,040  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't touch him...
Don't!

157
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,125  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did you hear what he said?
Don't make me get up!

158

162
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,681  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's wrong?

163

166
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:54,725  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Why? What's he doing?

167
00:17:55,887 --> 00:18:00,005  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Mother, why are you
acting this way?

168
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,360  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Excuse me, ma'am,

169
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
a dangerous Muslim stronghold
right around here!

170
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:12,802  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
So, if you could just

171
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,682  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
There's no one left here.
-Thanks for your kindness, ma'.

172
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:20,397  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

173
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,878  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When l die and

175
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:32,283  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Stay, just a little
bit more!

176
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:46,236  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who's the Serbian
champion? Brazil!

177
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:53,525  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

178

Shit, they've got everything,
you'd think they were Swedes!

179
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:02,916  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hey, there's no rest for
the hard-working!

181
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:10,804  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
to the Japanese for a refund,
the fan belt's stuck!

182
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:15,279  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What're you staring at?
Want me to get you a drill?

183
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:19,725  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Tell us, what's your

184
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:23,204  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
'Streets of Fire'!

185
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,763  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Lift a little. Not that
side, the other one.

186
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:34,642  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
A little more...
Now nail it.

187
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,885  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

-Cut the baloney, nail it.

189
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:43,926  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What've you done, man?
Raise the other side,

190
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:47,523  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
it's crooked again. -That's
it, l'm through hanging it!

191
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:50,407  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look what you did!
-What did l do? What?

192
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:55,158  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
See, it's fucked up! -Who's
gonna look at the sign?

193
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:59,002  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Whoever comes to have his car
fixed will look at it!

194
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:01,278  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
He'll just look at it.

195
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,677  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who's gonna look?
-No one has to look.

196
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:08,125  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Mom! Bring the brandy,
we're ready to roll!

197
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,680  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here's to your health,
boys, and lots of luck!

198
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,083  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Cheers!

199
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:18,796  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Say, isn't that sign
a bit crooked?

200
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,237  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Mom, don't go and
spoil our premiere.

201
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:26,806  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here comes Sloba! -Remember
me when the money starts

202
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:30,966  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
pouring in, you bloody
capitalists! -Help yourself.

203
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:33,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here, we brought the beer.

204
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:51,800  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's take their picture
before they get smashed!

205
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:05,196  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's wrong now? -Seems to me
the sign's a little crooked!

206
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:11,840  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sure as hell. -Come one,

207
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:16,524  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But my artistic nature...
-Take the picture, please!

208
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:20,683  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fuck the art, just
pull the trigger.

209
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:30,084  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milan! Why'd you do that?

210
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:34,403  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Go on, scram!
-Where?

211
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:38,806  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You know that all this
is yours and mine now!

212
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:43,603  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did that bum Halil send
you to guard his house?

213
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:49,963  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
All right, Milan,
what's wrong?

214
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:56,001  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Take it easy!
-Go away.

215
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You screwed up, prick!

216
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:11,801  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who fired?
-l fired!

217
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,362  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who are you to be judge
and jury here?

218
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,439  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ls that why you bear arms?

219
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:19,275  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
This'll get you a court
martial. You're finished!

220
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:22,485  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
He did it!
Arrest him!

221
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:26,880  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hush, hush...
Suck, suck...

222
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:31,958  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What're you looking at!
-Humpty Dumpty.

223
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,557  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Humpty Dumpty.

224
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,277  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
He's right, Captain. How can
they light a fire in this heat.

225
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,240  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Humpty Dumpty.

226
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:52,080  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where did you fight,
damn it, in Disneyland?!

227
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:55,963  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Humpty Dumpty.

228
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:58,887  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Humpty bloody Dumpty

229
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:03,085  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
sat on the wall,
scratching his ball...

230
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:08,119  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hurry up, man! l've put
this shit on three times,

231
00:23:08,447 --> 00:23:11,041  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
it keeps evaporating!
-One-one... This will do!

232
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:14,484  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's fine. -Shit,

233
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,678  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Stick them up your ass...
Lauda!

234
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:20,444  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hi there, Nazim! -You'll be
a postman like your dad!

235
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,156  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Get rid of that and come
into town for a beer!

236
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,364  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fuck off!

237
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:30,403  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Humpty bloody Dumpty...
Hurry it up, Lauda!

238
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:39,799  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's hear those
Belgrade assholes!

239
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:43,604  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
One, two, and a one,
two three.

240
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:47,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hit it, Lauda!

241
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:08,201  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
'You want to love, but
don't know how to kiss,

242
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:13,117  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
come on honey,
give me a little bit.'

243
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,717  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's go, boys, no dawdling.

244
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:19,244  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
There's no rest
for the hard-working!

245
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,604  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Shall we go into
the tunnel? -Not me!

246
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:27,244  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Aunt Fanny was just
kidding. Follow me.

247
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:32,317  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l wouldn't go see
that Ogre in the tunnel

248
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:35,605  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
for a barrel of beer.
Not for any money.

249
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:38,805  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did you see?
-No. Let's go up.

250
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:45,164  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do you boys have any money
for this mountain climbing?

251
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:50,805  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We do. -J ust asking.
Say, what's your name?

252
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:54,284  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Halil. -Come on, Halil,
how about a fill!

253
00:24:54,607 --> 00:24:57,041  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But Aunt Fanny, we just
want to have a peek.

254
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,119  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You won't get far
from just peeking!

255
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:02,285  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l don't want to!
-No shilly-shallying now.

256
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:06,037  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't! Don't!
-Quiet, this is erotic!

257
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:11,836  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look, a real scout's winkie!

258
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:25,641  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What are you doing,
you bumhead?!

259
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,758  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How can l pick up
girls like this?

260
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,555  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look what you did!
-What'd l do?

261
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:36,675  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll get you for this!

262
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,880  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now you'll see
how Musa skins a goat!

263
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:47,166  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Musa can roll
my dick's overcoat!

264
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:56,561  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
'All of Yugoslavia's
dancing rock'n'roll,

265
00:25:57,287 --> 00:26:01,405  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
while everything around us
is going down the hole...'

266
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:34,444  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm going up! -Captain,
Mascot's screaming!

267
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:37,725  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fork, go get him.
Velja, too.

268
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:50,678  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Veljaaa! -We're not deaf,
you moron!

269
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:53,923  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You really have
a closet-phobia, Kid!

270
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:56,682  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Want a bazooka to finish
it off? -What happened?

271
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:59,965  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Nothing. The kid's just
leaving tracks.

272
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:03,922  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Marko, let Uncle Velja give
you some candy.

273
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:07,245  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You give me that little gun
and l'll give you some candy.

274
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:11,958  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Take the kid out of here.
-Let's go, kid.

275
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:16,246  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How'd l shoot?
-You did.

276
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:22,876  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milan, come and
see something.

277
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:33,356  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did you finish, Marko?
Go on, off with you!

278
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:38,966  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
SERBlA TO TOKYO

279
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,203  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
These are prisoners of war.
No one is to touch them.

280
00:29:17,607 --> 00:29:19,438  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ls that clear?
-Yes sir!

281
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,000  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look, a fresh Muslim.

282
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:28,637  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They're reinforcing.

283
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We should make
a counter attack.

284
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:36,166  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's retreat, Milan
... like men.

285
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:39,123  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You go first,

286
00:29:39,847 --> 00:29:43,522  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll follow.

287
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:49,245  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Nice looking Muslim, young.

288
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:53,003  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How old do you think he is?

289
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:56,040  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Old enough.

290
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:14,358  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where's Sloba?
-ln the warehouse.

291
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:30,484  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm so sorry
we couldn't find you.

292
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:32,758  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What did they do to her?

293
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:36,563  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
A group of Muslims
attacked at night.

294
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:40,842  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The bastards swam
across the Drina.

295
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:45,359  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Went through the village
like wildfire. -Sloba!

296
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:47,757  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We looked for you everywhere.
-Did you hear what l asked?

297
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:54,200  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We buried her yesterday
next to your father.

298
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,838  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Everything was done properly.

299
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:06,319  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And we caught two Muslims
alive. -How did they kill her?

300
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:11,159  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They said they were from
Halil's detachment.

301
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:16,439  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
While they could still talk.

302
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:22,038  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
So, you just think about
guarding his house again.

303
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,806  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hear?

304
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:39,401  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l should have killed
you back then.

305
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:42,327  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You can now
if you want to.

306
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:46,527  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hear?

307
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:57,686  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
War's a whore...

308
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:03,438  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where are you going with
that shovel? Are you crazy?

309
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:10,878  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do you speak English?

310
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:53,517  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
BOSNlA TO TOKYO

311
00:32:57,287 --> 00:33:00,996  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
CHETNlK MAMA.

312
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,676  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Why don't you
leave him alone?

313
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:28,403  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

314
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:35,085  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
For good.

315
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,678  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And this here's New York!

316
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:43,479  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did you know that more
people live in New York

317
00:33:43,807 --> 00:33:46,002  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
than all the Serbs
put together.

318
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,927  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Although l never stole
anything in New York.

319
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:52,677  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You're young,
there's still time.

320
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,796  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
There's a prophesy that says
just enough Serbs will be left

321
00:33:57,207 --> 00:34:01,803  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
to stand under a pear tree.
-ln that case everyone else

322
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:06,803  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
will be standing under
a dandelion witj no crowding.

323
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:13,441  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Thank heavens we're under
a pear tree right now.

324
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:47,437  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sumadinac!
Where's our cover?!

325
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:51,078  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll get even of
l make it out!

326
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:07,555  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Kid!

327
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:11,243  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Get your fat ass
over here!

328
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:23,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's stuck!
-Hold on, Professor!

329
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:30,040  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Brother-in-law!
-Lie down and shut up!

330
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:34,356  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l don't want my sister wasting
money on widow's weeds!

331
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:45,235  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Run over here! Run!

332
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,876  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Head down that way!
There's an abandoned tunnel!

333
00:35:56,247 --> 00:36:00,604  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Tunnel? -Yes, go hide inside!
Take the Professor.

334
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:04,084  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milan, how's Mascot?
-He's alive! Get going!

335
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:08,639  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Professor, move your ass!
Move, motherfucker!

336
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:16,359  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Get over here!

337
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:29,366  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Are you nuts?

338
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:31,365  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Run, the kid's had it! Run!

339
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:40,563  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Little Chetnik!
lt won't hurt a bit.

340
00:36:40,887 --> 00:36:44,516  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You'll just go to sleep.
-l'll sleep on your sister,

341
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:46,883  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
on your mother...

342
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:51,240  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We can't go any farther.
-Yes, we can.

343
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:08,124  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do you give up?
-Nope. -Someone has to.

344
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,802  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You do it.
-You do it.

345
00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:19,605  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hang on, bro'!

346
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:25,918  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What if they're on
the other side?

347
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l bet you 50 marks
they're not. -Too much.

348
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:32,286  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What if a train comes along?
-Shut up! -Scared shitless?

349
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:35,041  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Kurtalici was the name
of that village?

350
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:38,558  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who cares, moron,
get in there!

351
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:16,436  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
All that's missing here
is dead Chetniks.

352
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:19,521  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't tempt the devil.

353
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:40,406  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Those circumcised bastards
will screw us

354
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:43,560  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
if they sniff us out.

355
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:50,119  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where'd you get this
tunnel? -l don't know.

356
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:55,161  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l never dared go
in it before.

357
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:56,881  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Maybe now wasn't
the time, either.

358
00:38:57,247 --> 00:39:01,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sumadinac, come in.
Do you hear me, damn it?

359
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:06,358  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where are you?
Answer me.

360
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:11,235  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come in, Sumadinac.

361
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:18,398  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll have your Sumadinac
for breakfasr.

362
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:23,443  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We're in the neighborhood.
How about some coffee?

363
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:26,839  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Scared shitless, rats?

364
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:38,120  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Dear Chetniks,
Chamil speaking.

365
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:42,036  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We're not going to split up
now that the fun has started!

366
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,086  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We will impregnate
your mothers!

367
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:52,998  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Turn that shit off.
-Chetniiiks! ! !

368
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:05,567  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Showtime, boys!

369
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:04,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now let's play hide-and-seek.

370
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:08,122  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Chetniks hide first!
1 0, 9, 8...

371
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:16,365  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Last one yo hide
will be my bride!

372
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:28,963  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come to play!
-No cheating!

373
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,999  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Asshoooles!

374
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:37,802  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where are you,
bustards?

375
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:44,599  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn peasants, sleeping as
on their Mother Goose bosoms.

376
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:51,684  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l was the one with noble
hands before this shit.

377
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:58,280  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn this tunnel and
whoever brought us here.

378
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:03,921  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm the one who screwed up.

379
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:06,796  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What can l do now?
-Nothing.

380
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:11,240  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Knit us some socks
to ward off the cold.

381
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:15,475  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Are you asking for
trouble, maybe?

382
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,326  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't shoot, it's Speedy!

383
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:31,997  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Bro', let's bet
30 marks he'll pass!

384
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:35,405  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's too much!

385
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:39,119  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Up yours!

386
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,955  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn them all to hell!

387
00:42:56,447 --> 00:42:59,519  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did you see my home run!

388
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:06,481  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm sopping wet,
is anyone thirsty?

389
00:43:06,927 --> 00:43:09,441  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Anyone got a stub?

390
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,118  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Light up,
you'll feel better.

391
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:21,356  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How'd you find us, Speedy?
-l couldn't miss a good party.

392
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,844  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l heard you calling for
Mommy on the two-way.

393
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:26,805  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When are the others
coming?

394
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:29,397  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When they get around to it.
-Get around to it!?

395
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:32,407  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Didn't you
call headquarters?

396
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:35,116  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
One question at a time.

397
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:37,319  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
First question, dummy.

398
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,997  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ls anyone going to get us
out of this shit or not?

399
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:44,326  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well, guys...
What can l say?

400
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:56,006  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Nothing.

401
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:03,963  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sumadinac! Gvozden here...

402
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:10,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Yo, Chetties! The truck
driver's not bad.

403
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:15,081  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We'll bury him
with the spare parts!

404
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:36,843  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We've stuck our pricks
in a wasps' nest!

405
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:42,520  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's make a strategy to
vanish out of here, Big Serbs!

406
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:50,516  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Not a bad party,
eh, Doctor?

407
00:44:50,927 --> 00:44:55,045  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn it, the doctor!
l forgot about her!

408
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:00,245  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hold your fire!

409
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:03,764  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn me to hell!

410
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:08,365  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How could l forget!
Doctor! Doctor!

411
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,079  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fork, keep an eye
on the Muslims!

412
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:19,525  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And you, don't lose
your cool! Enough!

413
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:23,363  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm cool, Captain!

414
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:50,838  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't rely on my English.

415
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,801  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She said she made a mistake,
it was a misunderstanding...

416
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:58,041  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look, a Muslim visa. -She's
sorry she hid in my truck,

417
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:01,366  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
she knows she broke the law
and will be punished,

418
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,525  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
but she's asking us
to let her go.

419
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:11,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look, she's as freckled
as a turkey's egg.

420
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:15,843  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She says she's sorry, eh?

421
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:19,165  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You'll be sorrier
than you think!

422
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:23,242  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Wait a minute, folks...
-What are you staring at?

423
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:29,483  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milk her for informations.
-She's skinny. Let's skin her.

424
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:33,880  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She'll say we did it,
anyway.

425
00:46:47,447 --> 00:46:49,756  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look, '7-1 1 '!

426
00:46:54,807 --> 00:46:57,002  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's gotten into you?
-What're you doing?

427
00:46:57,407 --> 00:47:00,638  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Beating her. -She's resisting
a routine inspection.

428
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:04,397  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No, you like other people's
things. Give that back.

429
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,444  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Take my place for a while,
you two.

430
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,759  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look, she really is
a stinking journalist.

431
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:17,563  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ls that how you always treat
women? -Only foreigners.

432
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:20,236  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did you every screw anything
outside your village?

433
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:23,804  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fuck off, man!

434
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:26,767  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How they love spanking!

435
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:37,605  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let the whore go. Anyway,
if she stays with us, boys...

436
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:43,087  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Laza, what was it l told you?
-We'll fill her with tadpoles.

437
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:49,397  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where the hell
are you going?

438
00:47:59,727 --> 00:48:02,241  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn stupid chick!

439
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:14,243  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Bring her here!

440
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:17,804  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
My, what fluent English,
she understood everything!

441
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:20,556  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's tie her up!

442
00:48:22,087 --> 00:48:25,921  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's she dreaming about?
-America.

443
00:48:26,247 --> 00:48:32,038  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Say, do you think she has
freckles all over her body?

444
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:37,239  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll bet you 20 marks
she has. -That's too much.

445
00:48:41,647 --> 00:48:44,605  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What are you staring at?

446
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:48,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She's not for you,
she's cultured.

447
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:52,237  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's nicer with culture.
-How about some respect.

448
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:57,116  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Lift her up.

449
00:48:58,327 --> 00:49:01,080  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt just slipped out.

450
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:27,605  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Boys, this is all we have.
A liter and a half of water.

451
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:35,240  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Professor, don't gulp that
water, we'll need it.

452
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:39,481  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Speedy, you're in charge of
that. -Yes, sir, Comrade Tito.

453
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:43,765  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Captain, what'd they teach
you at military school?

454
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:46,555  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How long will 1 -1/2 liters
last for Snow White

455
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:48,883  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and the Seven Dwarfs?

456
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:53,202  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm not thirsty.

457
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:09,396  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Go ahaead, make fun of me.

458
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:21,039  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You drink like a sissy.

459
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:30,845  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn it, like it's
your last! -God forbid!

460
00:50:32,087 --> 00:50:34,885  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Not coke, just water.

461
00:50:52,087 --> 00:50:54,043  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Stop that, idiot.
Don't waste water on her.

462
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:58,162  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What are you, Mother Teresa?
-Yo, bro'!

463
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:02,116  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Those stinking journalists
are to blame for this shit!

464
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:11,085  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn it, after a year of war
without a scratch

465
00:51:11,407 --> 00:51:16,322  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and look at this crater now.
-You'll be fine.

466
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:20,162  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You'll pickpocket with
your right hand.

467
00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:23,763  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll get even with her...
-Don't move!

468
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:30,759  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's she shitting about?
-She wants to help.

469
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:34,039  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But you'll have to untie her.

470
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:36,722  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf she comes near me
l'll strangle her!

471
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,482  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf she starts for your cock,
shall l let her?

472
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:42,720  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well... l'll tear her
to bits!

473
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:47,563  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Laza, slaughter this bitch!
-Too bad they didn't hit

474
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:50,481  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
your mouth, you wouldn't
bullshit so much!

475
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,116  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Relax with some music.

476
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:57,924  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here's 'Helmut Khol's
Got a Beautiful Hole'!

477
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:08,365  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf l only had a healthy vein
like that! Tell the doctor...

478
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:17,596  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sure is nice when a man's
dreams come true.

479
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:22,043  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
His whole life he dreamed of
having a needle in his vein

480
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:26,246  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
round the clock, and look!
He made it!

481
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:29,639  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's nice
when someone succeeds,

482
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:35,087  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
but it should be shared with
your friends, right Speedy?

483
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:38,519  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's that shit you're
saying?

484
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:41,487  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
J ust kidding, man!

485
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:48,116  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hey, soldier,
want some papaya?

486
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:54,442  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's split, man.

487
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:57,202  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hold on, pal!

488
00:52:57,527 --> 00:53:02,362  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's their problem?
-Their heads are screwed up!

489
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:04,723  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fuck them!

490
00:53:05,127 --> 00:53:07,163  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Have you heard the latest
news from the front?

491
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:09,882  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The French have
conquered Paris!

492
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,085  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Say, asshole,
what's your nationality?

493
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:17,320  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm a junkie!

494
00:53:22,807 --> 00:53:25,275  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
J unkie...

495
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:34,924  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Thank heavens there's
no one to come visit us.

496
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:39,926  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They visit me at night!

497
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,721  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hey, little friend...

498
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,919  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Draw!

499
00:54:11,087 --> 00:54:16,719  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf anyone's interested, we've
been here exactly 24 hours.

500
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:22,603  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The guys outside
seem tired, too.

501
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:26,880  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They're waiting for us to
get nervous and head out.

502
00:54:28,007 --> 00:54:31,443  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's what l'd do,
if l were up there.

503
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:35,197  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
First, l'd
let'em get thirsty.

504
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:39,364  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's ask, maybe they've
got trained commanders.

505
00:54:39,687 --> 00:54:42,884  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Oh Muslims!

506
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:45,881  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sorry to wake you, l just
wanted to tell you,

507
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:49,876  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
your makeup's a bit messy.

508
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:54,957  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Leave her alone, Velja,
just play us a tune. -OK.

509
00:54:57,247 --> 00:55:02,162  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do you have any favorite song,
Captain?... Wait a minute.

510
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:26,406  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fork! lt's your turn!
-l'll go with you, bro'.

511
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:30,322  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No, you just sit there.
Enjoy in bloody commie song!

512
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:34,198  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Ask for one of
our songs afterwards.

513
00:55:34,607 --> 00:55:37,724  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You don't like such
classics, anyway.

514
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:42,519  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fuck your 'red' classics!

515
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:56,198  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
This is their song.
After you'll hear ours,

516
00:55:56,527 --> 00:56:00,156  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
then you figure out
which one is better.

517
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:04,162  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And now: 'Top of the chops'
show time!

518
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:15,967  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here is the new
singing star,

519
00:56:16,287 --> 00:56:20,997  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
formerly yours
and now ours, Marko!

520
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,999  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Cry, baby, cry!

521
00:56:37,847 --> 00:56:40,407  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't worry about Marko.

522
00:56:40,807 --> 00:56:44,800  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Bakir's a slow hand
circumciser!

523
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:48,358  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Go over to their side,
now! Go!

524
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:04,964  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now l'm gonna fuck the living
daylights out of them!

525
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:13,481  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come back, you idiot!

526
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:28,364  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Bro'...

527
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:31,321  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Bro'...?
-Laza!

528
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:35,562  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They hit my hat!

529
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:39,599  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look! My hat.

530
00:57:42,647 --> 00:57:44,558  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l can walk by myself!

531
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:21,079  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come on, Laza, get up,
back to guard duty!

532
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:28,165  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They hit my hat,
motherfuckers.

533
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:32,598  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm cold, bro'.

534
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:38,166  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l bet 500 marks that
you'll make it!

535
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:44,926  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's too much.

536
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:50,359  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Too much...

537
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:52,917  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Once again, history
is repeating itself.

538
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:55,557  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Raging hordes of evil
have risen against

539
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:58,481  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
the entire Serbian people.
Croatian criminals,

540
00:58:58,807 --> 00:59:02,117  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
foreign mercenaries, and
fanatics of Allah's Jihad,

541
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:06,560  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
just as they did 50 years
ago, they are attacking

542
00:59:06,887 --> 00:59:10,402  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
the poorly armed Serbian
defenders who are heroically

543
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:13,037  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
holding their own
on this unfair battle...

544
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:17,406  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where are you going, bro'?
-l've got a job to do.

545
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:22,157  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
...their children will not be
the victims of Croatian

546
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:25,127  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
fascism, assisted by world
powers, with intentions

547
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:29,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
to draw a new map of Europe
and create a monster

548
00:59:29,367 --> 00:59:32,006  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
with a foreboding name:

549
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,562  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
'The new world order!'

550
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:37,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l said to myself,
no more!

551
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:43,761  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They commit genocide over
the entire Serbian people,

552
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:46,562  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and l sit by calmly,
damn their mercenary souls!

553
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:50,005  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No more, buddy! Not another
German od Muslim soldier

554
00:59:50,447 --> 00:59:53,519  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
will set foot here!
No more!

555
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:03,039  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How's it up there in Sweden,
cold, eh?

556
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:07,320  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But what a standard
of living!

557
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:31,445  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Take the picture!

558
01:00:33,607 --> 01:00:36,405  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf you came to take
pictures, then do it!

559
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:39,275  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn you...

560
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,522  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come on, bro'-in-law!

561
01:00:54,887 --> 01:01:01,486  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll bet you 1 00...
it's not much!

562
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:09,763  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't be stingy, Laza!

563
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:14,046  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
This is a senseless war!
The regime that is responsible

564
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,279  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
for the death of
our sons must go!

565
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:21,202  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We need salvation,
our people need peace.

566
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:23,358  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Peace!

567
01:01:25,367 --> 01:01:31,158  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't let your lives be
run by war profiteers!

568
01:01:31,807 --> 01:01:33,877  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They're cute.
-Who?

569
01:01:34,247 --> 01:01:37,000  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That chubby one
in the fur coat.

570
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:39,636  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
... love and tolerance!

571
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,720  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No one can lie
to you anymore!

572
01:01:43,047 --> 01:01:47,757  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No lofty goal can justify
your futile sacrifice.

573
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:52,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Soon you will start
lying to yourselves!

574
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:17,482  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ln 1 941 the Kraut
aggressed...

575
01:02:24,127 --> 01:02:27,005  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did we have a nice pee?

576
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:30,325  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ln 1 945 the Serb
kicked his ass!

577
01:02:36,447 --> 01:02:39,837  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Love is the most important!
Give love a chance!

578
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:54,118  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Can anyone in this
country sleep

579
01:02:54,487 --> 01:02:56,842  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
while our youth is
in this senseless war?

580
01:02:57,247 --> 01:03:00,080  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Can you sleep soundly,
you, youth of Serbia...

581
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:04,002  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Watch me slam-dunk!

582
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:11,443  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Really, you should
be tied down.

583
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:20,364  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The youth of Serbia
can sleep soundly now.

584
01:03:28,447 --> 01:03:32,838  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Some people think
we're headed wrong,

585
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:37,638  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
'cause we listen to records
and sing rock songs,

586
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:41,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
but deep inside
the battle's hot as hell,

587
01:03:41,967 --> 01:03:44,561  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and let me tell you
what l know quite well,

588
01:03:44,927 --> 01:03:46,963  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
comrade Tito count on us!

589
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:49,926  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What are you looking for,
Professor?

590
01:03:51,047 --> 01:03:55,962  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No one leaves anything
behind, them or us.

591
01:03:57,807 --> 01:04:01,322  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Forget the books, we'll read
after vacation's over!

592
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:04,281  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's a shame
to throw them away.

593
01:04:09,207 --> 01:04:12,085  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Want me to read something?

594
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:16,884  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You really profited from those
books. lf you'd taken a TV,

595
01:04:17,207 --> 01:04:21,723  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
like others, where would
you plug it in?

596
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:28,643  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Read. Better listen to you
than those pussies down there.

597
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:34,161  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
'We noticed it one night, when
we were just fooling around.

598
01:04:35,047 --> 01:04:39,279  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We noticed a village,
our cannon was staring at.

599
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:44,317  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt was still in flames.
And every night afterwards

600
01:04:44,687 --> 01:04:48,202  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
at the same time, villages
were ablaze on the horizon.

601
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:52,918  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We were surrounded by a great
circle of strange celebrations

602
01:04:54,447 --> 01:04:58,679  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
going on in all those places
burning in front of us.

603
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:03,523  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And the flames just rose
up and licked the clouds...'

604
01:05:03,847 --> 01:05:07,396  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Pretty villages are
pretty when they burn.

605
01:05:07,727 --> 01:05:11,242  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Ugly ones stay ugly,
even when they burn.

606
01:05:14,487 --> 01:05:17,399  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You would have been the best
poet among my students.

607
01:05:17,727 --> 01:05:20,366  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When you've been
behind bars for so long,

608
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:22,518  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
you come out
as well-read as Rambeau.

609
01:05:22,887 --> 01:05:26,482  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When l see such a fire
l always get thirsty.

610
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:30,641  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's the name of this
village? -Who gives a shit!

611
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:36,481  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We set a place on fire and
don't even know its name.

612
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:40,317  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We're killing each other
for a fistful of ashes.

613
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,598  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf you intellectuals
had been asked,

614
01:05:43,047 --> 01:05:45,481  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
all of Serbia would
have gone to hell long ago.

615
01:05:45,847 --> 01:05:48,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
OK, boys,
let's move out!

616
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:55,404  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
'One village in particular
looked very gay.

617
01:05:55,807 --> 01:06:00,403  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
A few houses, at the bottom
of an ugly little valley,

618
01:06:00,727 --> 01:06:04,037  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
you wouldn't notice during
the day. You can't imagine

619
01:06:04,367 --> 01:06:07,598  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
what it looked like
at night, when it burned.

620
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:11,237  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You would say...'

621
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,805  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's all right, Professor...
lt's all right...

622
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:32,356  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Velja, who would you sell
it to? -J ust practicing.

623
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:35,998  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
To stay in shape
for later.

624
01:06:37,047 --> 01:06:40,756  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Go ahead and practice.

625
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:45,405  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Good morning, Chetniks!

626
01:06:53,407 --> 01:06:56,046  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's a nice day to die
and you're still asleep!

627
01:06:56,367 --> 01:07:01,282  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Good morning,
dear 'Chets'!

628
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:12,758  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The draft here is
killing me! -Milan!

629
01:07:17,247 --> 01:07:22,367  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll give you this if you
give my Mercedes an overhaul.

630
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:25,759  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's the model?
-WHF FMT...

631
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:31,446  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The Mercedes, dumbbell!
-600. -That's my specialty.

632
01:07:32,407 --> 01:07:35,365  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But don't blow it!
-Agreed.

633
01:07:40,207 --> 01:07:43,563  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Muslims, are you
still up there?

634
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:47,198  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sumadinac here.
Are you still alive, men?

635
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:49,483  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Yes, we're alive!

636
01:07:52,127 --> 01:07:57,201  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hello! Sumadinac you old
mongrel, where have you been?

637
01:07:57,527 --> 01:07:59,165  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where are you?

638
01:07:59,567 --> 01:08:03,401  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ln a tunnel, two kilometers
east of... -Kurtalici!

639
01:08:03,767 --> 01:08:07,157  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Ask when the cavalry's
coming. -Sumadinac!

640
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:18,206  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Men, what can l say, you'll
have to hold on for a while!

641
01:08:18,567 --> 01:08:22,719  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Good luck! -Maybe they
don't have any horses.

642
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:27,322  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sumadinac, old mongrel...

643
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:33,161  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What an unique slime
you are,

644
01:08:33,607 --> 01:08:35,518  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
...my friend.

645
01:08:46,407 --> 01:08:48,637  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We'd better fix that truck.

646
01:08:49,047 --> 01:08:52,198  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You'll end up
the tragic heroine

647
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:57,277  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
of someone else's news.
Translate that!

648
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:30,562  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Closed. All good kids
are in bed asleep.

649
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:35,922  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm going to tuck in
those two now!

650
01:09:36,327 --> 01:09:39,683  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Doctor, it's not a replay,
give me some in advance,

651
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:42,077  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You'll see the bread
tomorrow.

652
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:43,840  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Beg you pardon?

653
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:50,278  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm extremely intolerant
towards such impudence!

654
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:56,318  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Draw!

655
01:09:56,687 --> 01:09:59,599  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l always brought the dough,
what's wrong now?

656
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:03,238  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Be a man! !
A man!

657
01:10:20,047 --> 01:10:23,164  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Nurse! Nurse!

658
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:26,320  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where are you, damn it?!
-Nurse!

659
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:30,401  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Soldier, call the doctor!

660
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:35,076  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Nurse!

661
01:10:48,687 --> 01:10:52,600  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You really screwed me up!

662
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:58,919  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milan, please!

663
01:11:31,127 --> 01:11:35,996  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
So, General, want to look
nice for your funeral...

664
01:11:36,367 --> 01:11:38,085  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
according to regulations?

665
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,916  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's what we got
in the army.

666
01:11:41,327 --> 01:11:44,603  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And l was a lucky bum, l'd
just got hooked on heroin

667
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,686  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and socialized, when they
said: Go on home, soldier!

668
01:11:48,007 --> 01:11:50,646  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Heroin was dirt cheap in '89,
the year of 'dolce vita'.

669
01:11:51,047 --> 01:11:55,006  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Keep up the bullshit.
l'll get you out of this.

670
01:11:55,327 --> 01:11:58,876  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You're safer here with me than
in Belgrade with your junkies.

671
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:01,966  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The army didn't tighten
you enough.

672
01:12:04,007 --> 01:12:10,276  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That army of Tito's was
a real traveling circus!

673
01:12:12,407 --> 01:12:18,676  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Miss Linel wants to film us,
make a story about us.

674
01:12:19,007 --> 01:12:21,475  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milan, how about it?

675
01:12:21,807 --> 01:12:25,038  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No. -What filming?
Out of the question!

676
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:29,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Why not? Let her shoot.
ln any case they shit on us

677
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:31,278  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
like we came
from Hitler's testicles.

678
01:12:31,687 --> 01:12:33,166  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Captain, let the kids
have their fun.

679
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:37,116  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's be gentlemen...
-Shoot, freckle-face.

680
01:12:37,447 --> 01:12:41,998  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No way! ! Then they put
words in your mouth with...

681
01:12:42,327 --> 01:12:45,637  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
what's it called
... editing,

682
01:12:46,007 --> 01:12:48,760  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
they can make us look real
bad, sully us to hell!

683
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:19,917  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
My name is Speedy, l am
unreformed drug addict,

684
01:13:20,247 --> 01:13:22,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
currently getting 'anti-drug
war group therapy',

685
01:13:22,927 --> 01:13:25,236  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
son of an ex-colonel
of the ex-Yugoslav army

686
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:30,243  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
who was a lush... -What
are you saying, idiot?

687
01:13:30,567 --> 01:13:33,843  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Go ahead, Speedy, get it
all out, l'm next!

688
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:37,523  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Tell them how you stole
hendicaped grannies'purses

689
01:13:37,887 --> 01:13:41,482  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
in Germany. -Don't stick
your nose in my affairs!

690
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,242  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l shit on your affairs!
Aren't you ashamed

691
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:47,639  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
to steal honestly earned
money? -Honestly?

692
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:50,720  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You're fighting just to
earn another stripe,

693
01:13:51,047 --> 01:13:53,959  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
damned communist!
-Velja...

694
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:58,043  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
if you don't stop, l'll shove
this down your throat!

695
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:02,440  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who are you to talk about
honesty, you bloody drivel!

696
01:14:07,367 --> 01:14:12,919  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Your great honesty, you were
always full of that shit.

697
01:14:13,967 --> 01:14:17,357  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do you think, Mr. Captain,

698
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:21,806  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
that one single house we set
on fire, or they set on fire,

699
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:26,086  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
was honestly earned?

700
01:14:26,447 --> 01:14:28,403  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
To hell it was!

701
01:14:28,727 --> 01:14:32,800  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf it was honest, it wouldn't
be so easy to set them on fire.

702
01:14:33,527 --> 01:14:38,806  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
As long as Tito stuffed
US dollars up your ass,

703
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:41,925  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
you blathered about
brotherhood and unity,

704
01:14:42,247 --> 01:14:45,444  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and smiled at each other.

705
01:14:45,767 --> 01:14:48,839  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And then the time came
to settle the score!

706
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:52,557  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fine, but why didn't
you do it earlier?

707
01:14:53,887 --> 01:14:57,357  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lnstead you jacked off for
50 years, drove fancy cars,

708
01:14:57,687 --> 01:15:01,999  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
screwed the best girls, and
now when you can't get it up,

709
01:15:02,367 --> 01:15:05,040  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
now you want to be honorable.

710
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:08,677  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l shit on that honor of yours

711
01:15:09,007 --> 01:15:12,238  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and your whole honorable
screwed generation!

712
01:15:12,567 --> 01:15:18,597  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fuck all of you...
honest suckers!

713
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:24,002  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'd shove your face in
if you weren't wounded!

714
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:27,000  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's just a light wound.

715
01:15:27,327 --> 01:15:31,718  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Captain, he was just
joking. -Butt out!

716
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:35,120  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Have it your own way,
mother-fuckers!

717
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:43,716  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l want to say something
for the... NEWS!

718
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:55,083  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l recently saw on TV...
Did you know, wretched girl,

719
01:15:55,727 --> 01:16:00,357  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
that the Serbs are
the oldest nation?

720
01:16:01,047 --> 01:16:04,562  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When the Kraut and English

721
01:16:04,967 --> 01:16:08,801  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and American, 600 years ago,

722
01:16:09,207 --> 01:16:12,756  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
were eating pork with
their fucking hands,

723
01:16:13,087 --> 01:16:15,521  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
we had this,

724
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:21,842  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and we'd gallantly... pick!

725
01:16:23,087 --> 01:16:26,921  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
At the Serbian court
we ate with a fork

726
01:16:27,247 --> 01:16:31,286  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and the Kraut with...
his damn fingers!

727
01:16:34,127 --> 01:16:38,564  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Serbs...
the oldest nation!

728
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:52,157  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt was this fork that drove
us in here. lnto a cave.

729
01:16:52,527 --> 01:16:56,156  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Listen carefully!
You have no way out!

730
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:01,364  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come out and surrender
and you'll stay alive!

731
01:17:01,687 --> 01:17:04,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
There's another
'honest' man.

732
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:08,884  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l, Captain Mislimovic,
guarantee your lives.

733
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:12,925  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Captain Muslimovic?

734
01:17:13,687 --> 01:17:17,236  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf you remember, we were
in the barracks together.

735
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:23,597  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sergeant Maksimovic,
now captain. Remember?

736
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:28,400  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l see we both got
promoted, Captain!

737
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:31,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Shame on you, Captain!

738
01:17:31,407 --> 01:17:35,082  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How many burned villages
will get you another stripe?

739
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:39,645  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come on out,
you deserter!

740
01:17:51,407 --> 01:17:54,524  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You betrayed me!

741
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:04,639  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Say, Gvozden, who's that?
-My brother-in-law.

742
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:08,926  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Good morning, boys!
-Doctor, how's Speedy?

743
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:11,397  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who?
-How's Speedy?

744
01:18:11,807 --> 01:18:15,800  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Boys, the doctor can't
remember all of you!

745
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:22,316  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Say, Doctor... do you remember
that Muslim over there?

746
01:18:22,807 --> 01:18:25,605  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
He sure has rosy cheeks.

747
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:32,956  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Son, our oath obliges us.
-l bet it does, tadpole.

748
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:35,921  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Excuse me?
-Listen carefully!

749
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:40,041  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf Speedy doesn't make it,
that one won't either!

750
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:44,958  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm not to blame, young man.
You and he are the same to me.

751
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:50,443  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You're both screwed up and
you're in a foreign country,

752
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:53,839  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
so you might
choose your words.

753
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:59,485  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l wish you a speedy recovery!

754
01:18:59,847 --> 01:19:02,919  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Doctor, it's a matter
of cultural differences!

755
01:19:03,247 --> 01:19:04,919  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here's our benefactor!

756
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:08,165  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Everything for our brave
boys! Pass these around.

757
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:17,400  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Want 'Brut' or 'Kouros'?

758
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:20,082  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Catch, pal!

759
01:19:20,967 --> 01:19:23,765  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You flinched, here it
is on the floor!

760
01:19:24,127 --> 01:19:26,687  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Nurse, he dropped
his present.

761
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:29,640  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You'll pick it up
when you get better!

762
01:19:30,007 --> 01:19:32,601  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Doctor, here's a small
present for you.

763
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:37,006  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Take care of our boys!
-Sloba, we're caring for them

764
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:43,124  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
like our very own! -They are
the future of Serbia!

765
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:49,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ln 1 991 the Croats
attacked, one day soon

766
01:19:49,927 --> 01:19:54,079  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
the Serbs will
beat them back!

767
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:57,445  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Happy New Year, heroes!

768
01:19:57,767 --> 01:20:01,726  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milan, that frigging
doctor's not to blame.

769
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,483  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
He might have been just like
you if they'd butchered

770
01:20:05,807 --> 01:20:09,641  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
his mother. lnstead, she's
walking around Belgrade now,

771
01:20:09,967 --> 01:20:12,561  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and he was lucky enough
to stay the same

772
01:20:12,887 --> 01:20:16,323  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
refined frigging doctor.
We can only envy him!

773
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:20,242  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You and l and that kid over
there can only envy him!

774
01:20:25,847 --> 01:20:28,964  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Mustafa...

775
01:20:29,327 --> 01:20:31,158  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sulejman...

776
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:42,805  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l lost my little Muslim
friend, lbro.

777
01:20:47,007 --> 01:20:50,317  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
God, it would be easier
if she wasn't here.

778
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:58,682  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She reminds me of what l'll
miss when a bullet hits me.

779
01:21:00,567 --> 01:21:04,401  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l couldn't bang her
for a barrel of beer.

780
01:21:04,727 --> 01:21:07,321  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What about
a glass of water?

781
01:21:08,687 --> 01:21:14,080  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'd stick it to her and you,
and even to crazy Fork.

782
01:21:14,407 --> 01:21:17,479  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Admir... Nazim...
-Near my house in Banja Luka

783
01:21:17,807 --> 01:21:21,277  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
is a fountain.
lt has the coldest water.

784
01:21:22,487 --> 01:21:25,479  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's all l think about.

785
01:21:25,767 --> 01:21:29,999  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l can picture every
single stone in it.

786
01:21:32,967 --> 01:21:37,358  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Stop the bullshit, Professor.
Don't remind me of the time

787
01:21:37,687 --> 01:21:42,715  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l stole a tank truck of beer
at the October Fest in Munich.

788
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:47,444  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l got down under it and
drank it dry in three days.

789
01:21:47,847 --> 01:21:50,725  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Captain, tell them, we said
whoever talks about water

790
01:21:51,047 --> 01:21:55,359  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
has to kneel on cartridges!
Go on, fatty, kneel.

791
01:21:55,687 --> 01:22:00,363  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's a mess,
totally screwed up.

792
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:06,683  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But l'll fix it,

793
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:12,127  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
everything can be fixed,
right?

794
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,318  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What good will it do if
you get it to work?

795
01:22:20,767 --> 01:22:21,005  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sorry, just mouthing off.

796
01:22:21,447 --> 01:22:24,883  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When l was a kid, l thought
little people lived

797
01:22:25,327 --> 01:22:29,081  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
under the hood
and made the car work.

798
01:22:31,807 --> 01:22:35,197  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Man, l've seen them
with my own eyes.

799
01:22:35,647 --> 01:22:40,641  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do you think we'll make it
out of here alive?

800
01:22:41,007 --> 01:22:42,725  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hold this.

801
01:22:44,087 --> 01:22:47,762  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l got you into this shit,
l'll get you out of it,

802
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:51,125  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
if it's the last thing
l do! Understand?

803
01:22:51,567 --> 01:22:55,685  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Safet... ldris...

804
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:03,237  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Cow! -That's not
really a Muslim name.

805
01:23:09,247 --> 01:23:12,762  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come kitty, kitty!

806
01:23:13,807 --> 01:23:17,595  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We've got to guess her
name! Lulabelle, Mary...

807
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,487  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Maybe it's Muslims'.
-Enver!

808
01:23:22,527 --> 01:23:24,643  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's a bull's name, idiot!

809
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:29,645  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Barbie! Barbie! ! !

810
01:23:40,887 --> 01:23:44,436  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No milk today,
dear Chetniks...

811
01:23:50,047 --> 01:23:54,563  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Anyway, my mother put
beer in my bottle.

812
01:24:09,247 --> 01:24:12,523  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ls that 1 :0 for us,
or did it hit the goalpost?

813
01:24:12,927 --> 01:24:16,158  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm trying to force myself to
feel sorry for the poor guy,

814
01:24:16,487 --> 01:24:22,403  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
but it won't work! We've gone
to hell... it won't work!

815
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:28,002  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Keep on trying, Professor,
it might come.

816
01:24:32,087 --> 01:24:37,445  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ls it worth living when a man
starts feeling like that?

817
01:24:37,967 --> 01:24:40,686  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Whose team were you for
before the war?

818
01:24:41,047 --> 01:24:44,198  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Mostar's or Sarajevo's?
-l'm not into soccer.

819
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:48,759  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You just get better, so they
don't even the score.

820
01:24:52,767 --> 01:24:57,397  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And l'll try to make
the winning goal.

821
01:25:18,087 --> 01:25:22,285  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Collecting liquid for
the radiator? Great idea.

822
01:25:36,727 --> 01:25:39,366  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who's next?

823
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:50,366  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Thanks, l had a beer five
days ago and that'll do.

824
01:25:52,327 --> 01:25:56,115  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn, you peed all over the
bottle we have to drink from.

825
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:12,676  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf you want to refresh
yourself, you take the best!

826
01:26:13,087 --> 01:26:17,638  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Coca Cola,
it's the real thing!

827
01:26:32,407 --> 01:26:36,366  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Great 'bouquet',
home-made?

828
01:26:36,807 --> 01:26:39,765  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let me cross myself.

829
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:56,078  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Have some.

830
01:26:58,007 --> 01:27:01,079  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Have some,
it's sugar-free.

831
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:04,639  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l mean, diet Coke!

832
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:17,003  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She loves it,
let's export it!

833
01:27:24,127 --> 01:27:26,721  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now you're one of ours.

834
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:31,716  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lf a Muslim comes,
just boom-boom.

835
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:35,523  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Try it, imagine
a Muslim...

836
01:27:42,287 --> 01:27:44,721  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Muslims! !

837
01:27:45,247 --> 01:27:48,557  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's up, little Chetnik?
lsn't your mouth dry?

838
01:27:48,967 --> 01:27:51,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Of course not, we got
spring water in the tunnel!

839
01:27:52,247 --> 01:27:55,125  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where did you get it from?

840
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:59,685  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
From a mobile fountain!
-What's that, buddy?

841
01:28:00,167 --> 01:28:04,718  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What l used to refresh
your old lady with.

842
01:28:06,887 --> 01:28:11,039  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Professor, you're some
sophisticated comedian.

843
01:28:11,447 --> 01:28:16,157  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well, Chetniks, soon
you'll be eating shit!

844
01:28:16,607 --> 01:28:20,759  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We didn't come here
to insult each other!

845
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:29,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hey, up there, know the one
about the Muslim girl

846
01:28:30,287 --> 01:28:32,243  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
taking a monkey
for a walk in Sarajevo?

847
01:28:32,647 --> 01:28:34,558  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come on, Chetnik, go for it!
-People asked her

848
01:28:34,927 --> 01:28:37,282  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
where she got it. She said:
from UN forces.

849
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:40,884  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They said, well, why didn't
you have an abortion?

850
01:28:41,247 --> 01:28:45,525  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
One Muslim girl,
took a monkey, Chita...

851
01:28:46,327 --> 01:28:48,318  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Thanks, thanks...

852
01:28:50,487 --> 01:28:53,604  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
One more, please! -Thanks,
you're a wanderfull audience!

853
01:28:54,007 --> 01:28:58,444  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The blond Muslim girl woke up
under a cow and looked

854
01:28:58,847 --> 01:29:02,601  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
at the udder and said,
Serbs, you're still here...

855
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:11,957  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You're still here!

856
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:21,717  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You're still here...

857
01:29:27,767 --> 01:29:30,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Watch the birdie!

858
01:29:48,087 --> 01:29:52,126  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fuck, you killed
my audience!

859
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:58,960  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's wartime, buddy,
we're short on credit.

860
01:29:59,967 --> 01:30:03,755  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here's something until
tomorrow. From my dead father.

861
01:30:04,207 --> 01:30:06,323  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
A gold tick-tock!

862
01:30:06,727 --> 01:30:10,720  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ls that from a scout brigade?
-He got it from the army.

863
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:14,198  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Give it here!

864
01:30:19,687 --> 01:30:21,917  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's why we'll
lose the war.

865
01:30:22,327 --> 01:30:24,887  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
30 years of service
for a snort of dope!

866
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:30,077  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's not right at all!

867
01:30:32,767 --> 01:30:35,486  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Doctor, what if l...?

868
01:30:35,887 --> 01:30:38,526  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You can't shoot up here!

869
01:30:38,927 --> 01:30:43,796  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Kids play here!
OK, buy a ticket! !

870
01:30:50,647 --> 01:30:54,560  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Are you still late?
-No, l got it this morning!

871
01:30:55,167 --> 01:30:59,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Great! -Why didn't
you say so?

872
01:31:01,487 --> 01:31:05,275  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When it started,
l was like born again!

873
01:31:05,647 --> 01:31:08,081  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn, what should we do
with this walkman?

874
01:31:08,527 --> 01:31:10,802  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
He won't be needing it
anymore. lnternal bleeding.

875
01:31:11,207 --> 01:31:13,846  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Too bad,
he was a sweety.

876
01:31:23,527 --> 01:31:28,999  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Kill the bloody
Croats!

877
01:31:29,407 --> 01:31:32,126  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Zagreb, here we come!

878
01:31:56,127 --> 01:31:58,322  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Fuck off, zombie!

879
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:01,639  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Thanks, boys, thanks!
Let's hear it!

880
01:32:01,967 --> 01:32:04,925  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Through the forests
and mountains

881
01:32:05,327 --> 01:32:08,444  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
of our glorious land,

882
01:32:08,807 --> 01:32:14,643  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Partizan detachments carry
the splendor of battle!

883
01:32:30,967 --> 01:32:33,640  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's great you got
the 'big M'.

884
01:32:33,967 --> 01:32:37,164  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
All you needed was a baby
in the middle of this mess!

885
01:33:26,887 --> 01:33:29,845  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm stuffed up with
this tunnel.

886
01:33:30,207 --> 01:33:35,440  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Lisa, let's do it like
Romeo and J uliette

887
01:33:35,767 --> 01:33:38,964  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and they can film it
for a 'soap', eh?

888
01:33:39,287 --> 01:33:42,962  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here, take some, this'll
make you go woof woof.

889
01:33:50,327 --> 01:33:54,843  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Dear Chetniks, we have
a great program for you:

890
01:33:55,367 --> 01:33:59,326  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The songs of your
youth and ours.

891
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:20,717  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l used to love that song.

892
01:34:21,527 --> 01:34:25,076  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

893
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:32,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hurry up,
the bell's gonna ring.

894
01:34:33,007 --> 01:34:36,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Wait, look, 'Rocky ll'!
-Look, they're screwing.

895
01:34:37,887 --> 01:34:41,436  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Quiet, learn something.
-lt's gonna ring.

896
01:34:41,767 --> 01:34:44,406  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't worry, ma'am,
it's the long recess.

897
01:34:44,727 --> 01:34:48,163  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hurry, the bell! -The postman
always rings twice.

898
01:34:48,487 --> 01:34:53,117  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here it comes, air mail!
-No, send it by ship!

899
01:34:55,767 --> 01:34:58,486  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We inerrupt this program
for a special announcement

900
01:34:58,807 --> 01:35:01,162  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
from the Central Committee:

901
01:35:01,567 --> 01:35:05,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Comrade Tito is dead...

902
01:35:06,207 --> 01:35:12,316  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Today, May 4, 1 980,
at 1 5:05, in Ljubljana,

903
01:35:12,647 --> 01:35:15,400  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
the heart stopped beating
of the great son

904
01:35:15,727 --> 01:35:18,082  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
of our nationalities
and minorities...

905
01:35:20,767 --> 01:35:23,679  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Why don't you cry?

906
01:35:25,327 --> 01:35:30,276  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How will we live without
our Comrade Tito?

907
01:35:30,607 --> 01:35:32,962  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l don't know.

908
01:35:35,167 --> 01:35:38,079  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You cry first.

909
01:35:38,407 --> 01:35:40,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l can't.

910
01:36:22,407 --> 01:36:29,483  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Muslims, are any of you
whores free for a slow dance?

911
01:36:33,927 --> 01:36:39,001  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Velja, don't fall for that
trick, they'll shoot!

912
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:43,798  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who cares, l lost my virginity
while this song was playing.

913
01:36:44,167 --> 01:36:47,443  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Travolta,
they'll kill you!

914
01:36:48,207 --> 01:36:51,119  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Naw...

915
01:36:51,447 --> 01:36:53,517  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damned fool!

916
01:36:53,927 --> 01:36:57,602  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Tonight, if she's listening,
let her hear the pain

917
01:36:59,927 --> 01:37:05,001  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
in the song l'm singing
for her ears alone,

918
01:37:10,847 --> 01:37:13,156  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
let her carry with her
always in her heart,

919
01:37:13,487 --> 01:37:17,162  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
the life she threw away...

920
01:37:26,487 --> 01:37:30,321  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's wrong, you bums,
can't you do any better?

921
01:37:30,687 --> 01:37:33,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
These legs have jumped
from the second floor

922
01:37:33,407 --> 01:37:35,284  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
of the Hamburg Volksbank!

923
01:37:39,527 --> 01:37:42,837  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now, that's better.

924
01:37:58,807 --> 01:38:02,243  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Say, Captain,
how'd l dance?

925
01:38:08,127 --> 01:38:10,277  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What'd you do,
Travolta?

926
01:38:10,647 --> 01:38:12,842  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm too emotional.

927
01:38:13,247 --> 01:38:17,286  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That song got to me,
it really hit me.

928
01:38:17,647 --> 01:38:20,207  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We continue with our
'Listeners' requests',

929
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:24,122  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here's hoping that the
Chetnik pig recovers soon.

930
01:38:24,487 --> 01:38:27,365  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And here's our
shared Hymn:

931
01:38:27,727 --> 01:38:33,324  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hey Slovenes, the spirit of
our ancestors still lives...

932
01:38:40,927 --> 01:38:44,920  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now you've got to
stand up, that's the custom!

933
01:38:52,607 --> 01:38:55,201  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And now since
we've had our fun,

934
01:38:55,527 --> 01:38:58,121  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
we're sending you a broad
for your enjoyment!

935
01:38:58,487 --> 01:39:00,557  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here comes a sex bomb!

936
01:39:00,967 --> 01:39:05,085  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Go to your own kind and
show them your love bites!

937
01:39:05,407 --> 01:39:08,319  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She must be full
of explosives!

938
01:39:08,727 --> 01:39:11,446  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What shell we do?

939
01:39:11,847 --> 01:39:14,839  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Tell them what
gentlemen we are!

940
01:39:15,527 --> 01:39:19,202  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hello, Chetniks,

941
01:39:27,767 --> 01:39:29,086  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Why her?

942
01:39:29,527 --> 01:39:31,677  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She can barely walk, she
must be full of explosives!

943
01:39:34,327 --> 01:39:37,364  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

959
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:02,286  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What a damned life.

960
01:41:04,287 --> 01:41:07,359  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Watch the birdie!
-Wait.

961
01:41:08,687 --> 01:41:11,326  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
One, two, three, four...

962
01:41:11,647 --> 01:41:15,526  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

963
01:41:15,967 --> 01:41:19,926  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Tighten up your ranks,

964
01:41:20,967 --> 01:41:22,400  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Twelve, thirteen...

965
01:41:22,727 --> 01:41:26,276  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

966
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:29,081  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What are you doing?
-Banging each other.

967
01:41:29,447 --> 01:41:31,677  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
First he'll do it to me,

968
01:41:32,087 --> 01:41:37,605  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What? Get up! -Teacher, you're
against brotherhood and unity.

969
01:41:38,007 --> 01:41:40,760  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come along children,

971
01:41:48,607 --> 01:41:51,405  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well, you won't!

972
01:41:52,767 --> 01:41:54,678  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

973
01:41:55,847 --> 01:41:59,965  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

974
01:42:02,887 --> 01:42:08,120  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You orthodox dogs, we send you

975
01:42:08,527 --> 01:42:12,964  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We don't know what else

976
01:42:19,127 --> 01:42:22,324  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You really
disappointed me.

977
01:42:24,967 --> 01:42:28,676  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She didn't explode,

978
01:42:29,087 --> 01:42:32,363  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
As soon as l get out l'll
light a candle for her.

979
01:42:35,207 --> 01:42:41,396  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And for Laza. -l didn't have
the guts, no one did.

980
01:42:42,087 --> 01:42:45,284  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You were the bravest.

981
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:55,883  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

983
01:43:03,167 --> 01:43:07,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That Fork's got
the brilliant idea.

984
01:43:08,727 --> 01:43:12,845  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

986
01:43:22,607 --> 01:43:25,201  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Enough's enough.

987
01:43:29,247 --> 01:43:35,516  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well, l'll be off!

989
01:43:41,447 --> 01:43:47,044  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Muslims...

990
01:43:48,527 --> 01:43:52,202  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No more free drinks.

991
01:43:55,687 --> 01:43:59,839  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Captain, do you think
it's better to shoot

992
01:44:00,287 --> 01:44:04,075  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
in the head or the heart?
-Get off my back!

993
01:44:04,487 --> 01:44:10,517  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

994
01:44:10,847 --> 01:44:14,044  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't ask me. You figure
it out, Velja.

995
01:44:14,407 --> 01:44:17,001  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hey, who's going
to help me choose!

996
01:44:17,367 --> 01:44:19,085  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well...

997

They're gone.

998
01:45:31,567 --> 01:45:33,683  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where're you off to,

999
01:45:34,127 --> 01:45:37,517  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

-Have a nice trip, pilgrim!

1000
01:46:10,727 --> 01:46:15,118  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Look at this. This is
General's from World War l.

1001
01:46:15,487 --> 01:46:17,717  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

1002
01:46:18,087 --> 01:46:21,397  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

Now this here is...

1003
01:46:25,727 --> 01:46:28,446  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

to make sure you don't
bungle things and die.

1006
01:46:35,207 --> 01:46:37,641  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

hero in you.

1010
01:46:45,407 --> 01:46:48,638  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
God be with you!
And with you!

1011
01:46:52,487 --> 01:46:54,239  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
God save the Serbs!

1012
01:46:55,287 --> 01:46:56,561  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
lt's showtime, folks!

1013
01:46:57,447 --> 01:47:00,086  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Yo, bro'!

1014
01:47:03,207 --> 01:47:07,086  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The man's gone.

1015
01:47:11,327 --> 01:47:14,603  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They're still here!
-This hand's a dud.

1016
01:47:17,327 --> 01:47:19,682  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
They'll shoot again.

1017
01:47:20,327 --> 01:47:23,478  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

1018
01:47:30,127 --> 01:47:34,882  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You don't have to translate on
that shitty American any more.

1019
01:47:35,887 --> 01:47:38,845  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
She understood by herself,
but l'll be sorry,

1020
01:47:39,247 --> 01:47:44,002  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
if she doesn't write her
story... if there is a story.

1021
01:47:47,687 --> 01:47:51,202  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And l've got what to say.

1022
01:47:52,247 --> 01:47:58,766  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

You find that funny?

1025
01:48:08,247 --> 01:48:10,158  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well, it is funny.

1026
01:48:13,927 --> 01:48:18,239  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
He was a smart bastard,
Comrade Tito.

1027
01:48:18,767 --> 01:48:23,761  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
He lied a lot... but we
all loved him.

1028
01:48:24,927 --> 01:48:29,876  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
350 kilometers on foot.

1029
01:48:30,807 --> 01:48:34,686  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That was just
a stroll walk for me.

1030
01:48:43,887 --> 01:48:46,845  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well, kids,

1031
01:48:47,247 --> 01:48:52,116  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
There's no reason to wait.
The machine's as good as new.

1032
01:49:14,367 --> 01:49:16,483  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come, have some coffee!

1033
01:49:16,887 --> 01:49:19,799  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

1034
01:49:20,127 --> 01:49:23,199  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Only gays are left in

1035
01:49:23,487 --> 01:49:28,163  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come on! -These guys aren't

1036
01:49:54,487 --> 01:49:59,322  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Damn helmet. l stuck it over

1037
01:50:01,207 --> 01:50:05,519  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

1038
01:50:05,927 --> 01:50:10,318  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Anyone got some bullets to

1039
01:50:10,647 --> 01:50:14,879  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milan, give this to my mother.

1040
01:50:15,247 --> 01:50:19,763  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

1043
01:50:29,447 --> 01:50:31,438  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
No hard feelings,

1044
01:50:31,847 --> 01:50:34,680  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

1046
01:50:38,207 --> 01:50:41,005  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now l'm ready.

1047
01:50:43,607 --> 01:50:46,167  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
When you come to my funeral

1048
01:50:47,327 --> 01:50:52,276  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and see the miles of babes
crying for me,

1049
01:50:52,607 --> 01:50:56,680  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
you'll know who
Uncle Velja was...

1050
01:50:57,127 --> 01:50:59,641  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
His mother's fool!

1051
01:50:59,967 --> 01:51:02,800  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
...l gave candy
to each of them!

1052
01:51:06,327 --> 01:51:10,843  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Well, l won't keep you
any longer.

1053
01:51:12,927 --> 01:51:17,045  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Drop by to see me
when you've got time!

1054
01:52:24,487 --> 01:52:25,966  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Real Hollywood slobbering!

1055
01:52:28,967 --> 01:52:32,846  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
This is worth living for.

1056
01:52:35,327 --> 01:52:38,922  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
At least a while longer!

1057
01:52:42,847 --> 01:52:46,123  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l was just kidding.
So long!

1058
01:52:47,887 --> 01:52:52,005  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Jesus Christ, you really
screwed me up!

1059
01:52:52,727 --> 01:52:55,082  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You, bastard!

1060
01:52:56,087 --> 01:52:59,284  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Uncle Velja has
a present for everybody!

1061
01:52:59,647 --> 01:53:02,241  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Mom, don't look at
me like that.

1062
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,797  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Everything's been paid for,
l just lost the receipts!

1063
01:53:05,247 --> 01:53:08,319  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come here! J ust look at it!
The papers are clean,

1064
01:53:08,607 --> 01:53:10,837  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
they were laundered
with my jeans!

1065
01:53:12,327 --> 01:53:15,797  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Take me for a spin!
-l don't have a license!

1066
01:53:16,127 --> 01:53:20,086  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Take mine! -Velja,
why didn't you write?

1067
01:53:20,407 --> 01:53:23,604  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Why should l, when you
knew l was fine!

1068
01:53:23,927 --> 01:53:25,963  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Hey, did you finish
your freshman year?

1069
01:53:26,287 --> 01:53:29,518  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sophomore, bro! -So, soon
you'll be an archeologist!

1070
01:53:29,967 --> 01:53:32,925  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But don't dig me up when
l kick the bucket!

1071
01:53:33,327 --> 01:53:36,080  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't worry, we just
dig up works of art.

1072
01:53:36,407 --> 01:53:39,126  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What am l, pulp,
you motherfucker?!

1073
01:53:39,487 --> 01:53:42,160  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sorry, Mama!
Here, punish yourself.

1074
01:53:42,567 --> 01:53:44,922  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
God, you've gotten
stronger!

1075
01:53:45,247 --> 01:53:49,798  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's the neighbor, she
must have seen you arive.

1076
01:53:52,487 --> 01:53:55,957  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
ls the student, Milos Kozic,

1077
01:53:56,287 --> 01:54:00,724  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now he's had it! Healthy,
and ignored his call-up twice,

1078
01:54:01,047 --> 01:54:05,006  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
motherfucker... Sorry, ma'am.
He's got to come with us!

1079
01:54:05,407 --> 01:54:09,286  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Archeologist, we've got bones
too, but we bury them! -Yap!

1080
01:54:10,127 --> 01:54:13,836  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You came at the right time,
l just got back from a trip.

1081
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:17,239  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
A little bit of fresh air
will do me good.

1082
01:54:17,607 --> 01:54:19,677  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Mom!

1083
01:54:20,247 --> 01:54:23,796  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Kid! Take this,
careful how you drive.

1084
01:54:24,127 --> 01:54:27,517  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The seat goes down on the
side, and her legs go up.

1085
01:54:27,847 --> 01:54:30,998  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Sorry, Mom!

1086
01:54:31,607 --> 01:54:33,438  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's get moving!

1087
01:54:33,847 --> 01:54:35,917  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The sooner l leave,
the sooner l'll be back!

1088
01:54:36,247 --> 01:54:38,363  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You'll see how great it is
in the army.

1089
01:54:51,207 --> 01:54:54,563  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Jesus, how you conned me,
bastard, damn you!

1090
01:55:00,887 --> 01:55:03,276  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Chetniks!

1091
01:55:04,287 --> 01:55:08,758  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We're gonna make a delicatesse
out of you! Smoked Chetniks!

1092
01:55:09,127 --> 01:55:12,358  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Don't let me down now!
Hear?

1093
01:55:14,127 --> 01:55:17,164  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's go, Professor, please!

1094
01:55:17,447 --> 01:55:20,803  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'm ready, l found my helmet.

1095
01:55:21,687 --> 01:55:26,477  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Are you breathing with
gills, Chetniks?

1096
01:55:33,007 --> 01:55:35,840  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Good evening, Serbs.

1097
01:55:38,167 --> 01:55:41,796  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
And good night!
-Halil!

1098
01:55:42,487 --> 01:55:44,682  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Where were you yesterday
at the soccer game?

1099
01:55:45,087 --> 01:55:47,681  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We beat those guys
from Kurtalici 5: 1 !

1100
01:55:48,007 --> 01:55:51,079  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l had to go get circumcised!
-Can you pee now?

1101
01:55:51,367 --> 01:55:55,042  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Of course, why not!
-Let me see!

1102
01:55:56,567 --> 01:55:58,319  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Take a good look.

1103
01:55:58,727 --> 01:56:01,241  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Whoever has a longer one
will get a telegram!

1104
01:56:01,567 --> 01:56:04,843  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
The girls will die laughing
when they see you!

1105
01:56:06,167 --> 01:56:09,557  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who goes first?

1106
01:56:09,967 --> 01:56:11,480  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You!

1107
01:56:20,007 --> 01:56:23,158  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Third and fifth odd!

1108
01:56:23,527 --> 01:56:27,156  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Luck's on your side, Milan!

1109
01:56:33,847 --> 01:56:39,797  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Your turn!
-First and fifth odd!

1110
01:56:40,167 --> 01:56:44,445  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
How much is seven and six?

1111
01:56:44,807 --> 01:56:47,799  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Ask the teacher!

1112
01:57:23,087 --> 01:57:26,443  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l'll take the truck! You take
them out on the other side!

1113
01:58:05,887 --> 01:58:08,321  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Wait, where are
you going? Wait!

1114
01:58:19,567 --> 01:58:21,444  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l won't let you!

1115
01:58:43,087 --> 01:58:45,157  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Come back! Nurse!

1116
01:58:57,047 --> 01:58:59,322  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
That's our artillery!

1117
01:59:00,567 --> 01:59:05,277  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Gvozden, what are you doing?
Take them out the other side!

1118
01:59:09,887 --> 01:59:12,401  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's not kiss good-bye!

1119
01:59:13,967 --> 01:59:17,357  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
With Marshall Tito,
our heroic son,

1120
01:59:17,727 --> 01:59:21,925  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
even the devil will
admit we have won,

1121
01:59:22,847 --> 01:59:26,760  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
with heads held high,
walk with a grin,

1122
01:59:27,087 --> 01:59:30,636  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
and keep our hand
firmly in a fist!

1123
01:59:40,527 --> 01:59:43,997  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Now you'll meet
my brother-in-law.

1124
02:00:03,127 --> 02:00:06,199  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here we come, bro'!

1125
02:00:29,487 --> 02:00:31,159  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Let's go!

1126
02:00:40,367 --> 02:00:42,278  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517

1127
02:00:44,567 --> 02:00:47,604  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Those are our boys,
they'll bury us in here!

1128
02:01:18,407 --> 02:01:21,763  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l won't let you!
Nurse!

1129
02:01:45,767 --> 02:01:47,564  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do you give up?
-No!

1130
02:01:47,967 --> 02:01:50,162  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What do you mean, no?
-No!

1131
02:01:51,927 --> 02:01:56,045  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Here comes the
Serbian cavalry!

1132
02:01:58,967 --> 02:02:01,527  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Milan!

1133
02:02:26,047 --> 02:02:28,402  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
So you went
into the tunnel?

1134
02:02:31,047 --> 02:02:32,605  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l did!

1135
02:02:33,007 --> 02:02:36,682  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Why'd you burn our garage?
-Why'd you slaughter my mother?

1136
02:02:37,007 --> 02:02:40,522  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l didn't slaughter anyone!

1137
02:02:42,167 --> 02:02:45,637  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
l didn't set the garage
on fire, either!

1138
02:02:46,007 --> 02:02:50,842  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Who did? That Ogre
from the tunnel, maybe?

1139
02:02:54,327 --> 02:02:57,876  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Did the Ogre do it, Milan?

1140
02:03:00,847 --> 02:03:03,156  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do it.

1141
02:03:05,127 --> 02:03:06,845  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You do it.

1142
02:03:07,207 --> 02:03:09,198  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
Do you give up?
-No way!

1143
02:03:09,567 --> 02:03:12,877  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
One of us has got to!
-You do it! -No, you do it!

1144
02:03:21,007 --> 02:03:24,044  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What's up, Lauda!

1145
02:03:47,087 --> 02:03:49,078  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You do it.

1146
02:03:49,447 --> 02:03:52,245  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
What a bloody mess!

1147
02:04:05,607 --> 02:04:10,806  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
You Ogre, you're some
hell of a whore!

1148
02:04:51,527 --> 02:04:54,917  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
We got nice and drunk,
didn't we?

1149
02:05:02,287 --> 02:05:05,836  X1:030 X2:689 Y1:438 Y2:517
But tell me mate...
