Colonel Theakes has
given us a new mission.

What is it this time? Wash his car?
Feed his horses?

There's a line in the sand, Mainwaring,
and you've crossed it.

at our bits, aren't we, lads?

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,912
It's no way for
a spy to behave.

322
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,715
Rose?

323
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,555
It can't be!

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,233
Arthur?

325
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,472
What a remarkable thing.

326
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,479
I'm sorry, Captain.

327
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,548
Mr. Wilson was my
tutor at Oxford.

328
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,399
Remarkable.

329
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,789
Uh...

330
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,433
Wilson,
take the men home.

331
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,438
I shall be driving Miss
Winters up to Sully Point.

332
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,913
Oh, might I, sir?

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,673
We have such a great deal to catch up on.
Certainly not.

334
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,318
Oh, captain,
please, I insist.

335
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,834
I've taken up far
too much of your time.

336
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,229
Well, if that's
what you'd prefer.

Shall we?
My earring.

339
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,830
My earring, I've dropped it.
It's very precious.

340
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,831
Fan out, men.
Fan out. Oh, no.

342

I absolutely
must find it.

Fan out! Earring!

344

looking for exactly?

Well, I look forward to getting to
know you more in the coming days.

Ah. Allow me.
Oh, no, it's...

No, it's...
It's my, it's my...

No, I'll, I'll...
It's my typewriter.

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,834
Oh. I want to get
a start on the article.

Hmm.

Might we have tea tomorrow?
Say 5:00?

Well, that would be...

366
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,276
Oh, no, there's a briefing
on some patrol thingy.

367
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,079
Patrol?
Yes, of the Dover base.

368
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,432
Dinner afterwards, then?

369
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,873
There must be
somewhere in town.

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,398
Well, yes, there's
The Oak Hotel, but...

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,914
7:00. I insist.

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,157
Right. Yes.

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,279
How nice.
Thank you, Rose.

I want you to have
a word with Frank.

378
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,433
He's got it into his head he
wants to be a Spitfire pilot.

379
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,556
He gets dizzy
standing on a chair.

380
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,710
Well, he lives in his head,
that's his trouble.

382
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,233
Must have been a racer.

Where do you
keep your...

384

He told me about
that journalist woman.

Arthur?

386
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,836
Shall I roll
out the pastry?

387
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,400
Frank said
you drove her home.

388
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,555
Did I?

389
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,477
Oh, yes, that's right,
I believe I did.

390
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,669
Ever so glamorous,
Frank said.

391
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,274
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

392
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,752
Just you remember which
side your bread's buttered.

393
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,195
Pass me that bird.

Here you go.

395
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,958
Thank you for taking me to the
pictures again, Frank. It was...

396
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,393
It was ever
so romantic.

397
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,520
Thanks for
walking me home.

398
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,034
Mum doesn't like me
being out after dark.

Ooh.

What're you doing?

401
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,276
Kissing you.
What's wrong with that?

402
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,389
People only kiss
like that in the films!

Morning, Miss Winters.
Corporal Jones.

But a soldier by nature, ma'am.

More notches on my rifle
than you've had hot dinners.

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,152
Not that you've had
too many hot dinners.

You've a fine fettle of

Good day.

I saw that,
Jack Jones.

You just slipped
her a sausage.

I didn't mean
nothing by it.

And you never stamped
her book, neither.

To be writing
about us, I mean.

470

Seeing her again after so long is
really rather discombobulating.

Well, you know, confusing.

I know
what it means, Wilson.

So, you knew
her at Oxford.

I was her tutor
for a while.

Are you questioning
an order, Mainwaring?

As you know, the Home Guard
have been asked for cuts

520

We'll be reviewing
the troops.

Put on a good show.

529

There's no better way
of saving the platoon.

Evening, Mavis.

00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,640
I'm just
stretching my legs.

Likewise, I'm sure.

Just resting my eyes.

00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,270
Don't! It makes
you look piggy.

823
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,475
Come along.

824
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,238
Come on, Joe.
Darts night.

825
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,276
I don't play darts.
You do now.

Mavis. (SNORTS)
What a...

831
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,636
What a lovely surprise.

832
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,909
New suit, Arthur?

833
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,833
Uh, what?
No, no, no. It's...

834
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,951
You can wear it for
what's left of your dinner.

Rose Winters.
You do a marvelous job.

837
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,190
I believe in fighting
for what's ours

838

and crushing
the enemy underfoot.

Hello, Joe.
Oh. Strike a light!

849
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,037
I thought
you was Old Bill.

850
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,990
Quite a hoard
you have here.

851
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,835
I take it you don't
believe in rationing.

852
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,430
Well, keep your head down
and earn a few bob,

853
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,516
that's what I believe in.

854
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,711
Since they shut off the army base,
I've got a right backlog.

855
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,159
I'm making up for lost time.

856
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,549
Captain Mainwaring said you're
not going near the base.

857
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,830
Once I'm inside
the compound,

858
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,353
there'll be no stopping me.

859
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,716
You know,
I should really report this.

860
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,239
Come on, then.

861
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,196
We all have our price,
Miss Winters.

862
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,673
What's yours?

863
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,752
Petrol? Navy Cut?
Bootleg French perfume?

864
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,749
Chanel No.5?

865
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,633
When you go to the base,
take me with you.

866
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,637
You're not coming
on the patrol.

867
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,917
You're not the only who knows
how to get what they want, Joe.

868
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,553
Of course, this will be
quilted for extra comfort

869
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,835
on your eternal slumber.

870
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,229
Yes, I'd be quite happy
to decompose in this.

871
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,556
We'll take two, Mr. Frazer.

872
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,149
I don't suppose
you would consider a discount.

873
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,679
Well, to avail
yourself of that,

874
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,553
you would both have to pass on
before the end of the month.

875
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,116
Oh. We're not ready to go quite yet,
are we, Cissy?

876
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,431
Mother lived to 101.

877

Miss Winters, one moment!

Miss Winters.

879
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,430
Cissy rang The Lady
magazine in London

880
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,428
to inquire about
your follow-up article.

881
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,473
And they know
nothing about it, or you.

882
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,793
You're on the run
from the police.

883
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,797
You killed a man
with your umbrella.

884
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,991
Oh, I do apologize,
Miss Winters.

885
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,432
She is cursed with
a romantic spirit.

886
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,794
I know.

887
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,511
You're a secret agent.

888

A German spy

889
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,115
sent here to discover
the invasion plans

890
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,475
and bring
the Allies to their knees.

891
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,994
I'm afraid the truth is far less
colorful than that, ladies.

892
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,112
I work for
the Associated Press.

893
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,273
They place all their
articles uncredited.

894
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,632
I hope that's cleared up
the confusion for you.

895
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,994
Good day.

Please, come on in.
Yeah.

901
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,591
Sorry about the manner
of my invitation.

902
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,511
No, no.

903
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,514
No. Not at all.

you'd tell me more</i>

about your unique
leadership style.

906
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,715
Well,

907
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,713
I'm not one to
blow my own trumpet,

908
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,156
but I lead by example.

909
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,389
There's nothing I would ask my men
to do that I would not do myself.

910
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,555
Hmm.

911
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,389
Cake?

912
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,877
It's rather small,
I'm afraid.

913
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,348
We eat

914
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,757
as a free people,
not under the Nazi heel.

915
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,709
One thing my
men know for sure,

916
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,951
the jackboot will not tread
upon this hallowed land

917

breath in this...

Are you all right?

920
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,799
Gone down the wrong way.

(GROANS)

922
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,595
You speak so
eloquently, Captain.

923
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,517
Have you never committed
your thoughts to paper?

924
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,276
No, there's not enough
hours in the day, I'm afraid.

925
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,876
Leadership is many things,
Miss Winters.

926

Rose, I insist.

927
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,951
Leadership is
many things, Rose.

928
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,354
But most of all,
it's about vision.

929
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,475
(CLATTERS)
Oh.

930
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,079

MAINWARING: So sorry.

933
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,076
Europe is crying out
for a man of vision, clarity,

934
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,275
even ruthlessness.

935
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,469
Quite.

Get the trains
running on time.

I believe you're destined to play
a huge part in this war, George.

938
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,789
Really?

939
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,073
I do hope so.

940
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,150
I'm only sorry I won't be
able to write about it.

941
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,635
But you must.

942
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,514
What is the matter?

943
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,119
ROSE: (CRYING)
It's my editor.

944
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,634
He said if I don't write about
your patrol in my article,

945
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,635
then he won't publish it.

946
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,997
Come, now. Here.

947
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,831
Maybe if your
editor insists upon it,

948
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,234
then...

949
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,639
What?

950
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,760
Maybe you should...

What's he doing here?

954
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,548
(WHISPERING)
I have no idea.

955
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,557
One moment.

No, no.

WILSON: No, I won't!

00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,918
I've been doing
that all my life,

brought them all back.

1128

I'm leaving tomorrow

1129

Tomorrow night?

1131

Tomorrow night's
bridge night.

1132

I need your answer.

1133

After the patrol.

1134
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,556
Oh. Captain Mainwaring.
Morning, ladies.

1135
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,519
Captain Mainwaring, we have discovered
something terribly exciting

1136
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,358
about Miss Winters.

1137
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,674
Straight out
of Greenmantle.

1138
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,836
I can't stop.
My country needs me.

1139
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,474
DOLLY: Well, please yourself,
Mr. Mainwaring.

1140
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,353
Off to win
the war, Napoleon?

1141
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,436
Just you wait, Hodges.

1142
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,159
Today is going to be the
pinnacle of my military career.

1143
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,317
Don't tell me, you're gonna collect
Colonel Theakes's laundry?

1144
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,998

Morning, sir.

1145

About yesterday,
we're both men of the world.

1146

Are we, sir?

1147
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,319
Well, yes.

1148
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,594
I suggest that we...

1149
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,829
Draw a veil.

1150
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,789
Precisely.

1151
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,949
Consider it drawn.

1152
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,640
Colonel, we're just
about to set off.

1153
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,871
THEAKES: (ON PHONE) <i>MI5 have picked
up another signal from the spy.</i>

1154
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,671
They've narrowed down
his location, Mainwaring.

1155
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,633
<i>He's in Walmington.</i>

1156

Walmington? Good Lord.

1157
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,880
They're putting a cordon
round the town to flush him out.

1158
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,638
I want your
platoon at their disposal

1159
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,789
<i>as soon as you've
finished patrol.</i>

1160
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,313
<i>You'd better
let your men know.</i>

1161
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,594
Of course, Colonel.

1162
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,551
<i>It's imperative that
he's caught, Mainwaring.</i>

1164

ALL: In Walmington?

1165
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,911
I can feel it in my bones.
Walmington?

1166
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,235
I'll catch him, sir.
What does he look like?

1167
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,509
We don't know, Frank.

1168
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,079
That's rather
the point with spies.

1169
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,110
His target is
the army base at Dover.

1170
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,915
We need to keep
a close watch on those cliffs.

Look.

Don't panic, Mr. Godfrey.
Keep pointing.

1183
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,998
I'll alert my commanding officer.
What is it?

1184
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,951
It's over there.
Look. Can you see?

What is it, Godfrey?

news to her at Sully Point.

I'm coming with you.

1439

Good of you, Walker,
but I think I should go alone.

1440

Meet me at the
church hall in an hour,

1441
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,800

rota for the traitor Wilson.

Dolly dear, what did you mean
it was staring you in the face?

of course.

That Chanel
dress in particular.

1445
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,436
So, we phoned the
fashion house in Paris

1446
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,630
to ask if anyone
there knew her.

1447
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,718
DOLLY: A very nice young
man in records confirmed

1448
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,395
that she bought regularly
from their collections,

1449
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,598
and they sent them
directly to her home.

1450
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,198
That was the missing piece of
the jigsaw, wasn't it, Cissy?

1451
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,599
But what was it?

1452

Ooh. The address,
Silly Billy.

1453
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,754
Miss Winters
lives in Berlin.

Why were you
there, Arthur?

1460

1462

1464
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,634
I wasn't leaving you.
I went to say goodbye to her.

1465
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,477
My life is here
with you, dearest,

1466

as innocent as a newborn babe.

1470

He's a Nazi spy.

1471

We caught him at the station
about to abscons.

1472
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,271
Abscond, Jonesy.

1473
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,949
Rose Winters asked
me to see her off.

1474
