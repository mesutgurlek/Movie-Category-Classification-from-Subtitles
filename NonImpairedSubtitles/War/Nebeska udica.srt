1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,592
You can do it, champ!

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,193
Try it again, but easy.
Well done, that's it!

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,188
They say that every story
needs the words of its own.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,392
For my story, I couldn't find
them for a long time.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,397
It began when words
had dried up.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,189
Well done! You're genius!

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,995
Last seconds of the game;
Come on, let's do it now!

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
Atta, boy!

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,592
Kajevic Jr. will do the
hook. Will he make it?

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,791
Is the gold in our hands again?
Kajevic, and he scores!

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,956
Kaja, the champion!
Kaja, the champion!

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,553
The motherfuckers were
close last night.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,235
I was blown off the ground!

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,318
Enough for today!
-What do you mean, enough?

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,638
I'm in a hurry, man! I paid you
300 marks up front!

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,070
What's the rush, when
they're bombing us?

17
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,118
I'm in a rush all the time.
I'm a businessman!

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,828
They say you're doing better
than in the last war.

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,196
Which one? -In both.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,876
People smoke more,
the enemy is stronger now.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,669
Why? Do you think I should
fight? -God, no!

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,876
Just like the last time:

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,992
You rolling in mud,
me pushing cigarettes.

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,990
One man falls, another fills
his pocket. -Way of the world!

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,876
You telling me I'm not
patriotic?- By no means.

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,319
When I'm through, you'll
be a 100% fucking Serb!

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,838
Right! And you gotta do
more work and talk less.

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,270
Up your ass!
-Up yours!

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,950
What did the doctor say?

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,597
The bombs scared the kid,
so he's a bit.silent.

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,918
Did he prescribe any medicine?
-He'll get over it. -When will

32
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,671
he get over? -lf he hadn't been
here, it wouldn't have happened.

33
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,356
Hey mom, take the kid to
the other room.

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,393
It's my fault I let the kid
stay here...

35
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,553
when they're bombing us!
-They could have hit anywhere.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,872
They could have hit your place.
-But they didn't.

37
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,993
You're bad luck. You simply
attract disasters. -Absolutely.

38
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,071
Since I attracted you.

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,718
I take him to spend one night
here because my mother's ill.

40
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,069
So what? -Whenever I rely
on you, it all goes wrong.

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,909
Everything went wrong since
you took him and left me.

42
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,271
I've felt a 100% percent
better since I left you.

43
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,269
Listen, Tijana.
He doesn't feel better!

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,196
You heard what the doctor
said: a happy family life!

45
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,033
That's what he needs. And you
and me, we'd manage somehow.

46
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,312
He needs safety, normal life -
that was what the doctor said!

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,799
No drinking with the jerks!
-Nor staying with your mom!

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,628
If my mother weren't that ill.

49
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,310
I would take both of them
to Italy!

50
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,159
And he would start speaking
right across the border?

51
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,193
I would start singing!

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,636
Come on, move your ass!
I said, get up!

53
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,829
Move your ass over here!

54
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,828
Your sis says you're on it
again. -Everybody's talking.

55
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,519
Let them babble!

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,638
It isn't true, dad! -I don't
give a shit about your life.

57
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,556
But if they talk again that my
son's smoking weird tobacco,

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,109
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of you.

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,352
I swear by my mother's...
-Leave you late mother alone!

60
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,875
She was a wimp,
just like you are.

61
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,953
She's lucky she didn't
live to see what I see now.

62
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,038
Watch what you're
doing, wimp!

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,477
I'm sorry, bro.
-Piss off!

64
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,997
Siske! Hey, Siske!

65
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,271
Hi, Zuba!

66
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,790
What do you want? I told
you not to come back.

67
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,794
I want you to do that butterfly
for me. -I told you I won't.

68
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,111
I've got money. -I don't
care about your money!

69
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,550
You know what that
butterfly means?

70
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,832
That's what whores have on them.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,118
Maya and Beba have it.
-Because they are whores!

72
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,116
Oops, sorry!
I didn't see you there!

73
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,916
You're on now.
-I am.

74
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,789
Do I know you?
-My mom lives here.

75
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,119
Pavlovic?
The little Pavlovic girl?

76
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,315
Do you remember me?
We were in the same class.

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,432
I don't think so. -My father was
in the army.

78
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,116
So, we'd moved to Sarajevo.
Turcinovic, remember?

79
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,757
Turca? Oh, yes.

80
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,750
How did you say we called you?
-Call me Josie now.

81
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,871
I gotta get back home before
the alarm. -Hang on!

82
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,714
Pick one of those.
-I have a boyfriend.

83
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,553
He doesn't like to wait.
-Come on.

84
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,430
What's your boyfriend's name?
-Ufonja. -Oh, Ufi!

85
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,391
What are you doing with that
guy? -None of your business.

86
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,276
Well, it is.
You pretty, he an asshole.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,630
I'm gonna tell him that.
-Oh, I'm scared shitless!

88
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,838
I'm off. Ciao!

89
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,077
Hey, Josie, hang on! Don't miss
your big chance, Josie!

90
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,589
I hope they won't bomb
here again.

91
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,997
They blasted everything.
There's nothing left.

92
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,630
I'm gonna die waiting
for a taxi here.

93
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,997
You're gonna die rushing.
-Somebody's gotta rush,

94
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,436
and that somebody is me. 'Cause
you are the legend of the 'hood.

95
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,872
Almost a great player.-We didn't
get along in normal times.

96
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,709
Why don't we try it now?

97
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,397
Take me across the river.
-Yes, if you pay for the fear.

98
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,274
Be a good boy, honey.
And listen to your daddy.

99
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,079
Take care of him, Kaja,
please. -OK, Tijana.

100
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,919
I'm gonna bring him some clean
stuff tomorrow.

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,428
Need any dough now? -Sure,
for some ice cream and beer...

102
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,114
How much do you need?
-I'm only kidding.

103
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,278
Buy something for Jovan.
-I don't need it.

104
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,552
If you wanna go across
the bridge, let's get moving.

105
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,638
They're gonna blast the bridge
while you're kissing.

106
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,155
And I've already had a bath.

107
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,110
Hey, sis, please don't!

108
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,393
I can stand the bombs, but
when someone starts crying.

109
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,716
Where's your kid?
-Upstairs. Asleep.

110
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,470
Hey folks, this summer's
gonna suck bad.

111
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,752
Why do you think so?
-The bombs are dropping

112
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,435
and you ask me why!
-It could be worse.

113
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,433
It can always get worse here.
But it can never get better.

114
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,798
When it was better here?
-Ten years ago.

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,309
We went to Sutomore,
on the coast.

116
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,758
They bombed Sutomore...
-That was yesterday,

117
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,155
and we were there
10 years ago.

118
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,070
And 5 years ago, we were
camping in Greece. -It was cool.

119
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,028
Sure, you were with Tijana
we only had our hands.

120
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,037
And, last year. -What the fuck
happened last year?

121
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,795
A basketball tournament here.
The dudes from the city came.

122
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,509
Here, on our court?

123
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,277
We can play here even now, but
we can play "The Lost Brigade".

124
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,394
We beat the shit out of them
didn't we? -We sure did.

125
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,317
We were mean.
-You are a mean player.

126
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,596
Zuba, Come on!

127
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,116
And you're bragging 'cause
we've beat some suckers.

128
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,715
Remember those upstarts
in expensive gear?

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,430
They didn't know shit.
-We're naturals, man.

130
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,275
Cut the bullshit, you jerks!
Look at yourselves!

131
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,511
There's no Sutomore,
no Greece for us.

132
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,632
We can't go across the border.

133
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,798
All we can get here are alerts
and that shit falling on us.

134
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,759
That's what I said:
it's gonna suck bad.

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,958
Let's rebuild it?
-What?

136
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,599
The court.

137
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,628
Why, we get rid of the mess,
lift the basket.

138
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,599
And there's a new court!
-You're nuts, man.

139
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,913
That basket probably weighs
3 tons. Who will lift that?

140
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,511
It can be done in three days,
I promise!

141
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,948
You really are smart, man!
Rebuild the court!

142
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,831
Well, unless a bomb
razes us to the ground.

143
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,955
Or unless our anti-aircraft
take cover in here.

144
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,353
Or unless they decide to
send their troops 'cause

145
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,790
they have nothing
better to do,

146
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,073
or unless we starve to death,
or unless we get drafted.

147
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,754
Then perhaps we'll mend
that court some day.

148
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,039
I'm gonna get some sleep.
This war is fucking boring.

149
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,789
What's wrong with him?
-He's nuts or something.

150
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,393
They are early tonight!
-I'll see you.

151
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,597
Come on, let's go!

152
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,117
Hey, champ!

153
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,994
Let me tell him something,
mom, please.

154
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,628
Are these bastards bothering
you? lgnore them.

155
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,390
You gotta sleep. We're gonna
practice the hook tomorrow.

156
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,591
You'll master it a 100%.

157
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,668
Dad will clean up the court
and coach you.

158
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,316
But you gotta sleep, get some
rest till tomorrow.

159
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,438
Come on!

160
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,315
Zuba!
-What's up?

161
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,719
An earthquake? Another bombing?
-I want my butterfly.

162
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,160
Fuck the butterfly! You need
a pimp, not a tattoo.

163
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,989
You're a bastard.
-I know.

164
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,799
Why didn't you come downstairs?
-Where? -In front of the house.

165
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,878
Everybody's there.
Kaja's giving a speech.

166
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,671
He's probably organizing
a fucking May Day parade.

167
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,912
Fuck! This guy is out
of his mind!

168
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,833
So, what do you say?

169
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,032
Who can guarantee they
ain't gonna blast us again?

170
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,433
People start to relax, and
they come back and boom!

171
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,555
Gonna fly high in the sky.
-Bye-bye new court, bye-bye!

172
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,436
OK, what now?
Got a better idea?

173
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,559
You wanna spend the whole
summer in the shelter?

174
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,712
I just said:
"Let's rebuild the court!"

175
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,918
I don't say it's a big deal.
It's nothing much, but.

176
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,997
Have you ever been fucked
when you did what I said?

177
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,272
We've always been fucked
when we did what you said.

178
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,877
Come on, fuck off.
We can do it, really!

179
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,995
I say you can't! What's your
fucking bullshit, Kaja?

180
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,391
These are dangerous times.
You gotta try to survive.

181
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,395
Make yourselves useful;
go sell some cigarettes for me.

182
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,313
You know when you're
gonna rebuild it? Never!

183
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,318
Wanna bet?
-Against who?

184
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,830
Me.We're gonna make
it in 3 days.

185
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,068
What are you gonna bet?
A slice of pie? -Deutschmarks.

186
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,638
Oh, marks!

187
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,871
OK, I'll bet you 500 marks
you won't make it. -500 marks!

188
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,794
You could buy a used car!

189
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,318
Too much!

190
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,319
Suck my cock!
-Stop swearing, fucker!

191
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,193
You can't collect 500 marks?!

192
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,513
Hey guys, can anyone lend
me 300 marks?

193
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,995
No small change, man.
-I left them in another suit.

194
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,390
I'll give you 300 marks.
-Very generous!

195
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,316
Atta boy! You're my hero now!
You heard him, chicken?

196
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,316
Looks like it's getting
serious now.

197
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,752
Why are you putting him on?
-Cut the crap!

198
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,110
OK, no more kidding.
500 marks till Monday.

199
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,950
Here's my hand, yokel!
-Fuck you, oaf! -Cut, Kaja.

200
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,156
You're cool.

201
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,830
And I was a bastard some time
ago! -You just pretend.

202
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,031
I know it, I keep telling
everyone.

203
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,113
You just pretend you're bad, but.
- I'm cool? Sure, I'm cool.

204
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,470
How come I didn't see it
a minute ago?

205
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,832
You gave him 300 marks.
-I don't care about 300 marks.

206
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,510
I just wanted to see
the fucker's face.

207
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,515
What do you blame him for?
-All, but that's another story.

208
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,555
They're never gonna make it.
They know it and you know it.

209
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,998
Shitty kids.

210
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,317
If they survive this shit,
that will be their big success.

211
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,512
You belong to the young
batch of their breed.

212
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,428
A chick with little brains,

213
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,037
who'll graduate 'cause
the teachers are starving.

214
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,956
Your friends are whores
and you hope that I'll do you

215
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,830
that butterfly to help you to
a better start as a hooker.

216
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,669
How can you say that?!
-What? -Things like that.

217
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,839
Because it's true. -It is not.
-Yes, it is. -No! -Yes!

218
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,838
Hey guys,
we gotta drink to it!

219
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,756
You gotta toast before
each big effort.

220
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,869
And then, tomorrow, slowly.
-It's no rush, man.

221
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,352
No work on Easter.
-We'll work when it gets cold.

222
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,509
Hey, Jovan! Come over here.
Take this to your dad.

223
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,190
When your dad was playing,
Djordjevic was on the bench.

224
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,439
Jovan!

225
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,553
There goes the beer!
-Honey...

226
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,708
Are you OK? For sure?

227
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,758
Hi, Tiki.

228
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,589
Hello, everybody!
Everything as usual?

229
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,669
We stick to our ways. -Where
have you been all this time?

230
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,396
Hi! -Hello!
We're rebuilding the court.

231
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,478
It's a lot of work.
-That much work could kill you.

232
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,272
We're just getting things ready.
I talked them into it.

233
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,511
Jovan's having a great time.

234
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,917
Cool, but I gotta go. I brought
some clean stuff for Jovan.

235
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,877
How's your mom?
-A little better.

236
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,749
I'll try to catch a couple
of hours tomorrow.

237
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,235
We can make a barbecue.

238
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,359
The guys always ask for you.
-I'm touched.

239
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,878
I thought, something
like a beach party.

240
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,910
Good, old times, remember?
-Jovan, see you tomorrow, honey.

241
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,949
Hold on!

242
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,831
Kaja, please try not to let him
get hurt, OK? -I'll try.

243
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,638
See you!

244
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,109
Jovan the champ!

245
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,076
Now you know it's yours
and no one can take it.

246
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,108
We'll make the court
tomorrow, Jovan.

247
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,630
It's gonna be the best in town.
You know who's gonna play here?

248
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,872
Rebraca, Bodiroga and Djordjevic

249
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,154
against Siske, Turca, me
and you. Yeah.

250
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,158
You know how tall this
Rebraca is? As a mountain, son!

251
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,028
Daddy's gonna put you
on his shoulders and

252
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,835
you're gonna slam-dunk
above Rebraca's head.

253
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,591
We're gonna beat the shit
out of them, you'll see.

254
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,349
Mommy's gonna cheer for us.

255
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,552
You know she likes to
cheer, for the winners.

256
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,473
She's gonna yell:
"Kaja, Jovan, Kaja, Jovan!"

257
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,031
The whole 'hood's gonna
support us and we'll win.

258
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,357
Fuck!

259
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,950
Let's go! Time to go to bed.

260
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,831
Fuck, they're giving us hell!

261
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,159
Don't they know that Divac
is a Serb? - So what?

262
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,516
Would you bomb Michael
Jordan's country? -I would

263
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,911
if I had the weapons.
-Give us the sausages.

264
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,152
See you, guys!
-Hey, grab a sausage!

265
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,389
Any news, old man?

266
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,435
Just the bad ones.
-Bad or worse?

267
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,834
The worst.

268
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,236
That's what I like about you; you
know how to cheer up people!

269
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,790
Can't you keep the noise down?

270
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,630
Hey, where have you been?

271
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,513
Sobering up, like everyone else.

272
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,196
Can't I have some peace and
quiet? -Yeah, sure, why not?

273
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,712
No way!

274
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,950
Hey, come on, quick!
Come on, let's give it a push!

275
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,190
Hey guys, where's Misa?

276
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,229
His mom is a bit scared.
-She worries a lot, you know.

277
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,316
Hey, kid.
-Leave me alone!

278
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,670
Are you kinda angry with me?

279
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,877
I don't need your tattoo.
I need nothing from you!

280
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,675
Everything around you is
filthy. It makes me sick!

281
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,518
Me too.

282
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,831
Hello, is that you, Tijana?
He's OK, still sleeping.

283
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,879
It wasn't that bad last night.
Some soft bombs, they say.

284
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,549
I'd hang them all in the
center of Belgrade

285
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,870
both the NATO guys
and our warmongers.

286
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,031
God forgive me!

287
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,551
He woke up.
Probably heard it's you.

288
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,992
Would you like to say
something to mom?

289
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,198
Jovan, are you there?

290
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,635
Mom will drop by
to play with you, OK?

291
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,590
We're going on a trip soon.

292
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,389
Then mom will be with you
every night.

293
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,710
You should see him
listening and nodding.

294
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,757
OK, Tijana, bye.

295
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,514
Say hello to your mother.
Give her my best.

296
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,555
Woe is me,
when kids have kids!

297
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,631
Maybe we're not angels,
but we're not the worst people.

298
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,629
Why, we aren't done yet.

299
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,755
Blisters already?
-Delicate skin, eh, Siske?

300
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,470
I didn't lift anything heavier
than a joint in years.

301
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,832
Check him out! Atta, boy!

302
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,311
Are we gonna build the best
court in town, or are we?

303
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,234
Come out on your terrace
And hail the Serbian race!

304
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,956
Come out on your balconies
To hail the champions!

305
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,113
God help us!
God help us!

306
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,436
Why don't you cut it out?
-What's up, old man?

307
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,558
We're just cleaning up the mess.
-You'll suffocate us!

308
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,235
As if the terror from
the sky weren't enough!

309
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,358
That guy in the AWACS can
tell time from your watches.

310
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,988
Do you want to have
them bomb us again?

311
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,550
What did you say?
They'll bomb us again?

312
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,355
We're just cleaning up.
You can close your windows.

313
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,715
I know you well, Kajevic.

314
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,230
You made even little Misa
come downstairs!

315
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,030
What's the matter, old fart?
No one made me do anything!

316
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,953
If you want to clean, why don't
you clean the shelter?

317
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,113
I cleaned it up this morning!
-Did you hear it?

318
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,392
She cleaned it up!

319
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,069
We're no rats to spend the
whole summer in the shelter.

320
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,239
Don't argue with him,
just screw him!

321
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,116
Misa, come back inside!
I'll tie you to the bed!

322
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,748
And you want to play while
the bombs are falling on us!

323
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,992
Why don't you join the army
and serve your country?

324
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,833
What are you yelling for?
Who's yelling?

325
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,709
What are you two doing?
-Working. -Drinking.

326
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,112
Beer?! In this heat?!
You need booze when it's hot!

327
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,195
Wanna some booze? -Better have
one for us. -For you? Sure.

328
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,634
And for the two of you? OK?
What about you? -You don't drink

329
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,396
anything for me. -Never mind.
I'll drink for you too.

330
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,758
Come on!

331
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,157
I knew it!

332
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,555
What's up, guys? Looks like
some rusty kind of job?

333
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,988
Don't worry, Kaja.
We'll fix everything up.

334
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,589
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

335
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,792
Don't make uncle Toza
pull out your ears!

336
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,639
Hey guys, it's snowing!

337
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,674
Let me see!

338
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,836
Who needs toilet paper?

339
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,636
Look what a lousy print!
Saving on us, motherfuckers?

340
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,350
If they were throwing out
dollars, we wouldn't mind.

341
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,958
You're right. Maybe they'll
throw those 500 marks for you.

342
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,398
Come on, guys,
back to work!

343
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,916
You'll never win your bet
if you don't work.

344
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,231
Hold on, your dad's coming.

345
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,271
You didn't say hi! -Hi!
I didn't see you come in!

346
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,591
You were working hard.
I can't believe it.

347
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,752
You didn't believe we were gonna
do it. -To be honest - I didn't.

348
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,157
I can't remember when
I saw you working last time.

349
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,788
Kaja's got
some surprises for you.

350
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,434
I must take a bath:
I reek like hell. - You do.

351
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,429
As if you've just come
back from the training.

352
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,638
Where have you been?
-Why?

353
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,310
Do you take your dumplings
with sugar? - Yes, thank you.

354
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,953
Staying for dinner?
-I'll stay the night.

355
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,795
Your mother has let me.
If you don't mind.

356
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,071
I do mind. It's an invasion
of my privacy.

357
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,197
But if you wash the dishes,
massage my back etc...

358
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,035
.then it's OK.

359
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,075
I can't stand another night
without him. Go take your bath.

360
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,792
Your athlete's torso's just
too much. -Ex-athlete's torso.

361
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,711
It's because of my mom.

362
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,037
A nurse is with her.
In case she calls.

363
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,518
Don't be embarrassed about
the mobile. We are family.

364
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,908
See how good you look when
you're doing some work?

365
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,353
Tijana, I'm a 100% OK!
I swear by my mother.

366
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,348
I'm not old yet. Look!
-You haven't grown up yet!

367
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,632
You're somewhere on Jovan's
level, believe me.

368
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,157
That used to turn you on, Tiki.
-It did, once, Kaja.

369
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,758
Why not again, Tiki?
-You had us!

370
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,072
Like a game won!
But you lost us.

371
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,511
The game is over. -I counted on
some overtime, but...

372
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,791
Hey, what are you doing? -Aren't
he dumplings great, son?

373
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,753
I let him spend 3 days
with you, and look at him!

374
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,429
Hey, what's the big deal?
-One kid's enough for me.

375
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,230
But two...
Too many and two much.

376
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,878
I forgot to tell you, son.

377
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,037
That friend of yours from
Spain, Djordjevic, called today.

378
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,033
Sasha called me? -Yes.

379
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,750
I didn't know you were in touch.
-What a nice guy he was!

380
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,191
Kaja used to play with him.
Then he moved away.

381
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,071
He's in our national team.
-Love is what counts.

382
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,354
The national team? You're in
it today, tomorrow you're out.

383
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,594
And what did Sasha say?
-He wants to recommend you

384
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,675
for a job in Italy. He asks if
we need anything.

385
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,119
They are early tonight!

386
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,559
I'll get some candles.
-Come on, honey!

387
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,478
Easy, Tijana. Don't panic.
-I just want to take him to bed.

388
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,990
Probably a graphite bomb.
There's a total black-out.

389
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,039
Cemetery candles!
-They're for dad's anniversary.

390
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,069
Let's go to our room, honey.

391
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,551
Mommy's gonna put
you in bed.

392
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,475
She'll tell you the story of
a boy, Peter Pan, who lived

393
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,753
in the Never-Never Land
and didn't want to grow up.

394
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,996
He was that kind of man.

395
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,912
Good night.

396
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,515
Danka, why did you start
lying in you old age?

397
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,311
Everybody lies today and
so can I. It's for your good.

398
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,995
Shame on you.
-Shame on you!

399
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,071
I've got no money,
No cigarettes,

400
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,713
I've got no wife
by my side,

401
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:40,914
I've got no home, no luck,
Nobody cares for me.

402
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:51,675
Oh, how I'd like to get stoned,
Any kind of drug would do.

403
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:02,879
I wouldn't control my brain,
I'd rather blast it with a gun.

404
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:18,470
Cigarettes are like food
When a man has no wife.

405
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,793
Did you grasp that Danka
was lying? -I did.

406
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,434
I like the girls
in summer dresses.

407
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,399
I like the girls
in summer dresses.

408
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,510
I kiss their backs.

409
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,268
I can feel the fragrance
of resin...

410
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,394
Tonight my ship found
her harbor.

411
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,235
If I were you,
I'd fall in love with me.

412
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,955
If I were you, I would.
But I'm not.

413
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,714
Sorry. I have things to do.

414
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,078
Oh, good morning.

415
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,510
There will be no tears today,
eh, sis? -Not today. I promise.

416
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,832
I can see it's a different
story. Love or something.

417
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,190
Something.

418
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,393
Love and war...

419
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,273
Hey, where are we going?
-Hey, wait for me!

420
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,475
How come your mom let you
out? -She can't play it cool.

421
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,232
Here it is.

422
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,078
This is it!
-You sure it's a basket?

423
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,075
It looks better than
the one we have.

424
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,199
A little rusty, but solid.
-As hard as my cock.

425
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,078
Let's try to lift it.

426
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,549
It's in one piece. -We'll die
hauling it to our court.

427
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,836
Come on, guys.
You can do it without me.

428
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,272
Where are you going? -I've got
a situation over there.

429
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,632
I'd like to have
that situation myself.

430
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,197
We won't forget this, Turca!
-Hey, Josie! Hold on!

431
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,268
I feel awful being here.
-A nice place for a walk.

432
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,717
Authentic Yugoslav ruins.
A must for tourists.

433
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,509
Come on, Josie. Come on,
let's take a walk.

434
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,040
The cafeteria was over there.
That crazy dentist's office

435
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,315
over there. Such a prick he was,
it's good they'd blasted it.

436
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,390
Are you afraid of radiation?
-Yes, terribly.

437
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,513
Don't you feel that something
radiates between the two of us?

438
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,632
I'm sick.
-Hey, check this out!

439
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,354
Probably meaning: "Hey,
wanna play three on three?"

440
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,358
"Let's have a ball" means
"let's have some fun".

441
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,276
It can also mean.
-Sure, sure it can.

442
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,193
Your English is perfect.
-You fool!

443
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,033
Let's sit down. Come on.

444
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,911
I was in Sarajevo when
the shellings started.

445
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,591
We ran a little,
we fought a little.

446
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,111
Did some funny
and crazy stuff.

447
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,153
When I came here,
I thought: "It's over."

448
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,836
And look at me now:
Under fire again!

449
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,273
Is that why you're all smile?
You've seen it all before?

450
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,359
I finally grasped that
nothing's too terrible.

451
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,155
If you look at it the right
way, anything can be fun.

452
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,476
Nothing has to be really
terrible. You see?

453
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,795
You're not cheerful;
you're crazy. -Same thing.

454
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,510
What now? -What now?!
Let's weld the basket!

455
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,315
How do you mean to weld it?
With your nails?

456
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,915
Let's bring the cables,
the gear.

457
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,556
What cables? It's a black-out.
-The power's back.

458
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,915
I know what we need.
Misa, come with me.

459
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,116
We'll be right back.

460
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,118
Hello!
-Hi!

461
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,555
What are you doing with the
tools? Dad's gonna kill you.

462
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,917
If you rat on me,
I'll shave you with this stuff.

463
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,594
Let's go!

464
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,838
Where are you going?
This is the safest place.

465
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,592
And you think that's funny?

466
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,836
But, we love each other.
-You're nuts.

467
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,751
Josie.

468
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,315
Josie, hold on! Josie!

469
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,678
I'm gonna fuck you bad
because of this, aggressors!

470
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,554
Let me show you something!

471
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,913
Hold it! - Don't you see
what you're doing? - So?

472
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,718
That's not the way to do it.
You used up the electrodes.

473
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,075
I'm gonna get some new ones.

474
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,789
What are you doing?

475
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,354
We're doing the court.
I thought you knew it.

476
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,398
Doing the court?
-Yes.

477
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,791
Looks like you've
been welding? -Yes.

478
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,630
I can imagine how well
you welded it!

479
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,997
You know, it's gonna be
a real basketball court.

480
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,591
I thought this situation was
gonna make you grow up!

481
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,351
You're just fooling around.
-What do you want, old man?

482
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,998
When you're not working,
you just sit here, smoke,

483
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,549
and you can't wait to
pick on me!

484
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,837
What was it I did to you?
Come on, tell me!

485
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,509
God did it to me; to let
me have a son like you!

486
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,993
I've grown up in ruins.
But I had balls all my life!

487
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,000
I gave you everything,
to your mother and you!

488
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,199
Was it my fault your
mother died?

489
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,950
Was it my fault you
became such a wimp?

490
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,311
Fuck you, old man!

491
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,189
You'll never gonna
have what we had.

492
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,551
We've built everything
and you can't even make

493
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,433
a fucking basketball court.

494
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,109
Hey, Marlboro!

495
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,235
Look how the works progress
and get your 500 marks ready.

496
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,992
When he gives me that dough,
we're gonna party till dawn!

497
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,915
That's the right height.
It's OK.

498
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,875
Looks pretty low to me.
-It looks too high to me.

499
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,636
No, it's fantastic. -It's too
high. -Come on, ask Kaja.

500
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,040
It's OK, it's cool.

501
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,794
Don't sit on the ball
son, come on.

502
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,356
The height is right,
but it looks somewhat.

503
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,471
like it's crooked.

504
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,076
Anything looks crooked
after a bottle of brandy.

505
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,118
You're a very interesting
man, neighbor.

506
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,589
OK, let's check the height.
Come over here, son.

507
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,838
Come on, shoot!

508
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,280
It's 3,05 m. I guarantee.
Give me five, son! -Ufonja.

509
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,559
Wonderful.

510
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,190
But now you'll have to take
it back to where you found it.

511
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,636
What do you mean, back?
-The basket. It belongs to us.

512
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,638
You shouldn't have touched it.
That's stealing.

513
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,558
What are you talking about?
Since when it belongs to you?

514
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,389
Just a heap of rusty iron.
-Who are you to say that?

515
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,638
You stole our basket! You
know what they do to thieves?

516
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,797
What? What?
-OK, I see.

517
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,832
You came here because
of the chick.

518
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,435
Ufi. I know you came
here because of Josie.

519
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,437
And she chose a better,
prettier and smarter man.

520
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,513
I don't give a shit for that
slut. I want the basket back!

521
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,150
Why don't we settle this
the civilised way? -How?

522
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,517
I mean, I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you!

523
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,475
Hold on! Cut that!

524
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,156
Jovan, give me the ball.

525
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,317
Let's play three on three
up to 21 . OK?

526
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,873
So, what do we do after
we win?

527
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,999
Well, if you win you can
take the basket with you.

528
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,233
If you lose, it stays here. You
can even drop by to play.

529
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,678
No way! -Why? You don't
dare, do you?

530
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,397
Fuck you!

531
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,149
He can't do it. -What you mean,
he can't? Hold him!

532
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,279
Where's the other basket?
That's the problem!

533
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,428
You gotta fly to win!
We started, we started!

534
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,436
Fuck you!
-No, come on, get away!

535
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,033
What the fuck is it?

536
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,948
Cover him Turca, please!

537
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,995
That's right! Do it, man!

538
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,160
How are you, guys?
-Hey, hello!

539
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,075
Just another foul like that.

540
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,229
Do it!

541
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,829
Didn't I tell you it was too
low? -How you welded it.

542
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,429
I'm gonna weld your mouth!

543
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,432
Victory?

544
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,751
I'm buying beer! -First dibs!
-And cigarettes!

545
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,591
How are you, Tiki?

546
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,797
You were good.
You can still score.

547
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,633
Well, not like I used to be...

548
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,315
What are you doing here?
-I came to see you play...

549
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,714
Are you putting me on?
-I gotta go before the alarm.

550
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,752
Wait, wait... Do I look alittle
like I used to? -Just a little.

551
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,755
You sure are hot for me!
-Come on, dream on!

552
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,915
Bye bye.

553
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,589
Here's some coffee for you.
-Thank you.

554
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,956
No, thank you. I'm having
beer. -A strange taste.

555
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,871
The water is two days old.
A little stale, smells of pipes.

556
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,789
Thank you, we're having beer.
-No, thanks.

557
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,075
What about Josie?
-No problem, buddy.

558
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,750
I wanted to dump her anyway.
She's become a bore.

559
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,394
Fucking hysterical:
"They're bombing us!"

560
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,198
"They're bombing us!"

561
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,350
Just go ahead and cope with her.

562
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,196
I'll try. I have a way with
women's hearts. -Do you?

563
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,714
They're bombing us again!

564
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,159
Let's split!

565
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,879
Danka, Danka,
come on, quick!

566
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,710
Did Tijana call? -Yes, she's
arrived home. -She has?

567
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,555
Here's the vest.
Here's the bag. Quick!

568
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,553
Mihailo!

569
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,548
Misa!
-I'm here, mom.

570
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,231
What's the matter, mom?

571
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,832
And then Hercules jumped
on Pegasus and flew back.

572
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,237
Try to catch some
sleep now, son.

573
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,479
He isn't afraid of anything,
grandma's treasure!

574
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,549
Kaja, there's a game on TV.
-I'll wait till he's asleep.

575
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,036
Can we agree on the idea
that the quality of one's life

576
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,955
can be measured on the scale
of fulfillment of his ambitions?

577
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,032
One smoke and you
got stoned, man!

578
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,318
My grandfather was a farmer.
That's what he wanted to be.

579
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,870
My father is a laborer.
He always wanted to be one.

580
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,276
What about me? -That's what I'm
asking. What about you?

581
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,433
Is my wish gonna come true?
-What would you like to be?

582
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,835
A lover.

583
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,033
You'd better try to be
a laborer or a farmer.

584
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,558
Come on, grab yourself a beer.

585
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,431
Here you are, Turk! You're
the big tiger here, right?

586
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,751
I'll bet you a 100 marks
they will blast the bridge.

587
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,549
Are those 500 marks ready?
We already played on the court.

588
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,634
It's OK, Turk, it's OK.
Suck my cock!

589
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,116
Josie, where have you been?
It's me, Turca, the pretty one?

590
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,391
Didn't you see me?

591
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,996
Don't worry, it'll be over
soon. Don't worry.

592
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,116
Get away from me!
-OK, I'll get away.

593
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,956
We're gonna suffocate!

594
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,668
We're gonna suffocate!

595
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,756
We're all gonna die here!
Let me go! -I'm off.

596
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,554
Where to?
-Out of here!

597
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,712
Where do you think
you're going, woman?

598
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,753
Come back here!
-Let me go!

599
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,637
What's wrong with you?
-Let a bomb kill us all!

600
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,236
I can't stand this any more!

601
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,358
I'm sick!

602
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,677
Hey, Josie, remember my scar?

603
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,032
You know how I got it?
Do you know how? -How?

604
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,596
We were running away
from Sarajevo. Behind the zoo,

605
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,950
where the nuthouse is.

606
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,515
Their snipers are here,
our snipers over there.

607
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,719
I take a look to the left and
spot a cherry tree.

608
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,316
Branches overloaded with fruit.
I feel like I could die for

609
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,796
a cherry. I say, what the hell,
and set off toward the tree.

610
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,195
As soon as I put the first
cherry in my mouth,

611
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,272
they open fire!
I thought I was done.

612
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,274
I haven't touched a cherry
for five years since that day.

613
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,830
What does this have
to do with cherries?

614
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,757
Nothing. Important thing is
that you don't get scared.

615
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,232
And I never got to try
cherries again.

616
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,396
Here's some water.

617
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,598
What have I got
from my life, guys?

618
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,156
How many girls did I have?
Nothing!

619
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,631
You want me to count
them for you? Watch now.

620
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,076
There was one in Makarska,
on the beach.

621
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,791
One in Titograd,
while I was in the army. Two.

622
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,635
Have a seat, Seka, please!
-The tally's three and a half!

623
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,429
I ain't counting heavy
pettings in the doorways.

624
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,276
Nothing for my potentials!
I have a whole life to live!

625
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,040
Seka, come and sit here.

626
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,355
You're pretty, you see.

627
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,669
But you look sad.
Are you OK? Come on, tell me.

628
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,549
Zuba hasn't come down.

629
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,833
Probably screwing some
chick upstairs.

630
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,792
While we're wasting time here.

631
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,711
Are you OK, son?
Don't be afraid, please.

632
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,316
Are you alive, Zuba?
-Fifty-fifty. It depends.

633
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,632
What's the matter? Are you OK?
-They razed their basket.

634
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,120
I was right,
they ain't gonna make it.

635
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,074
I though you didn't care.
-I don't.

636
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,553
Move you legs, son.

637
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,918
Leave it that way, ma.
I'll clean it up.

638
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,111
I gotta call Tijana first.
She isn't answering the phone.

639
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,954
Where were you?
I've just called.

640
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,080
Take it easy, please!

641
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,635
Calm down, Tijana!
-Just hold me, Kaja, please.

642
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,679
You never know
when to hold me!

643
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,514
I was trying to call
all night long.

644
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,350
I was worried about
you and Jovan.

645
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,073
Let me look at your hand.

646
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,872
I don't know what to do, Kaja.

647
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,032
Does it hurt?

648
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,950
What if he never speaks
again? -It has to sting a bit.

649
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,551
I'm staying here! We
should all stick together now.

650
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,958
Did they bomb near you?
-Worse than ever.

651
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,276
How's your mom?
-Shivering and trembling.

652
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,989
A neighbor's with her
while I'm here.

653
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,516
You gotta go, Tiki.
-I can't.

654
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,430
Be reasonable, please. Don't
you see they've run amok?

655
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,279
It's getting worse all the time.

656
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,435
What about the Italian visas?
-I can't think about that now.

657
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,111
We must think about it!
-Just shut up and hold me.

658
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,918
What's up, champ?
Wanna pee?

659
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,711
You don't need a butterfly.
You need something else.

660
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,590
And what have you got?

661
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,476
Me? Nothing, 'cause I
don't believe in anything.

662
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,472
What about me?
Do you believe in me?

663
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,159
You? -I don't care
for that butterfly.

664
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,472
What I really wanted
was to be with you.

665
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:14,750
I don't know why;
you're ugly, boring and fat.

666
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,759
And I still wanted you.

667
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:28,597
So? Do you hate me now?
-I can't hate you.

668
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:34,757
I don't know how to do it.
-You can learn to hate.

669
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,350
Go home now. Come on.

670
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,394
Did mom teach you
the numbers?

671
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,432
Do you know what number
was on dad's dress? -Seven.

672
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:02,879
What did you say?
Jovan, what did you say?

673
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,394
Come on, say it again,
please!

674
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,677
Come on, son.
Come on, say it again!

675
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:17,280
Danka, he spoke up! - What?
-He said "seven"!

676
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,597
Jovan, is that true?

677
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,436
Hello, Tijana! -Yes? -You
know what happened? -What?

678
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,677
Jovan spoke! -Oh, come on!
-Honest to God! -How?

679
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,679
He just said "seven". I asked
him what my number was.

680
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,919
He said "seven". -Don't make
things up. -I'd never do that.

681
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,390
Let him tell you himself.
Come on, tell your mom.

682
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,109
Tell her what you.
Tell her. Come on.

683
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,960
No, he won't do it now.
But he really did it. Really!

684
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,635
OK, Kaja. I'll call you.
-OK.

685
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,232
How are you, Toza?
-Who is it, son? -Toza.

686
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,835
I'll bring 500 marks for you.
-It was a mistake, they say.

687
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,917
Mistake, my ass!

688
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:09,198
I'm sorry. -I know you have
a heart of gold.

689
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,790
I'll bring the money.
-Hang on.

690
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,913
What do you say: let's
forget about the bet?

691
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,471
Why? -I love to win,
but not with their help.

692
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,315
Without them,
you'd have made it.

693
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,750
Then you should give me
500 marks. -Turk. you know.

694
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,316
Come with me,
I'I lget you the basket.

695
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,391
Jovan just spoke.

696
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,716
Welcome to our modest
celebration!

697
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,677
It's your court,
Turk, after all.

698
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:27,355
I'd have missed anyway.
And, suck my cock!

699
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,514
Let's go, guys! Let them idle,
but we've got work to do.

700
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,678
You, Kaja?
-Me?

701
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:47,119
It's OK, buddy.
Just don't be late, please.

702
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,911
Why are you fooling around?
This country's in war,

703
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,119
and you're fooling around!
Go fuck you! Do it quick.

704
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,719
Yes, buddy, I was waiting
for you 1 5 days.

705
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:05,830
Do you have a cigarette?
-I'll call you later.

706
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,673
What's your name?
-Seka.

707
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,194
Come on? Seka? I'm Toza.
-Pleased to meet you.

708
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,676
Are you from the 'hood?
-Yes, I live here.

709
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,953
I've never seen you before.
A cigarette, eh? -Yes.

710
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,676
Take this.
-All of them?!

711
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,710
Thank you.
-Thank you.

712
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,193
What's the matter with you,
you drunken swine?!

713
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,113
Wait until I come upstairs to
tattoo your fucking brain!

714
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,317
I'll come down and stick
those cigarettes up your ass!

715
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,439
OK, I'm waiting for you! I'm
sick and tired of you, jerk!

716
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,556
What's up? Leave me alone!
-Come here!

717
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,318
I gotta go home.

718
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,718
What did you do with him?
-None of your business!

719
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,229
It is! Get in here!

720
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,198
He just gave me cigarettes.
-You don't know him.

721
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,518
I'm sick of your lecturing!

722
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,352
Sorry. - What for?
-Everything.

723
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:24,555
Her name was Jelena.
-Whose? You sister's?

724
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,070
She was 1 7.
Just like you are now.

725
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,952
I was drafted and
our grandma died

726
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,399
and my best friend
managed to dodge the draft.

727
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,871
I thought it was a good thing;
he would take care of her.

728
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,548
And so he did.

729
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,910
What happened?

730
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:57,232
He took her to Amsterdam.
He came back; she did not.

731
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,473
And you don't know what
happened to her? -No idea.

732
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:07,518
Maybe she's OK.
-Then she'd have called.

733
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,479
Why don't you ask that
friend of yours?

734
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,395
Toza?
I wanted to kill him.

735
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,917
When I stuck a gun barrel
in his mouth, he told me

736
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,550
she ran away from him
with some criminal.

737
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,359
And I believed him.

738
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,029
Am I the only one
whom you've told that?

739
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,755
Yes, though everybody
knows it.

740
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,800
Come on, pick out a card.

741
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,032
Remember which it is.

742
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,838
Why don't you tell me
what card I picked out?

743
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,316
How the hell do I know
what card you picked out?!

744
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,075
I've got something for you.
-Really?

745
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,078
Cherries!

746
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,309
They may start shooting
from somewhere. -They won't.

747
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,749
Yes, this is the great quality
of these guys.

748
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,596
The awkwardness, poor play.
Yes, yes, all these misses!

749
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,677
Come on!

750
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,753
Here's your inquisitor!
-Yes.

751
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,713
Come on, shoot!
Come on, hit it!

752
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,431
Would you like to play?
-Move your ass back home!

753
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,673
Come on, hard hats, would
you like to play? -Why not?

754
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,320
OK, but let's play a men's
game! -OK.

755
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,838
OK, let's play three on three,
up to eleven points.

756
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,391
It's one - nil.

757
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,955
Ciao.
-Hi.

758
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,831
Balls, kid!

759
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,993
Come on, bro, that's it!

760
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,470
It's 1 1 - 8.

761
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,751
Let's go to my place.
-He plays well, your kid.

762
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,428
I coached him.
-The kid's got balls.

763
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,840
Did Tijana call, mom?

764
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,910
What did you say?
-Did Tijana call? -Not yet.

765
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,791
Looks so calm tonight.
-I don't know why they're late.

766
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,314
Hey, what are you
doing, champ?!

767
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,669
Would you like to
massage your dad's back?

768
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,075
Come on, step on me.

769
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,637
Yes, that's it!

770
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,753
Hey, take it easy!

771
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,195
How come you're here so
early? -I came to take Jovan.

772
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,598
We are leaving.

773
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,958
Where to? -To a safe place.
Far away from here.

774
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,153
What will happen
to Kaja, Tijana?

775
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,478
Hey, bravo!

776
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:25,116
Where were you, Tiki?
A bit early, aren't you?

777
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,433
I came to pack his stuff.
-Champ's going home?

778
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,314
No, I'm taking him to Italy.
I've got the visas.

779
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,630
Hey, hold it, son. Hold it.

780
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,514
Where are you, honey?

781
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,555
Pity you weren't here yesterday.
It was great.

782
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,918
Everybody came out.
As if the situation was normal.

783
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,716
Have you seen the court?
-What are you talking about?

784
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,675
I'm taking him to Italy and
you're talking about the court!

785
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,590
You should have seen him!
He started to speak.

786
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,671
I wanna say,
I finally did something.

787
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,116
It isn't much,
but it's something.

788
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,273
I did something for Jovan.

789
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,398
I did it to make him
think of something else.

790
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,594
Are you still talking about it?
-You should have been here.

791
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,391
Everything was abnormally
normal, like ten years ago.

792
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,308
I thought that this thing
has made us.

793
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,354
somehow closer after all.
-Kaja, I still love you,

794
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,069
but it won't make me stay.
-Why is it your only way to tell

795
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,556
me that you love me?
Why?!

796
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:17,880
Hello, taxi! Please send
a car to 4th Boulevard No. 70.

797
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,271
In three minutes?
Yes, thank you.

798
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,632
So, you managed
to get the visas?

799
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,799
I thought we might talk
some more about it.

800
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,993
Kaja, you said it yourself.
Jovan should live a normal life.

801
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,994
This place won't be normal
even in ten years time.

802
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,832
Jovan!

803
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,478
Jovan!

804
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,714
Hey, honey!

805
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,878
Come on out of there,
please.

806
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,992
Honey, we're gonna take a trip.

807
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:14,716
Across the sea. Eh?
Come on, sweetheart.

808
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,599
Don't you wanna go with
your mommy?

809
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,399
Hey, champ,
please don't hide there.

810
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,475
Do you know how you
become a real champion?

811
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,712
When you come out
to play when it's hardest.

812
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,229
And win.

813
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,513
When Djordjevic and
the guys come to play here,

814
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:50,195
I'll let you know, so that
mom can take you here.

815
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,913
You know?

816
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,313
OK?

817
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,516
Come on!

818
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:13,158
No son, it's your ball.
Take it with you.

819
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,558
I'm overloaded.
I can't take this one too.

820
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,639
It's my present for him,
Tijana.

821
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,909
I made you some lemonade and
sandwiches for the trip.

822
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,069
Jovan likes grandma's
sandwiches the best.

823
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,840
You shouldn't have.

824
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,476
Come on, honey.

825
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,511
Listen, Kaja, you really did
miracles with that court.

826
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,234
You really surprised me.

827
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,794
But I need greater miracles
to make me stay here.

828
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,760
What shall I do?

829
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,314
I'll practice to work
great miracles.

830
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,474
Hey, champ.

831
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,791
Come on.

832
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,553
Tijana!!!
Tijana!!!

833
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:23,036
What is it, honey?
-Seven.

834
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,469
What are you doing here? You
wanna stay here all day long?

835
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,359
Nothing. Everything is OK.

836
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,273
Lousy weather. A hard day
for both NATO and us.

837
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,353
You're a nice guy, Turca?
Has anyone told you that?

838
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,034
Chicks mostly.

839
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,509
Let's have a beer together,
come on.

840
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,357
No, I'll stay here for
a while to cool down.

841
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,238
Bye.

842
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,389
I know.

843
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:41,589
Dad was buried on Thursday.
The ceremony was a quiet one.

844
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,829
A lot of people died
in these days.

845
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,673
Zuka and Siske didn't fight
any more.

846
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,751
They didn't talk too much,
either.

847
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,798
They were just sitting
in silence.

848
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,276
Turca talked Josie into
going with him to Greece.

849
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,830
They made it across the
border and left the country.

850
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,475
He promised to teach
her to laugh again.

851
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:10,275
Misa was the first
to get drafted.

852
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:14,639
Many others were called-up
after him.

853
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,829
Come on, private.
Go there and grow up.

854
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,872
See you.

855
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,396
It's you. Looks like you,
doesn't it?

856
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,593
I couldn't have done it better,
I was looking at the mirror.

857
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,558
No one plays any more.

858
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:59,554
I couldn't sleep because of
the noise from the court.

859
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,714
Now I can't sleep
because of the silence.

860
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,799
When are you gonna
finish that tattoo?

861
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,151
Never.

862
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,678
Come on, you try.
I'd surely have missed.

863
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,548
Tijana went to Italy
and she got married later.

864
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,230
I started speaking again,
but in Italian.

865
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,638
But I've never forgotten
my mother tongue.

866
