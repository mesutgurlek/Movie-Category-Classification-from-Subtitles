(HELICOPTERS APPROACHING)

3
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,292
OFFICER: It's time to change
the game in Afghanistan,

4
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,727
to force the Taliban to react to us,

5
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,164
instead of us reacting to them.

6
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:42,336
I want you to understand, I picked
you specifically to be the company

7
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,573
that goes the furthest south
in the battalion's AO.

8

I know that you will be able to overcome
any challenge that you'll face.

Some days you'll have good days, and
some days you'll have bad days.

10
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,617
But the same question
I posed months ago,

11
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,652
is what should really drive your action.

12
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,324
Is what I'm doing gonna
move the Afghan people

13
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,260
closer to their government
or further away.

14
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:13,667
We are attacking to seize control
of the population from the Taliban.

15
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,836
Because once we've
secured the population,

16
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,472
they no longer have a sea to swim in.

17
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,708
And the insurgents are
gonna die on the vine.

18
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:26,546
Every interaction we have with the
people is critical to our success.

19
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,416
They have to develop trust in us,

20

we are experts in the
application of violence.

23

of purpose and aggression

broke my hip up real bad,

took a piece of the bone out
where my femur meets my hip.

tumbled, flipped through

and my leg's broke right now.

174

It just ain't in the cast
because it's got a metal bar

from my knee to my hip
holding it together,

so it's not in a cast.

like a village elder.

have to go talk to that village elder

Well... (CLEARS THROAT)

635
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:00,952
We're gonna be in the area, not
necessarily in these houses

636
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:04,122
or in this village, but
we're gonna be in this area

come back, I do, very quickly.

00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,774
They can come back, but we
are going to be here also.

Some of the bombs that we have
found in some of the villages,

we're putting them together
and blowing them up.

You, the people that live in
the villages around here,

652
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:34,846
are trapped in the middle. I understand.

653
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,918
The people that have been here, forcing
their hand on you and oppressing you

654
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,822
and hurting you, that's why we're
here to get them away from you,

00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:45,691

do that to you anymore.

I hope that our relationship,

with me and you, our relationship
can become stronger,

658

because what I want is what
you think is best for you.

659
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,303
Not what I think is best for you,

so that we don't have the fights.

time you will accept me

as one of your village leaders,

671

672
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,341
I share the same hardship that you do.

We're in the same position.

Yeah, see, this is a
completely different class

The houses are, too.

You know, we need to tell them that

682
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:11,676
we really, really, really love the house

683
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,244
and really want to rent it,

684
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:16,381
and my situation, that I
got to get into a house.

It's perfect.

at our other house.

it heal by itself.

butt's kind of gone, dude?

Yeah. Well, that's kind
of where it started.

And then it goes down my leg.

And you say this was a firefight?

717
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,251
I mean, we had been fighting like...

718
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:34,819
That looks painful, man.

719

We had been fighting
for months and months,

720

but, just at the very end,

721

I made it all the way
to the very end, dude.

722
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,361
That was gonna be... I had one more...

I had about one more
mission the very next day,

724
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,533
then I would've been done, man.
I'd have been safe.

I'm doing pretty bad, to be honest.

00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,513
I can tell. All right.

729
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,182
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

730

You gonna throw up? I might.

731
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:07,618
Okay, I'm gonna put this in.

732
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:08,886
Just need a minute.

Tell them we're getting
shot at from that wall.

Yeah, but they can't come down the road.

Get that mark and shoot
the middle of the wall.

747

They're shooting from there

748
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,662
and directly down the road.

and they need to drop 2-0-0.

750
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:09,647
NATHAN: When I was 18 years old,

751
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,250
all I wanted to do was kill people,

752
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,584
you know.

753
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,553
They used to ask me when I
came into the Marine Corps,

754
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:18,323
"Why did you come
into the Marine Corps?"

755
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:21,226
"Why did you come into the
Marine Corps Infantry?"

756
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:23,995
And I always told them,
"Because I wanna kill people."

757
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:27,932
And they always said, "That's the
best answer I've ever heard."

758
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,702
That's all they want, that's
all they ever wanted.

759
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:36,107
And, you know, I thought for
a long time that was cool.

760
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,942
That's really what I wanted.

761
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,711
And, you know, that's
really the way I felt.

762
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,447
You know, in my first two deployments,

763
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,981
I was kinda one of them guys

764
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:47,152
that didn't really have
any fear whatsoever.

765
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,054
You know, I was ready to go do it,

766
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:52,323
I wanted to go fight, I
wanted to go kill the enemy,

767
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,959
and be, you know, a roughneck,

768
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:59,064
and cuss and spit tobacco
and come home and do it again.

769
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,033
I did that.

770
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:04,735
I was just a young cowboy.

771
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:07,238
And then this last time, you know,

772
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:10,108
I had more concern
about it, you know, like,

773
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:12,543
"I'm all for it, let's go do it."

774
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:17,282
But, you know, I've already
done it, I've already done it,

775
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:21,052
and it's not everything you
think it's going to be.

776
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:23,188
And it's hard and it's tough,

777
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:26,191
and it changes people,

778
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:29,327
and here I am going to do it again.

779
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,529
All right, hold on.

780
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:33,531
God, you're fighting me. I'm not.

781
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,500
I'm leaning on the desk.

782
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,235
Sitting here, being still.

783
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:39,104
(EXHALES) There we go.

784
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,408
NATHAN: But I've got to do it.

785
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:47,412
I've got to fight to get home
to my wife and to my family.

786
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:51,549
And also for my men and for our country.

787
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:55,220
So, you know, still ready to go do it,

788
00:50:55,253 --> 00:51:00,425
but I've got a 26-year-old
head on me this time

789
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:02,493
instead of an 18-year-old head on me.

790
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,563
You know, I just kind of grew up.

952
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:45,736
In time, as your knee motion
starts to come around,

953
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:46,937
this may really bug you.

954
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:48,672
I may have to cut it out.

955
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,342
That's where it hurts. It burned
for a long time to the touch.

956
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:55,445
I could barely touch it,
and it would shoot pain.

957
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:57,414
Like when I first left last time,

958
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,750
it'd shoot pain down through my body.

959
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:02,019
And then, I just kept
working it and rubbing it,

960
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,955
and it, like, hid itself down inside.

961
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:06,290
You know what I mean? Mmm-hmm.

brace that bends ya?

Remember, you're not going
to be yourself again.

973

say you're a Devil Dog again

978
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:37,121

979

and go back to killing people.

980
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:39,489
All right. Okay?

981
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:41,158
Yes, sir.

982
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,726
I understand. Good.

983
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,095
I'll be a few minutes. Okay.

984
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:46,163
No worries.

Feel better? A big relief, huh?

988
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:03,881
About a year.

989
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:06,116
I know. You've known
that the whole time.

990

blessed that it's a year.

all stuffed in his clothes.

back and didn't have shit.

he get on this side?

want you telling the doctor

that we need to switch
it to something else.

to something else.

You said that I even told
that other doctor something.

You told Dr. James that.

the pain doctor that

and make them mess me all up.

What did I tell them?

1062
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,764
To switch my medicine.
You didn't tell him.

switch your medicine.

Oh, man, right in the kisser.

There's one right, you know.

1271
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:59,929
Yep, one more time.
This one is for Ashley.

1272
01:19:59,963 --> 01:20:02,899
Oh, got your ass!

When we lay down in the bed at night,

1277
01:20:10,874 --> 01:20:13,843
I put one in the chamber, like that,

1278
01:20:13,877 --> 01:20:16,946
and I put it on the
right side of my body,

01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,781
tucked in between the mattress

I put it in the perfect spot.

01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:26,455
All I have to do is this.

1283
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:29,926
Run my hand along the
edge until I feel it,

1284
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:32,161
and I pull it out,

1285
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:35,531
all I got to do is flip it
off safe and I'm ready.

(CLICKS)

1287
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:41,270
Done.

1288
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:10,900
Okay, get in the position.

1289
01:21:14,003 --> 01:21:15,038

1290
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:20,043
This is the starting
position we start in.

1291
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:21,377
Later on, I get aggravated

1292
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,046
and start freaking the fuck out

1293
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:26,482
and push you off of me into the wall.

I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

I pray the Lord my soul to take.

I'm fucking hit, dude."
