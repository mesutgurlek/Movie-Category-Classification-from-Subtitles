1
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,291
Who created these horrible
weapons?

2
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,773
From there, the war and
carnage started

3
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,853
And the way to a cruel death was open.

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,335
However,
don't blame this miserable.

5
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,208
We're the ones who don't
know how to use what he gave us.

6
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,175
To defend ourselves from the
wild animals.

7
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,134
The time is coming near

8
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,531
and the fatalities

9
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,412
with God's will,

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,771
will decide, which one of us

11
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,451
forgetting of ourselves

12
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,053
will cry, because the destiny 

13
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,811
will bring  a  cruel and violent death

14
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,854
in the worst time of war

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,338
to a captain so loyal.

16
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,693
That had only a few shots,
in that war that he commanded

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,178
to the achievements that we're waiting from him.

18
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,656
Because on these days

19
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,773
it's normal to trespass people.
Even more using intrigue

20
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,929
and politics.

21
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,091
From Your Highness Frederico
Gonzaga, Marquis of Mântua

22
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,137
to the Famous
Alfonso D'Este, Duke of Ferrara:

23
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,932
 SignorJoannino,

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,210
was brought, yesterday, Mântua

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,020
To be treated of a leg wound.

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,331
that he got from a shot fired by the
army of Frendsburg

27
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,416
But the doctors said that he
is between life and death.

28
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,258
It's not enough being loyal,

29
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,455
as you are

30
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,732
if your good name isn't recognized

31
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,974
By our religion and our faith

32
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,492
that we follow since our birth.

33
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,776
By the dawn of the day,

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,893
he woke up, with a lot of pain.

35
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,128
And, at the time he saw me,

36
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,889
he told me to ask Maria, his wife

37
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,734
to send his son, Cosimo

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,376
And when he was talking,he could feel
the death coming for him,

39
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,375
and got sad.

40
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,734
He told me to bring his company bed,

41
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,969
so he could die like a soldier.

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,889
At this time, his eyes were looking
like glass

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,096
And the light gave place to darkness.

44
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,213
I heard that even His Holiness became moved.

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,889
Although he could stop to cry

46
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,331
the tragic fate of SignorJoannino, his nephew,

47
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,619
The Holy Priest recognized the evil side
that he had.

48
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,130
and that it was bigger than the good side.

49
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,255
But we'll not say nothing more about this.

50
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,177
because God found a medicine.

51
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,538
Signor Joanni De'Medici,

52
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,095
Captain of the army of His Holiness
Clemente Vll,

53
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,214
became ill, which lasted for 4 days.

54
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,135
and then he died in the land of Grifone.

55
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,212
from a fever.

56
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,732
after he got shot in the leg
by a cannonball

57
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,494
in Mântua, in the last day of November.

58
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,654
of 1 526.

59
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,296
Six days before

60
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,857
German cars!

61
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,730
Throw it on the river!

62
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,017
Today, saturday,

63
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,377
joining the army from the
lansquenetes, on the border of Pó,

64
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,211
Signor Joanni D'Medici
and his cavalry,

65
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,260
rided with such heart

66
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,889
that the enemy retreated,

67
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,053
losing several cars of provisions.

68
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,052
General!

69
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,372
Captain De'Medici attacked our provision cars!

70
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,454
That demon and his dark group
- Let's maintain the order.

71
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,090
And avoid any confrontation.

72
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,018
The reason for this hostility is clear now.

73
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,489
Let's avoid losses and cross
the river immediately.

74
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,380
The Elite Forces of Emperor Carlos V,

75
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,659
invaded the country with a infantry
of 18000 men.

76
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,213
and they loot a few of our cities.

77
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,537
But they received only half of
their salary

78
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,215
and to make matters worse,

79
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,291
they don't have any artillery.

80
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,339
The progression from the German invasion
met with

81
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,979
General Della Rovere
and his Pontifical army

82
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,293
whose infantry of 8.000 men
and 600 elite men.

83
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,538
are preceded by Joanni de'Medici
with 600 armed men

84
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,492
and the same number of cavalry

85
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,654
which responsability

86
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,051
is to delay the Germans, attacking them,

87
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,817
day and night.
And Captain Médici

88
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,136
polished all of his weaponry

89
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,617
to surprise the enemy in the darkness.

90
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,495
At first, we're uncertain

91
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,174
about which way the Germans took

92
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,014
and whey they were 8 miles
away from Mântua,

93
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,575
il looked like they wanted to
cross the river

94
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,818
in Bogoforte or San Nicolo Po.

95
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,969
But in that part of the river

96
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,416
there were no more bridges

97
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,533
so, they have a bad time crossing it

98
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,657
So, they stopped.

99
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,208
The bridge fell.

100
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,618
The soldiers of the pontifical army
had cut the ropes.

101
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,375
The supreme German Commander,
General Frundsberg,

102
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,135
was in a hurry to go back to Rome

103
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,975
because he had trained his soldiers
to kill the priests

104
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,049
and to stole the wealth of the Church.

105
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,939
He had a gold rope that was always
with him.

106
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,897
Claiming he was going to hang
the Pope with it!

107
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,610
Prepare yourselves for an urgent message.

108
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,931
A messenger!

109
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,575
Prepare the messenger to leave.

110
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,615
A message to Captain De'Medici!

111
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,658
We have to expel Frundberg

112
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,098
before he crosses the river,
and opens his way to Parma.

113
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,649
If he refuses to fight us,
it's because he wants to go back to Rome.

114
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,372
In the middle of the winter, he won't
find neither food nor amunition.

115
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,128
He now how to find it.
That Luteran!

116
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,330
Not for a long time.

117
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,650
To Francesco Maria Della Rovere,
Duke of Urbino,

118
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,614
Supreme Commander
of the Pontifical Army.

119
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,577
It looks to me

120
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,574
that the Italian army,
not being disciplined,

121
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,169
and don't obeying any orders,

122
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,780
our infantry can't

123
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,530
take the attack

124
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,208
of the German Army

125
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,936
Although that army

126
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,337
doesn't have artillery

127
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,256
And it would be better

128
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,133
to attack

129
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,769
this army of lansquenetes

130
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,250
through skirmish and sudden attacks,

131
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,730
to cause them damage and to stop

132
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,692
the renew of their stocks,
the only way to destroy

133
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,419
the order and obtain victory.
upon people so weel organized.

134
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,690
Your faithful and obedient
Giovanni De'Medici.

135
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,732
Here's the reward for a soldier
of these days.

136
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,138
a bullet flattened as a coin.

137
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,296
Colonel Cuppano,

138
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,895
the new fire weapons change the wars,

139
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,055
but the wars change the world.

140
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,211
For the honored
Captain De'Medici.

141
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,777
Your Highness can be sure

142
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,415
that you're so important to me

143
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,852
that i'll always regret

144
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,889
when you make me a request
that I can't fulfill.

145
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,374
like this from today, regarding
the artillery

146
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,895
that you ask, and I can't do.

147
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,019
And certainly, I don't know anyone

148
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,691
that can do that on these dark times.

149
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,812
That is the reason

150
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,331
that i ask you, Captain De'Medici,

151
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,772
that you forgive me, because I can't
do what you're asking

152
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,889
Your brother,
Alfonso D'Este, Duke of Ferrara.

153
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,180
A long hair and a long beard are both
a nest for lices.

154
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,208
And is an advantage to the enemy.

155
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,896
I'm so hungry that I could eat a pig.
- And i'd eat even it's bones.

156
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,654
Those bastards, of all races and religions

157
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,693
just do evil things.
They rape women,

158
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,250
burn the grass and kill the cattle.

159
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,892
they stole our things,
and what is worse

160
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,975
they don't have any respect for our
land and our people.

161
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,852
The Pope's army is poor, they don't
have any money.

162
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,820
Enough!

163
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,856
No money! Ruffians!

164
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,653
The faster we get rid of the Germans

165
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,971
the faster we the rid of the Pontificals,
that are worse than the Turkish.

166
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,934
Bastards! They hurt the ones they
have to defend.

167
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,137
as the one who they have to fight.

168
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,100
To end this war with the minimun cost,

169
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,254
We should allow General Frundsberg
to pass.

170
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,850
through the passage of  Curtatone.

171
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,770
The German is in a hurry to cross the Pó

172
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,494
to get rid of the pontifical soldiers.

173
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,414
Fog today, clouds tomorrow.

174
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,697
If the lansquenetes can have

175
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,494
on day ahead of the pontifical.

176
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,460
they can cross the river and
open the way to Milan.

177
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,449
Guards!
- To your work!

178
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,610
Inform the vicar that Gonzaga said,

179
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,336
that tonight we'll let General Frundsberg pass.

180
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,088
and so his Army.
- Yes, Your Honor.

181
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,216
In the name of the father, the son

182
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,014
And The Holy Spirit. Amen.

183
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,535
What they'll say in Mântua

184
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,451
when they see me

185
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,339
asking favors for other people?

186
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,855
You'll be put aside.

187
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,697
Here you have,

188
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,090
the reward for my honor,

189
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,896
that, without hesitation,

190
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,775
I delivered for everyone to see.

191
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,136
Everyone is watching

192
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,889
the love that you've been showing.

193
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,128
They know that I trust you

194
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,573
They know that I never denied

195
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,290
any favors.

196
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,298
It's too cruel

197
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,609
that from this love,
that I though that it was eternal

198
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,169
I got only disgrace

199
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,931
All that I have left

200
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,894
is to bear the disgrace of my husband.

201
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,700
And I can only hope for

202
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,494
a disgraceful fate.

203
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,608
In the name of Your Majesty,
the Emperor,

204
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,050
The german Ambassador

205
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,808
for the Duke of Ferrara,
Alfonso D'Este!

206
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,330
Your Precious Imperial Highness,

207
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,260
Carlos V,Emperor Of Germany

208
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,610
Sent me in person,

209
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,015
a noble Ambassador

210
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,615
so that I can share.

211
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,694
of your honored investiment.

212
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,889
And also to bring the wedding contract.

213
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,375
Between our son, Hercule

214
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,375
and your beloved daughter

215
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,658
the distinct Margarida of Áustria.

216
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,093
Artillery piece known as
"falconetto",

217
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,260
a new mecanism of reloading from
the back, allowing

218
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,578
a faster charging and a greater fire power.

219
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,298
Hurry up!

220
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,490
Hide this.

221
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,817
My beloved wife,

222
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,620
please, send me six plates,

223
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,130
some bowls and cups.

224
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,490
Two towels and 8 napkins.

225
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,937
Two blouses,

226
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,217
Because is very cold in here.

227
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,729
Since our last report,

228
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,973
nothing happened in here,

229
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,496
that we should tell you, Your Highness.

230
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,809
And if wasn't for these letters,

231
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,448
it wouldn't bother you

232
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,568
in your absence.

233
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,299
Keep it straight.

234
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,490
For God's sake.

235
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,332
Keep yourself on the border.

236
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,300
With the chain!

237
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,532
That's it! Well done.

238
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,017
I'm Matteo Cusastro,

239
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,655
Chanceler of the Marquis of Mântua.

240
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,892
I bring greetings from Your Highness,
and the promise of hospitality

241
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,848
to General Frundsberg

242
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,890
and his Imperial Army in Gonzaga's Fort.

243
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,328
Fill it, so it'll last the whole night.

244
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,016
Read something to me.

245
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,135
Here's what Maquiavel wrote:

246
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,058
"The loyalty of the mercenaries
is short.

247
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,929
"Why should them be loyal to the ones
they don't know?"

248
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,535
"Why Gods and Saints would we make
them swear?

249
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,810
"The ones they love,
or the ones they hate?

250
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,859
"I don't know anyone they love.

251
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,210
"But i know they hate everyone

252
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,770
"Nothing is worst than the idea

253
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,979
"that all the wars are created
because of money.

254
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,409
"Instead Of politics."
- Capitão De'Medici!

255
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,938
Who's there?

256
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,257
They located Frundsberg
in the road of Mântua.

257
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,088
Between Montanara and Curtatone.

258
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,173
preceded by a squadron, with
Gonzaga's weapons.

259
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,179
You're sure?
- According to our patrol.

260
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,418
That bastard Federico
swears loyalty to the Pope,

261
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,970
And then offers protection 
to the Germans.

262
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,098
It's politics, Monsieur Aretino
Like Maquiavel wrote,

263
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,175
the politics is worst than the weapons.

264
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,098
The Germans had gone back

265
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,617
to cross the Pó.
We can't stop them now.

266
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,090
If we stop Frundsberg,
we'll stop the war.

267
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,816
To proceed at night,
the great risk is the swamp.

268
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,810
The worst thing for the soldiers

269
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,370
The wars represent only
problems, dear Luc'Antonio.

270
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,010
The cavalry must be ready to leave.

271
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,492
Guards!

272
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,700
A moment!

273
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,453
Wait!
A car will leave.

274
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,772
Let it pass!

275
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,973
Raise the door, but don't
block the chains

276
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,458
Two sentinels waiting for orders.

277
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,413
Where are you going at this time?

278
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,420
You're searching for hell

279
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,973
or there are crows in your rooftop?

280
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,695
You're damned souls without rest?

281
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,893
De Profundis Clamo Te Domine.

282
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,335
We're searching the camp 
of the pontificals.

283
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,617
Search for your salvation,
your ignorants..

284
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,813
We're living times of ignorance,

285
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,735
and the triumph of the Beast

286
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,171
For your there is no forgiveness,
no salvation,

287
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,416
Is there anyone in here?

288
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,297
Answer!

289
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,850
We're searching Captain De'Medici.

290
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,691
They're gone for a few hours.

291
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,618
Let's go.

292
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,252
We'll keep searching.

293
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,216
Pontifical mail.

294
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,530
Inform captain De'Medici!

295
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,328
The Germans entered through
the passage of Curtatone!

296
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,098
Ride faster.

297
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,617
And stick together.

298
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,418
Vicar, release the guards.

299
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,298
All torches must be thrown away.

300
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,409
Hurry! They can't see the light.

301
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,099
Silence.

302
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,100
Raise the bridge and tie the chains.

303
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,692
Order everyone to be quiet tonight.

304
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,092
You, where you're going?

305
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,893
Stop! Customs from Parma.

306
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,732
Who are you, venicean dog?

307
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,571
I bring salt.

308
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,131
From Ferrara to Mântua.

309
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,090
Always authorized.

310
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,974
Screw you

311
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,894
And your mother too.

312
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,728
ANd your father, that pig.

313
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,339
Hurry up!

314
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,896
Tonight, we did it.

315
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,018
Commander Frundsberg
allowed me to know that he understands.

316
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,419
the damage caused by those soldiers on
this land.

317
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,170
But that's war, there's nothing you can do.

318
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,697
And to you, he'll always be grateful.

319
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,374
For let him pass.

320
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,576
Giving him an advantage on the pontificals.

321
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,569
and cross the Pó in Ostiglia,
the only bridge still in one piece.

322
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,014
But, to leave no doubts.

323
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,014
We'll send an urgent message to
His Holiness.

324
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,891
To tell how Your Highness

325
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,410
Ask him for forgiveness.

326
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,738
For what i was forced to do,

327
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,578
Because i could never had stopped the
 lansquenetes from passing

328
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,534
they would pass anyway.

329
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,296
Guards, open.

330
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,810
Lower the bridge.

331
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,332
I'm Giovanni De'Medici,

332
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,732
Captain of the pontifical army,
asking for passage.

333
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,010
We're searcing the germans from Frundsberg! Open it.

334
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,419
Tell the vicar to give the order.

335
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,617
In the name of God, don't answer.

336
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,852
In the name of His Holiness,
and Your King.

337
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,889
That the eternal Lord kill us right now.

338
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,815
Open this door.

339
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,656
Betray the church.

340
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,337
Or tomorrow i'll cut your throats,
starting from the vicar.

341
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,178
And this bastard Gonzaga

342
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,139
Traitors! Bastards

343
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,490
Bastards!

344
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,696
What is that at this time of the night?

345
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,897
It's captain De'Medici.

346
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,694
He's in the passage of Curtatone
with his men.

347
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,530
He's searching for General Frundsberg,
in the middle of the night.

348
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,256
He manaced the vicar and Your Highness.

349
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,174
He said that if we don't lower the bridge.

350
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,855
Tomorrow morning, heads will roll.

351
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,371
firewood for the fire.

352
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,055
We need to get warm.

353
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,778
Look!

354
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,850
What a strange Christ.

355
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,330
The Christ of the poors.

356
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,498
of the hungry,
the homeless.

357
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,050
Bivaque Bande Nere near the walls of Curtatone

358
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,250
If the money dows not came from Rome.

359
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,295
What we'll say?

360
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,934
TO be happy with the blessing
of the Pope?

361
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,449
Wine against the cold??

362
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,777
Dear Luc'Antonio,

363
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,096
in Rome, you know

364
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,616
that the blessing without weapons
doesn't win wars.

365
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,177
Get him up.

366
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,496
Pull the head.

367
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,017
See if he bites you.

368
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,298
Or send you to hell to burn your ass.

369
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,211
To warm myself

370
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,536
i'd burn the Christ and the Virgin Mary.

371
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,131
My beloved wife,

372
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,615
i want you to go to Rome,

373
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,296
the faster the better.

374
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,936
You know my needs.

375
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,131
Explain that to the Pope.

376
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,969
How i'm without means to continue.

377
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,736
In the war, tho ear the 
respect of the soldiers.

378
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,378
we have to spend as much as we can.

379
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,049
I ordered a little bed,

380
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,132
so that 2 men can carry without problem.

381
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,378
Our little Cosimo Cosimo had a fever
during two days.

382
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,573
but we had no doubts that he would be
better soon.

383
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,375
so we left Rome.,

384
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,817
although is snowing.

385
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,698
Sunday, 24 of November.

386
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,816
Where is the vicar?

387
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,734
You, go and tell Federico

388
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,330
Who's always doing bad things

389
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,094
That when I find the Germans,
I'll be back

390
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,576
So I can have a good talk with him

391
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,614
who didn't let me in yesterday

392
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,014
I'll punch him until he pukes shit.

393
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,211
It's our fault.

394
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,008
that the vicar didn't open the door 

395
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,854
to no one, at that time?

396
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,260
If he had talked to us, 

397
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,135
like everyone should do

398
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,219
we would ask him to open.

399
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,770
the passage of Curtatone.

400
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,734
But Your Highness

401
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,291
Knows SignorJoanni better than anyone.

402
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,373
He was always very violent.

403
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,495
When he was young, killed a friend
with his sword

404
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,055
Holy Mother,
what a fog.

405
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,138
In the border of Pó, near Mântua,
in a discrete place.

406
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,174
 General Frundsberg received

407
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,810
the four pieces of artillery

408
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,208
given in secret by Alfonso
D'Este. Now, the german.

409
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,458
knowing that will surprise the pontifical army
with the cannon

410
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,898
decided to cross the Pó
in Ostiglia

411
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,414
to get rid of Captain De'Medici,

412
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,292
whose cavalry were coming to get him.

413
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,693
Gaining time, riding through the bay of
Bagnolo San Vito,

414
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,212
Where he's getting in prior of
the german army.

415
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,494
who's been advancing for hours.

416
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,490
When our country get rid of these armies.

417
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,613
well be free of this war.

418
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,890
It looks like the head of the column.

419
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,051
It's the personal guard of Frundsberg.

420
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,694
But he's not there.

421
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,817
Armors in the center.

422
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,735
Take positions on the hill.

423
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,132
Take the right distance to fire.

424
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,731
Load!

425
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,137
Don't resist!

426
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,695
Don't resist!

427
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,288
Keep yourselves in the border

428
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,940
they're retreating!
Don't fight.

429
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,615
BASTARDS.

430
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,295
FIght as soldiers.

431
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,935
What kind of men are you?

432
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,730
Bastards sons of bitches.

433
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,738
Although last friday and saturday

434
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,616
we've had an horrible journey,
through cold and snow.

435
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,058
We arrived on Rome last night.
In our father's house.

436
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,776
safe and sound, thank God.

437
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,898
We've been imediately received by our
uncle, the Pope.

438
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,257
With affection and attention.

439
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,816
I spoke to him about our necessities
on the war.

440
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,895
His answer was

441
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,377
that he would give us support,
day or night.

442
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,055
every time we needed.

443
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,934
We should prepare to go back
before the night falls?

444
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,417
Before night fall

445
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,211
There's one more thing.

446
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,974
To expel Frundsberg!

447
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,932
By horse, two by two.

448
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,373
Rapid cavalry
two by two.

449
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,532
Why are you so proud?

450
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,856
Where are you going,
armed as killers?

451
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,575
You don't need our weapons

452
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,488
TO exterminate the people in this world.

453
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,051
Listen to me! Be careful

454
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,335
The Lord's vengeance is too powerful

455
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,769
More than all of your swords.

456
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,492
Shut up, priest.

457
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,772
The real wealth is not from this world.

458
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,097
Stabulum hoc praeponere coelo!

459
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,330
That's him.

460
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,616
It's an ambush.

461
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,410
Retreat.

462
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,655
Artillery.

463
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,378
General Della Rovere
inform your HIGHNESS.

464
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,129
that they did not took him to the
dormitory yet,

465
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,932
What we now for sure

466
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,774
is hat he got hurt in a skirmish with the lansquenetes,

467
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,979
that were hidden nearby

468
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,450
in San Nicolo da Po.

469
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,618
Joanni went there with his cavalry.

470
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,334
In the ambush, he got hurt in
the leg by a bullet.

471
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,376
The General Della Rovere is worried

472
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:20,210
because he doesn't know from where Frundsberg
artillery is coming from.

473
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,258
We already informed

474
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,254
His Holiness, the Pope

475
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:29,295
That Marquis Federico
does not have this artillery.

476
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,771
And the few we have

477
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,695
we want to save it, as our only defense.

478
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,450
and nothing more.

479
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,300
So, we don't take any advantage

480
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,777
and no one shows so powerful weapons
paid by the church

481
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,615
the Pope, actually

482
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,569
The German artillery

483
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,051
for what we know

484
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,650
Belongs to the Duke of Ferrara

485
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:00,132
who delivered to Frundsberg
during the night.

486
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:03,776
in boats used to transport salt

487
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:10,017
And neither the Duke officials,
nor ours.

488
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,410
have looked closely on these boats

489
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,293
Look!

490
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,616
It's snowing.

491
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,289
Holy Mother!

492
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:35,373
The renowned Signor De'Medicis,

493
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,693
Commander of the Pontifical Army,

494
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,970
The last shot of "Falconete"

495
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,379
Bad Luck!
- The Real bad luck

496
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,817
is that the winter is really wild

497
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,813
and the cold causes more damage than
the weapons

498
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,855
And our own MesserJoannino
is the first between those fanatics.

499
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,140
Even polished the metal of his armor

500
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,657
to fight during the night.
What could be worse?

501
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,175
Famous General,

502
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,657
Our error was to attack the germans,
who have a god commander

503
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:21,491
they already have an advantage on position.

504
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,129
But if they refuse to admit
their error.

505
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,809
They cant blame us for the incident
with the passage in Curtatone.

506
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,689
It remained closed, as usual,

507
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,528
since the world is world.

508
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,496
Messer Gonzaga,

509
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,419
Captain De'Medici searched for

510
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,214
your protection, and no one else

511
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,895
May God reward you a thousand times.

512
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,689
for helping us.

513
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,295
It is a great reward to 

514
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,693
help Captain De'Medici.

515
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,611
With a wound in the same leg

516
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,375
he wounded in Pavia's battle.

517
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,328
It was a great honor to me

518
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,932
to be in the battlefield by your side

519
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,179
Your cousin, Marquis Federico,
is coming to visit you

520
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:25,134
with the General Della
Rovere, Duke de Urbino.

521
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,410
General!
- My respects.

522
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,932
Dear cousin,

523
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,654
We all regret

524
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,534
the bad luck of our
Joannino.

525
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,613
Without Captain De'Medici in the battlefields

526
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,133
His Holiness, the Pope,
will have all the reasons

527
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,253
to be worried with the result
of this war.

528
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:08,096
That's strange, a general like yourself

529
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,579
abandon the battle to visit a sick one.

530
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:16,494
However, I should be happy with my luck

531
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:20,771
Because, even with all the bad things
that already happened

532
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,098
I had the honor to be brought
to the house of MesserLoyso,

533
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,416
who is like

534
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,373
a brother to me,

535
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,415
and, if I die here,

536
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,097
I wouldn't be seen 

537
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:44,976
as an enemy of Gonzaga Family.

538
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:52,129
Our renowned
Marquês Federico

539
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:55,020
had rapidly called

540
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,536
the surgeon, Habram,

541
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,414
that will take care of you with
all of his knowledge.

542
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,893
For all of this, i'm really grateful
to  MesserFederico

543
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:11,653
for our old friendship and his charity.

544
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,696
And I thank you all,

545
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,575
My dear friends.

546
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,530
But, above all, I thank God

547
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:28,534
who allows us to do everything.

548
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,731
Master Habram is here.

549
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,450
Great, let him do his job.

550
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:36,090
Monday, 25 of November

551
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,017
It doesn't worth it

552
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,854
The leeches are not working,

553
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,655
we've tried twice

554
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,620
That's a signal that the blood is deteriorated.

555
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,095
The wound is full of worms

556
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,652
It's been 20 hours since he was treated.

557
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:17,248
The doctor said he is in
danger of death

558
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:22,652
Although nothing is for sure.

559
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,614
before the end of the fourth day.

560
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:59,296
Your impetuous nature

561
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:03,457
always stopped you from

562
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,255
make use of my wealth

563
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:09,210
As I wanted you to do.

564
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,259
Ask me anything now

565
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:19,334
Worthy of us both.

566
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:30,650
Love me, when i'm dead

567
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,259
so that my wound

568
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:12,369
don't contaminate my whole body

569
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,815
There's no other way

570
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,055
we have to cut the leg off.

571
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,774
Do what you have to do

572
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,490
We need clothes to make sheets

573
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,454
In my house there's no one

574
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:45,528
Promise me that you'll send some

575
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,209
But I don't know what i'm gonna do.

576
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,730
Send two towels,

577
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,293
and two crosses.

578
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,811
And also

579
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,171
two packs of roses

580
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,935
to put on his bed

581
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,250
and give him a good fragrance.

582
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,890
Wednesday, 27 of November

583
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,491
Everyone, get out.

584
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,297
Cut it!

585
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:55,851
With the help of God Almighty

586
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:16,213
I'm sad because I couldn't send
everything you asked.

587
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,337
As i wrote, one day I'll have
more money

588
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,609
and then, i'll serve you better.

589
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,330
Am I healed?

590
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:02,370
Friday, 29 of November

591
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,178
Inform Maria not to believe

592
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:02,974
so fast in a disgrace.

593
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,690
and that, in the next moon,

594
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:14,169
i'll be back home

595
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,415
This is only to inform you

596
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:33,411
that, right now

597
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:37,213
i'm about to give birth

598
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,776
And i'm sure that the child is
from Your HIghness.

599
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:49,174
Although I don't ask for money right now,

600
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,619
I ask you a favor.

601
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,299
please, write to my husband

602
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:04,692
that, in respect for Your Highness

603
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:09,212
he doesn't leave me alone, as he did in the past

604
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,297
only in the interest of the unborn child

605
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:23,449
because she'll have his blood.

606
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,135
Please,

607
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:53,253
Read something for me

608
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:43,537
During my whole life,

609
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:48,015
I've always lived

610
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,935
as a soldier

611
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:56,293
as I would've lived

612
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:59,698
by the rules of the religious

613
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:04,292
If I had chosen that path

614
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:09,008
that you did.

615
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,298
From the abyss, I call for you, my Lord.

616
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,009
Hear my voice.

617
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,690
Hear my prayers

618
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:24,216
If you remember all of
our sins

619
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,570
How can we be saved.

620
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,376
Have mercy of me, Lord.

621
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:34,534
Freed me of my unhappiness

622
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,539
And, with all of your Love

623
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,575
erase all of my sins.

624
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:44,179
Óh, death, where's your victory?

625
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:47,533
Where is the blade of your sword?

626
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,895
The inevitable weapon of death

627
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:53,820
Is in the law of sin.

628
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:57,774
But I hope that you save me, my Lord

629
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,813
and my soul believes in your
forgiveness.

630
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,375
and my soul is waiting for You.

631
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:08,613
more than the sentinels wait for the dawn.

632
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:12,857
The Famous Signor
Joanni De'Medici,

633
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:18,409
Captain of the army of 
His Holiness Clemente VII,

634
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,049
remained ill for four days

635
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:26,258
and then, died of a fever

636
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:31,337
after he got shot by a cannon

637
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:35,250
in Mântua,

638
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:39,249
In the last day of November
 of 1526

639
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:16,374
The German kept walking
along the river

640
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,698
In Ostiglia, they crossed the Pó.

641
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:23,019
Free of Captain De'Medici,

642
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:26,977
nothing else could stop them.

643
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:30,251
The General Frundsberg,

644
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,577
badly ill,

645
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:35,858
Had to abandon his army, and go home

646
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,048
The army of your majesty

647
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,536
The Emperor Carlos V,

648
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:45,090
joined with the army of Bourbon,

649
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:48,417
and then conquered the city of Rome

650
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:51,698
In May of 1527.

651
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:57,253
Because of the dead of
Captain Joanni De'Medici,

652
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:00,892
The most famous commanders and
captains of all armies

653
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:03,492
expressed their wish

654
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,733
that the fire weapons would never be used

655
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:09,298
against the men
