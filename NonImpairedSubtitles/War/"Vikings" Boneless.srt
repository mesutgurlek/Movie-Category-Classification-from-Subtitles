1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,364
Ragnar: Previously on "Vikings":

2
00:00:01,465 --> 00:00:03,200
Without Jarl Borg's ships and warriors

3
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:06,002
we cannot hope to mount
a successful raid on Wessex.

4
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:07,170
We will find another ally.

5
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:10,307
I want my revenge on King
Ecbert and I shall have it.

6
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,375
Envoy: You need a new
ally to attack Wessex.

7
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:14,010
We can provide such an ally.

8
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:15,779
His name is Earl Ingstad.

9
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:17,380
Lagertha: Over a hundred warriors.

10
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,382
Will you accept me as an ally?

11
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:21,651
King Ecbert: Ragnar Lothbrok
is no longer alone

12
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,053
in attacking our shores.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,123
If you and I join together,
we should surely overcome him.

14
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:29,192
Rollo: Why do you keep making
concessions to Horik?

15
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:30,727
Ragnar: Because he is the king.

16
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:34,831
Floki: Everything here is for Ragnar,
but he cannot have everything.

17
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:37,167
Siggy: Floki is angry with Ragnar.

18
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:39,236
Aslaug: I told Ragnar
if he forced himself on me

19
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,037
in the first three days of his return,

20
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:43,240
I would bear him a monster.

(Cries out in agony)

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,433
(Grunts and wails in agony)

29
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:27,444
Siggy: (Concerned exhale)

30
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:33,216
Princess Aslaug, listen to me.

31
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:37,253
You are in an open field.

32
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,055
On one side of you is a deep pit

33
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:42,625
filled with bones and ashes
and hellish things.

34
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,828
On the other side is your house,

35
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,396
your sons, the Fjord,

36
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:50,900
and the sunlight is striking the snow
high on the mountains.

37
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:52,802
If you want to reach your house,

38
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,673
then you must push the
baby out as Freya would.

39
00:02:56,774 --> 00:03:00,910
Let him rip you, but push... Out.

40
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:03,613
(Shaky breaths)

41
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:05,915
Choose life.

42
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:08,685
(Distorted chanting)

43
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,153
- Siggy: Yes.
- Aslaug: (Cries out in pain)

44
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:15,156
- Siggy: Yes.
- Sorceress: The baby will come.

45
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,395
Aslaug: (Grunts in pain)

46
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,563
- Siggy: That's it! Good.
- Sorceress: I see the head.

47
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,365
Aslaug: Agggghhhhhhhhhhhh!

48
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,467
(Panting, relieved)

49
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,671
(Crying)

50
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:33,777
- (Baby cries)
- Siggy: It's alive.

51
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:34,944
It is alive.

52
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,213
Sorceress: It's a boy.

53
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:48,391
(Baby coos)

54
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,764
King Horik: We must prepare
to go to Wessex.

55
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:58,902
Obviously, we must leave soon.

56
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,804
Lagertha: I have to return
to my territories.

57
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:05,241
I have to prepare my ships.

58
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,177
It will take some time.

59
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:09,112
King Horik: How much time?

60
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:12,615
Bjorn: Just enough time.

61
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:15,852
No more, no less, King Horik.

62
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,656
Porunn: Your father has a new child.

63
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,293
- Bjorn: A son?
- Porunn: Yes.

64
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:26,963
King Horik: I must congratulate
your father.

65
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:29,799
It is never a bad day to have a son.

66
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,903
The gods cannot stop
offering him their blessings.

67
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:36,172
Erlendur: I, too, am happy for Earl Ragnar.

68
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:38,274
King Horik: Erlendur.

69
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:45,115
Lagertha: Who are you?

70
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:46,282
Porunn: Porunn.

71
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:49,385
Lagertha: I meant, who are you to my son?

72
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:55,859
Bjorn: She is a servant. A slave...

73
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:58,928
(Waves lap at the shore)

74
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:04,167
And I am in love with her.

75
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:08,838
(Preparatory breaths)

76
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:18,114
(Baby fusses)

77
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:25,021
(Bites umbilical cord and spits)

78
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:33,196
(Sighs)

79
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:39,435
(Sighs heavily)

80
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:45,975
(Sniffs and sighs dejectedly, baby coos)

81
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:51,714
Ragnar: After all,

82
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:53,783
your prophecy was right.

83
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:56,685
(Baby fusses)

84
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,591
(Footsteps thud loudly, rain patters)

85
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,034
King Horik: Don't be too long.

86
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:13,536
Lagertha: I won't.

87
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:15,571
King Horik: I need you.

88
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,573
If the three of us are equals,
we need each other.

89
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:21,010
But one cannot be more
equal than the other.

90
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:22,645
You mean Ragnar.

91
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:24,547
You and I are at least his equal,

92
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:27,883
and Ragnar must come to understand this.

93
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,218
I agree.

94
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,686
Siggy: Lagertha!

95
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,590
To keep you warm.

96
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:37,226
What is wrong with Ragnar's new son?

97
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:41,297
Siggy: Nothing. Be safe.

98
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,734
Lagertha: How loyal you are, Siggy.

99
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:49,839
(Rain patters loudly)

100
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:00,816
Agh! (Vicious thud)

101
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:04,120
(Shields strike hard, weapons clank)

102
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:05,688
Don't die stupidly.

103
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:07,089
I'm not going to die.

104
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,724
(Sword strikes)

105
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:09,892
Agh!

106
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:13,662
Rollo: Yes, you are! If I choose.

107
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:20,035
Agghhh! (Axe strikes)

108
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:23,539
Rollo: Fight!

109
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,674
(Water splashes, swords clash)

110
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,543
(Blade slashes) Ugh!

111
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,645
(Distorted shaky breaths)

112
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,283
(Axe strike rings, surprised gasp)

113
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,854
(Distorted axe strike,
distorted shout of surprise)

114
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:40,689
(Blade rings, water splashes)

115
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:42,791
(Sword strikes sand)

116
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:45,961
(Shaky breaths)

117
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:48,063
(Shield splashes)

118
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,901
(Grunts)

119
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,938
Always remember to finish off
your opponent, if you can.

120
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,106
No man ever ran away

121
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:58,541
with his entrails hanging to his knees,

122
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:00,543
or his head cut off.

123
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,918
(Blade rings)

124
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:14,623
Rollo: Your mother is an amazing woman.

125
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:16,192
Bjorn: I know.

126
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:20,095
You were in love with her once.

127
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:21,964
(Thunder rumbles)

128
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:26,202
Well, believe me, those
feelings are wasted.

129
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,705
Don't the gods love?

130
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:34,476
Who is to say their love is wasted?

131
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,579
(Chuckles)

132
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:40,182
How come you know so much about the gods?

133
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,121
Because my father, you and I...

134
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:49,959
Are all descended from Odin.

135
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,528
Or is that not true, uncle?

136
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:02,037
He will die anyway.

137
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:04,540
What is the point of pretending?

138
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,578
If we were wolves, or even pigs,

139
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,581
this poor, weak runt would be discarded.

140
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:14,683
(Baby coos)

141
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,120
(Sniffles)

142
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:21,523
We are not wolves or pigs.

143
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,829
Ragnar: It is natural.

144
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:30,532
We let such babies die for their own good.

145
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:34,003
For what kind of a life could he live?

146
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,307
I know, but I don't care.

147
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:48,083
(Fire crackles)

148
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:54,857
(Loud buzz of chatter)

149
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:59,228
(Sheep bleat)

150
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:04,833
Aethelwulf: Always so behind the times!

151
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:08,137
Athelstan: Well, that's true.
My work is for all eternity.

152
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,039
- Athelstan: Who is coming?
- Aethelwulf: Kwenthrith.

153
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,674
The daughter of Offa!

154
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:12,841
Athelstan: King of Mercia?

155
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:15,577
Aethelwulf: Well, before he died, that is.

156
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,746
Athelstan: Not his son?

157
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,081
Aethelwulf: Don't you know anything?

158
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:22,851
Kwenthrith killed her brother,
Offa's natural heir.

159
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:27,556
Now the whole kingdom is
beset by dynastic squabble.

160
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:30,993
Everyone is murdering everyone.

161
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:32,895
Athelstan: Presumably...

162
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:34,530
King Ecbert doesn't want to get involved

163
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:36,765
with such terrible squabbles?

164
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,567
Aethelwulf: Of course not.

165
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:39,968
My father has no interest whatsoever

166
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,504
in what happens in our neighboring kingdom,

167
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,940
which just so happens to be
the largest, most important,

168
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,042
and richest kingdom in England.

169
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:52,081
Athelstan: So this is our fratricide.

170
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,016
Our mass murderer.

171
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:57,019
King Ecbert: Welcome, princess,

172
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,288
to the Kingdom of Wessex.

173
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,058
(Fierce wind blows)

174
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:08,664
(Water laps gently)

175
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,176
(Fierce wind blows)

176
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:25,914
(Footsteps rustle lightly)

177
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,230
(Baby fusses)

178
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,636
(Footsteps retreat)

179
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,314
(Baby coos)

180
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:03,419
(Water flows nearby, birds chirp)

181
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,921
There is no other way.

182
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:07,990
(Inhales sharply)

183
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:14,863
No other way, my son.

184
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:34,249
(Baby fusses)

185
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,687
(Birds chirp, water flows nearby)

186
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,889
(Metallic scrape)

187
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,630
(Birds chirp)

188
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,264
(Relieved exhale)

189
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,682
(Baby coos softly, Aslaug weeps quietly)

190
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:40,992
(Horse whinnies in the distance)

191
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,477
(horse whinnies, galloping hooves)

192
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,787
(Galloping hooves thunder loudly)

193
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:16,060
(Loud, excited chatter
fills the great hall)

194
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:18,162
(Bells jingle)

195
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,166
Women: Lagertha! Lagertha!

196
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,472
- Man: My lady.
- Woman: It is good to see you!

197
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:31,142
Einar: Welcome back, Earl Ingstad.
We've all missed your presence.

198
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:34,545
Lagertha: Thank you, Einar.

199
00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:36,547
But you will have to do without my presence

200
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:38,416
a great deal longer.

201
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:42,019
It is agreed that I am to raid
the English kingdom of Wessex

202
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,722
with king Horik and Earl Ragnar.

203
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:46,524
(Shouts of excitement, bells jingle)

204
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,793
I expect my ships to be provisioned

205
00:14:48,894 --> 00:14:51,162
by the next full moon,

206
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:55,132
and all my warriors to be
armed and assembled.

207
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:59,070
Man and woman: (Chatter excitedly)

208
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:01,506
(Doors burst open, royal trumpet bellows)

209
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:04,675
(Cheering and applause)

210
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:09,780
(Music plays, lively chatter fills hall)

211
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,388
Kwenthrith: Oh, no meat for me.

212
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,757
I don't like it. It kills you.

213
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,592
(Bishop laughs)

214
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,694
Kwenthrith: Only vegetables.

215
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:31,536
Who are you?

216
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:34,972
My name is Athelstan.
I was a monk at Lindisfarne.

217
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:37,842
A monk!

218
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:40,778
King Ecbert: Athelstan was captured
by the northmen.

219
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,446
He's lived amongst them.

220
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:45,816
He knows everything about their pagan ways.

221
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:51,689
I have heard that the pagans
sacrifice human beings!

222
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,825
Is that true? Do they actually?

223
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:57,528
Every nine years, yes, they do.

224
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:59,730
To please their gods.

225
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:02,333
Kwenthrith: And are they naked?

226
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:03,501
I have been told that they make love

227
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:05,570
to whomever they choose,

228
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:09,874
and that the idea of fidelity
is utterly strange to them.

229
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:13,978
They have... A different morality to us.

230
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,614
Is it not more natural?

231
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,617
Athelstan: I...

232
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:21,352
Kwenthrith: (Distantly)
Is it not more natural?

233
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,622
(Moans of pleasure) Is it not more natural?

234
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:25,890
(Heavy breathing)

235
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:28,659
(Echoing) Is it not more natural?

236
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,597
Athelstan: I... I would only say
that it is different.

237
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,465
(Loud buzz of chatter)

238
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:35,700
(Light clang)

239
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:38,369
Kwenthrith: How boring you are!

240
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,806
King Ecbert: I was shocked to hear
of the death of your brother.

241
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:44,909
Kwenthrith: Oh, don't worry
about my brother.

242
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,045
Did you know that the Pope
has already made him a Saint?

243
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:50,514
Saint Kenelm!

244
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:54,518
Apparently, he lived an exemplary life!

245
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,490
King Ecbert: Do you mean to say that
he was not altogether virtuous?

246
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:01,425
Kwenthrith: Well, he raped me
when I was about twelve.

247
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:02,827
Bishop Edmund: (Coughs violently)

248
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:05,196
Kwenthrith: So you must make up
your own mind.

249
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:08,566
King Ecbert, I do not need to ask

250
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,768
why you've invited me here.

251
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,837
I know very well.

252
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:16,107
You want to influence
the destiny of Mercia.

253
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,843
My family are killing one another,

254
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,578
and you want to be on the side of the party

255
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,914
which succeeds to the crown.

256
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,851
You put it very precisely, princess.

257
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:29,687
It should not surprise you to hear

258
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:32,957
that myself and my allies will succeed.

259
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:36,927
But, perhaps, your support
would be an advantage.

260
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,597
King Ecbert: I was thinking of sending
my son, Aethelwulf,

261
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:42,533
to advise and help you.

262
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:52,877
I would gladly open my gates...
To your handsome son.

263
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:54,378
Aethelwulf: (Chuckles)

264
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:57,648
King Ecbert: I would also like to hire
some northmen as mercenaries

265
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:01,986
to help you succeed in gaining
the throne of Mercia.

266
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:04,655
Kwenthrith: I need to meet these northmen

267
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:08,959
whose prowess, in all things,
I have heard so much about.

268
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,861
Heh.

269
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:14,899
It seems no one can talk
of anything else now.

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,868
King Ecbert: So let us drink...

271
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:23,107
- (Chairs scrape back)
- To princess Kwenthrith,

272
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,110
and the conquest of Mercia.

273
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:28,012
All: The conquest of Mercia!

274
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:29,947
(Cups clink)

275
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:34,785
(Low, muffled roar, water ripples lightly)

276
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:41,125
(Water splashes, Lagertha sighs)

277
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:47,965
(Bathwater splashes,
Lagertha sighs repeatedly)

278
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:53,137
(Chimes jingle lightly)

279
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,308
(Animal howls in the distance)

280
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,410
(Chuckles softly)

281
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,681
Lagertha: Einar, why don't you come in?

282
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:08,486
(Slurps)

283
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:12,590
(Door creaks open, bathwater sloshes)

284
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:15,860
Do you want to speak to me?

285
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,962
Einar: Yes.

286
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:21,465
Lagertha: Then wait.

287
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:25,603
(Water splashes)

288
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,940
Einar: (Breathing heavily)

289
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:36,947
What do you want to say?

290
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,185
(Exhales heavily)

291
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:44,221
(Liquid pours)

292
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:48,859
Einar: I thought we had an agreement.

293
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,596
I don't remember any agreements, Einar.

294
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:55,533
You do remember!

295
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:58,002
I would help you become Earl,

296
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:01,705
and then, as a result, we might be married.

297
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,543
Lagertha: I never made any arrangements.

298
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:09,814
Not with you, nor with anyone else.

299
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:22,126
You wanted rid of Sigvard
because he was insane.

300
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:25,162
So I killed him.

301
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,099
That's all.

302
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:33,204
Einar: (Breathing heavily,
unsheathes dagger)

303
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:41,045
If you do not let me enjoy you,

304
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,848
I shall open your face!

305
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:53,858
Lagertha: And then... What
would your family do, hmm?

306
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,495
If they had any respect for you,

307
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:02,800
they would have made you Earl, not me.

308
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,906
The truth is, you couldn't kill me.

309
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:13,844
The only person you could
kill was a dying man.

310
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:18,816
That's how brave you are.

311
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:25,089
(Barking and howling in the distance)

312
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,025
Siggy: Aslaug, forgive me.

313
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,160
What is wrong with Ivar?

314
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:37,134
Everybody talks, but nobody knows.

315
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:38,903
Aslaug: He is my son.

316
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:40,070
Siggy: But sooner or later,

317
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:41,405
you have to show him to the world.

318
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:44,475
You can't keep him covered up forever.

319
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,845
(Ivar coos)

320
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:50,281
(Sharp exhale)

321
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,054
(Object clatters lightly)

322
00:21:58,623 --> 00:22:01,592
(Approaching footsteps)

323
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:05,963
(Gasps)

324
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:11,535
Ragnar is right.

325
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:14,638
Aslaug, this child will never walk.

326
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:22,079
Oh, by the gods, you must...
You must put him out to die.

327
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:27,151
Thank you for your good advice,

328

out. Inge, help me!

495
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:34,566
(Foliage rustles underfoot, horse nickers)

496
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,071
Shield-maiden: Cover this here!

497
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:42,707
Warrior: And dig a trench for it.

498
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,844
Shield-maiden: Tie it with this rope.

499
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,082
I never imagined the west would be so wet!

500
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:52,984
King Horik: Where is Torstein going?

501
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:56,421
I sent him to inform the
king of our return.

502
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,123
Why?

503
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:02,327
Ragnar: So he knows that
we are here to talk...

504
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:04,096
And not to fight.

505
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:06,698
And you did that without
consulting with me.

506
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:12,204
Ragnar: I thought you would both agree.

507
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:14,406
King Horik: Why should you think that?

508
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:17,709
Ragnar: Because it is a sensible policy.

509
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:22,814
Fine, I will...

510
00:36:26,786 --> 00:36:31,556
Unfortunately, it is too
late to recall Torstein.

511
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:36,094
Lagertha: You should have
discussed it with us;

512
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,963
King Horik is right.

513
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:43,401
Ragnar: I will try to remember that
the next time, Earl Ingstad.

514
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:46,238
King Horik: There is not going to be
a next time, Ragnar,

515
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:48,440
unless you agree you will
never ever do anything again

516
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,176
without consulting with me first.

517
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:58,350
For you and I are not equals.

518
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,357
So, what do you propose now?

519
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,561
Ragnar: Wait.

520
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:11,997
Lagertha: For what?

521
00:37:12,098 --> 00:37:13,198
Ragnar: The unexpected.

522
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,367
King Horik: Let me tell you
what to expect, hmm?

523
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:19,037
King Ecbert will send
some envoy to trick us,

524
00:37:19,138 --> 00:37:21,206
or he will send some army to annihilate us.

525
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:23,308

Shield wall!

my father, King Ecbert,
sends his greetings.

550
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:57,926
He hopes that you will be
prepared to talk to him.

551
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,502
Ragnar: I am prepared.

552
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:09,505
But we would have to exchange hostages.

553
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:12,141
Aethelwulf: Of course.

554
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:15,911
And my father also sends you this,

00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:34,897
I gave it to him.

558
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:37,566
Then he is alive.

Aethelwulf: Athelstan is waiting to
see you at my father's villa.

You have his guarantee of safe passage,

as well as my father's.

562

Ragnar: Then...
