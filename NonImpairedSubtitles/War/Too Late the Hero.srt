1
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:13,786
Yes, sir, I'll give Capt. Nolan your message
soon as he returns.

2
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,081
<i>Get him now.</i>

3
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:16,621
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Do you hear me?</i>

4
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,088
<i>Get him now!</i>

5
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,590
Oh, boy.

6
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,864
He's pretty burned up, isn't he?

7
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:28,457
The old man wants to see you, right away.

8
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:30,559
Oh, God, that's all I need.

9
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:31,797
Good luck.

10
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:34,534
Come in.

11
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:41,004
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's happened?

12
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,310
That was Admiral Dawes on the radio, sir.

13
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:46,318
- I mean, it was Admiral Dawes personally.
- So?

14
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,547
I told him what you told me, sir...

15
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:51,920
that you weren't in,
and we were still looking for Lt. Lawson.

16
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:55,358
- And?
- And that didn't seem to satisfy him, sir.

17
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:58,026
It doesn't satisfy me, either.
What about Lawson?

18
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:00,930
- He's nowhere on the base, sir.
- Look off the base.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,265
Send out the Shore Patrol.
Bring him in, I don't care where he is.

20
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:06,237
Yes, sir. We've done that, sir.

21
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:09,206
If you've done that,
there's nothing else to tell me, is there?

22
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:10,640
No, sir, nothing else.

23
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,406
I just thought you'd like to know
what was going on.

24
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:30,322
Lt. Lawson!

25
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:41,006
If you're heading for the P.X.,
get us some more beer.

26
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,443
Anybody seen Lt. Lawson?

27
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:19,238
- Sam, where you going?
- I thought I'd have me a little grub.

28
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,871
- Wanna come?
- No, I ate already.

29
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:26,750
There he is!

30
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:29,946
Lt. Lawson!

31
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,090
Capt. Nolan wants to see you right away, sir.

32
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:38,255
- Who, me?
- That's right, Lieutenant.

33
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:40,196
Please, sir. Get in.

34
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:41,893
Yeah, I'll get in.

35
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:45,335
- What does he wanna see me about?
- I don't know, sir.

36
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:14,159
See you tonight, girls.
First come, first served.

37
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,632
You can draw straws.

38
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,298
Here we are, sir.

39
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:26,507
- Keep the meter running, boys.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:37,345
- The old man wanna see me?
- Boy, does he wanna see you.

41
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:44,092
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, John.

42
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:46,231
What's all the excitement?

43
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:49,132
They said you were looking for me.
Is that right?

44
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:50,669
By the way...

45
00:05:50,837 --> 00:05:54,830
how'd you make out with that funny broad
at the club last night?

46
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:58,373
I was under the impression
that the funny broad was with you.

47
00:05:58,444 --> 00:06:02,471
Hell, I brought her, but she really liked you.
That's why I left.

48
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:04,877
I wouldn't wanna appear ungallant...

49
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:08,887
but I think I'd just as soon
do without your assistance in that direction.

50
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:12,049
That's nice.
I thought I was doing you a favor.

51
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:17,590
Anyway, what's all the panic?
I was just getting ready to eat.

52
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:19,460
I have a job for you.

53
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,661
What, before I go on leave?

54
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,725
Yes, before you go on leave.

55
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:26,431
All right, as long as
I'm on that midday plane tomorrow.

56
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:29,474
Very gracious of you,
but it'll take a little longer than that.

57
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,375
Can't, John.
I got a four-weeks' leave coming.

58
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,540
- Later.
- Later nothing.

59
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:38,243
High noon tomorrow, I'm on that plane.
I'm gonna be in Frisco Sunday night.

60
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,717
We're flying you out of here this afternoon.

61
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:43,687
You'll be in the New Hebrides Sunday night.

62
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:46,882
The New Hebrides?

63
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,085
I've your orders here.

64
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,288
You'll report to a British Combat Unit
on one of the islands.

65
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:53,992
They need someone who speaks Japanese.

66
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,733
Combat Unit? What's that?

67
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,305
What the hell is that?

68
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,471
First you talk about postponing my leave,
now you're talking about combat?

69
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,708
There are three other officers
in the radio section.

70
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,808
Two of them speak better Japanese than me.

71
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:16,116
- They are all a lot older than you.
- That's good, they're mature.

72
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:17,678
But who picked on me?

73
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:20,954
I did. And it's not a question
of picking on you.

74
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:23,354
The British are organizing this for us...

75
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:26,796
and it's gonna involve
a certain amount of physical hardship.

76
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:30,097
We have to supply the man.
In my opinion, you're the man for the job.

77
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,296
No, John, negative.

78
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:35,932
Pick Antonelli, he likes all that military crap.
Not me, no.

79
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,805
I'm sending you, Lieutenant.

80
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:40,038
"Lieutenant"?
I'm Sam, don't you remember?

81
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,676
Sit down.

82
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:44,079
- Don't be...
- Sit down, Lieutenant.

83
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:53,119
I have to comply with an instruction
from higher authority.

84
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:54,659
A lot higher.

85
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:59,664
In order to do that, I'm obliged to make do
with the best possible personnel I have.

86
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:02,326
I know you're a long way
from being right for the job...

87
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:05,370
but only you begin to meet
the physical requirements.

88
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:08,669
Fortunately, they don't appear
to be concerned about much else.

89
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:12,302
So pack your things and report
to the Transportation Officer in 25 minutes.

90
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:14,505
You mentioned a Combat Unit.

91
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:17,672
I guess that means a bunch of limeys
running around...

92
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,514
playing soldier, getting shot at, right?

93
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:24,049
You may not remember this
or you may not be aware of it...

94
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:28,150
but I volunteered for the service
because as a language specialist...

95
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:31,526
I was gonna get a bar on my shoulder
and be able to sit by a radio...

96
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:34,430
and eavesdrop on those fiendish Orientals.

97
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,802
If they're gonna change those rules...

98
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:41,940
I just might have to resign that commission.

99
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,038
That's your privilege.

100
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,605
And if I do...

101
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:54,209
you'll have to send another officer.

102
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:55,812
Right?

103
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:59,085
The order specifies
"Japanese-speaking personnel."

104
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:02,824
If you resign your commission,
the Navy would be happy to accept it...

105
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,261
and send you out there
as a Seaman Second Class.

106
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:08,630
Would you like me to arrange that
for you right now?

107
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:09,996
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

108
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:15,205
- I can't win, can I?
- No, you can't.

109
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:21,271
Incidentally, this operation is something
the British are mounting for our benefit...

110
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:23,315
so it wouldn't hurt to show them courtesy.

111
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:24,747
- Courtesy?
- That's right.

112
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:28,719
You'll get along better if you don't
call them "limeys." That kind of thing.

113
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:31,018
I don't care
whether I get along with them or not.

114
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,651
Listen, you miserable bastard,
I'm not interested in your problems.

115
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:38,356
We lost two PT boats yesterday
not 2 miles from that bay down there.

116
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:42,094
I have to spend the rest of this day
writing to folks back in the States.

117
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:46,070
"Dear Mrs. Smith, a funny thing happened
to your boy last night. He got burnt up."

118
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:49,403
What shall I tell them?
"Too bad your kid couldn't be a bit smarter.

119
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:52,933
"If he spoke Japanese, we could've
gotten him a job sitting on his ass.

120
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:56,209
"When this mission comes along,
he'd say, 'Not me, buddy.'"

121
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:58,546
Go on, get out of here.
I don't have time for you.

122
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:01,711
From what I hear, the British
won't have time for your selfish...

123
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:05,052
I hope they get your goddamn head
shot off for you.

124
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:12,025
I'm sure we'll get along just fine, sir.

125
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:17,397
They're gonna love him.

126
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,279
Come on, scram!

127
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,720
- Toss it up, sir.
- You guys aren't in a hurry, are you?

128
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:58,072
You know something? I don't think
that clown's happy in the service.

129
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:02,137
Ain't it the living truth.
That bum wouldn't be happy anywhere.

130
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,116
Let's go.

131
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,097
Okay, back it in.

132
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,539
That's it.

133
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:33,274
A little to the left.

134
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:35,004
Hi.

135
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,915
- Boat's waiting, sir.
- What boat?

136
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:47,487
There's your boat, Lieutenant.

137
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:53,160
Thanks a whole lot.

138
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,896
Have a nice trip, Lieutenant.

139
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,550
Left, left, left, right, left!

140
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:28,456
Makes me a bloody foolish sight.
That's what.

141
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:31,165
Right, left! Keep those arms up.

142
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:33,635
Water's hard enough to come by.

143
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,169
Wash out those water barrels!
Get them off my square!

144
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:49,111
Keep those arms free, keep those heads up!

145
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:52,385
Go and get that man in the rear
or I'll keep dragging you all day!

146
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,154
Get those water barrels off my square!

147
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:05,127
Okay, bookie's off the course. No more bets.

148
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:09,265
Ready, set, go!

149
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,110
Connolly.

150
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:16,272
Your bleeding horse
is being left at the post.

151
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:19,806
That's not fair, Tosh!

152
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:21,216
Why not?

153
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,721
My jockey's only using his whip, ain't he?

154
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,155
If your bloke
doesn't wake his bloody ideas up...

155
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,386
you're gonna owe me two packets of fags.

156
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,825
He's right, Connolly.

157
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,386
Even you can run faster than that pig.

158
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:34,398
All the same, it isn't fair.

159
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:37,663
Away and pick your nose,
you mooning Mary!

160
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:40,204
But it isn't fair, Campbell. Look at that!

161
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:42,934
Objection! Steward's inquiry!

162
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,939
Gentlemen, objection sustained!
This bloody horse has been doped.

163
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:50,243
What the hell do you think
you're playing at?

164
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:54,616
Don't argue with the steward, laddie.
I've a mind to report you to the Jockey Club.

165
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:57,247
Leave him be.
I think his brains have come loose.

166
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:58,984
Yeah, you better watch it, Thornton.

167
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:01,026
All right, let's have you!

168
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:02,651
Cpl. McLean, get those men fell in.

169
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:04,559
Scott, right marker here.

170
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,928
One straight line, come on.

171
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:09,825
- Corporal.
- Sir.

172
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:13,629
Away and find Pvts. Rogers,
Currie, Rafferty, and Pvt. Riddle.

173
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:15,571
What's up then, Sarge?

174
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:17,703
Nothing to worry you.

175
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:19,676
- Good morning, sir!
- Howdy.

176
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,147
Commanding Officer apologizes.
He would have greeted you personally.

177
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:28,675
- It's okay.
- He's just come back from a reconnaissance.

178
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:32,415
Col. Thompson is waiting, sir.
If you'll come with me.

179
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:38,720
- Lf you'll come with me, sir.
- Right.

180
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:41,523
I'm excused duties, Sergeant.

181
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,090
Is that right?

182
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:51,703
Listen, laddie, we've had your stripes.

183
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:56,539
You make it necessary,
and I will personally crucify you.

184
00:14:57,349 --> 00:15:00,477
You're on that list
because I put you there myself.

185
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:03,146
If you want a personal interview,
you can have it.

186
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:06,783
And you'll likely find yourself
facing a court-martial...

187
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:09,350
for self-inflicted wounds.

188
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:12,687
Do you hear me all right, laddie?

189
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,023
Yes, Sergeant.

190
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,573
Tosh, what's that then?

191
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:26,010
It's a bleeding Yank, isn't it?

192
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,410
No, Connolly, that's not a Yank.

193
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,308
That's Snow White.

194
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,876
And very pretty she is, too.

195
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:34,913
All right!

196
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:37,245
You've got bugger all to laugh about.

197
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:38,983
- You there, Hearne!
- Sir.

198
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,184
You're supposed to be
standing to attention!

199
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,085
This way, sir!

200
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:54,606
Col. Thompson will join you
in a moment, sir.

201
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:59,502
All right, attention!

202
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:01,673
Fall in!

203
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:05,373
One, two, three, four...

204
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,113
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.

205
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:11,915
Welcome to the New Hebrides.

206
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,356
Lt. J.G. Sam Lawson reporting...

207
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:16,492
as ordered.

208
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:22,700
I think we can let the Sergeant Major
deal with those.

209
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:31,334
Yes, rather an imaginative location
for a military headquarters, don't you think?

210
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,502
Yeah.

211
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:36,743
I sometimes wonder what kind of an artist
Gauguin would've become...

212
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:40,876
if he'd had the misfortune
to choose this place instead of Tahiti.

213
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:45,550
Yes, I think there would have been
a certain lack of inspiration.

214
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:48,286
Mind you, I don't know
what the natives were like here...

215
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,351
but there are none anymore.

216
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:54,593
I'm sure he would've found the current crop
of inhabitants singularly unappealing.

217
00:16:57,936 --> 00:17:01,235
This part up here is all Japanese.
Not at all jolly.

218
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,772
And down here, we have our own group...

219
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:07,642
which I imagine he would've found
only marginally more agreeable.

220
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:12,173
Now, what we really have is the remainder
of a Brigade HQ Company...

221
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:14,549
consisting largely
of chaps from my regiment...

222
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,784
brought up to strength by
a rather bizarre variety of odds and sods...

223
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:22,258
who joined us
when we scrambled out of Singapore.

224
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:27,796
A lot of them were just as anxious to escape
the Army as they were the Japanese.

225
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:32,466
But I've no doubt
your chaps have told you about all this.

226
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:36,405
No, sir, my chaps didn't tell me anything.

227
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:41,878
Recently, though, the casualty rates
have been alarmingly high.

228
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:46,080
However, I'm afraid this little jaunt
we've organized now...

229
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,949
is going to change all that
because, amongst other things...

230
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:53,253
it's going to make it necessary for us
to penetrate all the way to their main base.

231
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:55,623
Sounds great. When do you leave?

232
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:57,457
As soon as we've briefed the men.

233
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,521
You'll be leaving
in about half an hour or so.

234
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:02,395
I'll be leaving in half an hour?

235
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:06,460
It doesn't do to let the men
brood about these things, you know.

236
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:08,500
Come in.

237
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:12,476
I believe you sent for me, sir.

238
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:15,980
Yes, Freddie. I wanted to have a chat
with you before I talk to the men.

239
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:18,278
- How are you feeling?
- First rate.

240
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,547
Good. Freddie's been on the sick list
the last few days.

241
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,815
I'm so sorry, I don't think you have met yet.

242
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:26,915
This is Lt. Lawson
of the United States Navy.

243
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:30,519
Lt. Lawson, this is Capt. Hornsby,
who'll be leading this patrol.

244
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:32,496
How do you do?
Glad you'll be coming along.

245
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:34,361
That makes one of us.

246
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,765
I guess this trip's unavoidable.

247
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:40,894
I shall be briefing the men in a few minutes.
Perhaps you'd like to get changed?

248
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:43,737
I take it you did bring some other gear?

249
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:47,270
This is all I got. What kind of gear?

250
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:50,246
It doesn't have to be
anything terribly formal.

251
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:52,146
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

252
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:58,253
Take the Lieutenant down to the stores...

253
00:18:58,323 --> 00:19:01,884
and help him sort out something
appropriate for the occasion, would you?

254
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,984
Sir.

255
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,894
I'm afraid our laundry service
is a little bit primitive.

256
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:09,365
We've been reduced to using seawater
for everything but drinking...

257
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:13,165
so don't be alarmed if the kit you get
is a little bit manky.

258
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:14,427
"Manky"?

259
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:16,731
How's the grub?

260
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:19,339
It's a little bit manky, too.

261
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:21,401
See you later.

262
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,307
If you'll come with me, sir?

263
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:32,821
- You did say half an hour?
- Yes.

264
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:38,158
Yeah, I thought you said that.

265
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,325
What an extraordinary fellow.

266
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,931
He is an American.

267
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,407
Yes, but he does actually speak Japanese,
does he?

268
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:55,139
He says so, and I certainly
don't feel qualified to put him to the test.

269
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:00,847
You wanted to talk to me, sir?

270
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,280
- You said...
- Yes, of course. It's nothing really.

271
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,518
I wanted to be sure you feel up to it.

272
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:08,616
Good heavens, yes.

273
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:12,721
I mean, if you don't feel entirely fit yet,
I can equally send O'Neill.

274
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,232
No, sir, I'm fine.

275
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:19,102
Anyway, it seems to me
to be a marvelous opportunity...

276
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:21,264
to really hurt them, for a change.

277
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:24,831
Yes. Let's hope
they're not entertaining similar ambitions.

278
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:27,072
Stand to!

279
00:20:28,814 --> 00:20:29,974
What the hell's that?

280
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,913
All guns and crews!

281
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,717
All guns stand to!

282
00:21:00,312 --> 00:21:02,576
All guns commence fire!

283
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,110
Keep the men out of range
of the enemy, Captain.

284
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:11,254
You men, keep back. Stay in the safety zone.

285
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:13,918
Keep back in the safety zone.

286
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:17,586
Trevor's patrol?

287
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,657
Make sure they don't hit our lads!

288
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:39,278
They'll never make it.

289
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:46,949
Fire!

290
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:58,563
They'll be out of enemy rifle range soon, sir.

291
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:27,194
Are they out of range yet, sir?

292
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:34,267
They're out of range now, sir.

293
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,974
Keep your guns at ready.

294
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:40,273
Keep your eyes on that jungle.

295
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,913
Bloody mess.

296
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,716
Terrible bloody mess.

297
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:54,451
Medical Orderly!

298
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:56,387
Stretcher bearers!

299
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:58,990
<i>A week from today...</i>

300
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:03,296
the American Navy proposes
sending a convoy up through these straits.

301
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:07,202
We know that the Japanese
have no air reconnaissance in this area...

302
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:10,969
so barring any unfortunate encounters
with surface craft...

303
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,410
the Americans' presence in these waters
should remain undetected.

304
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:18,177
Undetected, that is, until...

305
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:19,850
early on Thursday morning...

306
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:23,820
when they will come within sight
of the Japanese coast up here.

307
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:26,686
In the normal course of events...

308
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,056
the Japanese
would communicate this information...

309
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:31,652
to their air and naval forces up here.

310
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,996
And within 24 hours, this convoy
would be pretty much at their mercy.

311
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:38,031
Is that clear so far?

312
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:39,195
Yes, sir.

313
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:40,465
Hearne!

314
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:43,499
Tosh.

315
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:45,107
- What?
- Him.

316
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:53,113
The movements and major policy decisions
of the United States Navy...

317
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:54,776
may be of limited interest to you...

318
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:57,686
but if you will bear with me
for just a moment or two...

319
00:23:57,756 --> 00:24:02,022
I think you will find that it may be
worth your while to pay some attention.

320
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:04,084
- I am, sir.
- Good.

321
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:12,632
The object of our own operation
is simply to prevent news...

322
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:17,038
of the Americans' presence in these waters
from reaching the enemy's main base.

323
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:21,478
The Japanese transmit situation reports...

324
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:25,880
to their bases at Rabaul and Truk
on Wednesdays and Sundays.

325
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:30,050
If we were to destroy their radio...

326
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:33,420
before the transmission
on Wednesday night...

327
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:36,255
that is to say
before the convoy comes within sight...

328
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:37,989
of their coast here...

329
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:42,297
we should know that at least that part
of the mission had been successful.

330
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:46,133
This is where Lt. Lawson
of the United States Navy comes in.

331
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:50,633
Immediately prior
to Wednesday night's transmission...

332
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:53,769
you will destroy the Japanese radio.

333
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:59,150
Lt. Lawson will use
our own radio equipment...

334
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:03,483
to transmit the normal,
routine situation report in Japanese.

335
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:08,321
- Sir?
- Yes, Hearne, what is it?

336
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:12,388
Would the mission have to be abandoned...

337
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:15,365
if Lt. Lawson met with...

338
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,665
an unfortunate mishap?

339
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,964
Mishap?

340
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:25,800
Yes, I take your point...

341
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:29,813
but I think it's a little premature
to talk about abandoning the operation...

342
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:33,112
or of any mishap to the Lieutenant,
for that matter.

343
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,085
- Yes, sir.
- I hope your enthusiasm isn't catching.

344
00:25:36,154 --> 00:25:37,621
I hope so, too, sir.

345
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:39,452
However, if it answers your question...

346
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:42,857
Lt. Lawson's part in this operation
is not, in fact, essential.

347
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:45,987
It is merely a way of gaining additional time.

348
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:50,198
Lf, for any reason, he should be unable
to transmit the message...

349
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:54,932
we shall still be doing a very considerable
service by destroying the Japanese radio.

350
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,298
Yes, sir.

351
00:25:56,374 --> 00:26:01,107
We've never attempted to penetrate
this far into Japanese territory...

352
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:03,079
Bloody suicide mission.

353
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:04,812
Campbell.

354
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,608
Now's the time to shoot your other arm.

355
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:09,175
Knock it off.

356
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:20,657
Captain, I was wondering how come
Trevor didn't come that way or that way...

357
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:22,359
instead of down the middle like that?

358
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:24,334
- Mines, old boy.
- Mines?

359
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:27,667
Yeah. If the Japs ever sent
a sizeable force against us...

360
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:31,072
that bit of jungle over there
would be too close for comfort.

361
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:33,440
So we laid a mine field there...

362
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,708
and it worked a treat for a while
because it kept them out...

363
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:39,909
and our patrols could come and go
as they pleased.

364
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:43,442
Then one night
the Japs laid a few mine fields of their own.

365
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:46,456
It cost us seven men
before we discovered it.

366
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:49,886
Isn't there any other way out
of this target range?

367
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,794
Not if you're traveling north, Lieutenant.

368
00:26:52,964 --> 00:26:57,025
I don't like to seem unduly cautious,
but wouldn't it be better if we left at night?

369
00:26:57,102 --> 00:26:59,593
I'm sure the men
would be the first to agree with you.

370
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:01,434
- Wouldn't that make more sense?
- Indeed.

371
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:04,168
But if we're to reach the enemy camp
by Wednesday night...

372
00:27:04,242 --> 00:27:06,802
we have what you might call
a rather tight schedule.

373
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:08,812
We had intended leaving last night...

374
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,112
but unfortunately, your people
were somewhat late in delivering the body.

375
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:15,652
You mean the whole operation's
been hanging on me?

376
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,187
I'm afraid so.

377
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:20,782
I'm sorry about being late, Captain,
but I wasn't driving that damn boat.

378
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:22,850
Patrol, attention!

379
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:26,295
- Carry on, please.
- Sir.

380
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:28,627
Sgt. Johnstone, stand the men at ease.

381
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,224
Stand at ease!

382
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:32,294
Easy.

383
00:27:32,937 --> 00:27:33,961
Pay attention.

384
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,633
If we can get across that open ground
without attracting the enemy fire...

385
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:41,304
we can take it that the patrol encountered
by Trevor's men has withdrawn...

386
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:45,338
and we should be reasonably safe
until we've penetrated into the jungle.

387
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,350
Sgt. Johnstone and I will lead off.

388
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:50,080
The rest of you
will break up into three groups of four...

389
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:53,249
which Lt. Lawson here will dispatch
at intervals of 25 seconds.

390
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:55,019
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

391
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:56,185
Cpl. McLean...

392
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:59,822
you and Signalman Scott will remain
in the rear group with the Lieutenant.

393
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:02,196
Hearne, the same applies to you.

394
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:04,758
As Medical Orderly,
you will be in the last group.

395
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:06,997
If there are any casualties on the way over...

396
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:09,062
you will not stop to render aid to anyone...

397
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,836
unless they are injured
within 200 yards of cover.

398
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,435
- Is that clear, Hearne?
- That's clear, sir.

399
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:16,639
Sgt. Johnstone,
prepare to move the men off.

400
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:17,772
Sir!

401
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:23,578
All right, get moving.
Over to the weapon pits.

402
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:26,389
- You hear that, Connolly?
- Move along.

403
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:29,119
Don't get yourself shot
till you get to the other side.

404
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:30,456
Why not?

405
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:37,200
Because Uncle Tosh won't be able
to look after you, that's why not.

406
00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:38,868
All gun pits, stand to.

407
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:40,905
Come on, let's hurry up.

408
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:42,801
Give me three ranks!

409
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:44,136
Front rank:

410
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:46,939
Riddle, Thornton, Griffiths, Currie!

411
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:49,274
Center rank:

412
00:28:49,347 --> 00:28:51,975
Rafferty, Rogers, Connolly, Campbell!

413
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,048
Rear rank:

414
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:58,111
Lt. Lawson, Hearne, Cpl. McLean, Scott!

415
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,682
Captain, what about the four guys
they left out there?

416
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,354
If we get across safely...

417
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:09,155
I imagine they'll pick them up now.

418
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:11,293
And if we don't?

419
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:17,670
I suppose they'll pick us all up tonight.

420
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:19,733
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

421
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:21,640
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

422
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:22,873
Right.

423
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:25,179
Off we go.

424
00:29:26,317 --> 00:29:28,444
Twenty-five, twenty-four...

425
00:29:28,886 --> 00:29:30,979
twenty-three, twenty-two...

426
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:33,182
Get yourself out of here...

427
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,858
before you go, I've news for you,
you're on a charge.

428
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:40,057
A charge for appearing on guard duty
with your boot laces undone.

429
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:43,225
...seven, six, five...

430
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:45,535
You'll be on the Hebrides line-up.

431
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:46,763
...one, all right, go.

432
00:29:46,838 --> 00:29:50,604
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You better go in disguise</i>

433
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:54,167
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You're in for a big surprise</i>

434
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:55,507
Shut up!

435
00:29:57,882 --> 00:29:59,110
Stupid idiot.

436
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:01,083
Thornton, what's the matter with you?

437
00:30:01,152 --> 00:30:03,746
My head's sore. I'm fair daffy.

438
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:08,451
I don't think that guy's playing
with a full deck.

439
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:10,118
What do you say, sir?

440
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:12,856
I think he's lost some of his marbles.

441
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,865
- What marbles are they, sir?
- Cuckoo.

442
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:20,300
- Cuckoo?
...twenty-four, twenty-three...

443
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:24,638
They wouldn't let him in the army
if he was cuckoo, would they, sir?

444
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,444
No, he's all right, old Thornton.

445
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,316
He's seen more soldiering
than you've had hot dinners.

446
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,174
He's all right.

447
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,714
Unless, of course,
he goes right off his rocker.

448
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:42,252
...seven, six...

449
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:44,591
Doesn't happen often.

450
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:48,760
...five, four...
- He's all right.

451
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,331
...three, two, one. Let's go.

452
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:56,063
Twenty-five, twenty-four...

453
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:58,533
twenty-three...

454
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:03,569
Don't walk in a straight line, you clowns.
Scatter, move to the left.

455
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:06,173
Come on, spread out. Use your heads.

456
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:08,813
That's great, sir.

457
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:12,449
The Lieutenant's obviously
done this before.

458
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:17,187
You don't have to be the Duke of Wellington
to know you don't walk in a straight line.

459
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:19,491
That's absolutely right, sir.

460
00:31:19,564 --> 00:31:20,929
He's right.

461
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:24,501
...seven, six, five...

462
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:27,533
four, three, two...

463
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:29,436
He's right, you know.

464
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:31,605
...one. Come on.

465
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:39,569
All right, you men, back to work.

466
00:32:55,026 --> 00:32:56,926
Spotted a relative, Campbell?

467
00:32:56,994 --> 00:32:59,588
Up your pipe, you Cockney ponce.

468
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:00,926
Be quiet!

469
00:33:16,113 --> 00:33:18,274
It's marvelous, this country living.

470
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:19,611
For pigs.

471
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:26,012
Look at my hands.
They look like chopped beef.

472
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:30,419
Excuse me, sir, is there something wrong
with your teeth?

473
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:32,989
We call it personal hygiene.

474
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:35,659
You ought to try it sometime.

475
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:38,598
You hear that, lads?

476
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:41,866
He reckons you're all a bunch of pigs.
Cheeky bastard.

477
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:44,635
May I have a light, please, Lieutenant?

478
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:46,035
Here.

479
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:49,803
Those two are getting pretty matey,
aren't they?

480
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,109
Why not?

481
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:54,241
Like you're always saying,
it's a matter of class.

482
00:33:54,318 --> 00:33:55,683
I don't know about Snow White...

483
00:33:55,753 --> 00:33:59,587
but old Hornsby's got about as much class
as a syphilitic road sweeper.

484
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:03,623
I really love this time of day.

485
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:07,562
- It always reminds me...
- It doesn't do much for me, I'll tell you.

486
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:10,328
I can see you're a confirmed city dweller.

487
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:12,335
My people farm, you know.

488
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:16,203
- We have this little estate in the Cotswolds.
- Is that right?

489
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,505
- Sgt. Johnstone.
- Sir?

490
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:25,515
- It's about time we moved off.
- Yes, sir.

491
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,643
Let's have Riddle out in front.

492
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,084
All right, Riddle, up front.

493
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:32,850
Why me again? I was back marker yesterday.

494
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:34,448
Keep it down, you chaps.

495
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:38,325
Because you're so bloody lovely, that's why.
Now don't argue! Get up front!

496
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:41,559
- Connolly, you kick off as back marker.
- Who, me, sir?

497
00:34:41,632 --> 00:34:43,156
All right, sir.

498
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,902
Hang on here
until we've been gone a full minute.

499
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:49,633
Jap patrol, sir. Coming right down the path.

500
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:51,698
- Five of them, this way.
- Did they see you?

501
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,834
I don't think so.

502
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,073
Off the path, both sides.
Don't fire unless I do!

503
00:34:56,147 --> 00:34:58,274
Captain, your field pack!

504
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:11,752
We did it!

505
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:15,019
Rogers, get your bloody head down!

506
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:17,619
Keep down, you bloody fool.

507
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:35,938
Rafferty! Rogers! Kill all those men!

508
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,708
Griffiths! Thornton! Pick up the rifles!

509
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:41,081
Come on, don't leave a trace.

510
00:36:43,354 --> 00:36:45,845
You heard the orders. Get a move on.

511
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:47,823
Don't leave a trace. I said off the trail.

512
00:36:47,892 --> 00:36:49,519
Tosh, over here.

513
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,657
Come on, clean it up.

514
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:54,889
That's right. Get it out of the way.

515
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:57,427
- Take him up that way.
- Tosh, hurry up!

516
00:36:57,501 --> 00:37:00,197
Over in the undergrowth. That's right.

517
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:09,741
You'll be all right, Connolly.

518
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:14,274
Riddle, get off down the trail
and keep cover.

519
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:18,321
- Come on, Riddle, double up!
- Get them off the trail.

520
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:21,222
- I think Riddle's bought it.
- Damn.

521
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:24,557
Campbell, you get on up there.
If you see any more coming...

522
00:37:24,628 --> 00:37:27,096
fire a warning shot
and get back here on the double.

523
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:29,359
- Yes, sir.
- Move it, Campbell!

524
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:33,969
Trying to work his ticket.

525
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:35,801
It's what you're doing, ain't you?

526
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:38,705
Trying to work your ticket, son?

527
00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:41,301
- Hearne.
- What do you want, sir?

528
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:44,243
What about these two?

529
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:48,508
Bloody idiot. Put your hand on there
and keep the pressure, all right?

530
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,127
This one's got about five minutes.

531
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:10,265
This one will be all right
if we get him back to camp.

532
00:38:10,341 --> 00:38:13,367
But we're not going in that direction,
are we?

533
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:21,012
No, sir.

534
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:49,510
All right, Sergeant...

535
00:38:50,014 --> 00:38:52,346
do we have any other casualties?

536
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:55,344
The Yank says Pvt. Riddle's dead, sir.

537
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:57,717
- Is that all?
- No, it's not all.

538
00:38:57,888 --> 00:38:59,651
Currie and Connolly.

539
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:02,157
- Both dead?
- No.

540
00:39:02,393 --> 00:39:05,260
What the hell do you mean, idiot?
Can't you speak plainly?

541
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:06,853
Currie's dead!

542
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:09,694
Connolly's wounded.

543
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:14,327
Right, Sergeant, get these Japanese bodies
off the trail, please.

544
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:17,634
You heard. Get these bodies off the trail.
Come on, move!

545
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:19,835
And erase those bloodstains.

546
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:23,303
Never you mind.
Hearne's taking good care of you.

547
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,904
Come on, Rogers, get a move on.

548
00:39:24,982 --> 00:39:27,815
I hear you're something
of a footballer, Connolly.

549
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:29,785
Before you know it, you'll be back home...

550
00:39:29,854 --> 00:39:32,288
playing for the regiment, perhaps.

551
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:34,821
I don't know whether I ever...

552
00:39:36,694 --> 00:39:38,958
You shouldn't have given up
smoking, Connolly.

553
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:41,190
You could've had a drag now.

554
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:45,962
Get those helmets.

555
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:59,114
I got his leg.
Take him up that way, towards the right.

556
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,741
Scott, give us a hand.

557
00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:05,786
- Don't take all day, man.
- Yes, sir.

558
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,415
The helmet, you damn fool!

559
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:13,726
That pretty well cleans it up, sir.

560
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:16,630
It's been a great day at Hampden Park, folks.

561
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,668
Hornsby's Hotspurs: 5...

562
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:21,068
Japanese United: 3.

563
00:40:21,605 --> 00:40:24,438
All eight of them scored by Hornsby.

564
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:27,509
What's he mean, all eight of them?

565
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:29,541
He means that Fairy Feet Hornsby...

566
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:33,049
deployed his forces
with such a masterly grasp of tactics...

567
00:40:33,117 --> 00:40:36,018
half of us got ourselves shot
by the other bloody half.

568
00:40:36,086 --> 00:40:37,713
No, it can't be.

569
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:40,313
Can't be? Go and dig the bullets out.

570
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:43,186
You won't find "Made in Japan"
written on them.

571
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,922
All right, Sergeant, let's be on our way.

572
00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:47,327
Come on, men.

573
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:49,596
Rafferty.

574
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:51,091
Back marker.

575
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:53,432
<i>Let's have a bloody good cry
And always remember</i>

576
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,664
Come on, move it.

577
00:40:54,738 --> 00:40:56,365
<i>The longer you live</i>

578
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,876
<i>The sooner you'll bloody well die</i>

579
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:02,509
<i>Look at the mourners</i>

580
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:06,047
<i>Bloody great hypocrites</i>

581
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:08,851
<i>Isn't it grand, boys</i>

582
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:11,618
Don't you know any other songs?

583
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:13,156
Aye, a few...

584
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:16,750
but at the moment, I happen
to be particularly fond of this one.

585
00:41:16,827 --> 00:41:18,818
I wish you'd sing us one you hate.

586
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:22,627
Campbell, has it ever occurred to you
that if you had the other arm broken...

587
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,635
you'd be needing a friend
to button your fly?

588
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,704
Capt. Hornsby! Over here! Japs!

589
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:07,101
Where are you?

590
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:09,941
We're coming after you,
you bloody little ape!

591
00:42:10,014 --> 00:42:12,949
Come on, Captain,
the bastard's getting away!

592
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:16,218
Get your blinking face here,
or we'll all be done for!

593
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:17,446
Hearne!

594
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:21,056
Come on, show yourself!

595
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:25,751
Two of them coming down there,
a lieutenant and a corporal.

596
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:29,026
I got the corporal. I winged
the other one, too. Could be dead now.

597
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,930
- Where did he go?
- Disappeared in there.

598
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:32,628
Hearne, see what you can do for him.

599
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:35,035
Corporal, take some men
and start combing the area.

600
00:42:35,105 --> 00:42:38,802
- Four of you on the double.
- He's got to be in the jungle somewhere.

601
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:42,271
Campbell, you and Scott
take a look from this tower.

602
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:44,439
See if you can spot anything from up there.

603
00:42:44,515 --> 00:42:46,847
Lieutenant, you better come with me.

604
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:51,510
- Come on.
- I can't go up there.

605
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:54,881
- You and your bloody arm.
- Go on, get on with it.

606
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:57,186
It's a bloody mile high.

607
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:36,029
What's up there, then?

608
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:39,263
Just some things
for measuring the weather or something.

609
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:41,327
It's like the stuff we've got back at camp.

610
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:42,633
Damn you, Hearne!

611
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:44,674
Shall I bring them down?

612
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:46,366
No, leave them.

613
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:50,641
If Hornsby sees them, he'll have us
lugging them all the way back to base.

614
00:43:52,116 --> 00:43:53,879
Don't worry, Thorny.

615
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:56,245
Snakes love Japs.

616
00:43:57,454 --> 00:44:00,912
You'll have to go to Woolworth's
and buy one, I think.

617
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:04,422
We're never gonna find him in this.

618
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:06,019
Let's get back.

619
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,829
It seems your friend
is on his way back to Tokyo.

620
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:15,894
- Hearne.
- What?

621
00:44:16,273 --> 00:44:17,740
How about it?

622
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:20,607
- Can he walk?
- No, sir.

623
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:23,275
- But, surely...
- No.

624
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,014
Right, give him a hand. Come on, now.

625
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,318
What's the matter with you?

626
00:44:34,391 --> 00:44:36,859
Can't you see that I can't put my foot down?

627
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:39,929
There's hundreds of these trails.

628
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:42,830
How're we ever gonna find him again
on our way back?

629
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,094
It's easy.

630
00:44:44,168 --> 00:44:47,137
We're gonna scatter little white pebbles
through the forest...

631
00:44:47,204 --> 00:44:49,695
just like bloody Hansel and Gretel.

632
00:44:49,907 --> 00:44:51,704
Carry on, Gunga Din.

633
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:54,177
This thing weighs a ton.

634
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:58,137
Ease him down over there.

635
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:01,909
Sorry we couldn't have
the Rolls Royce for you.

636
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,192
Just thought you might need this.

637
00:45:12,863 --> 00:45:14,387
Thank you, sir.

638
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:21,700
Good luck, Sergeant.

639
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:24,897
- Corporal.
- Sir?

640
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:28,376
There. Okay?

641
00:45:28,946 --> 00:45:30,208
All done.

642
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,376
- Here.
- What's this, then?

643
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:38,110
- Salt tablets.
- I'd rather have a smoke.

644
00:45:38,188 --> 00:45:39,849
- You short, then?
- Skint.

645
00:45:39,923 --> 00:45:41,891
Hearne, we've got to go.

646
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:44,886
I'll see you Saturday, okay?

647
00:45:46,196 --> 00:45:48,323
Yeah. Thanks.

648
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:50,599
Not for the cigarettes though.

649
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,101
You owe me them.
Don't you bloody forget it.

650
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,398
I won't.

651
00:45:55,305 --> 00:46:00,242
And don't forget to loosen the tourniquet,
otherwise your bloody leg will drop off.

652
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:02,272
See you.

653
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,175
Enjoy your rest, Sergeant.

654
00:47:02,806 --> 00:47:05,036
I reckon that makes you a Sergeant, Jock.

655
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:13,009
- Down there?
- Yes, sir.

656
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,950
All right. Hearne, Campbell, come with me.

657
00:47:18,488 --> 00:47:20,285
Well, move yourself, Campbell.

658
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:26,461
I knew that little Nip had to be in there.

659
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,150
What?

660
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:37,559
- Cover me.
- All right.

661
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:58,813
<i>They've gone. Let's move on.</i>

662
00:50:01,284 --> 00:50:04,685
<i>Did you hear me? There's no one here.
Let's move on.</i>

663
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:10,421
Look out!

664
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:36,778
It's not every day you get a chance
to kill an officer, is it, Lieutenant?

665
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:40,213
All he had was this knife.

666
00:50:40,357 --> 00:50:43,190
What did you want me to do?
Wait till he threw it at you?

667
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,284
No.

668
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:47,225
No! It's me, Campbell!

669
00:50:47,497 --> 00:50:49,556
What the hell do you want?

670
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:51,824
You asked for these, sir.

671
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:55,530
You idiot. You could've got yourself killed,
running up like that.

672
00:50:55,605 --> 00:50:57,766
Come on, let's get moving.

673
00:50:58,074 --> 00:50:59,336
Let's go.

674
00:51:01,912 --> 00:51:05,643
Where are you off to?
You're still back marker, remember?

675
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:39,536
Bugger off, you Yank bastard.
I hope you bloody crash!

676
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:42,578
- How do you know it's a Yank, kid?
- You can smell them.

677
00:52:42,646 --> 00:52:45,581
I thought all you limeys could smell
was our money.

678
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:55,553
Hearne, Lieutenant, Cpl. McLean,
come with me.

679
00:52:57,093 --> 00:52:59,084
Keep them here a moment.

680
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,524
Rogers.

681
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:09,068
Can you see him?

682
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:12,404
Where the hell is he?

683
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:15,737
You might say he's all around here.

684
00:53:18,481 --> 00:53:22,383
As a matter of fact,
you might even say he's got us surrounded.

685
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:28,348
That's right, Lieutenant. The bloody Yanks
are bombing us with old Army boots.

686
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,289
Land mine.

687
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:34,088
The damn fool should've known better.

688
00:53:58,988 --> 00:54:00,819
Here, look at this.

689
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:05,385
It's a Chinese railway station, crabs and all.

690
00:54:06,096 --> 00:54:10,089
Thornton, away in and find out
what time is the next train to Glasgow.

691
00:54:12,469 --> 00:54:14,027
"Next train to Glasgow."

692
00:54:14,104 --> 00:54:16,095
What's going on up there?

693
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:21,339
For God's sake, keep quiet. Keep moving!

694
00:54:21,411 --> 00:54:24,312
Corporal, send in two men
to see if there's anyone in there.

695
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,575
Thornton, over there on the left.

696
00:54:26,649 --> 00:54:29,083
Rafferty, over there on the right.

697
00:54:29,152 --> 00:54:32,883
They kind of move sideways.
Must be Oriental crabs.

698
00:54:33,656 --> 00:54:35,487
Lieutenant, will you join me?

699
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:37,788
They'll ruin your married life, won't they?

700
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:41,991
Here, give them a peck, Campbell.
A man ought to be close to his family.

701
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:43,123
Shut your trap.

702
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,635
All clear on the ground floor, sir.
Rafferty's up top.

703
00:54:47,337 --> 00:54:49,066
Keep them things away from me.

704
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:51,573
Campbell, get rid of the crabs.

705
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:58,609
Why me, you dafty queer?

706
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:04,586
- That kid that got it back there...
- Rogers?

707
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:07,289
Yeah, Rogers.

708
00:55:08,558 --> 00:55:11,755
Do you think he ever had time
to get himself laid?

709
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:15,994
Couldn't tell you.
Not my department really, is it?

710
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:19,825
I may be screwed up in a lot of ways...

711
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:26,066
but getting killed like one of these poor kids
isn't gonna be one of them.

712
00:55:26,142 --> 00:55:28,110
That's what you say now.

713
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:32,410
But I'm sure when it comes to the point,
you'll be one of the first over the top.

714
00:55:34,717 --> 00:55:36,275
Over the top?

715
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:39,321
I mean, you'll turn out to be a real fire-eater.

716
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:41,179
You wanna bet?

717
00:55:41,825 --> 00:55:43,986
I'll give you 8-to-5.

718
00:55:46,296 --> 00:55:48,161
And loan you the money.

719
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,561
You never get rid of those
with blue ointment, kids?

720
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:01,607
Time to relieve Griffiths, mate.

721
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,372
It's your sentry go. Griffiths, back there.

722
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:22,761
Takes a bloody bomb to wake him up.

723
00:56:22,832 --> 00:56:24,697
An earthquake's more like it.

724
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:26,826
Here, Tosh, give us a light.

725
00:56:39,582 --> 00:56:41,709
What the hell are you doing?

726
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:44,412
- Where'd you get these cigarettes?
- What's that to you?

727
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:47,456
- You stole them from Johnno, didn't you?
- Don't be bloody daft!

728
00:56:47,523 --> 00:56:49,548
Where'd the blood come from then?

729
00:56:49,626 --> 00:56:51,423
You did, you bastard, you stole them!

730
00:56:51,494 --> 00:56:53,758
He's got no use for them now.
What's the matter?

731
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,162
- They're mine, that's what!
- Piss off!

732
00:56:56,232 --> 00:56:58,666
- Don't "piss off!" me!
- Campbell, stop it.

733
00:56:58,735 --> 00:57:00,965
Get out, Tosh! That's it. Out!

734
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:08,077
Cut it out, Tosh.

735
00:57:08,144 --> 00:57:10,339
What's the meaning
of this disgusting exhibition?

736
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:11,903
I'll kill him!

737
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:24,453
He kicked me, sir. It's my arm, sir.
He kicked my arm.

738
00:57:25,328 --> 00:57:28,126
Kick his arm?
I'll jam it down his bloody throat!

739
00:57:28,197 --> 00:57:30,358
I gave Sgt. Johnstone these cigarettes.

740
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:33,231
Shut up, Hearne. Nobody's talking to you.

741
00:57:36,472 --> 00:57:39,805
- I'm bloody well talking to you, aren't I?
- What did you say?

742
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:42,140
I said that he stole these cigarettes...

743
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:44,645
I'm not interested
in your grubby little cigarettes.

744
00:57:44,714 --> 00:57:46,341
You bloody well should be!

745
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:49,977
Cpl. McLean, put this man on a charge.
Let's have no more of this nonsense.

746
00:57:52,922 --> 00:57:55,857
Where does he think he is,
bloody Aldershot?

747
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:07,269
Hearne, it seems
you're not going to be satisfied...

748
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:10,283
until you've talked yourself
into some really serious trouble.

749
00:58:10,351 --> 00:58:13,013
- Is that what you want?
- All I want is to get out of here.

750
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:16,545
If you had any sense, you'd know
we should've turned back a long time ago.

751
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:18,887
Thank you.
Have you anything to add to that?

752
00:58:18,959 --> 00:58:20,449
Yes, I have, sir.

753
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:22,757
Your last patrol was a bloody shambles.

754
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:26,027
Getting this one shot up the ass
isn't gonna win you any medals.

755
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,900
So why don't you go home like a good boy
before you get the lot of us killed?

756
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:32,438
I don't know about you,
but I have better things to do!

757
00:58:32,506 --> 00:58:34,838
Thank you. I shall cherish that bit of advice.

758
00:58:34,908 --> 00:58:37,433
Corporal, this man is under open arrest.

759
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:42,039
When you get back to camp, you will
prepare charges for a field courts-martial.

760
00:58:42,116 --> 00:58:44,141
Are you satisfied, Hearne?

761
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,384
Easy. Watch yourself, laddie.

762
00:58:48,455 --> 00:58:51,618
That wee man's near daft enough
to have you shot.

763
00:58:52,793 --> 00:58:55,523
All right, Corporal,
prepare to move off in five minutes.

764
00:58:55,596 --> 00:58:56,654
Sir.

765
00:58:57,197 --> 00:58:59,529
Rafferty, go and get Griffiths.

766
00:59:04,805 --> 00:59:07,205
All right, front marker, move out.

767
00:59:09,843 --> 00:59:14,177
It seems some of the men have just as little
enthusiasm for their duties as you do.

768
00:59:14,248 --> 00:59:17,342
Maybe they didn't
volunteer for the assignment either.

769
00:59:17,418 --> 00:59:18,544
No, they didn't.

770
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:22,248
Since this entire operation was
for the benefit of the United States Navy...

771
00:59:22,322 --> 00:59:25,348
they probably find the object
of the exercise extremely remote.

772
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:28,486
Furthermore, they're just as anxious
to get home as you are.

773
00:59:28,562 --> 00:59:30,621
Is that what you're gonna do now?
Go home?

774
00:59:30,697 --> 00:59:34,360
Fact is, it doesn't matter how you feel
about something before the event.

775
00:59:34,435 --> 00:59:36,733
You may very well feel it's a waste of time.

776
00:59:36,804 --> 00:59:39,932
For all I care, you could be
a long-haired conscientious objector.

777
00:59:40,007 --> 00:59:43,909
In that case, you should have had the guts
to say so in the first place.

778
00:59:43,977 --> 00:59:45,467
Is that right?

779
00:59:45,612 --> 00:59:47,671
The fact remains,
that once you're involved...

780
00:59:47,748 --> 00:59:50,478
you have a certain responsibility
to the people around you.

781
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:51,848
They depend on you.

782
00:59:51,919 --> 00:59:55,855
And that's something that none of your
sophisticated arguments can get around.

783
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:57,515
Do you understand what I mean?

784
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:59,456
Yeah, I hear you talking.

785
00:59:59,526 --> 01:00:01,653
But you still haven't answered my question.

786
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:02,888
Scott!

787
01:00:08,435 --> 01:00:09,697
Yes, sir.

788
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:15,067
All right, Corporal, move the men out.

789
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:03,615
...otherwise you'll wake up
Snow White and the Fairy Prince.

790
01:01:04,525 --> 01:01:06,254
Don't talk so daft.

791
01:01:06,393 --> 01:01:09,328
I just wanna get home like the rest of you.

792
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:18,801
Why don't we do that?

793
01:01:20,307 --> 01:01:23,276
Why don't we all just bugger off home?

794
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,272
We could always say...

795
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:33,080
that old Fairy Feet and Snow White got lost.

796
01:01:36,456 --> 01:01:38,651
Think. In six months' time...

797
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:43,758
the Japs will still be sitting
in this part of the jungle...

798
01:01:44,998 --> 01:01:48,695
and we will still be sitting
in our part of the jungle...

799
01:01:49,403 --> 01:01:53,066
and none of this
will have made a blind bit of difference.

800
01:01:58,612 --> 01:02:00,603
You're joking, ain't you?

801
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:05,582
That's right, Scottie.

802
01:02:06,286 --> 01:02:08,277
I'm always joking.

803
01:02:32,012 --> 01:02:33,411
All right, this is it.

804
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,243
Who gets to stay up?

805
01:02:38,952 --> 01:02:41,819
And we'll separate at this fork
in the trail here.

806
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:45,551
I shall take Lt. Lawson, Hearne
and Scott to deal with the radio shack.

807
01:02:45,626 --> 01:02:47,355
Cpl. McLean will lead the rest of you...

808
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:50,225
to the southern section
where the barracks are concentrated.

809
01:02:50,297 --> 01:02:52,822
Your job will be purely a diversionary one.

810
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:55,959
As far as we can see,
there's only one radio operator.

811
01:02:56,036 --> 01:02:59,870
Ideally, we would put him
out of commission just before midnight...

812
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,965
and then keep quiet until the Lieutenant...

813
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,567
has sent his message
on our own transmitter.

814
01:03:05,078 --> 01:03:09,344
If all goes well, we'll destroy their
transmitter immediately after midnight...

815
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:12,749
and pull back without calling
for any help from your people.

816
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:15,151
All right, let's be on our way.

817
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:18,787
Remember, any disturbance you hear
before midnight...

818
01:03:18,859 --> 01:03:21,327
will require diversionary action from you.

819
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:23,989
If you hear nothing
after the one big explosion...

820
01:03:24,064 --> 01:03:27,261
you can pull back
without revealing your position.

821
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:29,328
- Right?
- Right, sir.

822
01:03:29,403 --> 01:03:32,031
Lieutenant, will you lead off, please?

823
01:03:34,508 --> 01:03:36,135
Let's go, Scott.

824
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:45,649
Good luck.

825
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,785
Let us have you.

826
01:03:48,422 --> 01:03:51,789
Come on, we've just got 15 minutes.
Get your fingers out!

827
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:53,257
I'm coming.

828
01:03:53,327 --> 01:03:55,227
And remember, be quiet.

829
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:22,479
Sir.

830
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,133
Tosh!

831
01:04:43,777 --> 01:04:45,768
Hearne, you stupid idiot!

832
01:04:51,618 --> 01:04:54,052
- How is it?
- I'm just looking, sir.

833
01:04:56,189 --> 01:04:57,349
Come on.

834
01:04:57,424 --> 01:04:59,892
Oh, God, please. No.

835
01:05:01,194 --> 01:05:02,661
How about it?

836
01:05:05,399 --> 01:05:08,766
It's useless, sir.
There's at least three valves smashed.

837
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:10,860
- Valves?
- "Tubes" to you.

838
01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:14,166
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

839
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,774
Hearne, you bastard!
You did that deliberately.

840
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:21,871
No, I didn't, Mr. Hornsby.

841
01:05:23,016 --> 01:05:25,746
You'll address me properly, do you hear?

842
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:27,618
Do you hear?

843
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:35,894
Yes, I hear you, sir...

844
01:05:35,962 --> 01:05:39,864
and so will the Japs,
if you don't keep your bloody voice down.

845
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:43,759
I'm very sorry, sir,
but there was nothing I could do.

846
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:47,830
Dump that thing in the bushes!
We're late already. Out of my way.

847
01:05:49,242 --> 01:05:51,676
- Any spares?
- No.

848
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:33,679
Go on.

849
01:06:39,593 --> 01:06:42,289
Down there, under the hut.

850
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:48,661
Hurry.
