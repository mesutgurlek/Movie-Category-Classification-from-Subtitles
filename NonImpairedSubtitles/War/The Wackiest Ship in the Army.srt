1
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,054
If you remember Pearl Harbor...

2
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,750
you'll recall that in the year that followed...

3
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,350
the Japanese were almost invincible.

4
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,693
Early in 1943, however, they were checked.

5
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,163
Stopped cold by the Marines
at Guadalcanal...

6
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,792
the Navy in the Coral Sea...

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,928
and the Allied armies in New Guinea.

8
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:42,236
This was a period of far-reaching decisions,
desperate strategies...

9
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,139
and incredibly daring counter-strokes...

10
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,505
not the least of which involved...

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,777
two bright young naval officers.

12
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:19,995
This bold, slightly improbable adventure
began with a message...

13
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,471
authorized by the Commanding General,
South West Pacific Area...

14
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:28,105
and flashed by top priority to the lone
carrier on patrol in the Coral Sea.

15
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:33,410
It was an urgent request
for a particularly qualified young officer...

16
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,348
to lead an extremely delicate missión.

17
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,418
It demanded a man...

18
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,551
a man of executive ability
and high intelligence...

19
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:50,192
and that innate quality that enables a man
to swiftly estimate a situation...

20
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,065
and make a wise decisión.

21
00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:00,802
In bestowing that most thrilling
of all awards, an officer's first command...

22
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:06,210
the Navy knew it had a man that would ask
no questions and offer no excuses.

23
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:11,248
He would carry out orders regardless
of what obstacles fate put in his path.

24
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,451
Well...

25
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,859
Within the hour,
with high hopes and only a mild headache...

26
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,857
Lieutenant Rip Crandall was on his way...

27
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:26,099
to a secret anchorage,
a hidden harbor, so shrouded in mystery...

28
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:31,073
that it was known only as
"somewhere in the South Pacific. "

29
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,210
Here, the U.S. Seventh Fleet,
victors of the Coral Sea...

30
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:41,311
drowsed at anchor, licking their wounds
and dreaming of the great battles to come.

31
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,522
And here, the Lieutenant saw
his passport to high adventure.

32
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,734
Here, somewhere among
the flotillas of destroyers...

33
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,430
their vital supply and repair ships...

34
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:03,072
among stalwart battlewagons
of the Nevada class, carriers...

35
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,778
deadly cruisers of the Boise class, escorts,
and tenders of all classes...

36
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:13,877
he found the ship of his dreams, the Echo...

37
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,055
in, well, a class by itself.

38
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,922
While at first glance,
it might have looked like England's reply...

39
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,827
to the Boston Tea Party...

40
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:28,697
it had nevertheless had a distinguished
career in the copra trade.

41
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,294
The Navy had not only
gratefully received it from New Zealand...

42
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,399
as a sort of reverse lend-lease,
but had taken great pains...

43
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,511
to man it with a picked crew of specialists.

44
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,241
Dedicated, highly skilled seamen...

45
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:46,809
who chafed at inactivity here in this quiet
backwater far from the battle lines...

46
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:52,047
and awaited only the arrival
of their commander to swing into action.

47
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,251
Duck!

48
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,619
Bring that gear aboard.

49
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,232
Welcome aboard, sir.

50
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,999
What? Belay that racket!

51
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,870
You want the whole flotilla to hear us?
What is this?

52
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,239
Honors for the prospective
commanding officer, sir.

53
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,576
The officer in commissión
shall see that all honors and ceremonies-

54
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,615
This hulk is commissioned? As what?

55
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,880
- It's unclassified, sir.
- I can believe that.

56
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,584
Duck!

57
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,958
Sorry, sir. All right, bear a hand, there.

58
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,622
Let's get that thing in port and secure it!

59
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,096
- Johnson?
- Yes, sir?

60
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,444
I'm sorry, sir, but we've only been aboard
a couple of hours.

61
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,846
- How many men have you lost so far?
- None, sir, just a few cuts and bruises.

62
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,817
Don't forget Miller, sir.

63
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,081
Yeah. Yeoman Miller, sir.
Transferred to the hospital ship.

64
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,681
He's a real nut, sir.

65
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,991
I told him to look out for the hatch,
and he thought I wanted a match, and...

66
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,221
Thanks, Johnson.

67
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,267
You can take this man below
and show him where to stow his gear.

68
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,858
All right, sir.

69
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,596
What is all this malarkey
about this ship being commissioned?

70
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,302
It's true, sir. Admiral Hathaway
had me commissión her...

71
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,244
and sign her over to you.
The papers are in your stateroom.

72
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,541
My what?

73
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,011
Your cabin. You can go right ahead.
I'll bring your gear along.

74
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,109
Yes. Just leave it there.

75
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,643
Sir?

76
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,995
I'm sorry, sir.
I meant to warn you about these beams.

77
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,557
You gotta watch it.

78
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,331
- What did you say your name was?
- Tommy.

79
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,633
Sorry, sir. Hanson, sir. Ensign Thomas J.

80
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,539
Let's sit down.

81
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,174
My name is Crandall. Rip Crandall.

82
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,208
I know that. I'd have recognized you,
even if they hadn't told me.

83
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,719
You know me from someplace?

84
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,222
Balboa. The California Yacht Club.

85
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,324
You were getting ready
for the Honolulu race in '39.

86
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,489
What did you do? Crew for me? Or...

87
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,426
I tried to, sir.

88
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,731
You're not the kid
that fouled up the genoa jib?

89
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:19,863
Oh, gee.

90
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,134
I remember
I was a little rough with you that day.

91
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,733
- Didn't I chase you up the mast?
- Yes, sir.

92
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,076
You said I didn't know enough
to pour water out of a boot.

93
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,110
Boot. That was nice.

94
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,617
You were right, sir.
I nearly wrecked your ship.

95
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,678
But I've studied a lot about sailing
ever since. That's why I volunteered.

96
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,814
You volunteered? What? For this?

97
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,052
Yes, sir. I had a desk job here at the base...

98
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,118
and when Cmd. Vandewater
told me about this-

99
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:47,565
Vandewater? Not Wilbur Vandewater?

100
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,994
I don't know. Kind of slim, blond hair.

101
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,630
And a blackguard Nazi! That nose-

102
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,640
- Sir?
- What does he do here?

103
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,006
- Flight secretary to the Admiral.
- Yes, he would be.

104
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,240
You have to take him those clearance papers
when you've signed them.

105
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,943
- This ship's not officially yours until you do.
- lt isn't?

106
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,349
You're right. It isn't.

107
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,980
I'll get the ship's boat in the water
so you can take it.

108
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,423
Do that, Bill. Tommy. Wait a minute.
You got a copy of the Navy regs?

109
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,620
- ln the top left-hand drawer, sir.
- Thank you.

110
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,855
Anything wrong?

111
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,092
No. It's just that I do everything
by the book, you know.

112
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,274
Your gear, sir.
I already got that gaff secured.

113
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,510
The gaff. Chief.

114
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,516
Watch...

115
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,024
For your information,
it's not a gaff, it's a boom. The main boom.

116
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,562
Yeah. Sorry, sir.

117
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,656
Mr. Hanson has been teaching us.
The gaff is the...

118
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,100
The spar that, on this ship,
you would bend the head of the foresail to.

119
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,034
You didn't make your rate in sail?

120
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,370
No, sir. But do you think the rest
of these clowns know anything...

121
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,738
Beg pardon, sir.

122
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,744
My last hitch was on The Hamill,
the tender alongside, sir.

123
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,013
- And you volunteered, too?
- ln a manner of speaking, yes.

124
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,517
That is, no, sir.

125
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,245
You'd see it in my record anyway.
It was this, or else.

126
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,756
Else what?

127
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,829
Chief Svenson started his fifth hitch.

128
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,225
And the Chief's mess
gave him kind of a testimonial...

129
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,895
and I figured a party is no good
without entertainment...

130
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:35,804
and they got this girl dancer at the tavern.

131
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,864
I see.

132
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,434
Nothing like that, sir.
Her husband came with her.

133
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,536
Only...

134
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,207
Only it's wartime,
and unauthorized civilian personnel...

135
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,113
are not allowed on naval installations.

136
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,879
Particularly tenders, the skipper said.

137
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,320
So he gave me my choice of being busted
or grabbing the first ship out.

138
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,949
So, you volunteered. What, the first...

139
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,294
- The first ship out?
- That's what they said, sir.

140
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,820
- I've got to get out of here. Pardon me.
- Sir!

141
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,495
All clear? Lower away together.

142
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,774
If you don't mind, I'd just as soon
you didn't mention it to Mr. Hanson.

143
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,800
He really believes I did volunteer,
and he's kind of young and eager...

144
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,277
and you know?

145
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,716
Let go of the after fall.
Let go the forward fall.

146
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,615
Chief, your secret is safe with me...

147
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,953
because I'm not going to be around
to tell him anyway.

148
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,153
Leaving the ship.

149
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,867
I should have checked the caulking, sir.

150
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,143
It's okay, kid, it's nobody's fault.
Don't you worry about it.

151
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,773
But we'll get you ashore, sir.
Won't we, Chief?

152
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,908
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

153
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,011
Horse, slack your stern line.

154
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,025
Shark Bait, heave around on the bow.
Get that thing aboard.

155
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,730
- He can handle anything, sir.
- Yeah, I'm sure of that.

156
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,599
- He can't wait till we get to sea.
- Yeah, I'm sure of that, too.

157
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,741
- What's up, Chief?
- Brass, coming through.

158
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,349
Right this way, sir.

159
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,922
- Family entrance?
- Dock is on the port side, sir.

160
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,025
Show the Captain the quarterdeck, sailor.

161
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,929
Welcome aboard, sir.

162
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,200
With him in command,
we could sail right into Tokio Bay.

163
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,073
- I'd settle for just getting out of the harbor.
- He can do that blindfolded.

164
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:55,170
Yes, sir, but I don't think he's going to.
He didn't take them papers, sir.

165
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,511
He forgot them. He must have.

166
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,279
He's got to sign them. Can I still catch him?

167
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,590
Sir, you get them papers.
I'll see that you catch him.

168
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,327
Ahoy, the weather deck!

169
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,258
What do you want, Jack?
A new rubber band for the engine?

170
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,770
Got a special delivery for the dock.
Can you handle it?

171
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,932
Yeah. Hey, Boats,
throw the hook over the side.

172
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,022
Just put your foot in there
and hold on tight, sir.

173
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,957
Jack, don't forget to tell him
to get a transfer.

174
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,758
Yeah! You have to switch over
when you get up there, sir.

175
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,320
Okay, let's go.

176
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,834
Easy, Leahy! Take it up!

177
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,865
Okay, Boats, bring him up.

178
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:56,460
If you're looking for your brother, he's
in a scow on the other side of this monster.

179
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,503
No, sir. It's me, sir. Tommy.

180
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,301
The Chief had
the ship's crane put me on the dock.

181
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:05,469
That Chief. He's just full of ideas, isn't he?
What's the rush?

182
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,406
I promised I'd meet some guys
at the Officers' Club for dinner.

183
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:13,383
- I just thought I'd walk in with you.
- It's a little early for dinner, isn't it?

184
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,421
Yeah, but you know,
junior officers have to get in and get out.

185
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,251
I was hoping you'd have dinner with us.

186
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,349
I'd like the fellows to meet my new skipper.

187
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,485
Thanks, Tommy,
but I'm not your skipper yet.

188
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,995
You see, I haven't signed
those papers in your pocket.

189
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,625
Yeah. I figured you forgot them,
so I brought them along.

190
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,498
- You really didn't forget them, did you?
- You didn't think I did, did you?

191
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,564
I know the ship doesn't look like much, sir,
but it's no scow...

192
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,975
and once the men get to work on it,
you'll be surprised.

193
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:44,246
If it's on account of me, sir, don't worry,
you can get another junior officer.

194
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,614
Wait. Look, kid,
this has nothing to do with you.

195
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:50,314
It's just that I don't want to get stuck
on that ship, you see?

196
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,220
But it sails, sir.
And it might have an important missión.

197
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,023
Tommy, if it was the Vanderbilt yacht,
I wouldn't want it, kid.

198
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,461
Do you see all those ships?

199
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,521
That's only a fraction of the Japanese fleet.

200
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,590
Do you want to go
up against that in the Echo?

201
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,397
Yeah, maybe you're right.

202
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,269
I guess I'll have to give these
to Cmd. Vandewater myself.

203
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,904
I'll give them to Vandewater.
I'll take care of him. Where's his office?

204
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,242
Headquarters building.
Behind the tug mooring, sir.

205
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,303
Thanks.

206
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,282
Look, kid, I may end up
as your skipper yet...

207
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,822
but you understand
why I'm trying not to, don't you?

208
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,255
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

209
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,638
How do we set up now, Maggie?

210
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,940
Cpl. Hathaway's office called at 17:00, sir.
Col. Harris at 17:05.

211
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,044
Briefing's at 18:30.

212
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,549
- That'll clear the deck, sir.
- Fine.

213
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,448
- Is Lt. Crandall still waiting?
- Yes, sir.

214
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,817
But I'm sure he understands...

215
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,086
that you have a full schedule
and won't mind.

216
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,128
No. Send him in, please.

217
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,061
Yes, sir.

218
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,934
Permissión to secure at 18:00, sir?

219
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,001
Permissión to... Sure.

220
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,807
And get me Admiral Hathaway, would you?

221
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,772
843.

222
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,911
Tell me, once you secure at 18:00,
what would you be doing, Maggie?

223
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,581
Keeping a date at 18:01.

224
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,177
With the base efficiency expert, of course.

225
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,047
Of course.

226
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,981
Stun the crows.

227
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,595
Flag secretary returning the Admiral's call.

228
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,724
Yes, sir. Got it right here, sir.

229
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,371
- Somewhere. Hi, I'll be right with you.
- Yeah.

230
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,365
Sir? Absolutely, sir.

231
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,406
19:00 in your quarters, sir. Yes, sir.

232
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,739
19:00.

233
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,312
What is 19:00, anyway?

234
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,047
7:00. I might have known
you had your finger in this.

235
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,057
All steamed up about my new command
and I end up in a Chinese junk.

236
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,487
What are you talking about, Rip?

237
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,461
- I thought you were at sea.
- I was, and very happy...

238
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,660
until I get orders transferring me to a grain
barge masquerading as a Navy vessel.

239
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,635
- The USS Echo?
- Echo?

240
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,762
Say, is that the racing sloop-

241
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,672
Joke's over.
I've been aboard this career-wrecker.

242
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,735
I was hoping you'd report here first,
so that l-

243
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,576
You could con me into it?

244
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,719
She's a brute, isn't she?

245
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,814
I'd liked to have seen your face
when you went aboard.

246
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,091
But it's no joke, Rip.

247
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,661
- This is an important assignment.
- You're getting funnier by the minute.

248
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,129
No, I'm serious.

249
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,129
Gen. MacArthur himself
wants her delivered to New Guinea.

250
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,293
Why?

251
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,629
Why?
You know, I asked him that same thing.

252
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,729
I said to him, "Doug," I said...

253
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,475
"why do you want that old hulk
sailed to New Guinea?"

254
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,137
- And he said to me, "Van, boy"-
- "Drop dead."

255
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,510
What's MacArthur got to do
with the Navy, anyway?

256
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,515
Say, you have been at sea.

257
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,813
Let's just say that he mentioned it
to Admiral Hathaway...

258
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,719
and Admiral Hathaway suggested
that I get with it or else...

259
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,915
and l, in turn-

260
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,050
You saw a chance to do a favor
for an old sailing buddy.

261
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,062
Rip, I swear it, your name popped out
of the lBM machine...

262
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,291
with five or six other ex-yachtsmen...

263
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,458
none of whom I would trust with a canoe.

264
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:27,130
And if you don't think it's a favor,
I heard about your fitness report.

265
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,140
That popped up, too?

266
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,575
You should get your
next promotion around 1980.

267
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,309
Come on. Now, look.

268
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,473
All you've got to do is slip up
inside the Great Barrier Reef...

269
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,747
run across the Coral Sea,
and take her into Port Moresby.

270
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,448
It's blue water all the way, prevailing winds-

271
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,320
Enemy planes, enemy subs.

272
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,155
400 miles of open water,
I got a crew of cherry pickers.

273
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,129
You beat me to Santa Barbara once
with five Sea Scouts.

274
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,960
But that's got nothing to do with this.

275
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,798
No. I picked you because you're
the only man I know who can do the job.

276
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,998
Now I get it. Now, what,
I sit on that bucket for the duration?

277
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,065
The ship's to be turned over
to the port detachment in Moresby.

278
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,169
What they'll do with it, I don't know.
That's their business.

279
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,077
All you've got to do is get it there.

280
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,608
You'll be flown back here for reassignment
the same day you drop the hook up there.

281
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,921
Now, why don't you just sign the papers
and get it over with?

282
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,117
Wait, a reassignment to what?

283
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,984
You'll have demonstrated your fitness
for command.

284
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,323
"D," maybe.

285
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,098
Maybe even a destroyer.

286
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,959
This is a chance half the guys in the fleet
would give their eyeteeth for.

287
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,296
How come I feel like I'm buying a used car?

288
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,541
How much time do I have to train, Van?

289
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,577
A couple of days, maybe.

290
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:47,015
- Or more. Let's see, to be in Moresby-
- Not a chance.

291
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,644
Now, look, Rip...

292
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,513
I don't want to have to lean on you,
but if I have to-

293
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,456
You'd have done it when I first walked in.

294
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,959
I don't have to take that ship.

295
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,893
Don't have to face a court-martial, either.

296
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,831
A prospective commanding officer
must first certify a ship in proper condition-

297
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,266
That applies to assuming command
in a naval shipyard.

298
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,533
Paragraph 1 does.
Paragraph 3 states elsewhere-

299
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:11,565
All right! For a direct commissión you got
to be a sea lawyer in a hell of a hurry.

300
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,907
Skipper had me memorize a page
every time I goofed.

301
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,844
Then you must know
the whole book by heart.

302
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:20,112
But Admiral Hathaway isn't that soft.
Good luck on your next duty.

303
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,443
Wait a minute.

304
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,655
Van, just give me 10 days to train.

305
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,323
Tell you what, give you an extra day.

306
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,259
That's impossible, and you know it.

307
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,299
I don't know anything,
except she's got to sail.

308
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,062
Under the second officer, if necessary.

309
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,927
The kid? But that's insane. He couldn't.

310
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,668
You know as well as I do
he doesn't have the experience.

311
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,677
Do l? Maybe this will give it to him.

312
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,818
- Did you talk him into it, sir?
- No, but I got him worried.

313
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,154
- Keep working on his conscience, mister.
- Aye, aye, sir.

314
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,229
Kid, what's with you and Vandewater?

315
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,030
Nothing, sir. He just told me to stand by.

316
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,072
There might be new orders
for the Echo tomorrow, sir.

317
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,872
What are you doing here, anyway?

318
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,071
I just came over from the Officers' Club, sir.

319
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,240
I thought, you not knowing the base,
I'd show you where it was.

320
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,443
I was hoping you might have
dinner with us, sir.

321
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,146
Sorry, I didn't mean to be so suspicious.

322
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,516
Thanks.

323
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,318
The new orders, sir.
Does that mean you got the transfer?

324
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,388
He's gonna talk to the Admiral.

325
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,565
- You'll get it.
- What makes you say that?

326
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,433
With your experience,
they'll have to give you a command.

327
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,234
Good officers are scarce.

328
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,467
Command? If Admiral Dewey
was still running the Navy...

329
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,909
I'd be a big man, but he ain't.

330
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,014
"lronsides" Hathaway is.

331
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,417
Where did you say that Officers' Club was?

332
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,011
Over there, in back of the shelter.

333
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,570
- I would like a double anything.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,439
Do you have any chit?
Have to get it from the mess officer.

335
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,479
- We're not allowed to take cash.
- Here, sir. You can use mine.

336
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:32,244
I couldn't do that to you, too.
I mean, it's bad enough that... Never mind.

337
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,785
This is the officer
I was telling you about, Arthur.

338
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:39,790
Lt. Crandall? This is a real pleasure, sir.
There's nothing too good for you, sir.

339
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,622
Mr. Hanson was telling me
you are going to command the Echo.

340
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,254
If you need an extra hand,
I sure would like a transfer.

341
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,491
If I were going to command the Echo...

342
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,296
I doubt that we would observe
the cocktail hour.

343
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,903
No, sir, he didn't mean that.
He's a real sailor.

344
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,599
Did two years as a deckhand before the war.
Right, Arthur?

345
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:59,770
Right, sir. The Old Escobar out of Frisco.
But that was power.

346
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,370
And there's nothing like sail,
is there, Lieutenant?

347
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,540
Coming right up, gentlemen.

348
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:10,279
You know, once the sea gets in your blood,
I guess you never get rid of it, sir.

349
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,590
Tommy, The Old Escobar out of Frisco
is the ferry to Oakland.

350
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,891
I've been on it. I wish I was on it now.

351
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,131
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

352
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,336
Did Cmd. Vandewater say
who they'd get, sir?

353
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,199
No. I imagine they'll find somebody. Why?

354
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,038
No reason, sir.

355
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:37,047
I just thought, with you in command,
I'd get real practical experience.

356
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,549
I've been studying up
on seamanship and navigation-

357
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,779
Tommy, if you knew
I was gonna be your skipper...

358
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,616
you and Vandewater cooked this thing up.

359
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,521
No, sir. Not until I saw your name
on the orders this morning.

360
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,615
No pretzels.

361
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,923
Then what difference would it make
who got the assignment?

362
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,493
None, sir. Except I thought
I'd try and show you...

363
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,660
I wasn't as stupid as you thought I was.
In Balboa.

364
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,864
- I told you before. That was five years ago-
- Excuse me, sir.

365
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,533
The two gentlemen with the nurse
are waiting for you, sir.

366
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,475
Thanks. Won't you join us, sir?
I told them about you, too.

367
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,843
I see. And you primed them
full of the salty talk...

368
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,611
on how they were gonna sail with me, too?
What are you trying to...

369
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,380
I'm sorry. It's really nothing.
I've got a lot on my mind.

370
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,354
It's been a tough afternoon. You run along.

371
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,913
- I'm sorry. I'll join you later.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,354
Arthur.

373
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,093
Would you like me to freshen it up a bit, sir?

374
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,625
- You're gonna freshen that up?
- You can't fly on one wing, sir.

375
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:49,015
- Thanks, Jimmy. And don't bother to wait.
- Yes, ma'am. Thanks.

376
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,726
Coming through. Pardon me, gentlemen.

377
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,871
Do one of these.
Kid, I got one that will stop you.

378
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,049
Okay.

379
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:41,563
Do you know what it means
to miss New Orleans

380
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,076
And miss it each night and day?

381
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,210
I know I'm not wrong

382
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,681
The feeling's getting stronger

383
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,651
The longer I stay away

384
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,813
Miss the moss-covered vines

385
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,188
The tall sugar pines

386
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,387
Where mockin' birds used to sing

387
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,295
And I'd like to see

388
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,867
The lazy Mississippi

389
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,235
A- hurryin' into spring

390
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,369
The moonlight on the bayou

391
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:24,142
A Creole tune that fills the air

392
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:29,478
I dream about magnolias in June

393
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:33,217
And soon I'm wishing that I was there

394
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,455
Do you know what it means

395
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,520
To miss New Orleans

396
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,931
When that's where you left your heart?

397
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,202
And there's somethin' more

398
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,706
I miss the one I care for

399
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,671
More than I miss New Orleans

400
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:59,313
Wonderful, boy.

401
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,443
Tommy, you're magnificent. Wonderful.

402
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,851
Hanson, you were the... Wait a minute.

403
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,085
Where are you going?
We're just getting warmed up.

404
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,683
We should get back to the ship, sir.

405
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,127
We have to get the anchor watch set.
Ship's security.

406
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:16,156
Yeah, you're right. I'll just finish this.
Here he comes. I love your work.

407
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,259
From the time
we came in here this afternoon...

408
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,464
this guy's kept my glass filled with whisky
so you can shanghai me.

409
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,133
Where'd you get
"we gotta go back to the ship" business?

410
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,109
Will you fill me with the sauce and then...

411
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,940
No, sir. You left your gear over there.

412
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,278
And you haven't got a place to stay.
Until you're reassigned, I mean.

413
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,509
Right.

414
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,610
I could stay
at the Bachelor Officers' Quarters.

415
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:39,316
Yes, sir. I forgot.
I'll have them bring your gear over.

416
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,389
No, wait a minute, kid. I'm sorry.
I've been needling you all night long...

417
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,395
and you haven't done anything to deserve it.

418
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,863
It's just something is eating me.

419
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,227
Look, just chalk it up to the fact...

420
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:54,067
that I'm a heel, and you're much better off
that I didn't take command.

421
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,267
No, I couldn't do that, sir.
You have to do what you think is right.

422
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,209
- I'll have them bring your gear over.
- No.

423
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,879
Leave it there and I'll pick it up sometime.

424
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,281
Give me a chance to see the hulk again.
And you.

425
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,352
Thank you, sir. Good night, sir.

426
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,283
Take care of yourself, kid.

427
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,139
Miss Typewriter of 1943.

428
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,937
What happened to your efficiency expert?

429
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,501
Did he get his head
caught in a filing cabinet, I hope?

430
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,548
Never mind, old daddy's here.
Arthur. Old daddy's here.

431
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,083
Would you bring this girl
something tall and cool?

432
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,120
If you don't mind, Lieutenant,
I'm looking for an Ensign Hanson.

433
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,622
He's your date?
He gets around better than I thought.

434
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,385
This is official Navy business, sir.

435
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,950
I have some documents
which must be signed by 23:00.

436
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,327
There you go with those numbers again.
Ensign Hanson just left, ma'am.

437
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,095
I could try and catch him.
He left in a fast jeep. What documents?

438
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,693
I don't believe
that's any concern of yours, Lieutenant.

439
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,331
It's in connection with
Ensign Hanson's ship, the Echo.

440
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,638
I see. At the moment,
I'm still under orders to take command.

441
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,975
And if you don't mind, anything concerning
the Echo also concerns me.

442
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,311
Would you step into my office
for a moment, please?

443
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,545
Arthur! The wine.
Here we are, open for business.

444
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,444
Let's see the papers.

445
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,422
I understood you were to be reassigned, sir.

446
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,886
I don't think I should.

447
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,120
I haven't been reassigned yet.
Give me the papers.

448
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,754
I want to see the swindle
Vandewater's trying to pull.

449
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,663
This has nothing to do
with Cmd. Vandewater.

450
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,300
And I don't think Admiral Hathaway
would appreciate your terminology.

451
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,630
They're the acceptance
papers from the Echo.

452
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,607
The Admiral wants them signed tonight.

453
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,610
- By Ensign Hanson?
- By Ensign Hanson.

454
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,181
If you really need him,
his ship's down at the end of the dock.

455
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,218
- I can send a fellow over for him.
- You're a little over-trained.

456
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,049
If you're not careful,
I'll have you transferred to the Echo.

457
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,850
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

458
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,325
He did it. He wasn't bluffing.

459
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,486
I think that Admiral
will have his grandmother made skipper.

460
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,030
Are they all in order, sir?

461
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,233
Right down to the fine print.

462
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,895
In that case, you can't have any objection
to Ensign Hanson signing them.

463
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,733
Where did you say his ship is?

464
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,671
- Bye, Arthur.
- Bye, sir.

465
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,609
Now, Lieutenant, look. I told you,
the Admiral wants those papers signed by-

466
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,238
- They will be. You got a pen?
- Yes, sir.

467
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:22,642
But they have to be signed
by the officer taking command.

468
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,915
I know that. Give me the pen.

469
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,159
Gosh, Lieutenant,
after the way you behaved this afternoon...

470
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,793
I wouldn't have thought a team of horses
could've gotten you on that ship.

471
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,064
Shut up.

472
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,201
Well, missión accomplished.

473
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,547
- Good work, Hanson.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

474
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,111
I guess. Good night.

475
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,529
- Shark Bait, will you just try to stay with it?
- I'm sorry, Chief.

476
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,468
Good morning, sir.

477
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,737
Beautiful morning, Captain.

478
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,177
Horse.

479
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,027
You might have better luck... Chief.

480
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,594
You might have better luck with that thing
if you laid the gasket on the boom first.

481
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,140
- Yes, sir. Lay the...
- Gasket.

482
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,171
Under the foot of the sails there,
on the boom.

483
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:54,738
Yes, sir.

484
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,510
- Your coffee, sir.
- Thank you.

485
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,186
What was in that?

486
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,189
That was an egg, sir. And Mr...

487
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,759
I thought it'd settle the grounds, sir.
Something wrong with it?

488
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,566
Yeah. I thought I swallowed my tongue.

489
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,506
Mr. Hanson meant eggshells
in the bottom of the pot.

490
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,600
Not a raw egg in the cup.

491
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,408
What were you
before you entered the service?

492
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,381
I was a cook, sir. I've been one for years.

493
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,246
- I'll have another cup. With grounds.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,422
Shackle the foresheet to the traveler.
Good morning, sir.

495
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,859
This to that.

496
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:59,534
- This is supposed to be the winch?
- I beg your pardon, sir.

497
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,443
- Winch?
- Yeah.

498
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,971
No, sir. This is a spark plug, sir.

499
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:10,445
I was talking about the engine itself.
This is the power takeoff?

500
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,691
Beats me, sir.
Mr. Hanson just told me to get it running.

501
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,886
I see. What's your name?

502
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,394
Sparks, sir.

503
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,093
- Radioman, Second Class, sir.
- Yes, all radiomen are called Sparks.

504
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,362
I mean, what is your actual name?

505
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:29,473
That's it, sir. A.J. Sparks, Jr.

506
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,872
Funny, ain't it? I mean, being named Sparks
and making radioman.

507
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,435
It's very...

508
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,539
All I wanna know is
if this is the power takeoff?

509
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:42,143
I wrote my old man about it.
And he's A.J. Sparks, Sr.

510
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,552
But he darn near died laughing.

511
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,953
A fortunate thing he didn't.

512
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,018
Ship rigged and ready, sir. Request
permissión to send watch to breakfast.

513
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:54,189
I'd like to see the foresail set first, mister.

514
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,226
The foresail? Yes, sir.

515
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,196
Chief!

516
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,298
Set the foresail.

517
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:08,378
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by to set the foresail!

518
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,114
Chief, get a load of this.

519
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,691
- Man the fore halyards.
- Man the fore halyards!

520
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,092
- Stand by the foresheets.
- Stand by the foresheets!

521
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,536
Take this line and wrap it
a couple of times around the winch.

522
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,909
Get that line ready for running.

523
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,878
Come on. Get that other line clear.

524
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,447
Stand by to hoist away.

525
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,991
All hands, stand by to hoist away!

526
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,761
All hands, stand by to sink!

527
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,492
All right, break it up, you guys.
You got nothing to do?

528
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:09,261
Sir, the winch is still being repaired.
Shall we take it up manually?

529
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,432
No.

530
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,169
Have the men stand down.
I wanna talk to them.

531
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,843
Stand down.

532
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:16,836
Sir?

533
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,156
Stand easy.

534
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,430
That was pretty miserable, wasn't it?

535
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,995
No reason why it shouldn't be.

536
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,061
With the exception of
Mr. Hanson and myself...

537
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,267
none of you knows the slightest thing
about sailing.

538
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,207
Nobody expects you to.

539
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,703
However, this ship
sails for New Guinea Friday morning.

540
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,017
Once we're at sea,
any sailing order that isn't carried out...

541
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,577
sharply and efficiently
could cost any or all of you your lives.

542
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,889
Now, I can't make blue-water sailors
out of you overnight.

543
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,586
But you are all Navy men.

544
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,931
If you're willing to work 18 hours a day
for the next three days...

545
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,470
I think I can teach you enough to get by on.

546
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,735
But if you can't cut it...

547
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,305
if any one of you
thinks that he might endanger the lives...

548
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:24,712
of the rest of the members of this crew,
then put in for a transfer, and now.

549
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,816
There's no disgrace to it.

550
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,586
I'll be in my quarters for the next hour,
any man who wants to see me.

551
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,249
That's all. Dismissed.

552
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,430
Chief, I prefer that you
and Mr. Hanson remain on deck.

553
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,865
Let the men decide this for themselves.

554
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,370
What do we do if they all quit?

555
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,218
- Hello, Johnson.
- Yes, sir.

556
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,248
You didn't eat very much, sir.

557
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,687
I wasn't very hungry.

558
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,922
Not that there was
anything wrong with the food. I just...

559
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,569
Men eat yet?

560
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,364
Yes, sir. They ate real good.

561
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,409
- Kind of quiet, but real quick.
- What do you mean, "quiet"?

562
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:32,381
Sir, a couple of them said something about
seeing Mr. Hanson and the Chief.

563
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,714
They wanted to see Hanson and the...

564
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,511
Upper shroud, lower shroud, topping lift.

565
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,893
Upper shroud, lower shroud, topping lift.

566
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,893
Jibstay, forestay, foremast, stow.

567
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,762
- How about that?
- Don't knock it. It works.

568
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,670
Gaff, foresail, gasket.

569
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,934
Gaff, foresail, gasket.

570
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,942
Callahan, standing or running rigging?

571
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,446
Blue standing, red running...
Running rigging, Chief.

572
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,378
Sheet or halyard? You.

573
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,481
Sheets, trims, sails, halyards, hoists.
Halyard, Chief.

574
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,077
- Which one?
- I don't know.

575
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,153
They'll know her by tomorrow, sir.

576
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:18,127
With your permissión, the crew'd like to
take another run at setting the foresail.

577
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,254
- Very well.
- Okay, Chief.

578
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,822
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by to hoist the foresail!

579
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,993
Shark Bait, throw up the...

580
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,593
- Gaskets.
- Gaskets.

581
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:31,069
Horse, stand by the foresheet.
Halyards to the winch!

582
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,341
Come on, you told me
you'd get that thing working.

583
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,879
Sure. When do you want it for?

584
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,347
Now, you idiot. You think you're back
in that service station?

585
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,150
Take up the slack.

586
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,486
- Set the foresail, Chief.
- Aye, aye, sir.

587
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,722
Stand by the mainsail. Engage the winch.

588
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,958
- Spark!
- I'm trying!

589
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,231
Hoist away!

590
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,031
Take it easy! You'll rip the mast out.

591
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,398
Slack it easy.

592
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,153
It's stuck. Heave!

593
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,727
It's stuck, sir.

594
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,767
- It's stuck, sir.
- Yeah.

595
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,362
Did you grease the mast? That's all it needs.

596
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,771
Don't worry about it.
You better bring it down.

597
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,707
Okay, slack it off and lower away.

598
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,768
Slack off and lower away!

599
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,415
It's still stuck. You get a man up on the rig
and kick the gaff jaws loose.

600
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,249
I'll go myself, sir.

601
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,648
One volunteer. You.

602
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,360
There's nothing to it, sailor.

603
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,929
- Yeah? Why don't you go?
- Move.

604
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,632
Can't we talk this over, Chief?

605
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,870
He's scared to death, sir.

606
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,806
If he doesn't do it here,
he'll never do it at sea.

607
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,002
Come on, boy. There's nothing to it.

608
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,275
You'll be all right, son.
Just take one step at a time, okay?

609
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,475
Take it easy. Now, don't look down!

610
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,249
Close your eyes.

611
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,279
Now, when you open them,
look straight ahead.

612
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,181
That's a boy. Just keep your eyes level...

613
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,954
and go on up one rung at a time.
You can do it.

614
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,729
That's it, sailor. Now, go ahead.

615
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,697
Now, I want you to go on up...

616
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,996
until you are level with the gaff jaws.
You know what they are?

617
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,695
- Yeah.
- All right.

618
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,303
When you get there, and when you're ready,
just reach out...

619
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,808
and see if you can kick them free
with your foot.

620
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,434
You understand?

621
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,314
That's the boy. When you feel it, I want
you to reach out with your right foot...

622
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,285
and kick the gaff jaws loose.

623
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,184
That's it. Reach out.

624
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,419
Don't look down!

625
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,053
Now, kick it loose.

626
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,834
Hook your foot in the shroud.

627
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:13,963
I can't.

628
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,662
Take another turn around that winch
and hold it fast.

629
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,765
Take it easy, kid, I'm coming.

630
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,905
I'm slipping. My hands are slipping. I'll fall.

631
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,642
Stop that! Wanna land on someone?

632
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,646
Got you.

633
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,779
Let go with your left hand.

634
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,458
Oh, boy.

635
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,427
I would've fell.

636
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,522
- lf you hadn't been here, I'd have let go.
- Never.

637
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,599
- Hang on, I'm going up and kick her free.
- Okay.

638
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,843
Hang on, kid.
All right, lower it away, Mr. Hanson. It's free.

639
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,777
All right, lower away, Chief.

640
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,680
Slow now, slow. Slow.

641
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,349
Pull what you got.

642
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,365
Wait for me!

643
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,908
That's my ship leaving.
Will you let me through, you guys?

644
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,342
That's my ship.

645
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,383
Wait a minute, boy.
What you got in the bag?

646
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,045
For Pete's sake, I'm gonna miss it.
It's leaving.

647
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,423
He's afraid of missing that?

648
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:45,121
Wait for me! Wait! Come on! Wait for me!

649
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,800
- I made it.
- Yeah. Nice going, sailor.

650
00:42:56,307 --> 00:43:00,004
Now, bear a hand on the bowline.
We're just coming into the dock.

651
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,138
Say, you have got a few, haven't you?

652
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,377
He's a nut. But he's eager.
Here goes nothing.

653
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,480
- You'll be back before you know it.
- Just be sure I am.

654
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:11,578
The order's on my desk.

655
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,589
See they get processed, will you, beautiful?

656
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,557
Just pop them into that little lBM machine.

657
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,754
I'll square things with you
when I see you again next Friday night.

658
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,354
Are we getting
an lBM machine, Commander?

659
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,391
- My, that'd be-
- Yes, we might. Good luck, old boy.

660
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,236
Good landing.
You can take her on out now.

661
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,780
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by the line.

662
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,018
Not now, Johnson.

663
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:56,328
Chief, I want all this gear stowed
before we hit open sea.

664
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,924
Aye, aye, sir.

665
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,539
Come left, mister.

666
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,809
I said, come left.
You're cutting across the bow.

667
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,912
It's no use. She won't answer the helm.

668
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,719
Did you drop the centerboard?
Get up there and do it!

669
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,192
Go down and give me full speed astern.

670
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,957
- Sparks, back full quick!
- Back full, sir.

671
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,987
Not another one!

672
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,126
Come on with that centerboard!

673
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,903
Come on, you monster.

674
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,438
Centerboard down and locked, sir.

675
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,909
- Full speed astern, sir.
- Full speed ahead!

676
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,879
- Full speed ahead!
- Right, sir. Full ahead, sir!

677
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,207
Mister, will you get
a helmsman on that wheel...

678
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,252
and set sail, while I go below
and change my clothes?

679
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,786
Yes?

680
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:41,790
Shall I notify the Admiral's office
of the time of departure, sir?

681
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,466
Yes, please, Maggie.

682
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,128
While you're at it,
you might notify air-sea rescue...

683
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,138
to be on the lookout for a ship in distress.

684
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,944
- Now what?
- I think that Australian ship's saluting us.

685
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:02,483
They always cheered the Christians
before they threw them to the lions.

686
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,282
- You getting the sail up?
- Yes.

687
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,514
I'll be right up.

688
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,422
He's off to port.

689
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,397
- He's off to port.
- He's off to port.

690
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,899
- Sparks, kill that eggbeater.
- Yes, sir!

691
00:47:57,107 --> 00:48:00,668
What are you doing here?
Thought you left an hour ago.

692
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,439
The weather report said winds
up to hurricane force in the Coral Sea.

693
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,247
I thought you might have a message.

694
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,752
- From that little boat, I mean.
- Ship.

695
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,285
They're under orders
not to break radio silence, remember?

696
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,992
You're really worried.

697
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,827
- Did you fall for that wild man?
- No.

698
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,596
Mind you, he was kind of cute.

699
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,536
Don't worry about him.

700
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:32,032
The rougher it is, the better he likes it.
He's having a ball out there.

701
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,802
Besides, the last aerial sighting
put them way up here.

702
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:39,182
They're probably beyond the storm
and just loafing along.

703
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,718
If I ever get my hands on that Vandewater...

704
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,304
Yes, sir?

705
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,935
Get this from the files immediately, please.

706
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,876
Now, then...

707
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,474
what's the report on that schooner
we sent to Moresby last week?

708
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,321
- The...
- Echo, sir.

709
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,751
She rode out a storm Tuesday night
and was sighted from the air yesterday.

710
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,761
From the position report,
they'll raise the New Guinea coast-

711
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,297
Don't guess, Commander. I want to know.

712
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,061
That ship is a vital part of joint operations.

713
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,365
- The Echo, sir?
- The Echo.

714
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,837
What do you know
about an officer named Foster?

715
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,340
Lt. Dennis M. Foster.

716
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,172
Why, nothing, sir. Should l, sir?

717
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:45,177
He's been assigned
to take the Echo to Cape Gloucester.

718
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:49,582
Cape Gloucester on New Britain, sir?
Why, that's enemy territory.

719
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,948
Very good, Vandewater.

720
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:57,551
It also happens to be an excellent place
to watch Japanese ship movements.

721
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,219
For the past six or seven months...

722
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,595
the Australians have had
a coast watcher there doing that.

723
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,761
Then, two weeks ago,
in the middle of a transmissión...

724
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,933
he went off the air.

725
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,433
Killed? Taken prisoner, sir?

726
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,943
I don't know.

727
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:19,479
But that's why the Echo
was sent to Moresby...

728
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:24,384
on a faint chance that it could take
in a replacement if everything else failed.

729
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,988
A sub couldn't drop the man off at night?

730
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:30,356
What was the Spearfish doing
in the Solomon sea last week?

731
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:34,589
Uncharted reefs will make it
impossible to get anywhere near the coast.

732
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,557
And an airdrop is out of the question.

733
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:42,036
No, it's got to be
a shallow draft vessel like the Echo.

734
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:47,910
The Australian replacement is in Moresby
waiting for the ship to arrive.

735
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,277
As soon as it does, this man Foster
is supposed to take command...

736
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,078
and try and make the run up
to Cape Gloucester.

737
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:59,046
I'd feel better if I knew more about him.
It's a ticklish job.

738
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,748
I'll get Lt. Foster's file out immediately.

739
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,760
I've got it right here.

740
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:11,962
He seems to be qualified,
and Capt. McClung picked him.

741
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:16,662
He commands port detachment of Moresby
and ought to know what he's doing.

742
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,700
He wants to hold Lt. Crandall
for a few days...

743
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:24,076
until Foster's familiar enough
with the ship to take over.

744
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,845
Tell him he can have Lt. Crandall
for as long as he likes.

745
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,112
Yes, sir.

746
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:45,123
Lt. Foster will not relieve Lt. Crandall...

747
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,137
until, in the opinion of the port captain...

748
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:52,039
Lt. Foster is fully qualified
to command the Echo.

749
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:56,445
That means I can hold Crandall here
as long as I like.

750
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:02,147
- That make you any happier about Foster?
- I've got nothing against the bloke.

751
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,177
He's just not the type
that I'd pick for a mate.

752
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:09,214
- He's a good officer.
- The best. A real sterling character.

753
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:14,186
But if you can have this Crandall bloke,
why can't he stay in command?

754
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:18,257
Because his job is to acquaint Foster
with the Echo, that's why.

755
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:30,243
Of course, we could try sending you
in again in another sub.

756
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,111
Now, wait a minute.

757
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,051
I'm crazy about Foster.

758
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,888
- Where is that flaming ship, anyway?
- Simmer down, Pat.

759
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,318
She'll be along.

760
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,560
On deck!

761
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:54,363
- What's that?
- I can make out a pier in the harbor, sir.

762
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,869
Nan. Easy. Roger. King.

763
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,549
That's her, Mr. Foster, the Echo.

764
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,844
I was afraid of that. A tub.

765
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:16,656
All right. Contact and please pass the word
to stand by for special instructions.

766
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,250
Aye, aye, sir.

767
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,166
There's a building at the shore end.
That must be the port detachment.

768
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:27,567
Fine. Sparks, ready on the engine.
Some navigation, mister.

769
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,605
Have the boatswain stand by to down sail.

770
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:30,935
- Sir!
- What's the trouble?

771
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,941
I wish I knew. I can't get it started.

772
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,375
I checked the ignition system,
the valves, the pumps.

773
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,676
- I'm going through the fuel lines.
- Can we take her in under canvas?

774
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,911
- No room to maneuver in there.
- We'd be going in in style.

775
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,476
In style?
As long as we don't end up on the beach.

776
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,681
How long is it gonna take you to fix it?

777
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,122
If I can find the trouble, not long.
But if I can't?

778
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,683
We have orders to get in as fast as we can.
Get with it.

779
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:55,026
Wipe that grin off your face.
This isn't as easy as it looks.

780
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,589
Keep the deck.
Hold that beacon in your port bow...

781
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,397
till I give the order to come about. Hold this.

782
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,245
No reason to get excited.
It's a tricky maneuver.

783
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:14,875
If you handle your duties as well
as you've been doing, we'll be all right.

784
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,714
There's one very important thing.

785
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:19,016
We'll be on the wind
when we fetch that dock.

786
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,786
I must come up fast, lose weight,
try to coast alongside, understand?

787
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,555
- When we start to luff-
- That's when the sails flap?

788
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:29,121
Right. I want every inch of canvas
down as fast as possible.

789
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,158
- Mister, stand by to come about.
- Man the sheets. Keep a close haul.

790
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,761
Tell the man up the crosstrees
to watch the gaff jaws.

791
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,276
- I don't want them sticking again.
- Aye, aye, sir. Guys, keep your eye on the-

792
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,313
- Somebody's firing at us.
- Over us, so far.

793
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:54,087
What did we do? Lose the war already?

794
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,558
- Who's responsible for firing on that ship?
- I was trying to warn them, sir.

795
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,723
They've not answered our transmissión
and don't know of harbor defenses.

796
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,699
She's already in the harbor!

797
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,896
Did it ever occur to you
she might be on a radio silence?

798
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,531
They're coming any minute.
Get down and warn him off.

799
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:11,631
Yes, sir.

800
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,278
- Where are you?
- I'm sorry, I can't get the engine started.

801
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,581
Get the transmitter.
I want to know who fired on us and why.

802
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,747
I can't do that either.
It doesn't put out without the engine.

803
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,085
- Sir!
- What?

804
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,092
There's a flashing light on the dock.

805
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,254
Take out the hand blinker.
Stand by to come about.

806
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,198
- Aye, aye, sir.
- All hands stand by to heave to.

807
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:50,408
- What's the matter with them?
- They're going right into it.

808
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,579
- Got them now, sir.
- Tell them.

809
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,887
What do you got?

810
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,820
"You are...

811
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,457
"approaching..."

812
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,691
Cancel it, they're already in it.

813
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,134
Tell them quick.

814
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,935
Cancelled. Restart, sir.

815
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:19,532
All they're telling us
is we're approaching a Navy dock.

816
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:20,837
"You are...

817
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,505
"in...

818
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:23,703
"a...

819
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:28,214
"fine...

820
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:31,378
- "area."
- lsn't that nice?

821
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:34,150
Must be the chamber of commerce.
What are they saying?

822
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,954
- Excuse me, sir. That "F" was an "M."
- That's different.

823
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,824
- "You are in a mine area."
- Mine area? Get directions, quick!

824
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,888
Lookout, keep your eyes peeled
for subsurface objects.

825
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,648
There's something there now, sir!

826
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,150
Dead ahead!

827
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:05,949
There they are! Two of them!
Dead ahead, sir!

828
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,991
- Orderly!
- Another one, sir. Off the port bow.

829
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,583
Man the back stage.
Go forward, get that centerboard up.

830
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,219
She won't answer the helm.

831
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:16,026
It won't make any difference
if we hit a mine. Go on.

832
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:26,104
- They request we move inshore, sir.
- Get back to that engine, quick.

833
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,787
Centerboard up and secured, sir.

834
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,151
Another one off the port bow, sir!

835
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,568
Another one at starboard.

836
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:53,190
They're out of it.
Tell them they're in the clear.

837
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,463
- We're all clear, sir.
- Roger.

838
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,834
On deck!

839
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,837
Low waters ahead, sir.

840
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,334
Lower away all sails, Tommy.

841
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,572
Drop that centerboard.
Sparks, put it forward.

842
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,807
Lower away all sails! Let's get this down.

843
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,253
The gaff jaws are stuck again.

844
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,562
Kick that gaff jaw free.

845
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,733
- Centerboard down, sir.
- Right!

846
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,074
You monster, come about.

847
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:07,669
- Sir, we're closing on the dock.
- What? Back full, Sparks!

848
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:24,750
Sir, we're gonna ram the dock.

849
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:28,080
No. Go forward and get ready
to let go of the anchor starboard.

850
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,586
Johnson, bear a hand on the anchor.

851
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:35,389
Cameo, grab that line.
Stop it up short. Tend that line.

852
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,193
Sparks, I said back full!

853
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,631
Excuse me, sir, she quit on me again.

854
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,471
Go forward and rig the fenders
on the port side.

855
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,280
Shark Bait, let go of the anchor
and hold it underfoot.

856
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,991
Man overboard!

857
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,754
Look out below!

858
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,263
Nice work, mister.

859
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:55,206
- What did you say, sir?
- I said, very nice.

860
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:59,072
Is that all for this performance,
or have you got an encore?

861
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,480
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
This is a centerboard ship-

862
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,609
A ship?

863
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,984
Why, I was under the impressión
that it was a USO Tour.

864
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:09,014
This is an official Navy ship, sir.

865
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:12,556
The crew is doing the best they could
under the circumstances.

866
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:15,256
This crew is doing the best they can?

867
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,062
I suggest you take this crew out
for about six months.

868
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,661
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

869
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,401
This is my ship.

870
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:27,773
Anything this crew does is under my orders.

871
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,972
If you have any further remarks
about this ship or my crew...

872
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,242
you come aboard and make them to me.

873
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,878
- Throw the sails.
- Astern to.

874
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,185
Thank you for your invitation, Captain.

875
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,454
Since I'm relieving you,
that won't be necessary.

876
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,793
Whatever I have to say to this crew,
I'll say to them directly.

877
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,389
You're taking over?

878
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:53,993
As soon as you report your arrival
to the port captain.

879
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,702
I would be obliged
if you do that as quickly as possible.

880
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,112
Furl the sails.

881
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,636
Excellent, Lieutenant.

882
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,632
- At ease, please.
- Yes, sir.

883
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,306
You've done a remarkable job
bringing that ship up here.

884
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,712
Thank you, sir. I had a remarkable crew.

885
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:43,183
Yes, I saw them in action as you came in.

886
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,621
I'm sorry you won't be commanding them
on the missión.

887
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,987
Missión?

888
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,925
You don't think we brought that ship
up here just for the ride?

889
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:56,624
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
The missión is top secret.

890
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,599
You weren't informed, were you?

891
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,795
- No, sir.
- Come here.

892
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:06,435
Temporarily, the ship is being placed
at the disposal of the Air Force.

893
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,501
It's imperative that they get
one of their men ashore...

894
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,547
here on Cape Gloucester.

895
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,344
- ln New Britain? With the Echo?
- Yeah.

896
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:19,278
They seem to think
if she's disguised as a Navy training craft...

897
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,047
that she has a chance.

898
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:24,393
That's what they're doing to your ship now.

899
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,260
Camouflaging it.

900
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:30,026
And the Air Force will provide
what fighter cover they can.

901
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,766
Fortunately, that won't concern you, will it?
No, sir.

902
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:36,930
You've met your replacement, Lt. Foster?

903
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,600
- Yes, sir.
- Fine.

904
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:43,644
I have Admiral Hathaway's
permissión to hold you here...

905
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,773
until you can familiarize Foster with Echo.

906
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,447
- I know you're anxious to get back to town-
- That's all right.

907
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,683
It would take some time for the men
to get used to a new skipper.

908
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,317
It won't take more than 48 hours.

909
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:04,225
- I don't suppose you would be-
- Sir?

910
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,462
Yes, Davis, what is it?

911
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:09,368
Air Force reports enemy bombers
over the Solomon Sea.

912
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:12,804
They expect a raid in 20 to 25 minutes.

913
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:16,970
Mr. Patterson and the native corporal
are in the briefing room.

914
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,946
Shall I ask them to wait for the all clear?

915
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:22,109
- The Lieutenant and I will be over directly.
- Yes, sir.

916
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:25,210
Warn Echo. tell those
Air Force people to clear the dock.

917
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,585
Yes, sir.

918
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,699
They're going up to make the intercept.

919
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,039
Our ClC Room is over here.

920
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:55,182
Bogie 1 appears to be splitting.

921
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:58,185
Designated raids. One Abel and one Baker.

922
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,283
One Baker.

923
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,018
055. 43.

924
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,624
We know there's a convoy
building up here over BAM.

925
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:09,460
I'm fairly certain it'll take off
in the next 10 days...

926
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:13,992
run along the north coast of New Britain
and land troops either here at Madang...

927
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,765
or down here at Lae.

928
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,863
Lae, they'll land at Lae.

929
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,899
They'd be a month
coming over land from Madang.

930
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,344
We also know
that they'll be making a grave tactical error...

931
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,973
Mr. Patterson, that's right.

932
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:31,241
No Navy man would risk putting ships
through narrow straits like that.

933
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,346
They'd be a sitting duck
during an aerial attack.

934
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:38,087
- lsn't that right, sir?
- Absolutely, Lieutenant.

935
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,520
What Patterson is thinking of, though...

936
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:44,225
is this weather front
that's moving in from the central Pacific.

937
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:47,925
By the end of the week,
this whole area will be socked in so tight...

938
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,235
there won't be any chance
for aerial observation.

939
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,374
That's why it's so vital...

940
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:57,068
to get Pat in there to take the place
of that coast watcher...

941
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,944
who disappeared.
Tom Evans. Wasn't that his name?

942
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,040
Yeah.

943
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:05,645
Then we can hope, with Pat's help,
to get a visual sighting from the land.

944
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:11,421
Would it be difficult to drop Mr. Patterson
and the corporal by parachute?

945
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,794
If you ask me, it'd be flaming impossible.

946
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,322
I'd as soon go in with a brass band
and a neon light on my hat.

947
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,467
Besides, I don't like airplanes.

948
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:27,433
- Or air raids, either. Goodbye, all.
- Stick around a few minutes.

949
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,705
They'll be concentrating on the airstrips.

950
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,974
Yeah, and they might miss, too.

951
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,876
Don't you get any wrong ideas
about Patterson, Lieutenant.

952
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:42,822
If it weren't for him and the Australian
coast watchers who hid in the jungle...

953
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,225
when the Japanese occupied these islands,
we'd be in a bad way.

954
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,388
Both here and in the Solomons.

955
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,291
Patterson and that native corporal of his...

956
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,393
have spent the last six months
right here in the hills...

957
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,030
constantly in danger
from Japanese patrols...

958
01:07:57,106 --> 01:08:00,132
and just as constantly sending us
our vital information.

959
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,301
So don't-

960
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:10,285
Now, they're entitled to sit this one out, son.

961
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:13,687
One Baker. 050.

962
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,255
One Baker should be overhead
in two minutes.

963
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:17,417
Very well.

964
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:22,191
You have air cover
as far as the Trobriands here.

965
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,762
Across the Solomon Sea,
you'll just have to pray...

966
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,861
that the enemy thinks
you're a native trading vessel.

967
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,934
That'll be two, maybe three days.
Right, Crandall?

968
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:40,675
I'm sorry, sir. This is the first time
my crew's been under fire.

969
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:43,211
I'm afraid it won't be the last.

970
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:47,321
No, sir. Let me see, three days, you say?

971
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:51,890
If you took off from here at dusk, and
you were sharp on celestial navigation...

972
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,054
it could be two nights and a day.

973
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,754
Foster is a qualified navigator.

974
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,291
Thank you, sir.

975
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:04,197
You have a few days
to acquaint him with the ship's peculiarities.

976
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,534
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

977
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:10,871
If this weather front does move down,
you'll have to do some dead reckoning.

978
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,608
Why don't you let me worry about that?

979
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,544
Pardon me,
but they're swinging in over the harbor.

980
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:22,614
Everybody but the duty section
should be in the slit trenches.

981
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,955
- What?
- Your own orders, sir.

982
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:43,240
Welcome to the club.

983
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:46,844
- Where's he going?
- To be with his ship, I imagine.

984
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,276
Quite a bloke, that Crandall.

985
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:54,982
Duck!

986
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,002
The port captain's here, skipper.

987
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:04,087
- Kind of soggy out, isn't it, Crandall?
- Yes, sir.

988
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,552
We could run up the coast for a few miles.

989
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,620
I can show the Lieutenant
how the ship handles.

990
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,255
That won't be possible now.

991
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:13,859
The size of that air raid shows
the Japanese are building up to something.

992
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,302
Air Force wants Echo underway
as soon as possible.

993
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,600
I see, sir.

994
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,471
Get underway as soon as
you've accomplished the transfer.

995
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,177
Bring your papers to my office.

996
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:26,180
We'll see about arranging air transport
for you to Australia.

997
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,510
Yes, sir.

998
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,082
After you, Captain.

999
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,033
Yes, come in, Crandall.

1000
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,671
What're you doing here?
Why aren't you underway?

1001
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,715
I request you to order Lt. Crandall...

1002
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:03,115
to turn over the Echo to me
without further delay.

1003
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:06,484
He's got me signing for equipment
I can't even find. He's...

1004
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,782
Sir, he's getting underway.

1005
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,754
He is?

1006
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,624
No. He wouldn't do a thing like that.

1007
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,360
Sir, he must be.

1008
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:21,295
No, really?

1009
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:26,300
He's taking it out himself, sir. See?

1010
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,011
Yes, he is, isn't he?

1011
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,879
My ship in that minefield again.

1012
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,644
He knows where those mines are now.

1013
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,752
Aren't you going to order him back, sir?

1014
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,257
The Air Force would demand
an explanation...

1015
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,391
for the delay, and-

1016
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,088
Sir, this is a court-martial offense.

1017
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,993
- What, Lieutenant?
- I said this is a court-martial offense, sir.

1018
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,125
Yes, I guess you're right.

1019
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:57,494
Still, he was assigned to me
for an indefinite period.

1020
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,468
For as long as I needed him.

1021
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,636
I'll tell you what I'll do, Lieutenant.

1022
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:08,414
If he ever comes back from that missión...

1023
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,682
I'll consider a court-martial.

1024
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,720
Yes, sir.

1025
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,866
This channel of yours
is less than 100 feet wide.

1026
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,408
Is that the only break in the reef?

1027
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:37,968
The only one I know of,
and I've covered over 100 miles of it.

1028
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,274
- On deck!
- What is it?

1029
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,949
Another enemy aircraft
on the starboard quarter...

1030
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,714
closing in on us, sir.

1031
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,897
You'd better get below, sir.

1032
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:05,231
Same order stands!
Don't fire unless they fire first!

1033
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,446
Hold fire.

1034
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,724
Drop dead, you creeps.

1035
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,000
- Blow a couple of gaskets!
- Yeah.

1036
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,547
Looks okay, sir. They're waving back.

1037
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:07,060
Dogs.

1038
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:16,675
I hope that's the last of them.
This thing's starting to itch.

1039
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,809
It is. With that weather front coming,
be lucky to make home.

1040
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:21,372
Flaming shame if we didn't.

1041
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,317
Run forward and tell cook
to barbecue poultry for dinner.

1042
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,854
We need a decent meal for tonight's work.

1043
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,221
We'll hit that front in one hour.

1044
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:33,420
By midnight, it'll be darker
than 3-4 feet down a cow's throat.

1045
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,827
- How will we see the reef?
- Nothing to it.

1046
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,594
You can hear the surf pounding
on the reef for miles.

1047
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,500
Fine. How do we know
how much water's under us?

1048
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,232
That depends on the size
of the waves, don't it?

1049
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:47,639
Don't worry, I can take you through there
with my head in a bag.

1050
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,643
Yeah, you may have to.

1051
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,507
Yeah?

1052
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:58,514
Thanks for trying anyhow, Major.
Yeah, I'll be seeing you sometime soon.

1053
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:01,914
No, sir.

1054
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,823
He checked every squadron
that had a plane in the area today.

1055
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,418
That's absolutely the last time
she was seen by anybody.

1056
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,521
But that was at dawn this morning.

1057
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:12,396
By late afternoon,
they should've been somewhere up here.

1058
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,061
What about that observation flight
sent from there?

1059
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:16,762
Canceled due to the weather.

1060
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,272
You can bet the Japs
didn't cancel that convoy.

1061
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:23,673
If we'd just gotten that ship underway
one day sooner.

1062
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,126
Lower away all sails.

1063
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:47,665
Stand by the engine.
I want full power going over that reef.

1064
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,256
Tommy, take the deck.

1065
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,788
Where did you say this inlet was?

1066
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,852
- Straight ahead. Through those trees.
- Right.

1067
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:54,024
At least the Air Force has been up here.
They sure worked that one over.

1068
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:55,729
I guess so, sir.

1069
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:28,399
Lead him.

1070
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:34,234
I can knock that teacup
right out of his dukes.

1071
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,569
Don't.

1072
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,406
He may have friends,
like about 200,000 of them.

1073
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,244
Just keep your eye on them. Don't get itchy.

1074
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:57,458
You were going to glide
through the jungle like a ghost.

1075
01:18:57,532 --> 01:19:00,501
- This looks like Hannibal crossing the Alps.
- Take off.

1076
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:04,430
I'm gonna be here a long time.
I like my comfort now and then.

1077
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:07,907
You've enough for a hotel.
How far do the men have to lug this stuff?

1078
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:10,240
The other side of that little hill up there.

1079
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,872
I'll hide this stuff there
till I'm ready to move on.

1080
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,973
It'll take them hours to get up there.

1081
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,245
What am I to do?
Wait here like a sitting duck?

1082
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,550
Who's gonna know?
You're tucked in here real nice and cozy.

1083
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,146
The Japanese Navy never spotted you,
did they?

1084
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:26,126
- Where are you going?
- You have to stay on the ship, sir.

1085
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:30,130
- There has to be an officer with the patrol.
- Why don't you let the kid go?

1086
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:33,326
Give him a chance to stretch his legs
and look at the countryside.

1087
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:35,699
- Hanson, come-
- Thanks for the boat ride.

1088
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,604
- I'll radio your regards to Capt. McClung.
- Thanks.

1089
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:42,541
- I'll bring them back safe and sound.
- You better, or don't come back yourself.

1090
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:44,205
On the bow.

1091
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:49,008
- How do my men find their way back here?
- No problem.

1092
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:52,451
Those masts of yours
stick up like a lighthouse in the fog.

1093
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,420
Good on you, mate.

1094
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:01,486
You.

1095
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:05,158
Get out of here with those whites.
They'll spot you for two miles.

1096
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:22,845
Come on.

1097
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,613
Must have jumped him without his knowing.

1098
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,210
- I'll have the boys dig a-
- Leave him.

1099
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,544
Leave everything just where it is.

1100
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,286
I can't have them know I'm here.

1101
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,883
He had no family that I know of, Chief.

1102
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:09,163
Quicker I'm out of this, the better I'll like it.

1103
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,260
Let's go.

1104
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:28,976
- A little different up here.
- It's beautiful.

1105
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:33,738
- It's hard to believe.
- Your first stiff, kid?

1106
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,445
- Yeah.
- There'll be a lot more of them.

1107
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,586
No cup of tea, this war.

1108
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:40,877
Chief...

1109
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,818
Goroka will show you
where to dig my stuff in.

1110
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,357
You'll have no trouble
finding your way back.

1111
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:50,091
You've left a trail
as wide as George Street, Sydney.

1112
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:53,498
- Will it give you away?
- No, it grows over in a day.

1113
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,494
By tonight, we'll be a long way from here.

1114
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,497
You're gonna stay down there
in the jungle?

1115
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,572
Till the Japs get me.

1116
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:04,876
Or our blokes come down
and run them out of here.

1117
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,343
Don't worry about it.

1118
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:09,076
Just reckon I'm crazy enough
to get a kick out of it.

1119
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,017
That don't mean I wanna stay here for ever.

1120
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:14,619
You do your best to keep the Navy moving.

1121
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,680
Goroka, we go along now.

1122
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:38,045
- Stay awake.
- I'm awake.

1123
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,516
Give me some air, will you?

1124
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,454
Coffee, skipper?

1125
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:08,265
Shark Bait...

1126
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:11,073
secure that boom crutch.
I want to move fast when they get back.

1127
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:12,443
Yes, sir.

1128
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,633
The crew will finish up.

1129
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:37,364
There's nothing left
but pulling some brush over.

1130
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:43,876
We'll be ready by the time you cool off.
You went to the wrong school, sir.

1131
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:47,073
- Officers ain't supposed to work so hard.
- I needed it.

1132
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:57,818
Chief, come here.

1133
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,791
That's it, the Japanese convoy.

1134
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:09,098
Lucky we got the old man
up here when we did.

1135
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:12,264
He's still down in the jungle.
He can't possibly see it.

1136
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,604
We've got to get back to the ship.

1137
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:18,410
- All right, guys. Let's haul it.
- Come on, let's go.

1138
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:21,112
Get going.

1139
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:10,252
Sir, so the war lasts five minutes longer.

1140
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:12,190
It'll be dark in an hour.

1141
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:14,235
- Can I help you?
- I'm all right.

1142
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,837
Sir, I saw the mast. They're right below us.

1143
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,336
Go ahead.

1144
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:23,199
Last time I ran like this,
four MPs were on my tail.

1145
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:29,641
Rip! Listen up!

1146
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,050
Wait a minute.

1147
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:41,761
- Rip?
- Yeah, come in, kid.

1148
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:43,524
We saw the convoy. It was...

1149
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:45,691
Let him talk. Makes no difference now.

1150
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:10,756
Tommy, I'd like you to meet
Capt. Shigetsu. UCLA, '38.

1151
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:15,360
Bachelor of Science in Horticulture.
So, you saw our convoy?

1152
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:18,829
Move over there where I can watch you.

1153
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,958
- Not now, kid.
- No, later.

1154
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,040
As you were saying, you saw our convoy.

1155
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:30,236
Where were you
and what were you doing when you saw it?

1156
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:33,946
My name is Thomas Hanson,
Ensign, United States Naval Reserve.

1157
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:36,643
No use.
The good captain was just reminding me...

1158
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:39,619
that Japan is not a signatory
of the Geneva Convention.

1159
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:43,983
It really makes no difference.
We can classify you as a spy.

1160
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:45,624
This is an aerial photograph...

1161
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:48,423
taken of this ship
in the Solomon Sea yesterday.

1162
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,431
You certainly weren't in uniform then.

1163
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:53,763
Shall we get back to details of the missión?

1164
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:56,395
Let's get back to the Rose Bowl game.

1165
01:27:56,638 --> 01:28:00,039
Okay, but Maj. Samada's gonna ask you
the same questions.

1166
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:03,874
- Very educated man, the Major.
- Really? I'm Stanford myself.

1167
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:08,305
In that case, it'll be my pleasure
to assist the Major in his questioning.

1168
01:28:15,056 --> 01:28:18,025
He's a big one.
I thought they were all little jokers.

1169
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:21,653
Shut up.
What happened to you clowns? Asleep?

1170
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:25,399
They were on us like tents.
We didn't have a chance.

1171
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:29,993
It's for me. I'll get it.

1172
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,979
Real brass.

1173
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:44,775
Lay you eight-to-five he braces the sergeant.

1174
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:12,042
- You'll rise when the Major enters.
- Sure, we will.

1175
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:13,803
- You better.
- Okay.

1176
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:17,009
Do me a favor.
It's there, right there. That's it.

1177
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:21,044
I don't think they'd look good here
with the Major coming down.

1178
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,125
Thank you.

1179
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:35,399
Close the door.

1180
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:42,032
I won't tell you anything more!

1181
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:46,675
Good boy. Get the guns.

1182
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:55,512
Get below. Prime that engine.
Give me back full when I yell.

1183
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,455
- You want these?
- There are too many.

1184
01:29:57,525 --> 01:30:00,517
- What're you gonna do?
- Like I know! Get on the engine.

1185
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:32,519
Chief, look aft.

1186
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:43,603
Sarge.

1187
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,732
Didn't I meet you in Singapore once?

1188
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:51,269
I remember, you used to hang out
at that high-kickers club...

1189
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:52,903
in Saigon, huh?

1190
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:56,548
Duck!

1191
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:09,451
Go, Tommy! Give it full,
and get up here on this machine gun!

1192
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,216
Sparks, on the engine.

1193
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:41,895
Chief, drop the centerboard.

1194
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,096
Give me full ahead.

1195
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,580
Duck!

1196
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:13,820
See if you can get that machine gun nest.

1197
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:36,275
Hang on to that gun, kid. Here we go.

1198
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:09,707
You could've bet me we wouldn't make it.

1199
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:12,378
Sorry, sir.
The engine flooded out going over the reef.

1200
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:15,581
- Who needs it? Stand by to make sail.
- Aye, aye, sir!

1201
01:33:15,656 --> 01:33:18,124
Get this overboard
so we can raise the mainsail.

1202
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:20,126
Port Moresby trying to reach us, sir.

1203
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:22,685
Good. Get on that thing
and tell him what you saw.

1204
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:25,755
- I can't transfer without the engine, sir.
- Fix it.

1205
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:36,908
Look out, Rip!

1206
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:40,403
Don't shoot.

1207
01:33:42,216 --> 01:33:43,615
Keep going.

1208
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,650
- Rip, you all right?
- Are you kidding? I can't...

1209
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:59,065
Move. Just make one little move.

1210
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:03,093
Johnson, get the aid kit.

1211
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,175
Let him handle it, sir.

1212
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,751
- I can transmit now, sir.
- We'll contact them.

1213
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:24,620
- lf you do, you kill your captain-
- Shut up, you crumb.

1214
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:25,954
What do you mean?

1215
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:28,359
You're still within range
of the shore battery.

1216
01:34:28,429 --> 01:34:32,160
The second you start transmitting,
they'll blow you out of the water.

1217
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:36,264
Surrender. Your captain will be hospitalized.

1218
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:40,199
- We have excellent Japanese doctors.
- Sir.

1219
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:55,181
- Send it.
- It's insane.

1220
01:34:57,591 --> 01:35:01,357
You'll all be killed.
Can you stand by and let them destroy you?

1221
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:03,761
- Let me plug him, sir.
- Shut up.

1222
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:07,060
Enemy convoy seen
north of Cape Gloucester.

1223
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:10,199
What's the matter with you,
you got four thumbs?

1224
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:15,998
I told you so.

1225
01:35:16,077 --> 01:35:18,807
At 1600, heading west.

1226
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:24,411
- Break out the life raft, Chief.
- Yes, sir.

1227
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:27,318
Message received, sir.

1228
01:35:28,989 --> 01:35:31,389
Get that life raft over the side!

1229
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,327
- How's he doing?
- I'm okay. Let's get out of here.

1230
01:35:50,611 --> 01:35:52,670
We're hit in the forward hull.

1231
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,442
We're taking water fast.

1232
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:57,844
- You abandon ship.
- Abandon ship!

1233
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:58,942
Come on.

1234
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:11,963
Aren't you gonna stay
and die for the rising sun?

1235
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,556
You out of your mind?

1236
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:33,579
He's got a pretty high fever, sir.

1237
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:37,020
Can still fire flares.
Japanese nurses very good.

1238
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:39,958
One more crack out of you
and you're in the water.

1239
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:42,558
Sir, I hear a plane.

1240
01:36:43,931 --> 01:36:45,364
There it is!

1241
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:47,189
It's a PBY.

1242
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:54,206
Looks like UCLA blew another one.

1243
01:36:56,577 --> 01:36:59,011
On this same morning of 3 March...

1244
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:03,106
projecting the course of the enemy convoy
from the slim information received...

1245
01:37:03,184 --> 01:37:06,881
the Allied forces in New Guinea put every
available aircraft in the air...

1246
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:09,752
met the Japanese ships
and their air cover in the straits...

1247
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:11,519
between New Guinea and New Britain...

1248
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:15,187
and in a two-day running battle,
wreaked total destruction on it.

1249
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:43,915
Of this little-known,
yet highly decisive battle...

1250
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:46,186
Gen. Douglas MacArthur said:

1251
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:49,752
"The battle of the Bismarck Sea
won a victory of such completeness...

1252
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:53,163
"as to assume the proportions
of a major disaster to the enemy. "

1253
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:58,530
And so it is recorded
in the history of Worid War II.

1254
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:02,738
Of considerably less importance...

1255
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:05,040
yet of vital interest to us...

1256
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:07,603
is the fact that six months later...

1257
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:11,344
in what was now
just a quiet backwater in the rear area...

1258
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:16,688
a newly promoted Lt. J. G.
pulled alongside his first command...

1259
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:18,986
and prepared to take over.

1260
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:26,727
Belay that racket.
You want the whole area to hear us?

1261
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,200
As a matter of fact, sir, yes.

1262
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:33,095
- Stations for getting underway.
- Weigh her to side!

1263
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:02,027
What did you say about going ashore
and speaking to the Admiral?

1264
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:05,731
You weren't interested
in any more special missions.

1265
01:39:05,806 --> 01:39:08,172
I can let the man talk, can't l?
