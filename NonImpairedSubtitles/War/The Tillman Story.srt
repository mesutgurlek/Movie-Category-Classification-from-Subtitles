1
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,220
Quiet, please.

2
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,364
Pat Tillman, safety, Arizona State.

3
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,199
Good, keep looking. That's good.

4
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,585
Pat, can we try that
just one more time?

5
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:39,356
Make sure not to kind of even
glance up or look around or anything.

6
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,057
Okay. lt's a long-ass time
to just sit there.

7
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,633
Yeah, it is.

8
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:44,895
Here we go.

9
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,235
lf they knew anything about my son,
they wouldn't have done what they did.

10
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,240
Pat Tillman, safety, Arizona State.

11
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:57,883
Because he didn't really fit into
that box that they would have liked.

12
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,934
<i>Pat Tillman</i>
<i>loved the game of football.</i>

13
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,673
<i>Yet, as much as Pat Tillman loved</i>
<i>competing on the football field...</i>

14
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,283
<i>...he loved America even more.</i>

15
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,315
<i>Courageous and humble,</i>
<i>a loving husband and son...</i>

16
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:43,053
<i>...a devoted brother</i>
<i>and a fierce defender of liberty.</i>

17
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,561
<i>Pat Tillman</i>
<i>will always be remembered</i>--

18
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,928
l think they just thought, if they spun
the story and we found out...

19
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,195
...we'd just keep it quiet because
we wouldn't want to diminish...

20
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,635
...his heroism or anything like that...

21
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,743
...but, you know, nobody question's
Pat's heroics. He was always heroic.

22
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,608
What they said happened,
didn't happen.

23
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,978
They made up a story, and so
you have to set the record straight.

24
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,455
<i>Good evening, thanks for joining us</i>--

25
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,751
<i>Our top story</i>--

26
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,985
<i>On a more serious</i>
<i>and indeed, tragic note</i>--

27
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,130
<i>Live fire rounds all around me</i>--

28
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,532
<i>ln the third week of April 2004,</i>
<i>the 2 4-hour news cycle...</i>

29
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,506
<i>...was dominated by two stories</i>
<i>about fallen American soldiers.</i>

30
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,008
<i>The first involved an airport worker</i>
<i>who had been fired...</i>

31
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,481
<i>...after sharing these photos</i>
<i>with her local newspaper.</i>

32
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,521
<i>This sparked debate</i>
<i>about a federal law...</i>

33
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,624
<i>...that had been in place</i>
<i>since the first Gulf War.</i>

34
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,761
Why should we hear
about body bags and deaths?

35
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:55,364
<i>Americans had been mesmerized by</i>
<i>news coverage from the Persian Gulf.</i>

36
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,433
<i>But the military said</i>
<i>photos like these...</i>

37
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,367
<i>...violated the privacy</i>
<i>of grieving families.</i>

38
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,170
<i>The second story was not considered</i>
<i>a violation of privacy.</i>

39
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,374
<i>Pat Tillman, who gave up</i>
<i>a multimillion-dollar contract...</i>

40
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,383
<i>...in professional football,</i>
<i>has been killed.</i>

41
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,291
<i>At age 25, Pat Tillman</i>
<i>was a charismatic defensive back...</i>

42
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,193
<i>...in the national football league...</i>

43
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,699
<i>...with a reputation</i>
<i>as a bruising tackler.</i>

44
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,869
<i>But he brushed it all aside...</i>

45
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,734
<i>...when he announced</i>
<i>that he would be quitting the NFL...</i>

46
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,343
<i>...joining the Army Rangers</i>
<i>along with his brother Kevin...</i>

47
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,571
<i>...and setting off</i>
<i>to fight in the Middle East.</i>

48
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,046
<i>Though the media hounded him</i>
<i>for an interview...</i>

49
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:50,188
<i>...Tillman refused to speak publicly</i>
<i>about his decision to leave the NFL...</i>

50
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,656
<i>...requesting only that he</i>
<i>be looked upon as any other soldier.</i>

51
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:00,831
<i>But this was a request that, in death,</i>
<i>the public could not grant him.</i>

52
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,535
The first thing we heard
when we got the news of Pat's death...

53
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,305
...was that he was shot in the head
getting out of a vehicle.

54
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,497
That's all we heard.

55
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,270
We didn't get an official story
until the memorial service.

56
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,644
lf you're the victim of an ambush,
there are very few things you can do...

57
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,617
...to increase your chances
of survival.

58
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:29,022
One of which is to get off
that ambush point as fast as you can.

59
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,922
One of the vehicles
in Pat's convoy...

60
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,595
...could not get off.

61
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:46,443
He made the call,
he dismounted his troops...

62
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,208
...taking the fight to the enemy
uphill.

63
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,747
This gave his brothers,
in the downed vehicle...

64
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,385
...time to move off that target.

65
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,827
He directly saved their lives
with that move.

66
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,537
<i>Pat's memorial service</i>
<i>in San Jose, California...</i>

67
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,368
<i>...was carried live</i>
<i>by all the major networks.</i>

68
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,171
<i>That service is ongoing right now,</i>
<i>as you just saw here on Fox News</i>--

69
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,406
<i>The story recounted in the eulogy</i>
<i>was abridged...</i>

70
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,449
<i>...elaborated upon</i>
<i>and retold time and again.</i>

71
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,746
<i>According to military accounts,</i>
<i>Tillman ordered his men up a hill...</i>

72
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,925
<i>...to attack terrorists that</i>
<i>had pinned down part of his platoon.</i>

73
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,526
<i>All the soldiers in that</i>
<i>ambushed platoon were saved.</i>

74
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,628
<i>They were rescued by Pat Tillman.</i>

75
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,991
<i>Tillman directed his team</i>
<i>into firing positions.</i>

76
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,493
<i>Tillman's voice</i>
<i>was heard issuing commands...</i>

77
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,499
<i>...to take the fight</i>
<i>to the enemy forces.</i>

78
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,140
<i>Pat Tillman's family will also receive</i>
<i>the Silver Star for his service...</i>

79
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,141
<i>...and his great heroic efforts</i>
<i>over there on April 22nd.</i>

80
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,509
<i>Pat was given the Silver Star, the</i>
<i>nation's third highest combat honor...</i>

81
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,948
<i>...awarded for valor in battle</i>
<i>with enemies of the United States.</i>

82
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,780
<i>A Navy SEAL friend of the family...</i>

83
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,686
<i>...had based his eulogy</i>
<i>on the Silver Star narrative.</i>

84
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:11,353
Pat sacrificed himself
so his brothers could live.

85
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,331
What they received was something
that was really honorable, you know.

86
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,735
The narrative that they got was
something that was befitting a hero.

87
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,335
l knew that there was
a massive possibility...

88
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,845
...that other things were gonna come
out to bring certain things to light...

89
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,679
...that were gonna completely...

90
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:39,022
...make that ceremony invalid.

91
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,758
Company.

92
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,863
Present arm.

93
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:03,405
l remember, we did like this little
memorial in Afghanistan for Pat.

94
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,210
You know, l mean,
fuck, everybody showed up.

95
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,849
lt was terrible.
lt was terrible seeing everybody.

96
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,219
Everybody was just lost,
shocked, frustrated.

97
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,024
Sound off for roll call.

98
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,462
- Specialist Atkins.
- Here, first sarge.

99
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,601
- Sergeant Elroy.
- Here, first sarge.

100
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,862
- Specialist Norman.
- Here, first sarge.

101
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,233
Specialist Tillman.

102
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,840
Specialist Patrick Tillman.

103
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,241
Specialist Patrick Daniel Tillman.

104
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,412
l knew we were gonna get debriefed.

105
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,489
And they were gonna pick it apart
and figure out what happened.

106
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,785
And people were gonna get punished
and people were gonna be leaving.

107
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:53,295
l didn't expect to ever, you know,
be on a plane like two hours later.

108
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:01,064
They knew what the relationship was
between me, Kevin and Pat.

109
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,468
And they told me:

110
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,543
"You're the closest to the brothers,
we want you to fly back with Kevin.

111
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,340
lt's not your place
to tell the family anything.

112
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,915
You need to keep
your mouth shut about it.

113
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,645
You need to not cause
any type of turmoil."

114
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,348
And l-- You know, l said, okay. Yeah.

115
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,128
They put us into a cargo plane
that was completely empty.

116
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,096
The only thing in it, right there
in the middle, was Pat's coffin.

117
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,633
And they covered it
with an American flag.

118
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,213
Just sitting across from Kevin and
looking at him, l couldn't say anything.

119
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,511
l barely said two words to Kevin
the whole time we were flying home.

120
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,554
l was afraid that he might ask me
what happened to Pat.

121
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,200
Russell Baer came to our house
after Pat's memorial service...

122
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,066
...and my ex-husband,
or Pat's father...

123
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,971
...asked Russell to tell the story
of what happened to Pat.

124
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,079
The position he was in
while he was over at the house...

125
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,018
...was, l'm sure, very awkward.
lt appeared very awkward.

126
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,245
At the time, it seemed
that he was still very upset...

127
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,289
...and rattled by the whole setting,
and Pat's death...

128
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,050
...because he liked Pat a lot.

129
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,998
l went into Pat's mom's living room
and l gave them my narrative...

130
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,033
...excluding certain possibilities.

131
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:41,400
And Russell Baer told us nothing.

132
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,901
lnitially, l was not real pleased
with Russell Baer.

133
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,638
lt upset me that this kid...

134
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,114
...that's supposed to be a friend
of the family's, didn't say anything.

135
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:58,755
But we found out
about five weeks later, the reason.

136
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,523
A reporter from the <i>Arizona Republic</i>
contacted me.

137
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:06,289
lt was peculiar because l hadn't heard
from the media for quite a few weeks.

138
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,798
And l just got a very eerie feeling,
and when l called him back...

139
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,165
...he asked me what l thought about
the news the Army had given us...

140
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,465
...and l didn't know
what he was talking about.

141
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,506
So l basically prodded him
to tell me...

142
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,645
...and he said that,
you know, there was a suspicion...

143
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:25,340
...that Pat was killed by fratricide,
"friendly fire."

144
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,811
<i>The U.S. Army now says Pat Tillman</i>
<i>was not killed by enemy fire.</i>

145
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,614
<i>lt was dark, the terrain was rough.</i>

146
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,759
<i>To put it another way,</i>
<i>it was the fog of war.</i>

147
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,293
<i>Now the Army says, Tillman's death</i>
<i>was apparently an accident.</i>

148
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,864
The investigation results indicate
that Corporal Tillman...

149
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,798
...probably died
as a result of friendly fire...

150
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:49,737
...while his unit was engaged
in combat with enemy forces.

151
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,943
lt was determined that
l was to give the press conference.

152
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,077
My role during this period...

153
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,181
...was commander of the U.S. Army
Special Operations Command.

154
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,220
l commanded the Green Berets...

155
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,416
...Civil Affairs, SlOPs,
the 1 60th Aviation...

156
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:13,257
...the Rangers
and a number of our Special units.

157
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,368
<i>lt was General Kensinger's job</i>
<i>to explain why five weeks earlier...</i>

158
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,007
<i>...the military had reported</i>
<i>that Pat was killed by the Taliban.</i>

159
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,177
You know,
l don't wanna sound trite...

160
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:29,370
...but there's an old Army adage
that says first reports are incorrect.

161
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,518
There is an inherent danger
of confusion in any firefight...

162
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,654
...particularly when
a unit is ambushed.

163
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,221
<i>During the press conference...</i>

164
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,188
<i>...and at a subsequent private briefing</i>
<i>with the Tillmans...</i>

165
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,851
<i>...the Army said Pat had been killed</i>
<i>by an errant U.S. bullet...</i>

166
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,032
<i>...during a chaotic ambush.</i>

167
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,464
The ambush was conducted
by 10 to 12 enemy personnel...

168
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,931
...from multiple locations--

169
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,663
According to them,
things were confusing...

170
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,241
...and it's an unfortunate accident.

171
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,972
l know l felt like they haven't
really looked into this well enough...

172
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,049
...to give me an explanation,
and l don't much appreciate that.

173
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,046
The results of this investigation...

174
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,749
...in no way diminish the bravery
and sacrifice displayed...

175
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,052
...by Corporal Tillman.

176
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,489
ln the process of this explanation,
l asked one of them:

177
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,127
"Why then award him a Silver Star?

178
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,864
You don't give a Silver Star
for attitude."

179
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,702
He goes, "Well, we did in this case."

180
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,403
You don't wanna think the worst
of the people that you're dealing with.

181
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:40,847
Our thoughts and our prayers remain
with the Tillman family.

182
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,385
Thank you for being here
this morning.

183
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,955
You want to believe
they're telling you the truth...

184
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,888
...yet, you're getting this sense
that you're being lied to.

185
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,756
U.S. Central Command
is the point of contact...

186
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,695
...for further inquiries
in this investigation. Thank you.

187
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,132
At the end of the briefing, we were told
that we would be getting...

188
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:04,071
...the source documents that were
used to support the investigation.

189
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,483
They showed me the box.
lt was six binders full of stuff.

190
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,746
"Eventually, Mr. Tillman,
you're going to get a copy of all this."

191
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,020
l said,
"Great. When am l gonna get it?"

192
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,965
What motivates you the most?

193
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,641
l don't know.
l get a lot of satisfaction out of, like...

194
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,106
...you know,
my family being proud of me.

195
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,337
My brothers, you know, l care
what they think and how they feel...

196
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,812
...and l want them to be proud
of what l'm doing.

197
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:49,818
My mom-- My mom finished dead last
in the San Francisco Marathon.

198
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,048
l don't know when it was. She was
probably 30-- Whatever years old.

199
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,284
l mean, dead last.
On the little sheet when--

200
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,362
You know, they do it-- Her--
Mary Tillman, the last fricking name.

201
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,558
They were actually tearing everything
down when she finished, you know.

202
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,566
They were putting everything away.

203
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,502
So, l mean, that says a lot about her.
She's a real hard-working woman--

204
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,541
Dannie committed herself
to trying to...

205
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,339
...you know, figure out exactly
what happened to our son.

206
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,147
She contacted a lot of people.
She did a lot of work.

207
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,917
l'd take things to work,
or l'd make phone calls...

208
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,558
...when l didn't have students,
or when l had my break or at lunch.

209
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,058
l'd call the medical examiner,
the coroner.

210
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,961
l'd call ballistic people trying to find
someone that could answer questions.

211
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,933
l mean,
l was just making calls all the time.

212
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:43,742
Along the way, l'd encounter people
that were able to help us.

213
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,711
And at somewhere along the line,
we got in touch with Stan Goff.

214
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,812
l was running a blog,
everybody got a blog nowadays...

215
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,684
...so l wrote something
about the Tillman Case.

216
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,853
lt was just, you know,
a commentary piece related to...

217
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,019
...this whole perception-management
aspect of the war.

218
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,892
So when we got to talking,
she realized l'd been around.

219
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,503
l'd been to Vietnam
and Guatemala...

220
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:17,802
...Grenada, El Salvador, Peru,
Colombia, Somalia.

221
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,001
Three assignments
with Ranger units...

222
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,442
...two assignments
with the Special Forces unit...

223
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,208
...one assignment
with the Counterterrorist unit.

224
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,619
So it wasn't just
that l had experience in Pat's unit...

225
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,518
...it was also that
l could sort of help them...

226
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,957
...read the hieroglyphics
in that Special Operations world.

227
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,859
Because it is a culture.

228
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,731
The first time the family got a sense
that we were being lied to...

229
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,668
...was when we started looking
at the documents.

230
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,104
They gave her the papers,
but what they did was...

231
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,404
...l think, they tried to drown her,
you know.

232
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:59,107
They wanted to give her so much that,
you know, no normal human being...

233
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,255
...would dig through all this paperwork
and try to make sense out of it.

234
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,788
<i>The Army handed over transcripts</i>
<i>of every interview they conducted...</i>

235
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,260
<i>...with Pat's platoon</i>
<i>and their commanding officers.</i>

236
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,626
<i>There were also</i>
<i>radio-communications logs...</i>

237
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:20,066
<i>...field-hospital reports, terrain maps,</i>
<i>an autopsy...</i>

238
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,503
<i>...and a detailed study</i>
<i>of the light conditions that day.</i>

239
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,442
<i>ln all, it totaled over 3,000 pages</i>
<i>of material on Pat's death.</i>

240
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,673
But it's redacted.

241
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:38,255
Every single name, half the actions,
any references to places.

242
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,949
You have to go this sort of
painstaking reconstruction.

243
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,255
lt's like doing a very difficult
crossword puzzle.

244
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,797
You keep running around looking
for just one word you can fit in there...

245
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,868
...and then you can sort of
lock all the other stuff into it.

246
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,000
We tried to look
at what was being said...

247
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,042
...and then we'd try
to piece together--

248
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,840
Okay, if they're saying this,
then who might that be?

249
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,846
We would take a redacted name...

250
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,077
...and we'd try to count the number
of spaces that were in there...

251
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,382
...to try to figure out
whose last name was in there.

252
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,356
And, of course, by going over
the same thing again and again...

253
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,155
...with some names plugged in...

254
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,492
...we started to become familiar
with aspects of it.

255
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,167
l wanna make this very clear, when
we initially heard of this fratricide...

256
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,104
...and the fact that these soldiers
in this vehicle had killed Pat...

257
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,974
...we felt very bad for them,
to have to live with this.

258
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,342
We thought it was just some
horrible accident.

259
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,145
You know, they were in a fog of war
and they were frightened...

260
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:46,154
...and it was too dark to see. But you're
reading things in the documents...

261
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,848
...that make you very suspicious.

262
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,862
The more that we heard
about the situation...

263
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,969
...it seemed much more
like gross negligence.

264
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,612
They asked one of the soldiers:

265
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,679
"Did you positively identify
your target?"

266
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,283
He said, "l don't know.
l thought everybody else did.

267
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,146
l just wanted to be in a firefight."

268
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,447
That doesn't sound
like someone who's afraid.

269
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,717
That sounds like someone who
simply wants to shoot at something.

270
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,574
There's a sense that
we can't discover meaning...

271
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,712
...we can't discover who we are,
we have no real sense of identity...

272
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,816
...until that's tested somehow.

273
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,512
Let's test it against something
that's real, let's test it in a context...

274
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:57,321
...where life and death
are real coexisting possibilities.

275
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,867
All young infantrymen will say,
"l wanna be in a firefight."

276
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,932
That's what makes them feel
like they're fully fledged.

277
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:14,101
You know, they can say, "Well,
l've actually experienced combat."

278
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,086
<i>What is up?</i>

279
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,684
<i>What's up?</i>

280
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,260
l went in for all the selfish reasons.

281
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,662
l didn't go in because l was patriotic
and wanted to serve my country.

282
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,166
l wanted to serve myself.

283
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,767
l wanted to get some money
for college.

284
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,738
l wanted to learn
to be more self-sufficient.

285
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:50,279
l wanted to blow things up
and shoot guns, you know.

286
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,415
l got to Ranger battalion
September 1 0th.

287
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,284
And, literally, when l got there
and woke up the next morning...

288
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,119
...l got thrown out of my bed
and l thought it was a joke.

289
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,318
You know, new guy, big joke.

290
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,089
And when l saw the planes
hit the towers...

291
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,597
...you know, during breakfast,
it was like:

292
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,894
"l'm gonna fucking die."

293
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,670
lt was about 10 minutes later, there
was people yelling and standing up.

294
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,271
They were pumped
because we was gonna go to war.

295
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,743
They knew we was gonna go to war
at that point.

296
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,981
Sound off.

297
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,681
You don't wanna see it happen,
but at the same time...

298
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,617
...that's what
you've been working for.

299
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,314
And whenever that comes down,
you want a chance to say:

300
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,652
"Hey, l can handle this"

301
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,058
Airborne Rangers, motherfucker!

302
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,664
Go!

303
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,297
You know, we're supposed to believe
that soldiers' motives are pure...

304
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,769
...that they go into these situations
reluctantly.

305
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,967
lt's an imposition of a level of wisdom
and maturity on soldiers...

306
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:58,844
...that doesn't apply to 19 year olds
anywhere, ever.

307
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,951
l ain't fucking out, dude.

308
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:07,285
A 1 9-year-old kid is far less interested
in displaying wisdom...

309
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,861
...than they are in, like, giving some
sort of a practical demonstration...

310
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,158
...of their masculinity,
you know what l mean?

311
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:21,535
The atmosphere in a military unit
like that, is a locker-room atmosphere.

312
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,230
Tapping.

313
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,337
Fucker.

314
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,779
lt's not philosophical.

315
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:35,776
- l turn my back on you.
- Get that fucking camera out of here.

316
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,370
l expected Pat to be kind of like,
you know, in a general sense...

317
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,631
...the general depiction of, like,
your jock, your meathead.

318
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,468
Not very intelligent.

319
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:02,113
Kind of like the guys l knew
in high school. They were just...

320
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,604
...jerks.

321
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,677
Arrogant, you know, full of himself.

322
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,221
Why the hell is somebody leaving
an NFL contract...

323
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,952
...to come to this shit hole
and deal with this kind of nonsense?

324
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,230
There was just
kind of a low mumble...

325
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:26,268
...that he really was looking
to become a political leader.

326
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:31,172
A lot of people thought he just didn't
have a good head on his shoulders.

327
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:35,369
He wanted to kind of do the macho,
red-blooded American, patriotic thing.

328
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,451
He was an ex-football player, he was
used to getting millions of dollars...

329
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:45,318
...and he was used to
pretty much having it his way.

330
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,290
He was a private...

331
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,520
...which in Ranger mentality, it means
that you're on the same level as dirt.

332
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:01,501
There was a time where l did have
to take corrective action against Pat...

333
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:08,441
...for, basically, coming unglued on me
for an order that he was given.

334
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,539
That's just the way
that the military goes.

335
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,877
You get orders,
sometimes you don't like them.

336
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,111
You don't have the option of saying:

337
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,415
"l don't like this.
Let's do this another way."

338
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:25,358
Or in his case, saying,
"This is completely fucking stupid."

339
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,499
Pat had something,
you know, that l wanted.

340
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,399
You know, there was something
that Pat knew and just got...

341
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,540
...that l needed, that l wanted.

342
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:42,376
l went in looking for that one thing
that l couldn't put my finger on...

343
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:46,244
...that was going to help me to
accomplish everything l wanted to do...

344
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,215
...and Pat had that something.

345
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,120
He wasn't at all
what l expected to find.

346
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,885
He didn't seem like
this tough knucklehead guy.

347
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,461
You know, he was interested
in Emerson, in Chomsky...

348
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,395
...and he just seemed
very, just, open.

349
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,296
lt didn't matter who you were, where
you were from, what you were into...

350
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,441
...Pat always wanted to find out
what you were about.

351
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,278
And he would ask
a million questions.

352
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,006
l walked in on him one time and
he was reading the Book of Mormon.

353
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,847
And, you know, it really hit me
because l am Mormon.

354
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,512
So l asked him, "Hey, you know,
you have any questions...

355
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,158
...please feel free to ask.

356
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,056
l'll explain whatever l can to you
as best as l can."

357
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:36,496
l knew that he wasn't religious, but he
told me that he respected all religions.

358
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:42,233
Bryan O'Neal was kind of a small guy,
a very nervous guy.

359
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,772
l wasn't real impressed.

360
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,706
l think he was really looking
for a place to fit in...

361
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,608
...looking for more family...

362
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,681
...looking for something
that was a little bit of a closer tie.

363
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,944
l was kind of terrified going there
because, you know...

364
00:25:56,154 --> 00:26:00,955
...the rumors of hazing and tricks that
the senior guys play on the new guys.

365
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,793
Pat was different
from everyone else in the platoon.

366
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:08,762
He didn't ever, you know,
treat me like l was lower than him.

367
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,927
l think the only time,
you know, that l upset Pat...

368
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,905
...is he asked me to,
you know, prep some ChemLights...

369
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,043
...for an objective
we had the next day...

370
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,611
...and l forgot,
you know, l was doing other things.

371
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,305
And he basically let me know
that l disappointed him...

372
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,712
...that l didn't do
what he wanted me to do.

373
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,319
And that really, you know--

374
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,547
l wish he would've taken me
in the hallway...

375
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,193
...and smoked me up and down,
and, you know, treated me horribly...

376
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,759
...you know, called me stupid.

377
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:42,366
But him telling me that l disappointed
him, it really upset me, you know.

378
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,592
l decided
l was never gonna do that again...

379
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:48,569
...because he was such a great guy,
l didn't wanna let him down.

380
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,038
When Bryan came in,
Pat kind of picked him up.

381
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:58,346
He just put an arm around him and
scooped him up the best he could.

382
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,783
Everyone was actually envious
that he was my team leader...

383
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:07,755
...that little scrawny me would be
working with this huge football player.

384
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,694
l blamed myself for quite some time
that maybe...

385
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,354
...you know, Pat's not in a place
where he should be...

386
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,559
...because l didn't put forth
more effort.

387
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,228
And, you know, it's something
l still think about today.

388
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,035
You know,
that because of my lack of faith...

389
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,372
...you know,
he may be suffering for it.

390
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,984
For all those who are here tonight...

391
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,921
...we honor the memory
and accomplishments of Pat Tillman...

392
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:49,226
...by permanently retiring
his number 42 ASU football jersey.

393
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,230
Arizona was always very good
to Pat...

394
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,876
...but it's very hard when
you're put out there kind of on display.

395
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:07,409
The public grieving
is not something that l can do.

396
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,951
l don't wanna do it.

397
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,252
lt's an awkward spot.

398
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,856
The issue at the time was trying to
figure out what had happened to Pat.

399
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,966
lt was, you know,
sort of a difficult situation...

400
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,572
...because it was a very private thing
that happened...

401
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:33,676
...that was then being played out
in the public.

402
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,952
And so l had this sense of sort of
wanting to hold on to what l could.

403
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:50,453
Even at that point,
he was totally getting lost.

404
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:56,927
Pat, who he was as a person,
was lost in the conversation.

405
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,103
--<i>what you did with Pat Tillman</i>--

406
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,603
<i>Oh, there we go,</i>
<i>typical Republican personal attack.</i>

407
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,367
- <i>Can't stick to the issues</i>--
- <i>Let me finish the point.</i>

408
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,204
<i>Pat Tillman</i>
<i>was a Noam Chomsky fan...</i>

409
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,279
<i>...was gonna vote for John Kerry,</i>
<i>was against the war in lraq.</i>

410
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,814
- <i>l don't believe it.</i>
- <i>l don't believe it either.</i>

411
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,679
<i>He signed up</i>
<i>because of his desire to fight.</i>

412
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,720
They would take parts
of who he was...

413
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:23,053
...and magnify those
to suit their purposes.

414
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:30,966
l was trying to figure out
how to live without him.

415
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,132
You feel like
your world has stopped...

416
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,902
...and yet, everything goes on
like normal.

417
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:55,524
lt started pretty much overnight
after Pat was killed.

418
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,291
The day after he was killed,
there were cameras on my front lawn...

419
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,896
...which was bizarre.

420
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,660
l mean, l was not expecting
anything like that at all.

421
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,804
He lived here in University Place
with his wife.

422
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,203
l remember my mom was always
going around closing the blinds.

423
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,810
Today three men from Fort Lewis
walk slowly to the house...

424
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,846
...to tell his wife, Marie, they care.

425
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,678
Staff Sergeant David High, a Ranger,
tried unsuccessfully...

426
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,652
...to express his feelings,
choked up, and walked away.

427
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,791
No, that's not good. Sorry.

428
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:32,725
<i>But the newsmen camped out</i>
<i>on Marie's lawn had the story wrong.</i>

429
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,762
<i>ln fact, the casualty-assistance</i>
<i>officers were there to compel Marie...</i>

430
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:40,096
<i>...to sign off on a funeral</i>
<i>at Arlington National Cemetery...</i>

431
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,172
<i>...with full military honors.</i>

432
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,836
They were sort of pushing
for a military funeral...

433
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,449
...which was not
what his wishes were.

434
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,513
<i>During basic training,</i>
<i>Pat had a premonition...</i>

435
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:01,055
<i>...that if he died, he might be used</i>
<i>as a public-relations' stunt.</i>

436
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:05,127
<i>So he'd smuggled a copy</i>
<i>of his final wishes home to Marie.</i>

437
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,958
l really had to
kind of push back on them.

438
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,104
They were proceeding as if this was
the way things were gonna happen.

439
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,274
Probably thinking that,
you know, l was so grief-stricken...

440
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,205
...that l would just go along with it.

441
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,811
<i>My mission here</i>
<i>is to support the family...</i>

442
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:27,451
<i>...and help them through the process,</i>
<i>and make it easier for her.</i>

443
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,479
That's the first episode, in a way.

444
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,555
Before Pat's body is even cold.

445
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,287
The death didn't just belong
to the family.

446
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,294
This was bigger than the family.

447
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,265
"This is ours," you know.

448
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,938
lt's ours to interpret.

449
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,116
And you will see him again
when a loving God reunites us all...

450
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,811
...with the loved ones
who preceded us in death.

451
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,014
The contrast
of the memorial service...

452
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,353
...should have hit a warning shot
to the military.

453
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,860
You got people out there speaking
in these glittering generalities.

454
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,235
Pat, your family
doesn't have to worry anymore.

455
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:23,169
You are home, you are safe,
and you will not be forgotten.

456
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,177
And then you've got his brother
coming up there.

457
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:33,210
Somebody who's willing to speak
the brutality of that reality for them.

458
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:38,017
He was always giving gifts.
Thanks, Pat.

459
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,117
l didn't write shit
because l'm not a writer.

460
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,321
And l just want to say, it was--

461
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,033
There's a lot of people here, thanks.

462
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:54,229
lt was really amazing
to be his little baby brother.

463
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,906
Yeah, l'm not just gonna sit up here
and break down on you, but....

464
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,974
Thank you for coming.
Pat's a fucking champion...

465
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,886
...and always will be.

466
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,047
Just make no mistake,
he'd want me to say this.

467
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,350
He's not with God, he's fucking dead.
He's not religious, so....

468
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,688
Thanks for your thoughts,
but he's fucking dead.

469
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,530
l don't regret any of that.

470
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,671
You know,
as far as what l was thinking...

471
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,965
...l was just simply miserable,
you know.

472
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,632
l was, you know--
l was sad for my whole my family.

473
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,040
l was sad for my mom, my dad,
Marie, Kevin.

474
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,409
This isn't a production.
lt's my brother's service.

475
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,416
l didn't plan on saying that, it just....

476
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,726
He's not what these people
wished he was.

477
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,559
Everyone grabbed at Pat's death.

478
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,196
Not necessarily just the military,
everybody grabbed at him.

479
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,636
They just chose the wrong family
to try to do it in front of.

480
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,052
Not to say that we always did
the right thing in this house...

481
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,652
...we made lots of mistakes...

482
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:21,587
...but l think that we did make
an attempt to tell the truth.

483
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,321
You know, sometimes you have
to work at that.

484
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:31,201
<i>ln 1976, Patrick and Dannie Tillman</i>
<i>moved to New Almaden...</i>

485
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,462
<i>...a two-road town</i>
<i>near San Jose, California...</i>

486
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:38,631
<i>...where he practiced law</i>
<i>and she worked as a teacher.</i>

487
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,074
Part of the reason
for living out in New Almaden...

488
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:47,547
...was a deliberate decision...

489
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,818
...to set a better environment
for the kids.

490
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:55,322
We discouraged watching TV.

491
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,594
We did the same thing
with the telephone.

492
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:01,060
We had one telephone and it was
right in the middle of the house.

493
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,926
lf you wanted to talk to somebody...

494
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,194
...then you'd talk
right in front of everybody else.

495
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:10,499
So it wasn't like we isolated them,
it's just there were certain priorities...

496
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:15,805
...and it wasn't that difficult
to deprive them for their own good.

497
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:22,175
You know, we did grow up together.
Pat and Kevin were so close in age...

498
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:26,015
...they were only 14 months apart,
so they were together all the time.

499
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,089
They would go to the creek,
the mountains.

500
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,022
l was exhausted by 7
because they were all over the place...

501
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,754
...and l just didn't have
that kind of stamina.

502
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,990
lt was just our own little world.

503
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,159
And we happened to have a very just
and kind leader in Pat.

504
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,670
And it pushed Kevin and myself
to do things...

505
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,242
...that, you know, we probably wouldn't
have normally done.

506
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,175
The boys had that colorful language.

507
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,841
lt just was the way they talked.

508
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:59,545
Well, the F-word
is one of their more popular words...

509
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,726
...and they can use it as an adjective,
a verb, a noun.

510
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,193
They can, you know-- And then other
parts of speech that we don't know.

511
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,993
Yeah, that's true.

512
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,432
They kind of-- They swear a lot.

513
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,697
Did you have rules in the house
about cussing?

514
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,204
Evidently not.

515
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:20,070
l never met Pat, so the only way
that l know Pat Tillman...

516
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,304
...is through what l've heard
from his family.

517
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:28,315
Pat was a pretty typical kid,
but then he also had this gift.

518
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,720
You know, he had this gift.

519
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:35,052
He was a comparatively little guy
that could just really run fast...

520
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,057
...and knock the shit out of people.

521
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,231
<i>We first noticed Pat Tillman when he</i>
<i>scored the game-winning touchdown...</i>

522
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,394
<i>...against lndependence last season,</i>
<i>then did a flip in full pads.</i>

523
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,732
Made it up, l don't know.

524
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,466
Came to me right about the time
l did it. l don't know.

525
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:57,080
He was very low-key about getting
the compliments and the accolades.

526
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,676
lt kind of embarrassed him.

527
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,817
<i>You're always so modest</i>
<i>when l talk to you.</i>

528
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,849
<i>This time,</i>
<i>take some credit for yourself.</i>

529
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,521
<i>You're not gonna do it, are you?</i>

530
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,488
<i>l had a big line</i>
<i>and a great offensive coordinator.</i>

531
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,752
<i>l don't know where he is,</i>
<i>but well-coached.</i>

532
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,429
He wasn't much of a showman.

533
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,188
- <i>Give him the plaque.</i>
- <i>Here you go.</i>

534
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,925
He enjoyed the game. He enjoyed
all the games that he played.

535
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,177
He liked climbing things.

536
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,973
He liked jumping off of things.

537
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,284
He liked taking risks, yeah.
Yeah, he was big on risks.

538
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:44,188
He challenged himself that way.
He wouldn't let me see any of that.

539
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,193
lf you're gonna do that kind of stuff,
do it behind my back.

540
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,841
<i>Pat was given a football scholarship</i>
<i>to Arizona State University...</i>

541
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,135
<i>...where he became</i>
<i>an academic All-American...</i>

542
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,175
<i>...with a 3.8 grade point average.</i>

543
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,871
We never lose at home.
We kicked the shit out of them.

544
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,017
<i>His square-jawed intensity</i>
<i>and long-haired California cool...</i>

545
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,016
<i>...soon made him a local celebrity.</i>

546
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,212
<i>l want you to talk about Patton...</i>

547
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,153
<i>...military leaders</i>
<i>that you kind of tap into...</i>

548
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,453
<i>...for your own,</i>
<i>l guess, abilities on a football field.</i>

549
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,928
<i>You know, Patton's a cool guy.</i>
<i>l like his stuff.</i>

550
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,763
<i>He made some comment one time,</i>
<i>something to the effect of:</i>

551
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,166
<i>"No one ever won a war</i>
<i>dying for their country.</i>

552
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,466
<i>Let the other son of a bitch</i>
<i>die for his."</i>

553
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,975
<i>lt's things like that, it's guys like that,</i>
<i>guys where their attitude</i>--

554
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,476
<i>They're a little bit crazy...</i>

555
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,582
<i>...but it's that craziness</i>
<i>that propels them to greatness.</i>

556
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:45,454
The throw. Shoots it over the middle.
And, whoa, what a hit.

557
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,087
Pat Tillman knocked the helmet
off of lsaac Byrd.

558
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,193
- That was scary.
- Oh, my.

559
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,795
<i>Because he was considered small,</i>
<i>at 5'11"...</i>

560
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,228
<i>...Pat was never expected</i>
<i>to make it in the NFL.</i>

561
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:01,798
<i>But from his very first training camp,</i>
<i>he set the tone for his career.</i>

562
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:10,078
l mean, there are gonna be fights
in training camp.

563
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,510
l got Pitt and Pat Tillman together.

564
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,084
Those two are important to me.
There was no problem.

565
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,915
You know, 9:00 in the morning,
get your ass knocked off...

566
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,091
...l might be mad too.

567
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,021
He would hit you
as hard as he possibly could.

568
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,234
Never even looked at Pat Tillman.
Never even thought--

569
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:37,601
That's a perfect job for Pat Tillman
because he's a little bit free of spirit.

570
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:40,936
<i>To his new teammates,</i>
<i>Pat was a bit of an oddball.</i>

571
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,010
<i>He didn't own a cell phone</i>
<i>or a car...</i>

572
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,081
<i>...and would leave his beach cruiser</i>
<i>in the team parking lot...</i>

573
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,683
<i>...among the Escalades and BMWs.</i>

574
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,715
<i>But to fans, Pat was a rare example</i>
<i>of a public figure...</i>

575
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,824
<i>...who wasn't afraid</i>
<i>to speak his mind.</i>

576
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,960
Why should the fans think
this year's gonna be any different?

577
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,926
You know what? They shouldn't.

578
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,499
We haven't done anything
at this point to prove that we're not--

579
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:08,229
We didn't have a good year last year,
and that's the only thing that matters.

580
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,304
We need to go out
and start winning games.

581
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,477
When we start winning games,
the fans will come out and watch us.

582
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,339
Until that happens, you know,
l wouldn't come out either.

583
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,649
The Cardinals win
and they go to the playoffs.

584
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,342
He liked the physicality of it,
but l think he really liked that feeling...

585
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,887
...of being connected
with the man next to you.

586
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,290
l think he thrived
on that feeling of unity.

587
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:43,138
<i>At the age of 25,</i>
<i>four years into his NFL career...</i>

588
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,831
<i>...Pat married</i>
<i>his high-school sweetheart.</i>

589
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,775
This is very special for me.

590
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,437
lt means a lot that my older brother
is getting married--

591
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,416
<i>Pat first crossed paths</i>
<i>with Marie Ugenti at the age of 4...</i>

592
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,919
<i>...when they played</i>
<i>in the same youth soccer league.</i>

593
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,127
<i>She was his first and only girlfriend.</i>

594
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,931
<i>And even though they would go</i>
<i>to different colleges...</i>

595
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,566
<i>...and he would become</i>
<i>a high-profile athlete...</i>

596
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,898
<i>...Pat remained faithful to Marie</i>
<i>until the end of his life.</i>

597
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,668
As far as an older brother, you couldn't
ask for anything more than him.

598
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:26,707
l mean, he's lights out, he's fantastic.
And to know that he's with Marie...

599
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:30,853
...the greatest girl in the whole world,
it's just money, man.

600
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,852
lt's absolutely money for me.

601
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:36,493
l don't know, l love it, dude.
This is fucking awesome.

602
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,363
To see Pat and Marie get married--
lt was just an awesome day.

603
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,568
l didn't realize that--

604
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,738
You know, what was known
at that point, obviously.

605
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,100
But it was....

606
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,576
l'm glad l didn't. l don't think l would
have had as much fun, that's for sure.

607
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,943
They made this decision,
the three of them...

608
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,849
...Kevin and Pat and Marie.
lt was something they talked about.

609
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:11,119
They kept it from us until after
Pat and Marie were actually married.

610
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:16,397
The boys, they called me on,
actually, Mother's Day of 2002...

611
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,434
...and they told me
that they were going to enlist.

612
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:27,369
And Dannie was not happy
about the whole thing.

613
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,942
She made it known.

614
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:37,146
Members of the family
go back for generations serving.

615
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,948
My father, my father-in-law...

616
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:44,924
...all my uncles,
served in World War ll or Korea.

617
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,987
And, you know,
l talked to the boys a lot...

618
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,292
...about, you know,
the camaraderie of war.

619
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:56,601
And l suppose it concerned me
that l did talk too much about that.

620
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,766
That it became more intriguing to them
than it should've been.

621
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:06,414
Some people thought that, you know,
l could have talked him out of it...

622
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,017
...or asked him not to do it.

623
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:15,224
But that was just never something
l would've done.

624
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:21,355
Somehow or another, Dannie had
a lot more foresight than l did...

625
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,728
...because it dawned on her
right then and there...

626
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,098
...that she cannot deal
with losing one of her sons.

627
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,139
My comment at the time was:

628
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:38,179
"Could you imagine someone seeing
Pat and Kevin coming after them?

629
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,976
l feel bad for those people."

630
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:45,645
So that was a bad call on my part.

631
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,630
<i>We'll never know exactly</i>
<i>why Pat Tillman enlisted.</i>

632
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:05,070
<i>He made a deliberate choice</i>
<i>not to make it a public matter.</i>

633
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,746
<i>But after he died,</i>
<i>an interview surfaced.</i>

634
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,848
<i>Even as athletes, we bitch and moan</i>
<i>every now and again...</i>

635
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,042
<i>...about this or that,</i>
<i>and if we ever just, you know</i>--

636
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,653
<i>Times like this,</i>
<i>you stop and think about just how</i>--

637
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,622
<i>Not only how good we have it, but</i>
<i>what kind of a system we live under...</i>

638
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,557
<i>...what freedoms we're allowed,</i>
<i>and that wasn't built overnight.</i>

639
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,231
<i>And it's kind of</i>--

640
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,196
<i>The flag is a symbol of all that,</i>
<i>the symbol of</i>--

641
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,461
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you just don't think about it</i>--

642
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,198
<i>On the day after 9</i>/ <i>11, the Cardinals</i>
<i>had conducted team interviews...</i>

643
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,433
<i>...so players could comment</i>
<i>on the country...</i>

644
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,440
<i>...in the wake</i>
<i>of the terrorist attacks.</i>

645
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,870
<i>My great-grandfather</i>
<i>was at Pearl Harbor...</i>

646
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,346
<i>...and a lot of my family has given up</i>--
<i>Has gone and fought in wars.</i>

647
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,416
<i>And l really haven't done</i>
<i>a damn thing...</i>

648
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,850
<i>...as far as laying myself</i>
<i>on the line like that.</i>

649
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,524
<i>So l have a great deal of respect</i>
<i>for those that have.</i>

650
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,989
<i>And what the flag stands for.</i>

651
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,759
<i>The interview became known</i>
<i>as Pat's explanation...</i>

652
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:04,331
<i>...for why he dropped everything</i>
<i>and joined the Army...</i>

653
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,260
<i>...even though he wouldn't actually</i>
<i>make his decision...</i>

654
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,371
<i>...for another six months.</i>

655
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,332
<i>lt would be used</i>
<i>to violate his only request...</i>

656
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,446
<i>...that his motivation for enlisting</i>
<i>be kept private.</i>

657
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,778
Pat Tillman
had everything to live for.

658
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,648
All that was missing
was a true sense of purpose.

659
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:29,748
He said he found that
on September 11th, 2001.

660
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,825
Former safety
for the Arizona Cardinals...

661
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,657
...gave up a multimillion-dollar
pro-football deal...

662
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,628
...the day after September 11th.

663
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,301
Tillman explained his decision--

664
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,663
This is what he said
the day after the attacks--

665
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,566
Here's how he explained
his decision--

666
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,401
"To make right," he said,
"what 9<i>l</i>1 1 had made so wrong."

667
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,452
He was a human being...

668
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,558
...and by putting this kind of heroic,
saintly quality to him...

669
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,992
...you're taking away the struggle
of being a human being.

670
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,592
l mean, he had to make choices,
just like we all do.

671
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:16,330
And he tried
to make the right choices.

672
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,006
When he didn't make the right choice,
he was the first person to tell you.

673
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:49,472
The military was not
what Pat expected it to be.

674
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,041
He thought, just like the majority
of people in this country...

675
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,735
...that going into Afghanistan
was the right thing to do.

676
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,346
And then,
of course, once they enlisted...

677
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,576
...the talks started veering
towards going into lraq.

678
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:07,485
And when they were over there,
he didn't like what he saw.

679
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:15,589
<i>ln February 2003,</i>
<i>Pat and Kevin were deployed to lraq.</i>

680
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,435
<i>One month later,</i>
<i>the Rangers were ordered...</i>

681
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:23,094
<i>...to provide perimeter support</i>
<i>for the rescue of Jessica Lynch...</i>

682
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,003
<i>...a supply clerk who had reportedly</i>
<i>engaged the enemy...</i>

683
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,304
<i>...in a fierce firefight</i>
<i>before being taken prisoner.</i>

684
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,344
<i>She showed true courage.</i>

685
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,607
<i>She shot until</i>
<i>she ran out of ammunition.</i>

686
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,717
<i>She's alive, she's being tortured.</i>

687
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,421
<i>Despite the apparent urgency...</i>

688
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:43,889
<i>...the rescue of Jessica Lynch</i>
<i>was inexplicably put on hold.</i>

689
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,858
<i>Russell Baer waited out the delay</i>
<i>on top of a bunker...</i>

690
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,589
<i>...with Pat and his brother Kevin.</i>

691
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,469
Just watching these bombs
and these A-10's strafe the city.

692
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,141
That was the first time l'd heard Pat
in kind of like no-kidding opinion...

693
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,075
...on kind of
what was going on there.

694
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,210
He just said,
"This war is just so fucking illegal."

695
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,442
You know,
just watching this scene unfold...

696
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,746
...you know,
the city's being blown to shit.

697
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,980
<i>Come right, come right.</i>

698
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,560
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>l'm moving to cover our backs.</i>

699
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,762
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>This is oppressive.</i>

700
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,126
<i>Hold it there, please.</i>

701
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,895
lt's pretty clear the Special Ops team
could have essentially...

702
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,074
...walked into the hospital,
picked her up and carried her out...

703
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,937
...and would've been cooperated with
all along the way.

704
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,169
<i>lt would come out later</i>
<i>that Jessica Lynch...</i>

705
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,247
<i>...had neither fired her weapon</i>
<i>nor been tortured...</i>

706
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,178
<i>...and that the inexplicable delay...</i>

707
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,354
<i>...had been to enable a combat</i>
<i>camera crew to record the mission.</i>

708
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,146
- <i>Camera right here?</i>
- <i>Can you smile?</i>

709
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,722
- <i>Can you smile for the family?</i>
- <i>For your folks?</i>

710
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,555
<i>There you go. You're doing great,</i>
<i>Jessica. You're doing wonderful.</i>

711
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,162
lt was a film production.

712
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,162
Jessica Lynch's rescue
was a film production.

713
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,359
We understand that there is video
taken by a combat camera team.

714
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,800
- Can you show us that video?
- Do we have the tape?

715
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,035
Some brave souls put their lives
on the line to make this happen.

716
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,542
Loyal to the creed that they know...

717
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,941
...that they'll never leave
a fallen comrade...

718
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:16,449
...and never embarrass their country.
With that, l'll take your questions.

719
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,315
The media has been
more than complicit.

720
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:23,152
The military has just released new
video this morning of the daring raid.

721
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,022
They wanna take all the complexities
of a real situation...

722
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:30,325
...and reduce them
into a comfortable fable.

723
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,332
lt was a mission one described
as "a midnight ballet."

724
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,368
One that's easy to sort of digest...

725
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:38,268
...and, you know,
consists of good guys and bad guys...

726
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,909
...that are clearly recognizable
from movies.

727
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,806
<i>Saving Private Lynch.</i>

728
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:47,211
<i>Private First Class Jessica Lange,</i>
<i>a 1 9-year-old U.S. Army soldier.</i>

729
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,576
<i>l apologize. lt's Jessica Lynch.</i>

730
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,656
lf you wanna get the public
to cosign something...

731
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,763
...you gotta give them something
that they're willing to cosign.

732
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,092
lt has to be turned into
a morality play.

733
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,633
- American hero.
- American hero.

734
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,828
l do not wanna see dead bodies.

735
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:13,368
l do not wanna see coffins.
l wanna remain comfortable.

736
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,142
Welcome home.

737
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,473
And so, you know, the government
gives them what they want.

738
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,274
The press gives them
what they want.

739
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,561
Pat and Kevin,
when they came back from lraq...

740
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:38,224
...were like,
"This is just 100 percent bullshit."

741
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,828
l think after coming home from lraq,
he was a little disillusioned.

742
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,936
lt was right around
the halfway mark...

743
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:50,375
...and he was in a stage
of looking towards the next step.

744
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,677
<i>Just before Pat was due to return</i>
<i>to combat duty...</i>

745
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,218
<i>...an opportunity arose</i>
<i>that would have saved his life.</i>

746
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,353
One of the NFL teams
had approached his agent...

747
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,618
...and, you know, said that
he would be eligible to get out...

748
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,160
...since he had been
on a combat tour.

749
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,690
<i>ln a back-channel agreement...</i>

750
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,529
<i>...the military said that Pat could be</i>
<i>immediately discharged with honors...</i>

751
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,195
<i>...and could return to his football</i>
<i>career by the following season.</i>

752
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,671
<i>As coach Dave McGinnis</i>
<i>later recalled...</i>

753
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,106
<i>...Pat sought him out</i>
<i>to discuss the secret offer.</i>

754
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,870
When he came in and talked to me--

755
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,015
We talked for about two hours
in my office.

756
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,548
And we talked about some things
that at the time...

757
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,777
...that he asked that l not talk about.

758
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:34,855
He said, "Coach Mac, l'll tell you
some things, but l would prefer--"

759
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,583
And believe me,
l will hold those things forever.

760
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:42,094
Just know this,
that Pat Tillman made a decision...

761
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,757
...based on some very real values.

762
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:50,668
honor, integrity,
dignity, commitment...

763
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,365
...they were not just adjectives
with Pat Tillman...

764
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:56,740
...they were realities in his life...

765
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,609
...and that came through
very loud and clear.

766
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:04,014
He committed for three years and
he was gonna fulfill his commitment.

767
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,679
lt's the same reason why Kevin
didn't leave after Pat was killed.

768
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:12,123
They made a commitment
and they honored that.

769
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:16,623
Did you get the impression that
he planned on returning to football?

770
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,172
Just give me a minute here
because this is....

771
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,300
You know, he had....

772
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,138
That's what he wanted to do...

773
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:36,410
...because one of the last things that
he said to me when we left up there--

774
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,181
You know, l said, "Okay, good luck.
Stay in touch, we'll be--"

775
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,620
And he said, "You know, l'd...."

776
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,816
And then-- And his last--

777
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:48,691
He said, "Coach, l just-- You know,
l wanna come back and play for you."

778
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:59,101
<i>Pat reported for his second tour</i>
<i>of duty in April of 2004.</i>

779
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:03,010
<i>His platoon was sent to Afghanistan</i>
<i>and assigned to carry out...</i>

780
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:07,047
<i>...reconnaissance sweeps</i>
<i>near the Pakistani border.</i>

781
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,619
<i>The Rangers were accompanied</i>
<i>by a group of allied Afghan militia...</i>

782
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,448
<i>...known as AMF soldiers.</i>

783
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,954
<i>Pat was now in charge of a small</i>
<i>fire team including Bryan O'Neal.</i>

784
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:24,600
At that time,
l mean, l was still brand-new.

785
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,961
Being from Arizona...

786
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,435
...l thought a lot of Afghanistan
looked like a lot of Arizona.

787
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,437
The people were a bit different.

788
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,805
<i>These photos were taken</i>
<i>by Pat's platoon...</i>

789
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:42,041
<i>...in the days leading up</i>
<i>to the incident of April 22nd.</i>

790
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,212
<i>On that day,</i>
<i>while traversing the rugged terrain...</i>

791
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,620
<i>...one of the platoon's Humvees</i>
<i>broke down.</i>

792
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:55,354
<i>After six hours stuck in a small village,</i>
<i>the commanders back at base...</i>

793
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:59,968
<i>...ordered the platoon</i>
<i>split in two halves, or "serials."</i>

794
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,072
<i>One serial was to deal</i>
<i>with the downed vehicle...</i>

795

<i>...while the other, including Pat,</i>
<i>Russell Baer and Bryan O'Neal...</i>

796
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,145
<i>...was to carry on with the mission.</i>

797
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:14,781
l remember thinking that it was
a horrible idea to split the convoy.

798
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,852
You know, you're taking half
of your firepower away...

799
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,284
...especially in this area
we were going through.

800
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,755
As soon as we took off,
we basically went into this canyon...

801
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,552
...where the walls were so steep.

802
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,357
<i>442 Zulu.</i>
<i>We're running down the canyon.</i>

803

<i>...his recollection of events</i>
<i>passing through this canyon.</i>

805
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,771
<i>This video shows the actual canyon</i>
<i>where Pat was killed.</i>

806
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:42,638
<i>lt was presented to the Tillmans...</i>

807
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:46,475
<i>...as part of the military's</i>
<i>official explanation of the incident.</i>

808
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:52,144
<i>Okay, we're rolling.</i>
<i>This is April 23rd, 2006. 0551 Zulu.</i>

809
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,789
<i>The Army's investigator</i>
<i>returned to Afghanistan...</i>

810
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,583
<i>...with members of Pat's platoon...</i>

811
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,091
<i>...who walked him through</i>
<i>the sequence of events...</i>

812
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,787
<i>...and laid out the routes</i>
<i>of the two serials.</i>

813
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,896
<i>Traveling along a dry creek bed</i>
<i>at the bottom of a narrow gorge...</i>

814
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:12,040
<i>...Pat, Bryan O'Neal, Russell Baer,</i>
<i>and the rest of Serial 1...</i>

815
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,211
<i>...made it through the canyon</i>
<i>unscathed.</i>

816
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:20,110
<i>At the mouth of the canyon,</i>
<i>they arrived at a small village.</i>

817
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:24,378
There was a rolling hill
with some compounds on it.

818
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:28,182
My squad leader said, "Stop the
vehicles. Get out, stretch your legs.

819
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:32,088
Let's figure out where we're at.
Let's figure out where Serial 2's at."

820
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,761
And that's when we heard
the first initial explosion.

821
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,799
l remember hearing
these explosions go off...

822
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,839
...and l knew they were in the back
of the canyon where we just were.

823
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,239
Which kind of surprised me
because, you know, l didn't realize...

824
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:53,678
...that the second half of the convoy
was following behind us like they were.

825
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,278
<i>ln the steep terrain...</i>

826
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,750
<i>...the two serials had lost</i>
<i>radio contact with each other.</i>

827
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,445
<i>Pat's serial didn't know...</i>

828
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:04,889
<i>...that half a mile behind them</i>
<i>in the canyon, was the second serial.</i>

829
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:11,596
<i>ln the last of five vehicles was</i>
<i>Kevin Tillman and Jason Parsons.</i>

830
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:15,393
We was moving through the canyon
and then there was an explosion.

831
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,369
l mean,
it was a pretty decent explosion.

832
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,975
We seen rocks and dust
and everything fly.

833
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:24,470
People in a vehicle
further up the canyon...

834
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,514
...believed that it was
an RPG attack...

835
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,777
...so they began
lighting up that position.

836
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,456
<i>The Army initially reported</i>
<i>that the Rangers were set upon...</i>

837
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,630
<i>...by an ambush</i>
<i>of up to 20 Taliban fighters.</i>

838
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,992
But in the entire course
of this attack...

839
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,464
...not a single Ranger
was wounded by enemy fire.

840
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:50,298
Not even a bullet hole was found
in any of the equipment.

841
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,576
Even though you go through
all the statements, no one ever saw...

842
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,644
...more than two people at a time
that were attacking them.

843
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,838
And in many cases, they sounded
very unsure of themselves...

844
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,949
...even saying that.

845
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,179
lt's completely conceivable...

846
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:08,346
...that these explosions were maybe
one of our guys AD'd his weapon.

847
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:12,255
AD meaning they discharged
the weapon accidentally.

848
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,724
That's his perspective.
l'll let him have it.

849
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,925
But from my perspective,
there was two mortars that hit...

850
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,694
...there were rounds coming in...

851
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:25,773
...l had one impact 6 to 7 feet
away from me.

852
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,910
<i>ln the end, the existence</i>
<i>of any enemy combatants...</i>

853
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,239
<i>...has been disputed.</i>

854
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,272
<i>What has never been disputed is that,</i>
<i>in this moment...</i>

855
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,578
<i>...the Rangers in Serial 2</i>
<i>unleashed their full firepower...</i>

856
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,152
<i>...up into the canyon walls...</i>

857
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:42,552
<i>...as they continued driving</i>
<i>towards Serial 1.</i>

858
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,852
lt was not a fog of war,
not in my mind at all.

859
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,585
l believe it was a lust to fight.

860
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,232
l don't think these soldiers were scared
when they came out of that canyon.

861
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:53,300
l think they were relieved
they were out of the canyon...

862
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:54,993
...and they just wanted to shoot.

863
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,945
<i>Hearing the explosion</i>
<i>and gun fire...</i>

864
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:08,015
<i>...Serial 1 ran back toward the canyon</i>
<i>to help Serial 2.</i>

865
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,483
l remember seeing Pat, you know.
He yelled at me, "O'Neal, follow me!"

866
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,713
And, you know, l do what l was told.

867
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:16,824
You know, he's my team leader,
l follow him wherever l go.

868
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,655
And l was really surprised
at how quick O'Neal was following Pat.

869
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,389
l mean, he has just as much gear on
as everybody else...

870
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,591
...and he was just keeping up
with him.

871
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:30,398
l remember getting halfway up this hill
and Pat turning around...

872
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,472
...asking Sergeant Weeks,
my squad leader:

873
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,803
"Hey, Sergeant Weeks,
can we take our body armor off?"

874
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,570
And l remember thinking to myself:

875
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,714
"Fuck that.
l am keeping my body armor on."

876
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,384
Pat is wanting to get up there
as quickly as possible.

877
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,280
Tillman was at about this location...

878
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:48,218
...and he asked
if he could drop his body armor...

879
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:51,450
...and start pursuing up this hill.

880
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,424
l told him no.

881
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:58,890
At that time, l noticed there was
an Afghani militia man with us.

882
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,696
He jumped in with us
and we just started running.

883
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:07,067
<i>At the moment Pat's fire team</i>
<i>reached these rocks...</i>

884
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:11,714
<i>...the lead vehicle of Serial 2 emerged</i>
<i>from the canyon below them.</i>

885
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:18,043
<i>The vehicle had left Kevin, Jason</i>
<i>and the rest of the convoy behind.</i>

886
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:21,223
<i>lt pulled into the clearing,</i>
<i>and the soldiers onboard took aim...</i>

887
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:24,359
<i>...directly up at Pat's fire team.</i>

888
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,362
<i>The AMF soldier</i>
<i>standing next to Pat...</i>

889
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,328
<i>...was shot eight times in the chest</i>
<i>and dropped dead.</i>

890
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,330
<i>Facing the gentleman,</i>
<i>and l approached</i>--

891
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,628
People started to yell, "Cease fire!"

892
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:38,170
Then people said, "Hey, l think
they're fucking shooting at us."

893
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:43,539
And then, you know, we knew,
no shit, that they were shooting at us.

894
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:49,784
A .50 cal can shoot
900 rounds a minute...

895
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,752
...and it could have been no less than
a minute that they were shooting at us.

896
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,853
You could see on the rock
all the marks from the rounds...

897
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,155
...all except the spot
where l was lying.

898
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,993
l just remember thinking,
"l'm gonna die."

899
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,896
And, you know, asking Pat,
"What are we gonna do?

900
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:11,267
How are we gonna get out of this?"
And he said, "l've got an idea."

901
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,637
He popped a smoke grenade
and threw it...

902
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:19,781
...and they stopped shooting at us.

903
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:25,277
And after they stopped shooting at us,
you know, me and Pat stood up...

904
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,656
...let our hearts slow down
for a second.

905
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,985
l remember looking at Pat asking him,
"How could that happen?

906
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,889
How did they not see us?"

907
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:36,259
And, you know, he couldn't
answer me, he didn't know.

908
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:40,396
l was actually more afraid for the guys
that had just got done shooting at us...

909
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,798
...that they were gonna
get in trouble.

910
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,298
<i>The soldiers didn't get in trouble...</i>

911
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,476
<i>...because the military</i>
<i>always maintained...</i>

912
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,612
<i>...that what happened next</i>
<i>transpired in only four seconds...</i>

913
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,373
<i>...during the confusion of combat.</i>

914
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,718
For years, we get this story...

915
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:59,820
...that Pat was shot
from probably 200, 300 yards away.

916
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,491
They were going
about 25 to 35 miles an hour...

917
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,683
...firing wildly to the right...

918
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:10,059
...and Pat and this Afghan were just
an unfortunate consequence...

919
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:12,234
...of people being excited.

920
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:16,428
But Bryan O'Neal has said,
in no uncertain terms that...

921
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,107
...that was not the case.

922
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:22,334
Today was the first day l've ever
actually seen this PowerPoint.

923
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:27,112
lt's really interesting to see
from this perspective now.

924
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:36,581
l don't find this video accurate
because it depicts, on his account...

925
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,421
...that they were moving
continuously...

926
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,756
...through the valley
where they were driving.

927
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,795
ln actuality, from my memory...

928
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,403
...l remember them stopping and firing
on two occasions.

929
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,840
What he's saying here
is a complete lie.

930
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:58,004
The driver took them
from about a hundred yards away...

931
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,240
...over to a better location
to kill them.

932
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,885
Now they're about 40 yards away.

933
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:08,849
You know, they stopped
and then drove forward...

934
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,720
...and then reengaged us,
dismounted...

935
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,726
...and then started reengaging
us again.

936
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,962
At that point,
l thought we were all gonna die.

937
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,998
And....

938
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:29,076
l remember putting my weapon on fire,
and having my finger on the trigger...

939
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:31,508
...and knowing
these are my buddies down there...

940
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,478
...but knowing that they're gonna
kill us and kill everybody.

941
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:38,484
And l was, you know, a second away
from just loading them up...

942
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,179
...just killing them all,
and l could have done it.

943
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:46,560
l started to say a prayer out loud,
you know, and it was something like:

944
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:51,562
"Oh, God, please, if you can help us
out of this situation...

945
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,362
...you know, l'll be very grateful...

946
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:59,507
...and l'll do what l can to repay you
for this debt that l will owe you."

947
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:05,079
And l remember Pat saying,
"O'Neal, quit praying.

948
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,977
You know,
God is not the one to help you now.

949
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,251
This is reality,
this is what we need to focus on.

950
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,547
l don't want you
to go into some la-la land...

951
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,554
...not pay attention
and then get killed."

952
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,767
l was actually grateful
for him to say that.

953
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:30,303
l was really trying to put my focus
somewhere else and not keep it here.

954
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:34,866
Pat, he saved my life.

955
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,970
All of a sudden,
they started shooting at us again...

956
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:42,174
...and l just remember Pat,
you know, yelling his name.

957
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,613
"l'm Pat Tillman.

958
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,846
l'm Pat fucking Tillman,
why are you shooting at me?"

959
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:54,226
Pat's last words were, repeatedly,
"l'm Pat fucking Tillman."

960
01:03:55,631 --> 01:04:00,091
And that was after he got lit up
by the machine gun the first time.

961
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:06,606
He's flat on the ground,
sitting on the ground, he was hurt.

962
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:13,747
And l suspect
he was a bit disappointed...

963
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,078
...that his own team
is shooting at him.

964
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:23,623
And l imagine that those comments
of his, "l'm Pat fucking Tillman"...

965
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,260
...he said while looking
right at them...

966
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:31,263
...with a face that would make
most people nervous.

967
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:43,803
l remember hearing the sound
of a drinking fountain.

968
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,571
Like, when you press the button...

969
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,750
...to get water out of the drinking
fountain, the sound it makes.

970
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,252
And l just look over at my side
and l see this blood...

971
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:55,390
...pouring down this rock
that l'm sitting behind.

972
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,287
He-- His head was gone.

973
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,822
Completely gone.

974
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,001
And l take my helmet off
and l throw it against the ground...

975
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:10,138
...and then l kind of black out.

976
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:21,578
l just heard this guttural scream.

977
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:26,616
And l automatically thought,
"Someone's dead."

978
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,255
lt's the first thing l had.

979
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:33,019
And l caught Dannie about seven,
eight feet outside her door...

980
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,754
...and she was collapsing,
and l caught her...

981
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,762
...and she had a telephone
in her hand.

982
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,868
One sad thing,
and l'll never forget this...

983
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:45,473
...but she went
and got a picture of Patrick...

984
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:50,044
...and she had this picture
and she just kept saying:

985
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,511
"April the 22nd, 2004.

986
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:58,710
April the 22nd, Pat is gone.

987
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,754
April the 22nd--"

988
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:09,126
l was with Kevin when he found out
Pat had been killed.

989
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,858
He got out of the vehicle...

990
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:17,529
...and you could see there was a
million things going through his head.

991
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,607
There was absolute horror
and shock...

992
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:25,713
...and l remember him screaming
several times.

993
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:29,715
l remember him taking his helmet off
and slamming it on the ground.

994
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,417
l remember...

995
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,556
...our medic, Doc...

996
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:39,159
...kind of coming up to him, you know,
saying, "Hey, give me your weapon."

997
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:47,425
And then l saw him go over to his
brother's body and he just sat there.

998
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,174
l remember seeing Kevin
in his Humvee...

999
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,675
...and l was told by Colonel Bailey...

1000
01:06:56,879 --> 01:07:00,440
...to not tell him
Pat was killed by friendly fire.

1001
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:02,446
You know,
"Your career is on the line.

1002
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:06,451
Do not tell Kevin
exactly what happened."

1003
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:12,458
<i>Kevin had arrived on the scene</i>
<i>10 minutes after the shooting.</i>

1004
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,660
<i>He was immediately quarantined</i>
<i>and the rest of the platoon...</i>

1005
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,130
<i>...was ordered not to tell him</i>
<i>what had happened.</i>

1006
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:25,735
<i>Russell Baer was put on a plane</i>
<i>with Kevin.</i>

1007
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,808
<i>He was ordered</i>
<i>to escort Pat's remains back home...</i>

1008
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:33,209
<i>...and to present the family with flags</i>
<i>on behalf of the country.</i>

1009
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:39,586
That was a difficult experience for me.
Just with everything that l knew...

1010
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:44,218
...and l was scared
about what was to come afterwards.

1011
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,658
You know, l was just--
l was afraid for it all.

1012
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,561
l mean, it was the first time
l'd ever met Pat's mom...

1013
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:59,229
...and she saw how difficult it was
for me and she....

1014
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:07,678
She grabbed my hand,
kind of just patted my hand a little bit.

1015
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:12,142
The real test of a man is not when he
plays the role he wants for himself...

1016
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:15,414
...but when he plays the role
destiny has for him.

1017
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:19,219
So when that little voice in your head
tells you not to do the easy things...

1018
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,692
...but the right things...

1019
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:26,095
...it's Pat. Right in your ear, man.
lt's Pat.

1020
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,034
Right after Pat died...

1021
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:37,110
...we probably felt the most sense of
comfort from people from the military.

1022
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:42,683
And we were very honored to see
that General Kensinger was present.

1023
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,155
l wanna thank
anybody involved in the military...

1024
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,756
...especially the Rangers.
Outstanding human beings--

1025
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,360
Then to find out that they were
the very people to lie to us...

1026
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,155
...it's outrageous.

1027
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:58,527
l don't know a lot about
what happened to Pat...

1028
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:02,461
...but the last few days
have not been very pleasant.

1029
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:08,538
lt's only been a week
and it ain't getting any better.

1030
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,976
lt's a horrible thing to lie.

1031
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:16,743
lt's an atrocity that they would take a
young man with honorable intentions...

1032
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,214
...who served his country...

1033
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,752
...and lie about how he died
to promote a war.

1034
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:24,756
To use him as a political--
A propaganda tool, basically.

1035
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,655
That is immoral.

1036
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:36,901
<i>The five shooters never gave a</i>
<i>credible explanation for their actions.</i>

1037
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,165
<i>But by the time</i>
<i>the Tillmans had unredacted...</i>

1038
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,343
<i>...the entire box of documents...</i>

1039
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,536
<i>...they understood that the deception</i>
<i>about their son's death...</i>

1040
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,910
<i>...went much higher</i>
<i>than the soldiers on the ground.</i>

1041
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:49,379
Pat Tillman has been killed.

1042
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:52,247
Forty-five minutes later,
he's been killed by fratricide.

1043
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:56,356
"Oh, shit. What do we do now?"

1044
01:09:56,725 --> 01:10:00,422
"Okay, let's spin this
as a heroic action.

1045
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:03,757
We'll turn his dead body
into a recruiting poster."

1046
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:09,233
They destroyed his uniform,
his body armor, his helmet, his diary.

1047
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:12,565
Every piece of evidence
that could ever be used...

1048
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,109
...to explain what happened
is eliminated.

1049
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,747
You just don't do shit
without telling your superior officer.

1050
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:26,678
"Oh, l'm gonna go burn Pat's uniform."

1051
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:27,878
No.

1052
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,384
You don't piss without permission...

1053
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,659
...so this goes pretty damn high.

1054
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,462
<i>Once the Tillmans</i>
<i>shifted their focus...</i>

1055
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,329
<i>...to the higher-ups responsible</i>
<i>for the cover-up...</i>

1056
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,767
<i>...the lead investigator</i>
<i>assigned to their case...</i>

1057
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:47,101
<i>...began publicly suggesting</i>
<i>that it was time to move on.</i>

1058
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:51,278
<i>l don't know. These people,</i>
<i>they have a hard time letting it go.</i>

1059
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,741
<i>lt may be</i>
<i>because of their religious beliefs.</i>

1060
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,188
- <i>l don't know how an atheist thinks.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

1061
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:02,914
<i>But l can only imagine that,</i>
<i>that would be pretty tough.</i>

1062
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,752
<i>Right.</i>

1063
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,554
<i>lf you're an atheist,</i>
<i>then you don't believe in anything?</i>

1064
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:11,995
<i>lf you die, what is there to go to?</i>
<i>Nothing. You're worm dirt.</i>

1065
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,567
<i>lt's pretty hard</i>
<i>to get your head around that.</i>

1066
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,796
<i>So you suspect that's the reason</i>
<i>why this thing's dragging on.</i>

1067
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:21,465
<i>l think so. There's not a whole lot</i>
<i>of trust in the system.</i>

1068
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:24,646
- <i>Right.</i>
- <i>Or faith in the system.</i>

1069
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:32,752
lt was my understanding at the time
that this investigation is over...

1070
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,823
...that this has been closed...

1071
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:38,653
...they're not gonna give me the truth,
it's a done deal.

1072
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:44,322
And that being said, there's not much
l can do to force the issue.

1073
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,827
So l wrote them a letter.

1074
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,901
l just went through and blew out...

1075
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:53,336
...just about everything
they considered to be a fact.

1076
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:56,875
And explained to them
why that is a lie...

1077
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:02,039
...and concluded by telling them
that l have low regard for them.

1078
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,845
l just wanted to tell somebody off.

1079
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:16,488
<i>Unbeknownst to Pat Sr., the Army</i>
<i>considered the wording of his letter...</i>

1080
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,896
<i>...to be a formal accusation</i>
<i>of criminal misconduct.</i>

1081
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,667
<i>This automatically initiated</i>
<i>a new investigation...</i>

1082
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,567
<i>...by the inspector general's office.</i>

1083
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,298
Thank you for being here today.

1084
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:32,003
lt's kind of obnoxious that the letter
did have the impact that it did.

1085
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:37,208
lt's like, wait a minute, my mom has
been working her ass off for years...

1086
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:40,820
...and if she knew all she had to do
was tell you to go fuck yourself...

1087
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,288
...and you'd actually do your job,
l'm sure she would have done that...

1088
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:45,926
...two and a half years before.

1089
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:50,663
<i>After an 1 8-month inquiry,</i>
<i>the Army secretary announced...</i>

1090
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:54,302
<i>...that the military was finally ready</i>
<i>to assign blame.</i>

1091
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,267
We present to you the results
of the Wallace lnvestigation...

1092
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,703
...into the tragic death
of Corporal Pat Tillman.

1093
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:03,605
l'm on my way to an anniversary
in Las Vegas.

1094
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,916
l get a phone call from my wife
that says, "Hey, you're on CNN."

1095
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:14,182
Up first, new information
about who bungled the initial probe...

1096
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,948
...into the friendly-fire death...

1097
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,184
...of Army Ranger
and former football star Pat Tillman.

1098
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:23,631
Let's go to the news conference now
over at the Pentagon. Let's listen in.

1099
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,824
General Wallace did find
a senior official...

1100
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,970
...Lieutenant General Kensinger,
the senior leader in...

1101
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:34,404
...the administrative chain of command
for the 75th Ranger Regiment...

1102
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,601
...found him guilty of deception.

1103
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:42,346
General Kensinger was the captain
of that ship and his ship ran aground.

1104
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:44,348
lt ran aground because he failed--

1105
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:48,489
Devastating. Devastating to be called
the villain in the process...

1106
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,854
...or the captain
who ran his ship aground...

1107
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:56,224
...and let all his soldiers down.

1108
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,532
<i>General Kensinger</i>
<i>was the public face of the Army...</i>

1109
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,293
<i>...in the weeks after Pat's death.</i>

1110
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,403
l will not be taking questions.

1111
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:06,233
<i>The Army said that Kensinger knew</i>
<i>about the fratricide...</i>

1112
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,275
<i>...when he attended</i>
<i>Pat's memorial service.</i>

1113
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:12,572
<i>He would be stripped</i>
<i>of his third star.</i>

1114
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,043
<i>But as a reporter noted...</i>

1115
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:17,184
<i>...there may have be another reason</i>
<i>why Kensinger took the fall.</i>

1116
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:20,446
--yet, all the blame
falls on General Kensinger.

1117
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,385
l'm just trying to make sense of that.

1118
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,754
He happens to be retired,
is there a coincidence there?

1119
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,117
The fact that he--

1120
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:30,628
He's the only one
who's really being singled out.

1121
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,930
l believe the buck stops
with Kensinger.

1122
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,263
He was the senior leader
in the chain of command for--

1123
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,337
l don't think the buck stops
at Kensinger.

1124
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,374
There's no way this cover-up started at
the three-star level. lt had to go higher.

1125
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,205
You look at what Kensinger's role--

1126
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,439
l don't think Kensinger would have
been inclined to cover it up...

1127
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:48,877
...if he wasn't ordered to.

1128
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:50,551
--if he performed his duty--

1129
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:51,810
l mean, he was culpable.

1130
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:55,421
l mean, he could've easily
picked up the phone and called us...

1131
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,525
...you know, but this is their life,
this is their career...

1132
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:02,857
...and they're terrified of losing
what they've worked so hard for.

1133
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:06,090
My wife says
l'm too much of a soldier.

1134
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:09,828
l've been doing it, you know,
since 17.

1135
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:14,202
When somebody tells me something,
tells me to go do something, you say--

1136
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:19,210
ln the Army, you salute and, you know,
about-face, and go get it done.

1137
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:28,288
To think that, you know, this is how,
you know, you get treated.

1138
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,625
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

01:16:56,545 --> 01:17:01,107
The P4 memo states they must
warn the president about this...

1158
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:05,776
...because they'll be giving speeches
and they shouldn't be embarrassed...

1159
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:10,482
...if the circumstances of Pat's death
become public.

1160
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,590
He set aside a career in athletics--

1161
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,990
<i>The warning seemed to work.</i>

1162
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,598
<i>ln a speech</i>
<i>given two days before the memorial...</i>

1163
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,826
<i>...the president avoided</i>
<i>the very details of Pat's death...</i>

1164
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,868
<i>...that his speechwriters</i>
<i>had requested.</i>

1165
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:28,569
Friends say that this young man saw
the images of September the 11th...

1166
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:32,543
...and seeing that evil,
he felt called to defend America.

1167
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:41,786
Our suspicions in the beginning were
very much validated by that P4 memo.

1168
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:44,749
These generals had plenty of time...

1169
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,363
...to make sure that we, as a family,
were told the truth...

1170
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:51,794
...but they chose not to tell us.

1171
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:56,164
<i>The P4 memo clearly showed...</i>

1172
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:59,966
<i>...that while America was being told</i>
<i>the valorous account of Pat's death...</i>

1173
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:03,269
<i>...the entire chain of command</i>
<i>not only knew it was a lie...</i>

1174
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:06,003
<i>...but were urgently concerned</i>
<i>about the implications...</i>

1175
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:08,239
<i>...should the truth get out.</i>

1176
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:17,652
<i>Armed with this new evidence...</i>

1177
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,726
<i>...the family was able to take</i>
<i>their case above the military...</i>

1178
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:25,960
<i>...and in April 2007, the House of</i>
<i>Representatives convened hearings...</i>

1179
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:30,229
<i>...to investigate whether there had</i>
<i>been a cover-up in the Tillman case.</i>

1180
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:34,968
<i>The first testimony given</i>
<i>was from the man...</i>

1181
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:38,169
<i>...who had remained silent</i>
<i>throughout the ordeal...</i>

1182
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,008
<i>...Pat's brother, Kevin Tillman.</i>

1183
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,283
<i>Even after discovering</i>
<i>that the entire platoon...</i>

1184
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,753
<i>...had been lying to him</i>
<i>about the fratricide...</i>

1185
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:53,860
<i>...Kevin had insisted on completing</i>
<i>the full term of his enlistment.</i>

1186
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:57,861
<i>Once he got out of the Army,</i>
<i>Kevin went into seclusion...</i>

1187
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:02,002
<i>...refusing, until now,</i>
<i>to speak publicly about his brother.</i>

1188
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,909
My name is Kevin Tillman.

1189
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:11,136
Two days ago
marked the third anniversary...

1190
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:14,509
...of the death of my older brother,
Pat Tillman. Spera, Afghanistan.

1191
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:17,184
To our family and friends,
it was a devastating loss.

1192
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,819
To the nation,
it was a moment of disorientation.

1193
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,353
To the military, it was a nightmare.

1194
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:26,152
But to others within the government,
it appears to have been an opportunity.

1195
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:31,293
A terrible tragedy was transformed
into an inspirational message...

1196
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:35,493
...that served, instead, to support
the nation's foreign-policy wars.

1197
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,572
After the truth of Pat's death
was partially revealed...

1198
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,267
...the Army was now left with the task
of briefing our family...

1199
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:45,412
...and answering our questions.

1200
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,913
With any luck, our family
would sink quietly into our grief...

1201
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:52,644
...and the whole unsavory episode
would be swept under the rug.

1202
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:56,449
However, they miscalculated
our family's reaction.

1203
01:19:56,992 --> 01:20:00,120
Through the amazing strength
and perseverance of my mother...

1204
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,592
...the most amazing woman
on earth...

1205
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:06,899
...our family has managed to have
multiple investigations conducted.

1206
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:10,765
However, while each investigation
gathered more information...

1207
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:14,100
...the mountain of evidence was
never used to arrive at an honest...

1208
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,607
...or even sensible conclusion.

1209
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,370
That is why we ask Congress...

1210
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,071
...as a sovereign representative
of the whole people...

1211
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,808
...to investigate Pat's death.

1212
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:27,250
Anything less than the truth
is a betrayal of those values...

1213
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:31,687
...that all soldiers who have fought
for this nation have sought to uphold.

1214
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:33,417
Thank you for your time.

1215
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,327
Thank you very much
for your testimony.

1216
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,897
Ms. Tillman, l know he was speaking
for both of you.

1217
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,692
ls there anything you want to add?

1218
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:42,301
l would like to say...

1219
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,472
...we have been asked,
over and over again:

1220
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:49,042
"Well, what can we do for your family?
How can we appease you?"

1221
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,075
And it makes me sick.

1222
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:53,474
lt's not about our family.

1223
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:57,118
Our family will never be satisfied.
We'll never have Pat back.

1224
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:01,653
But what is so outrageous
is this isn't about Pat.

1225
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,655
This is about
what they did to a nation.

1226
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,828
Pat died for this country.

1227
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,997
He believed it was a great country
that had a system that worked.

1228
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,894
lt's not perfect,
no one has ever said that...

1229
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:17,902
...but to write these glorious tales
is really a disservice to Pat...

1230
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:20,404
...and to all the other soldiers.

1231
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,839
You're diminishing
their true heroism.

1232
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:26,207
lt may not be pretty, it may not be
like out of a John Wayne movie...

1233
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:31,613
...but that's not what war is all about.
lt's ugly, it's bloody, it's painful.

1234
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,448
Everyone should understand
what's going on.

1235
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:39,093
And we shouldn't have smokescreens
thrown in our face.

1236
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:41,719
Thank you.

1237
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:48,729
Pat Tillman was the most famous
enlisted man in the military.

1238
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:54,303
Pat Tillman is killed.
lt's obvious that it was fratricide.

1239
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:59,811
The idea, the very idea, that anyone
in that chain of command...

1240
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:07,745
...would dare keep this information
from anyone above them...

1241
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,753
...is absolutely inconceivable.

1242
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:14,155
Pat Tillman received a letter
congratulating him on his enlistment...

1243
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:19,032
...under the signature
of Donald Rumsfeld.

1244
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:22,834
The Secretary of Defense didn't
give me a congratulations letter...

1245
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,767
...whenever l joined the Army.

1246
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:29,905
Not only did Rumsfeld write a letter
to Pat right after he enlisted...

1247
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:34,844
...he also sent a high-priority e-mail
to the secretary of the Army...

1248
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,486
...saying that this guy is very special,
we need to keep an eye on him.

1249
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:43,319
<i>At the urging of the Tillmans,</i>
<i>the investigating committee...</i>

1250
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,892
<i>...requested testimony</i>
<i>from the recipients of the P4 memo...</i>

1251
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:51,623
<i>...as well as Secretary Rumsfeld</i>
<i>and General Richard Myers.</i>

1252
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:55,166
We finally were face to face
with the highest generals in the land.

1253
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:58,965
You know,
the former Secretary of Defense.

1254
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:01,699
And then we also had people
that have the power...

1255
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,844
...to make these guys accountable.

1256
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:11,508
General Abizaid, let me start with you.
When did you receive this memo?

1257
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:17,618
On the 29th, General McChrystal
sent his message...

1258
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,454
...and it went to my headquarters
in Tampa...

1259
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:23,460
...and it was not retransmitted...

1260
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:28,864
...for reasons of difficulties with our
systems within the headquarters...

1261
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,038
...until the 6th at the earliest--

1262
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:34,402
Yeah, yeah.
General Abizaid didn't get the fax...

1263
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,510
...and there was a mix-up at the office.
That's a good one.

1264
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:41,614
Probably the 6th. lt's a guess.
l can't be sure exactly of the date--

1265
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:45,513
Abizaid is responsible for the entire
Middle East and North Africa...

1266
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,517
...and this guy's not gonna
be informed?

1267
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,849
Well, General Myers,
let's turn to you.

1268
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:52,356
<i>The other generals recounted</i>
<i>similar stories.</i>

1269
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,687
l can't tell you.
l don't know how l knew.

1270
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,888
To the best of my knowledge,
l've never seen this P4.

1271
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:01,694
First of all, on the message,
on the P4, l was an info addressee...

1272
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:04,667
...which is not
the primary addressee--

1273
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,239
<i>ln the next three hours,</i>
<i>the committee would hear...</i>

1274
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:11,674
<i>...some variation of the phrase</i>
<i>"l don't recall," 82 times.</i>

1275
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,869
l just don't know.

1276
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:17,518
<i>lncredibly, this urgent warning had</i>
<i>somehow slipped through the cracks.</i>

1277
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,085
There's an interesting thing
about the P4 that says:

1278
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:24,247
"Deliver during normal duty hours."
And so, again--

1279
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,858
lt was very disappointing.

1280
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,858
That's not even the word,
we were angry.

1281
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,928
All the generals were lying.

1282
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:33,123
They should've been called
on a lot of things and they weren't.

1283
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,359
l thought this was
an oversight committee.

1284
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,303
To me, an oversight committee...

1285
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:39,769
...is someone that does
a bit of investigation.

1286
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,737
lt's not a cheerleading outfit.

1287
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:44,138
l believe
this is appropriately handled...

1288
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:47,371
...and those who made errors
were held accountable.

1289
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:52,019
Ninety-nine point nine percent
of the military do an outstanding job...

1290
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,018
...and l thank you
for setting an example.

1291
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:59,489
These folks were held accountable.
ls that correct, General Myers?

1292
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,254
General? All generals?

1293
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,227
From what l understand,
that's correct.

1294
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:09,028
You know, a lot of politics
is theatrical wrestling, you know...

1295
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:13,264
...which, behind the scenes it's like,
"Okay, let's don't get anybody hurt."

1296
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,842
Mr. Secretary, thank you
for being with us today.

1297
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,839
How and when did you learn
that Corporal Tillman had been killed?

1298
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:25,451
l don't recall precisely
how l learned that he was killed.

1299
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:27,913
Okay.

1300
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:32,022
Before he did so,
were you aware that President Bush...

1301
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,252
...was going to reference
Corporal Tillman...

1302
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,692
...in a correspondents' dinner speech
on May 1st?

1303
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:38,559
No.

1304
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:41,627
lt was embarrassing to watch.

1305
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,895
l have no recollection
of discussing it--

1306
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:46,403
These guys didn't have
the ammunition...

1307
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:50,567
...to cross-examine him
and catch him in a lie.

1308
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:54,277
Well, let me conclude the hearing
by just indicating the facts...

1309
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:58,441
...that General Myers and General
Brown knew at the end of April.

1310
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,280
General Abizaid learned on May 6th.

1311
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,718
Secretary Rumsfeld learned
on May 20th.

1312
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:05,882
Could l correct--?
Sir, could l make a point here?

1313
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:07,618
Who? Yes, Mr. Secretary?

1314
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,229
l wanna make sure
it's precisely accurate.

1315
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:15,266
l do not believe l testified
that l learned on May 20th, and if l--

1316
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,633
lf that impression's been left,
l don't want that left.

1317
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,071
My testimony is that
l just simply do not know...

1318
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:24,871
...when l first learned
of the possibility of fratricide.

1319
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,979
- l appreciate that correction.
- Thank you.

1320
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,342
- And, sir, if l may?
- Yeah.

1321
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:32,452
l also wanted to make sure
that the 6th is a logical day.

1322
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,554
- lt's not the day.
- Okay.

1323
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:39,216
lt's the best that my staff and l
could come to the conclusion--

1324
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:42,658
Well, you were all very busy.
There was no question about it.

1325
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:46,322
Sir, one other thing,
if l could interrupt to also correct.

1326
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:51,369
Your statement was that
l knew about the friendly fire.

1327
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:54,599
l knew that there was an investigation
ongoing...

1328
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:56,674
...about the potential for friendly fire.

1329
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:59,142
That's goes for me too.
That's exactly right.

1330
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:02,043
- And for me, as well.
- Okay.

1331
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,680
At the point that
they let Abizaid off the hook...

1332
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,013
...that's the point where
Dannie knew...

1333
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,850
...you know, that this is as far
as it was gonna go.

1334
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,047
Thank you, sir.

1335
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:15,889
That concludes our business and
the committee hearing is adjourned.

1336
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:32,871
On the way out
of the congressional hearing...

1337
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,345
...this congressman,
he squats down next to me...

1338
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,711
...and he holds out his hand
to shake my hand...

1339
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,513
...and he just wanted to tell me
that he's proud of me...

1340
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:42,883
...and he's proud of my son.

1341
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:45,588
l just said, "Get out of here.
Get away from me."

1342
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,421
He would not go away,
he wanted to keep talking.

1343
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:52,464
l pulled my hand away from him,
l said, "Get out of here, right now.

1344
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:53,793
Get away from me."

1345
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,542
Where does this stuff end?

1346
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:06,279
lt's been four years.

1347
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:11,647
None of the actors in this matter
have been held accountable.

1348
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,255
But that's certainly no fault
of Dannie's.

1349
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,655
Pat would be nothing but unbelievably
proud for her, you know.

1350
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:23,422
l mean, she took it
as far as she could take it.

1351
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:26,657
She did everything in her power
to fight for Pat.

1352
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,859
And l mean,
she knocked it out of the park.

1353
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:33,201
Unfortunately, the fucking government
moved the fence back, and it--

1354
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:35,968
You know, that was it.

1355
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,711
lt's about all l can do at this point.
We've sort of, you know--

1356
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:43,110
The questioning has sort of
run its course.

1357
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:48,855
l guess l held out hope that at
the last hour we would get answers...

1358
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:52,458
...but, no, that's not what happened.

1359
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:59,933
l don't think there's much else
that can be done.

1360
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,351
The be all and the end all...

1361
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:24,013
...is not whether or not
Congress follows through.

1362
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:28,557
Like it or not, there's a public
dimension to Pat Tillman...

1363
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:30,492
...and it ain't gonna go away.

1364
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:36,202
That's a dangerous thing
to fool around with, though.

1365
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:40,663
lt's dangerous
to lionize people like Pat.

1366
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:44,209
When people who are attracted
to the mystique of Pat Tillman...

1367
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:47,540
...begin to actually study
who Pat Tillman was...

1368
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:50,274
...they're gonna find out
that this story doesn't fit...

1369
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:53,249
...into something that's all tidy
and mythic.

1370
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:00,487
The danger of something like this...

1371
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:03,823
...is it's an opportunity
for reality to break through.

1372
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:07,057
People start asking questions...

1373
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:10,669
...and then all of the sudden,
the Tillman story changes.

1374
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:18,870
l've talked about it with my dad,
actually, and it was just like:

1375
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,982
"lt'd be really neat to have a statue of
Pat where he's laughing his ass off."

1376
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,446
You wanna make him a myth?

1377
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:29,384
Go ahead and make him a myth,
just be accurate with it.

1378
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:32,291
You know, if he could walk on water
in these myths...

1379
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:34,859
...then let him have a beer
every once in a while...

1380
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:37,929
...and let him hang out with friends
and let him be gracious...

1381
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:40,726
...and let him be sensitive
and let him be funny...

1382
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:43,870
...and let him be all the things
that he was.

1383
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:46,397
When l talk about Pat--

1384
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:50,008
And everybody is sort of on the same
page, at least, you know, the family.

1385
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:53,738
That when you talk about Pat, he's
sort of like sitting in the room with you.

1386
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:57,679
l mean, and that's such a--
That says so much about him.

1387
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:02,219
l can conjure his face,
l can conjure his laughter.

1388
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:06,325
You know, he just had this quality
to him that he so loved life...

1389
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:12,056
...and he would want us to,
you know, move on, move forward.

1390
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:16,201
l feel like, at least l've done
what l can for him.

1391
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:19,771
And now, it's just the idea
of just kind of moving on...

1392
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:24,502
...and just kind of bringing him
with us, sort of.

1393
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:31,810
A few more seconds.

1394
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:38,956
- That's it, we're done.
- All right.
