1
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,382
France. May, 1940.

2
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:25,797
Come on.

3
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:29,661
Come on.

4
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:37,428
We're ok. Get down.

5
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,989
We're .

6
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:43,287
Where the hell is he?

7
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,320
Shut up.

8
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:50,760
Get down.

9
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,008
Come on.

10
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:56,176
Watch out for rocks.

11
00:01:57,522 --> 00:02:00,038
We are finished.

12
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:02,121
Be still. We're fine.

13
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,719
Come on, Reines.

14
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,843
Come on, Reines.

15
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:17,442
Is he?

16
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:19,697
Silence. Quiet.

17
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:25,210
What we do, Smithy?

18
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,461
Watch the rocks.

19
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:32,761
Easy.

20
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,658
Come on, get up.

21
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,565
I'm coming!

22
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,659
Cover me.

23
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:05,830
oh Christ!

24
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:07,783
Well, my friend.

25
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,519
Here they come.

26
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,255
Cover us.

27
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:15,334
- We gotta go.
- Shut up, yes.

28
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:18,415
Watch, I'm on it.

29
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:22,495
- Here they come.
- Throw him.

30
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:29,439
At 11:00 o'clock.

31
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,620
Grenade! get down!

32
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:53,568
Come on, now. Come on.

33
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,733
Come on, get moving.

34
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,746
Come on in silence.

35
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,539
We lost. We will not die.
We're fuckin dead.

36
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,492
Shut up.

37
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,052
Get your rifle up. Get your rifle up!

38
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:41,263
Alright...Listen, we have
back 12 miles to get to the coast.

39
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:44,431
As we see a boat ride.

40
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:47,511
Gotta keep our head boys,
don't lose it now

41
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:49,334
We've come too far.

42
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:50,853
Stay alert.

43
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,806
We stay sharp.

44
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,040
We're gonna get through this.

45
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,539
- Alright?
- Alright.

46
00:04:56,712 --> 00:05:00,532
We'll be fine, we just have
to do what we know.

47
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,961
Look at me. Look at me!

48
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:06,581
We'll be in pub tomorrow
night having a bloody beer, right?

49
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,603
What the people of yours?

50
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:12,596
If they had better come with me.

51
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:16,068
Let's go.

52
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:37,523
Hold!
Advance man and be recognized!

53
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:41,480
- Easy...easy, boy.
- Don't shoot.

54
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:44,031
- We're British.
- Oh bloody hell, we're glad to see you long.

55
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:46,904
- Anybody got smoke?
- Identify yourself.

56
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,109
The 3 Little Pigs.

57
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,475
Don't get old slack with me.
Unit.

58
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,226
2 Platoon. B Company,
West Kent, sir.

59
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,674
Where is your platoon commander?

60
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:00,454
Dead, sir.

61
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:03,601
- Platoon sergeant?
- Dead.

62
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,935
I would appreciate to give us some
eat, some days my men do not eat.

63
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:11,104
No, but I have a job for you.

64
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,268
Report to the company Sergeant-Major.

65
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,221
We're digging in.

66
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,954
Maybe ambush these bastards.

67
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,299
Ambush?

68
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,418
Do you know what's coming?

69
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:33,274
Don't you dare to question me, Corporal.

70
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:36,313
- Is this the way off Dunkirk?
- No, you're digging in.

71
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:40,356
I have orders to hold line,
and we will hold the bloody line.

72
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:42,562
Orders are orders.
And I was given orders.

73
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:46,859
And I'm giving you an order.
What sort of soldier are you?

74
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:50,330
I wish you luck and all dare.

75
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:52,283
But we're going to Dunkirk.

76
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:55,147
Those were the last orders
given us by our sergeant.

77
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:59,272
Or you stay right here and you will
fight or I have you arrested.

78
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,306
For now, we have
finished fighting.

79
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,714
Let's go, boys.

80
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,092
- Sgt.
- Corporal!

81
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:18,539
- Calm down.
- What do you do?

82
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:20,970
- Put it down.
- We are on the same side.

83
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:25,917
Easy boy

84
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,081
Come on.

85
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,293
Live to fight another day.

86
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,606
You ain't gonna stop these bastards now.

87
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,335
- You stay and we're gonna make it, believe me.
- You're deserters, don't you?

88
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:47,460
Bloody cowards...I should
have you shot.

89
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,269
Arrest these men.

90
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:10,348
- Thank you.
- Come on, Sophie.

91
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,482
The Major: what he's like?

92
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,839
Typical royal navy marine.
Rough, tough and quite handsome, actually.

93
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,680
A quite unconventional
officer, actually.

94
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,850
Some say it has
Lucky to be Major.

95
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,800
But I was investigating and
father has a great story.

96
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,188
He fought all over the
world, including the pole.

97
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:33,462
It has been part of operations
special since 1939.

98
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,849
Good morning, ladies.

99
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:40,038
Many stories to tell.

100
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:43,423
Sounds familiar?

101
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:50,653
- Sophie.
- Yes?

102
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:54,516
- Have you ever loved?
- What does that mean?

103
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:57,728
Major.

104
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:01,417
Come in.

105
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,451
Splendid, Jack. What's up to you?

106
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,894
Steiner.

107
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,326
Thanks, Lindsey.

108
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,016
- I guess that has been introduced.
- No.

109
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:16,218
- But that manner.
- Sorry.

110
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,820
Mayor Jones, this is
Lieutenant Mortensen.

111
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:24,247
And of course, both know
Holbrook. Please take a sit.

112
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:26,089
Thank you.

113
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,932
I thought you had
lost interest in this war.

114
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:33,837
In fact, I'm not. I moved to
Boston when I was 14 years old.

115
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:37,214
It is hard to not
interested in this fight.

116
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:39,645
Mortensen, has agreed to help out.

117
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,851
- Unofficially, of course.
- Call it an investment interest.

118
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,760
If you want to see some action.

119
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:50,045
Jack, I'm afraid your instructor
position will be revoked.

120
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:51,878
I'm operational?

121
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:56,417
Operation Grendel.

122
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:59,161
- What do you know RDF?
- RDF?

123
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:03,189
- It relates to the defence.
- It stay for range and direction finding.

124
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:06,192
It is part of the line of defence
we've adopted along our coastline.

125
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:07,919
- Radar, is it?
- Quite right.

126
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:10,263
The technology is what can
make us win this war.

127
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,555
The problem is:
Jerry has it too.

128
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:15,011
Use radar to reach
their objectives, while

129
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,743
our guys are still navigating
by compass in the bloody stars.

130
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:22,303
The disastrous RAF raid on ? in December
39, was due to our soldiers

131
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,642
were detected at 75 miles from
the German coast by RDF.

132
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:30,738
They're building these things from
Norway to southern France.

133
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:33,038
The German RDF
known as Freire

134
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:36,553
and this is the Freire research center,
here, in the mountains.

135
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:40,202
We believe, if they have the new
technology, it will be here.

136
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:43,153
The admiral allowed me to
set up a commando unit.

137
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:45,584
Smaller, more versatile raiding party.

138
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:49,490
What I need from you is to infiltrate
one of these Freire stations

139
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,395
cause as much chaos as you can and get
the intelligence back intact.

140
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,515
We have one window, an opportunity.

141
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:02,556
Officially, you won't even
exist as a unit.

142
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:05,039
I need to know that you acquiest to that.

143
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,215
How many men do I have?

144
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,272
One eight men team
of specialists.

145
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:14,876
This operation won't be officially sanctioned, 
I'm afraid... but we only have six weeks.

146
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:18,790
Any longer than that will risk
any chance of night cover

147
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:22,652
I need any maps, any photographs and
all the intelligence you can.

148
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:26,727
- Mortensen, you know this area?
- I know the terrain. It is very harsh.

149
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:29,905
I used to camp in the
mountains when I was a kid.

150
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,900
Good. You can help
to instruct the team.

151
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,243
I need these men.

152
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,973
Brightling is in prison, but we need him.

153
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,705
I see. I'll make a call.

154
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,041
Major.

155
00:12:56,726 --> 00:13:00,328
They are together, you know.
A couple.

156
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:04,971
Maybe I should put a stop to it?

157
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,096
How is Grace?

158
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:11,220
Due any momemnt.

159
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,609
Splendid.

160
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,584
My mother should have
joined you lot.

161
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:29,492
It's for the best.

162
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:31,965
- I do not want you in London.
- Yes, it is the best.

163
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:35,263
It's always for the bloody best.

164
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,736
Is it right or to the
left, I always forget?

165
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,603
It's left.

166
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:42,033
What happened to the instructor's post?

167
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:46,763
- Grace, I never said I was going to stop...
- You said you'd be an instructor.

168
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:50,010
Grace, please. Don't make this
harder than it already is.

169
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:51,789
Jack, please.

170
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:09,488
How many fatherless children there
will be when this war is done?

171
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,134
I want yours to know you.

172
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:28,062
You are here because you are scam.

173
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,837
Have disappointed everyone.

174
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:33,747
Yourself.

175
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,524
You units, your King and your country.

176
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:42,123
I'm here to put you right,
to put you back on track.

177
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:48,951
You will not go without understanding what
means to be a decent human being.

178
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:55,036
Not a coward, deserter
thief or rapist.

179
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:57,335
Eyes forward.

180
00:14:57,718 --> 00:14:58,846
What if I say not?

181
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,755
Alone.

182
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,882
Who's this one?

183
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:05,442
Private Reines, sir.

184
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:13,253
Private Reines. Striking an officer,
disobeyed orders, cowardice. Shall I go on?

185
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,117
You are a bloody disgrace.

186
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:19,416
It was a mistake. I should
be gone back to the West Kent.

187
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,759
Save your speech
for your court-martial.

188
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:25,510
Why did you join the army, son?

189
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:30,153
- You wanted to see the world?
- It was either that or go to prison, dad.

190
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:34,710
You will increase the charges.

191
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,576
Damn stop giving orders, sir.

192
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,053
Are you okay?

193
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,223
Speaking of brave,
and see who jumps.

194
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,439
Sergeant, the hill, one
hour. Full weight, go.

195
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:46,739
Go go go.

196
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:52,381
You are stupid. You
are nothing. Move your asses.

197
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,896
Get up.

198
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:57,979
Move.

199
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,896
I have a heart attack.

200
00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:02,066
Follow the group.

201
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,715
Damn!

202
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:06,016
- Rot alone, damn worm.
- I cannot breathe.

203
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:09,444
He doesn't need any help. He is
special. Aren't you, Brightling?

204
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:12,047
He is a commando, isn't it?

205
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:15,953
Yes. Come on.

206
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:18,124
Is it not true, you fucking bastard?

207
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,338
Let go, I'll show you.

208
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:22,073
I cannot move the damn legs.

209
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,968
Come on. I'm not disappointed.

210
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,569
You two, take the pole.

211
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:34,188
So you were commando.

212
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:36,618
No, I wasn't.

213
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,571
How was it?

214
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:42,042
I heard about you boys.

215
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:43,995
I never knew you existed.

216
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,600
I thought it was propaganda,
you know that.

217
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,115
If we can get out of here.

218
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:51,947
Escape.

219
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:55,150
I have got something, cooking.

220
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:58,056
We can get out of here.
Change the names.

221
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:01,442
Become commando and
kill a few fucking Nazis.

222
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,569
Trust me.

223
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:06,336
I know what I mean.

224
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:09,505
Serious.

225
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,413
I'm a commando, man.

226
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,472
- Major Jones.
- Colonel.

227
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,206
I got a call from the guards.

228
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,159
Good.

229
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:34,675
So ...

230
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,753
- Something big for today.
- Strictly routine.

231
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:42,833
- I came to pick up one of my men.
- That's right, Brightling.

232
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:47,215
I think he's doing some exercise.

233
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:55,418
What do you think they do,
damn lazy? Follow the step.

234
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:58,977
Corporal. Brightling needs
an encouragement.

235
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,928
What the hell is it?

236
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:04,054
- Sergeant Major!
- Leave him alone.

237
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,265
Shit.

238
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,696
Water.

239
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,080
What the bloody hell have
you done to him?

240
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:16,076
Marsh.

241
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:18,072
Are you okay?

242
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:20,112
- Stay away.
- Take off.

243
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:22,586
He was helping him, idiots. Let him go.

244
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,710
What's your name?

245
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:29,247
- Bob Reines, West Camp, sir.
- Pick up this kitten and follow me.

246
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:43,199
- Do you take him away?
- Yes.

247
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:45,283
Room for one more?

248
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:47,886
What are you doing here?

249
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:50,925
- A misunderstanding, sir.
- I didn't ask for excuses.

250
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:54,092
Striking an officer and cowardice.

251
00:18:54,396 --> 00:18:57,565
But I am no coward
the officer, he deserved it.

252
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:01,470
- Get me out, please.
- I'm afraid not.

253
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:07,764
Alright, Syd, here we go.

254
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:11,669
Head down, head down.

255
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:17,311
Major...terribly sorry about your man.

256
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:19,262
Good luck.

257
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:21,130
Get back in row, Reines.

258
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:24,862
- Please Major, I want to be a commando, sir.
- Sorry, not this time.

259
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,901
Reines, get back in line.

260
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,376
- I hope you do well.
- I'm wasted here.

261
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,975
Can you control your man? The entire
day has been a total embarrassment.

262
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,885
Yes, sir.

263
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,489
Commando is a special breed, you
always have a chance.

264
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,570
As you go out, you find us.

265
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:46,908
Reines.

266
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:48,514
Bollocks.

267
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:50,207
Hold on to that man.

268
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,592
He tries to escape.

269
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:57,019
Get back.

270
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,356
- Don't be stupid, son.
- I'm not being stupid...

271
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:05,960
The Major is taking me out
of here, right now.

272
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,955
- He's not.
- I think I might be, Sergeant Major.

273
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:14,693
Now why don't we all calm down?
I'll drive you out.

274
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:17,374
Don't try anything silly.

275
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,847
Get in the car.

276
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:24,273
Get into the car Major.

277
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,661
Get back in line you faggots.

278
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:29,525
See you, boys.

279
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:37,033
I'll shoot you!

280
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:48,534
Right, I'm out, I found ya,
I want to be a commando.

281
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,441
Just like that?

282
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:53,611
- You said that.
- I know what I said.

283
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:55,650
- You gave me a note.
- I didn't.

284
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:56,997
But I prompted.

285
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:58,906
Syd, said he had something cooking.

286
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,981
He said he had something cooking?

287
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,974
So you thought it was
a signal to do this.

288
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:11,881
What? I'm a fool.

289
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:14,008
You bloody stupid!

290
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:17,697
I should return you back just for that.

291
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,040
If you take me back I'm a dead man.

292
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,539
- You seen many action?
- France, just before Dunkirk.

293
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:37,400
- What you think to?
- A bloody carnage.

294
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:42,955
- And you climb?
- Like a monkey.

295
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:46,557
Right.

296
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:51,460
Look after Syd, he's dehydrated.
Sips of water, little and often.

297
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,847
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

298
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,191
- Not yet a commando, yet.
- No.

299
00:21:56,537 --> 00:22:00,183
If you fail any part of this test, you go
straight back to the prison, do you understand?

300
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,396
Yes, sir.

301
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:05,826
- How do we pass the police?
- I don't know

302
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:13,247
If you pull over me a gun again

303
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:15,373
will be a dead man.

304
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:26,049
You have cold blood, you know, boy?

305
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:39,676
Stop what you
are doing and follow me.

306
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:42,540
Repórtense, move.

307
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,448
Come here quickly.

308
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,228
Stand to attention.

309
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:50,995
Good morning, gentlemen.

310
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:54,466
It's good to see you here.

311
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,287
Go ahead, Sergeant.

312
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:03,364
To my right here is the Sergeant
Grey. I'm Sgt McKensy .

313
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,965
You can call me, Mac

314
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:10,004
Most of you already know me.

315
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:14,929
Those that don't be prepared for
a big fucking surprise.

316
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:25,800
- Do not look ahead, Gable.
- Aye, sir.

317
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,447
- I like your moustache, laddie.
- Thanks, Sarge.

318
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:36,562
I hope we had a great time.

319
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:44,167
Gentlemen, after I'm finished with
you, you wish had never been born.

320
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:47,759
Do not underestimate me.

321
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:52,707
And never fuck with me.

322
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,308
- Do I make myself understood?
- Yes, sergeant.

323
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,953
- I can't fucking hear you!
- Yes, sir.

324
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,411
It is vital that we move quickly
and covertly as a team.

325
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:14,580
- Look at the man beside you.
- Look at him.

326
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:16,619
Get to know him.

327
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:21,939
You will eat with him, you will shave
with him and you will piss with him.

328
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,821
You'll trust him for life.

329
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:30,897
Right.

330
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:34,500
Let's try for our
first tactic of attack.

331
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,409
Squadron underway.

332
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,228
Come on, get moving.

333
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:49,645
Come on Reines.

334
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:12,428
- Hit him.
- Dale hard

335
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:14,035
Time.

336
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,547
Okay, Gable. The
moustache is perfect.

337
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,584
Move, get moving.

338
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:25,838
Reines, you're last.
You lost. You lost the game.

339
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,056
Move your asses. Move!

340
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:48,398
In a line, in a line.

341
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:50,439
Get in line.

342
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:01,158
Stand down.

343
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:11,091
Go back in line.

344
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,261
The FS commando knife.

345
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:18,540
This was designed especially for
what you have in mind.

346
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,900
Why?

347
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,806
Close quarter combat.

348
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,061
But only if we have to.

349
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:30,360
Get used to this.

350
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,649
Keep it on all the time.

351
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:37,599
Sergeant Mac

352
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:38,988

353
00:26:39,118 --> 00:26:40,854
Come on.

354
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,458
Topson. To the range.

355
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:46,278
Come on, today please.

356
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:49,534
Riley, to the range.

357
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,355
Mortensen, to the range.

358
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:57,823
Gable, to the range.

359
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,642
Brightling, to the range.

360
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,678
Come on son I haven't got all day.

361
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:12,231
Come on Reines.

362
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:23,688
This what.

363
00:27:23,862 --> 00:27:26,423
You need to learn how to use this.

364
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:29,243
Aye...let's start with the pistol.

365
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:33,236
Look at it: 9 mm, automatic.

366
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:36,967
Favoured by officers and you can see why.

367
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:47,904
Two shots to the main body mass, one to
head to finish the job.

368
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:51,376
Any questions? No? Good.

369
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,025
Mr. Mortensen, be my guest.

370
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:03,007
Good. Riley.

371
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:13,769
Good shooting, son. If you weren't
so fucking ugly I'd kiss you.

372
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,549
Who taught you to shoot so well, son?

373
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:17,849
- You did, Sergeant.
- Me? Never.

374
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:20,106
- "You did, Sergeant".
- What are you talking about?

375
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,885
Mr. Reines.

376
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:33,733
If you need a door
back, I'll give you a call.

377
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:36,077
Sorry, Sarge.

378
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:38,245
It is my weak side.

379
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:47,793
Reines.

380
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,906
Where did you learn to shoot so well?

381
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:56,986
- Cowboy movies.
- Oh, really?

382
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,978
God...Have we Jessie James
here, have we?

383
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:08,146
Well Mr. Reines, for being so fucking funny,
I think you deserve a little run, don't you?

384
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:11,741
Don't you, Sergeant Grey?

385
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,823
Put it over your head, sir. Above.

386
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:18,033
Follow me sir, come on.

387
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:21,918
Shut up!

388
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,899
Lift the arms Reines.

389
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:34,678
Yes Sergeant.

390
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:36,458
Is it painful son?

391
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:37,736
Yes, sir.

392
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:44,409
Pain, Reines, it's just
weakness leaving the body, son.

393
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:53,001
Step forward. Stand up!

394
00:30:00,943 --> 00:30:03,113
What do you think they teach you?

395
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:06,758
Discipline.

396
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:12,661
- Something you have an aversion to.
- Sir, I ...

397
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,569
Shut up. I'm talking!

398
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:19,475
I mean, what is your problem? well?

399
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:22,749
- Nothing, sorry.
- Sorry?

400
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:25,289
Sorry.

401
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:28,327
So you seem to say.

402
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,061
What's wrong?

403
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:33,926
Your mother didn't love you enough? Is that it?

404
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:35,921
Were you disappointed?

405
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:37,657
- You became a bully?
- No.

406
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:39,697
- Do not do it again.
- You're right you won't

407
00:30:40,913 --> 00:30:42,431
I'm sending you back.

408
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,478
No!

409
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:47,475
Sir.

410
00:30:47,691 --> 00:30:50,730
- Give me one good fucking reason why shouldn't.
- Because if.

411
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:52,683
Because what?

412
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:54,331
Because?

413
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:59,724
Because I've done more and achieved
more here than in my entire life.

414
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,968
Reines, you haven't achieved damn anything here.

415
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:10,085
One more chance. Please.

416
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:20,675
How you equip yourself in the next few days
will determine how you judge for the rest of your life.

417
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:28,139
- Depends on you.
- Thanks.

418
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,482
- Sergeant Grey.
- Thanks sir.

419
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,435
Thank you, sir.

420
00:31:32,652 --> 00:31:35,083
Top with your head, Reines.

421
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,925
Well, looks official.

422
00:31:51,054 --> 00:31:54,655
Come on, we review
internal 5 min.

423
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,995
Come on.

424
00:32:01,772 --> 00:32:03,769
Okay, let's do it.

425
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:09,193
Mr. Reines, exit please.

426
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,440
- What's up, Sergeant?
- Just wait here laddie.

427
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,043
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Hello.

428
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:21,519
After you

429
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:36,144
Rest, soldier.

430
00:32:39,144 --> 00:32:42,789
So...you are my escaped convict, are you?

431
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,215
- Can't you speak?
- Yes, sir.

432
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,323
I am. I did, sir

433
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,115
I want he back. It's a bloody mess.

434
00:32:56,026 --> 00:33:00,736
- Some people want your head.
- Sorry, sir.

435
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:03,846
If these were past, the
major Jones would be court-martialled

436
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:06,320
And you would be shot.

437
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:10,356
But these are extraordinary times.

438
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,090
And major Jones is
an exceptional leader.

439
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,260
You're in luck.

440
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:18,297
I persuaded her to let you
stay in this operation.

441
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:21,813
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

442
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:29,321
- I won't leave you down.
- No you won't.

443
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:38,608
I'd rather either not take notes.

444
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:46,944
Gentlemen, we are the masters
of our own fate.

445
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:51,450
Or at least it should be.

446
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:56,164
For this reason, I like many others,

447
00:33:56,424 --> 00:33:58,768
have been exploring innovative ideas

448
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:01,849
to destroy the enemy.

449
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:05,269
I need men like you

450
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:09,557
men with courage and honour.

451
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:13,275
Indeed we live in a age of honour.

452
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:17,066
With the honour comes
duty. And sacrifice.

453
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:18,989
We're not naive to death.

454
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:25,543
But you

455
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,752
are the first of a new breed.

456
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:34,092
A special force. An elite smashing grab
unit working behind the enemy lines.

457
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:39,379
This trade and its success
will define all future operations.

458
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,174
Major.

459
00:34:46,296 --> 00:34:49,767
Operation Grendel, Norway.
That's where we head to.

460
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:54,975
Now, this tower and many like them
are protecting our shores

461
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,188
are known as RDF.

462
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:01,224
Jerry also has the RDF,
the name is Freire.

463
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:05,095
Instruments that spotting out our
ships and aircraft miles away.

464
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,185
And giving Luftwaffe an advantage.

465
00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:11,701
Our mission:
infiltrate and occupy Norway.

466
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:16,893
Assaulting a communication station
in the mountain range in the north.

467
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:20,313
I say assault because Jerry spoke for
demolition job but this is a secondary aim,  

468
00:35:20,442 --> 00:35:26,768
the primary purpose of this mission is to get out 
of their hands latest generation of RDF technology.

469
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,070
Sergeant Ballright, you explain.

470
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:32,092
Good morning.

471
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:38,080
The basic operating principle of 
RDF is very simple.

472
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:44,538
The volume of sky to be kept under surveillance
is literally flood lit with our RAF pulse energy.

473
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,537
The backscattered pulses or...echoes of all
aircraft within facility receives

474
00:35:49,798 --> 00:35:53,878
a group of posts in the ground
stations that are received by a set of cross...

475
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:56,221
Ballright ...

476
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:58,867
In English, please.

477
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:09,751
The kit that the Major was referring to, is the latest,
most advanced technology we've seen in the world to date.

478
00:36:10,108 --> 00:36:15,533
Where I work we're developing an equipment
that can jam signals from the radio towers.

479
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,572
However,

480
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:21,565
we believe they have developed
anti-jamming device.

481
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:25,080
So our work is completely redundant.

482
00:36:25,297 --> 00:36:32,163
If they have it, I need to see it with
my eyes. Analyze it and steal its technology.

483
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,540
Thank you.

484
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:38,525
Sergeant Ballright, the
accompany you on your excursion.

485
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:41,433
Treat him with kindness.

486
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,603
Down to details.

487
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,942
I was informed that we have a
contact with an agent.

488
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:54,106
We have reported the operation
but we will keep contact to a minimum.

489
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:58,627
Insertion by plane. It will be 
a tactical landing.

490
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:01,926
The aircraft will fly
the engines off.

491
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:05,746
A parachute drop, maybe considered
if the weather it takes.

492
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:08,175
- Extraction by sea.
- So ...

493
00:37:09,658 --> 00:37:12,349
- Any questions?
- Our position.

494
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,561
General details, a fifth alpine
division is in the region.

495
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,641
We'll have to ask Beowulf the exact
numbers of the objectives.

496
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:21,289
But it's unlikely to be more
than a platoon.

497
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:23,073
- Are they any good sir?
- Yes, very.

498
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:24,983
So are we.

499
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,544
- They're not expecting us.
- Exactly.

500
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:32,351
I have to go back to London. Leave
to Ballright here to come acquainted.

501
00:37:33,732 --> 00:37:36,161
I wish you Godspeed.

502
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,114
And good luck.

503
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:42,344
Okay lads, we have much
to do, outside.

504
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:51,264
You too, Mr. Ballright. Looks like
we're gonna teach you how to shoot.

505
00:37:51,655 --> 00:37:53,391
I know how to shoot.

506
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:56,603
Get out of your fancy dress
and you can show us how is done.

507
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,208
Down your head.

508
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,418
You were right with him, though.

509
00:38:04,457 --> 00:38:06,367
It's a clever man.

510
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,275
Seems to know much about
the RDF setup.

511
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:12,348
The Magnetron.

512
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,167
We must be careful with Jerry.

513
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:19,594
Very good.

514
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:21,071
Steiner.

515
00:38:21,496 --> 00:38:22,841
May I help you?

516
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:25,185
I just wanted to give this
to commander Fleming.

517
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:27,354
Of course.

518
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:30,393
I wondered if you could give this to ...

519
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,952
I will make sure that she receives it.

520
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:40,548
These are the men wills
in the event of ...

521
00:38:45,313 --> 00:38:47,483
I want last thing, Jack.

522
00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:51,302
Beowulf's gone dark

523
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:53,125
Make sure there's
nothing to worry about.

524
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:05,658
Reines.

525
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:11,646
You right, Boss?

526
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,467
I want you to look out for him.

527
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:17,114
No problem.

528
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:18,807
Please, don't snatch.

529
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:20,760
Three shots each time. Again.

530
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:25,056
I did some researched on you Reines.
Studied your records.

531
00:39:25,274 --> 00:39:29,618
You brought your men
back. Why don't you tell me this?

532
00:39:30,881 --> 00:39:33,094
I did my best.

533
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:36,393
Yes. I put you up for a medal.

534
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:40,472
You never get it, of course.

535
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,331
Don't be afraid, Mr. Ballright.

536
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,195
Keep him close at all
times once we're on the ground.

537
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:50,627
Three shots and stops.

538
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:53,058
He is the nephew of someone important.

539
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:55,488
If it goes to crap

540
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:57,485
I get the picture, Major.
- Do you?

541
00:39:57,745 --> 00:39:59,524
Yes, a babysitting job: simple.

542
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:04,731
If it looks like he's going to be captured.

543
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:08,335
Or if he is...you shoot him.

544
00:40:11,197 --> 00:40:13,107
By the way ...

545
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,145
you deserve this.

546
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,881
Sir.

547
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:20,789
Very good.

548
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:22,872
Major Jones

549
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:25,302
You don't have to worry about me.

550
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,255
I won't slow you down.

551
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:29,382
I've already had some training.

552
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,289
Actually, I applied to join
a commando unit once...

553
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,547
But they wouldn't have me.

554
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:37,194
It seems that my talents lies elsewhere.

555
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,274
- I just wanted to do my bit.
- You're certainly doing your bit.

556
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,011
Good to have you on board.

557
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,743
This is Bob Reines. He will watch your
back on the ground.

558
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,782
- Delighted.
- A pleasure.

559
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:51,645
Short burst...more control, great accuracy.

560
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:54,206
Let's go through it again.

561
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,243
We meet with agent Beowulf
on the ground at...

562
00:40:57,504 --> 00:41:01,149
3267678. We landed in
a disused warehouse.

563
00:41:01,322 --> 00:41:04,405
- Enemy forces:
- 5th alpine. That's easy, sir.

564
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:05,792
Mission:

565
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:10,003
Storming the enemy communication
center to 277,890.

566
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:13,344
Protect air infiltration and extraction.

567
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:15,862
Go to the control room, lay
diversion charges along the way.

568
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,333
Secure the equipment inside the base Freire.

569
00:41:19,724 --> 00:41:21,372
Shoot loads.

570
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:24,064
Ensure intelligence
inside the Freire heart.

571
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:28,360
And if you ladies manage to do this without
awaken the commandant...

572
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:34,020
then we should be moving to 277995...
to watch the fireworks.

573
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:37,474
We return to the RP, then the
submarine and back home.

574
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:40,034
Aye...hug the kids and get some rest.

575
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:42,333
We leave tomorrow night.

576
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:28,180
15 minutes.

577
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:56,910
Go! Go!

578
00:42:57,387 --> 00:43:00,425
Come on.

579
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:03,854
React.

580
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:27,674
How many more are there?

581
00:44:34,228 --> 00:44:36,771
What is your mission?

582
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:00,654
- Are you okay?
- I thought I was going to be shot.

583
00:45:00,957 --> 00:45:02,780
So did I.

584
00:45:03,476 --> 00:45:04,950
What is this?

585
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:24,653
Boss.

586
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,081
Gable?

587
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,593
Broken neck.

588
00:45:40,753 --> 00:45:44,877
- Have you had contact?
- No, all clear.

589
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,829
Our problem is this.

590
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,694
We should be on the other
side of this bloody lake.

591
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:54,423
Now, we lost most of our kit and,
I'm afraid, the radio is out Sir.

592
00:45:58,243 --> 00:46:01,063
Well gentlemen, we still have a trailer.

593
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,234
Let's move in double time.
Next stop.

594
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:31,853
Mortensen, Reines.

595
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:34,283
- Riley
- Yes?

596
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:37,321
We'll be allright. I'll take good care of him.

597
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:40,966
Beowulf is beyond that spare

598
00:47:41,227 --> 00:47:43,441
Remember, codeword: Grendel.

599
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,436
- Response?
- Viking.

600
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:47,606
Any sign of trouble straight back here.

601
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,820
We will see when it's clear.

602
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,530
What is it?

603
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,387
It could be a patrol.

604
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:37,514
Let's give him a minute.

605
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:46,779
Say it.

606
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,453
Say it!

607
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:49,886
Viking.

608
00:49:54,373 --> 00:49:56,543
- You are late.
- It's a little girl.

609
00:49:56,803 --> 00:49:58,409

610
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:00,579
I already knew.

611
00:50:01,022 --> 00:50:03,583
Put the gun down.

612
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,577
Enough, Steiner.

613
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,615
Never ever point at me ever again.

614
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:11,741
Not once.

615
00:50:17,123 --> 00:50:18,599
Where are you from?

616
00:50:23,242 --> 00:50:24,978
How am I supposed to call you?

617
00:50:25,195 --> 00:50:27,148
Beowoulf?

618
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,750
Call me, Jensen.

619
00:50:30,966 --> 00:50:33,180
ok Jensen, I'm Steiner, and he is Bob.

620
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:35,003
Hi.

621
00:50:35,176 --> 00:50:36,651
Ok?

622
00:50:37,043 --> 00:50:39,212
- And where's the rest of you?
- On their route.

623
00:51:05,068 --> 00:51:08,454
- Jones, combined operations.
- Jensen, welcome to Norway.

624
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,673
- Shall we discuss about orders or you need to...?
- First I need you to contact London.

625
00:51:14,018 --> 00:51:17,577
- We've lost a lot of kit...the radio, you do have radio?
- Yes. Of course.

626
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:25,258
- May you update the objective?
- Yes the Germans are busy.

627
00:51:25,997 --> 00:51:29,642
They're travelling in the mountains shooting all
what they believe is the resistance.

628
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:31,811
What's this? That's hat..SS

629
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,889
They've been here for a month.

630
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:38,755
I told them in London.

631
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:50,212
- What shall I tell them?
- Tell this ...

632
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:59,932
Dispatch here arrived, sir. 
Not good news I'm afraid.

633
00:52:01,843 --> 00:52:03,882
Damn.

634
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:08,395
Send the trailer.

635
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:12,680
Will not make it.

636
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,533
Sir.

637
00:52:15,622 --> 00:52:17,403
I need your response.

638
00:52:22,827 --> 00:52:24,303
Pursue it.

639
00:52:29,076 --> 00:52:33,243
- I need you to confirm numbers.
- 20 to 30 trips at the centre daily.

640
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,367
Plus some naval radio operators.

641
00:52:39,362 --> 00:52:43,875
As you know, the approach road is
covered of heavy machinegun post here.

642
00:52:44,353 --> 00:52:47,824
They also set up a lookout tower, just east of this.

643
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:50,810
Right, Mac, get on to that.

644
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:54,673
Inside the huts they said you had intelligence on this.

645
00:52:54,977 --> 00:52:57,668
Michael was killed trying
to get that information.

646
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:00,922
- How long from here?
- 6 hours and 12 min, at pass.

647
00:53:01,138 --> 00:53:03,743
This property is half
km south of the target.

648
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:05,652
- It's in the valley ...
- I know.

649
00:53:05,695 --> 00:53:09,038
But can we continue to have
it? We need ammo, explosive.

650
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:12,379
- I have some hidden there, yes.
- Good.

651
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:16,024
I'm extracted with you
tomorrow night.

652
00:53:18,915 --> 00:53:21,189
- Why?
- Orders.

653
00:53:33,124 --> 00:53:36,422
- She is not Beowoulf.
- You might be right.

654
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:40,067
We may be
leading a patrol.

655
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:43,149
- This is insane.
- He managed to contact London.

656
00:53:43,279 --> 00:53:45,232
She's not Beowoulf.

657
00:53:45,274 --> 00:53:47,315
I do not care who he is.

658
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:50,179
She's helping us. 

659
00:53:50,787 --> 00:53:53,477
She compromised us

660
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:56,646
I'll put a bullet through myself.

661
00:53:57,253 --> 00:53:58,339
Stay alert.

662
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:04,515
Hi.

663
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:24,479

664
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,215

665
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,041

666
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:30,814
Come on.

667
00:55:37,905 --> 00:55:40,552
So the SS patrols
are hunting here.

668
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:42,766
What do you mean by SS?

669
00:55:43,547 --> 00:55:45,109
She's compromised.

670
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:48,306
- Where is the rest of your team?
- Hiding or dead.

671
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:51,051
Why do not you tell us
you were compromised?

672
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:54,219
What difference would it make?
Is this supplies, no?

673
00:55:55,174 --> 00:55:57,170
- Who are you?
- Steiner, what are you doing?

674
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,165
This girl will kill us.

675
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:01,509
You're not Beowoulf, right?

676
00:56:02,899 --> 00:56:04,374
Are You?

677
00:56:05,372 --> 00:56:06,631
Are you?

678
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:10,710
Now tell me,

679
00:56:10,797 --> 00:56:12,489
Fuck!

680
00:56:15,744 --> 00:56:18,739
He promised me that he would
take me to England.

681
00:56:48,432 --> 00:56:51,384
- What his story?
- She's been at it with Mr. Beowoulf.

682
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:55,246
Rather they were dating.

683
00:56:56,982 --> 00:57:02,667
Anyway, they get scrambled, they sent the SS
and he goes on his own.

684
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:06,312
And she keeps trying to transmit
like Beowoulf, no?

685
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:10,218
- Why do that?
- It's an important mission, right?

686
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,562
That's right.

687
00:57:12,822 --> 00:57:16,164
That stupid cow thought we cheat
and knew the situation

688
00:57:16,425 --> 00:57:18,160
So we just leave it like that.

689
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,982
Allright, ladies, shut the fuck up.

690
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:38,355
Jensen, a word.

691
01:01:46,773 --> 01:01:49,594
Regardless of who you really are

692
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:53,290
- You've fulfilled your order.
- Thank you, sir.

693
01:01:53,327 --> 01:01:57,319
The mission continues. I need you
to head off now to the first RV.

694
01:01:58,053 --> 01:02:00,265
Tell to London now where we are.

695
01:02:00,302 --> 01:02:02,442
And we are in place.

696
01:02:02,479 --> 01:02:06,414
Confirm the extraction coordinates.
And you wait for as long as you can.

697
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:10,681
I want you to get in the
submarine with or without us.

698
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,805
You're Beowoulf until
London, you understand?

699
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:17,408
What do I tell them in London?

700
01:02:17,842 --> 01:02:19,361
You tell them the truth.

701
01:02:29,516 --> 01:02:31,469
Right lads, gathering.

702
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:37,198
The new teams. Brithling
Mortensen with me.

703
01:02:38,266 --> 01:02:40,436
The job is the same.

704
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:45,835
Mac and his team will move to the Freire.
Set charges and move to us.

705
01:02:46,077 --> 01:02:48,942
My team will move to the communication room.

706
01:02:49,244 --> 01:02:51,893
Mac, we need a lot of noise
to distract these bastards.

707
01:02:52,283 --> 01:02:54,453
Riley, stay up as long as possible.

708
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,371
Ballright, quick as you can: in and out

709
01:02:59,444 --> 01:03:03,617
Right...heads down and
see you in the trailer.

710
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:38,670
Charges. I'll go
make some noise.

711
01:08:38,303 --> 01:08:39,908
It ends now.

712
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:05,253
The bloody tower
should be blown up.

713
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,326
Brightling.

714
01:09:36,587 --> 01:09:39,321
- Let's go to the Major.
- I'll stay, see you in the trailer.

715
01:09:43,444 --> 01:09:44,832
More noise.

716
01:09:55,508 --> 01:09:57,114
Reines.

717
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:02,018
Are you done yet?

718
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:05,490
This place is full of
secret treasures of the enemy.

719
01:10:05,881 --> 01:10:07,834
We're talking precision RDF.

720
01:10:08,181 --> 01:10:09,483
Give me your knife, Major.

721
01:10:17,728 --> 01:10:19,247
That's incredible.

722
01:10:19,378 --> 01:10:23,978
Technical manuals, recordings
freire operations.

723
01:10:24,672 --> 01:10:27,363
That's great Ballright, but we shall get moving.

724
01:10:37,388 --> 01:10:39,601
Reines leave here.

725
01:10:39,992 --> 01:10:41,336
Steiner, go, go!

726
01:10:57,394 --> 01:11:00,084
Well, come on. Take your weapon.

727
01:11:09,589 --> 01:11:11,976
No bullets. No fire.

728
01:11:25,934 --> 01:11:29,796
- We are going to split.
- Allright, we are in the trailer.

729
01:11:30,534 --> 01:11:32,835
Please contact the hills.

730
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:36,350
- What happened to Brightling? and Riley?
- Didn't make it.

731
01:11:37,566 --> 01:11:39,821
Right, come on. Let's move, move!

732
01:11:51,452 --> 01:11:53,622
Sir, is Beowoulf.

733
01:11:53,796 --> 01:11:56,660
Grendel destroyed.
Casualties. Trailer not possible.

734
01:11:56,878 --> 01:11:59,915
Standby 12 hours
in the designated place.

735
01:12:00,992 --> 01:12:02,424
Operator.

736
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:04,334
Naval strategic command, please.

737
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,750
- Strategic Command.
- SOS special ops.

738
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:15,573
Pick up required. Urgent.

739
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:17,614
- What proceed?
- Grendel.

740
01:12:17,744 --> 01:12:18,958
Please hold.

741
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:36,534
Thank you.

742
01:12:44,346 --> 01:12:49,221
- Is Steiner alive?
- I don't know.

743
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:53,460
- Special ops.
- Yes, need priority pick up.

744
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:57,974
Tonight, at 2000 hours,
Alpha from North, operation Grendel.

745
01:12:58,494 --> 01:13:00,490
It's not possible, I'm afraid.

746
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,659
Listen to me.

747
01:13:03,919 --> 01:13:09,083
This is a top priority extraction.
Send a bloody sub.

748
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:12,382
Sir, we already sent a pick up.

749
01:13:15,593 --> 01:13:19,847
If there is a window,
the slightest window of opportunity.

750
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:21,191
We'll see.

751
01:13:25,054 --> 01:13:26,008
Sir.

752
01:13:32,676 --> 01:13:33,934
Tell Viking.

753
01:13:38,048 --> 01:13:41,615
Naval pick up not possible.

754
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:46,786
Make your way to Sweden.

755
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,815
Should we let the Major
Jones know his news?

756
01:13:54,263 --> 01:14:00,919
Yes, of course.

757
01:14:01,094 --> 01:14:06,130
Born the daughter of
Sara. Both doing well.

758
01:14:08,003 --> 01:14:09,609
What's the latest?

759
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,343
The Major's got a baby girl.

760
01:14:13,905 --> 01:14:15,728
Good job.

761
01:14:17,845 --> 01:14:21,492
Pick up cancelled. We
to leave ourselves.

762
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,704
- All right, where to?
- Sweden.

763
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:26,873
- It will be rough.
- But we got here.

764
01:14:27,524 --> 01:14:30,605
Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Major.

765
01:14:37,094 --> 01:14:40,956
We are on foot to Sweden.
There's a 2 or 3 days walk.

766
01:14:41,174 --> 01:14:43,690
- We need supplies.
- The farm?

767
01:14:43,951 --> 01:14:46,554
- We promised we would not.
- Is there another farm?

768
01:14:46,772 --> 01:14:48,638
We will need more than fucking food.

769
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:52,231
Why we don't we just go in
and nick what we need?

770
01:14:52,883 --> 01:14:56,094
- It's a very good idea.
- Allright, let's move.

771
01:15:08,349 --> 01:15:10,665
Come on, all is well.

772
01:15:12,894 --> 01:15:15,281
You've done good there.

773
01:15:16,974 --> 01:15:19,187
I've never killed anyone before.

774
01:15:19,665 --> 01:15:21,531
I thought it would be harder.

775
01:15:21,661 --> 01:15:25,133
- It all happened so quickly.
- Listen to me.

776
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:27,432
Better them than you.

777
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:30,037
Well done.

778
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:32,380
Do not think about that or you'll go insane.

779
01:15:32,423 --> 01:15:36,764
People die, it happens. Now come on,
pick up that gun and be proud.

780
01:15:45,414 --> 01:15:46,976
Mac takes this.

781
01:15:47,672 --> 01:15:49,625
Steiner and Reines: with me.

782
01:17:28,572 --> 01:17:31,133
- Did you see the blood out there?
- Yes.

783
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,863
Oh fuck.

784
01:18:05,071 --> 01:18:06,806
Reines, crouch.

785
01:18:12,882 --> 01:18:13,966
What do you see?

786
01:18:14,575 --> 01:18:15,833
Reines, what do you see?

787
01:18:16,093 --> 01:18:17,439
Fuck.

788
01:18:18,307 --> 01:18:20,173
It's Brightling.

789
01:18:21,085 --> 01:18:22,777
We need to help him.

790
01:18:23,253 --> 01:18:25,076
Steiner and Mac could cover it.

791
01:18:25,511 --> 01:18:27,940
No, crouch. Get down.

792
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:35,752
Damn bastards.

793
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:39,442
Fucking animals.

794
01:18:42,783 --> 01:18:46,732
Germans bastards.

795
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,072
They're fucking animals.

796
01:18:53,069 --> 01:18:55,542
Would be wise to show yourselves.

797
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,699
Friendly farmers no longer 
available for trading.

798
01:19:05,827 --> 01:19:08,127
I have your friend.

799
01:19:14,681 --> 01:19:17,329
I think he'll be very happy to see you.

800
01:19:17,892 --> 01:19:19,583
Won't shoot if you come out now.

801
01:19:21,407 --> 01:19:24,141
Your friend will continue
to suffer until you do.

802
01:19:26,311 --> 01:19:27,700
They have to Syd.

803
01:19:28,005 --> 01:19:30,173
Mac, what do we do? Mac?

804
01:19:30,608 --> 01:19:32,387
Take it easy.

805
01:19:34,296 --> 01:19:37,161
All right, Know that we parted.

806
01:19:37,379 --> 01:19:39,678
They will be watching for us. Stay low.

807
01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:43,410
Miss, take this.

808
01:20:03,678 --> 01:20:06,714
Are you going just sit there
and watch your friend suffer?

809
01:20:10,447 --> 01:20:13,008
Now would be a very good time to come.

810
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:22,468
We have to go.

811
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:26,071
- We can not, we can not leave.
- She's right.

812
01:20:27,243 --> 01:20:29,108
Very good. Enough.

813
01:20:29,586 --> 01:20:30,975
Listen.

814
01:20:31,886 --> 01:20:33,666
Assume firing position.

815
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:44,992
Fucking animals.

816
01:21:20,883 --> 01:21:22,618
Single shots.

817
01:21:24,831 --> 01:21:26,221
Conserve your ammo.

818
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:48,094
Cover me down the stretch.

819
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,654
When you get out, either
they are dead or not,

820
01:21:51,348 --> 01:21:53,562
you're gonna fuck off to Sweden.

821
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:57,207
- Mac, I can stay.
- I have no time for this, son.

822
01:21:57,598 --> 01:21:59,160
- Make sure you take it.
- Of course.

823
01:22:00,107 --> 01:22:02,060
Okay, do it.

824
01:22:11,824 --> 01:22:13,256
Damn.

825
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:46,005
Mac

826
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:50,431
Ceasefire.

827
01:22:50,777 --> 01:22:52,470
You should be in Sweden, Mckensy.

828
01:22:52,645 --> 01:22:54,683
With all due respect, sir.
But fuck off.

829
01:22:54,813 --> 01:22:56,550
Do they expect?

830
01:22:57,461 --> 01:22:58,857
Ceasefire.

831
01:22:58,894 --> 01:23:01,801
- Ballright is safe.
- No way out.

832
01:23:02,756 --> 01:23:04,795
You have no chance to escape.

833
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:06,532
Go, go.

834
01:23:06,706 --> 01:23:09,092
Are you enjoying this?

835
01:23:09,352 --> 01:23:11,263
- Go.
- Shut up.

836
01:23:13,215 --> 01:23:15,428
What do you want me to do with this, sir?

837
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:18,032
- Go.
- You'll be prisoners of war.

838
01:23:20,636 --> 01:23:22,065
Stop your friend suffering.

839
01:23:24,455 --> 01:23:26,147
Fuck, that is unbearable.

840
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:28,318
Obviously he has orders
to take us alive.

841
01:23:28,534 --> 01:23:30,704
And torture the truth out of us.

842
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:33,264
But we live yet.

843
01:23:38,038 --> 01:23:39,817
Save him from his suffering.

844
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:41,119
No.

845
01:23:41,468 --> 01:23:43,420
Put it in order to
suffering of his friend.

846
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,852
Or I will.

847
01:23:45,589 --> 01:23:47,586
Right, time to leave Reines.

848
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,363
- Steiner. Take Reines to see Sweden.
- What?

849
01:23:50,753 --> 01:23:52,273
I need grenades.

850
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:54,876
And in 30 seconds. end up with this.

851
01:23:55,094 --> 01:23:57,568
When you throw the bloody grenades

852
01:23:57,784 --> 01:24:00,909
Me and Mac will move north. You
move east. Meet in Stockholm.

853
01:24:01,127 --> 01:24:03,036
If we stay together
We have more possibilities.

854
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:04,859
Split up will have
a better chance.

855
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:11,714
Make sure you arrive safely.

856
01:24:12,105 --> 01:24:14,363
You are a bloody good commandos.

857
01:24:14,796 --> 01:24:16,706
Its been a privilege.

858
01:24:31,852 --> 01:24:34,022
God forgive me.

859
01:24:34,934 --> 01:24:35,931
No.

860
01:24:46,955 --> 01:24:50,817
- Reines, throw the bloody grenade.
- Throw the grenade.

861
01:24:51,598 --> 01:24:53,290
Reines.

862
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,634
Go, go. Move.

863
01:25:07,568 --> 01:25:09,130
Are you dead, sir?

864
01:25:22,628 --> 01:25:25,103
- Ammo?
- Low.

865
01:25:28,443 --> 01:25:30,613
What do you want to do, Major?

866
01:25:31,698 --> 01:25:35,604
- You go, I'll cover you.
- You fucking go.

867
01:25:39,076 --> 01:25:40,291
Come on.

868
01:25:58,344 --> 01:26:00,732
Steiner.

869
01:26:04,073 --> 01:26:05,722
Look at me.

870
01:26:08,759 --> 01:26:11,537
Come with me. Come, get up, soldier.

871
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:15,964
Fucking lazy, fucking Steiner.

872
01:26:16,441 --> 01:26:18,568
Don't stand there.

873
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,518
It's ok.

874
01:26:25,599 --> 01:26:27,638
Do not die.

875
01:26:32,846 --> 01:26:35,146
Stay there.

876
01:26:35,494 --> 01:26:38,488
Wait, come back for you.

877
01:27:15,289 --> 01:27:16,809
Drop the knife.

878
01:27:20,715 --> 01:27:23,275
Reines, come on.

879
01:27:24,012 --> 01:27:26,053
Reines.

880
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:27,788
Reines.

881
01:27:30,175 --> 01:27:31,737
Reines.

882
01:27:32,344 --> 01:27:35,990
Your orders were to carry me
home or to shoot if you couldn't.

883
01:27:37,813 --> 01:27:40,764
If you stay here you're gonna die.

884
01:27:41,849 --> 01:27:44,020
I'm not going to shoot myself.

885
01:27:52,438 --> 01:27:55,216
You barmy bastard.

886
01:27:58,297 --> 01:27:59,512
let's go.

887
01:28:55,973 --> 01:28:57,449
That's Sweden.

888
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:08,083
Bloody good.
