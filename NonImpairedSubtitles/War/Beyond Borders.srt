00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,120
l wonder...

3
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,950
Do we all know where we belong?

4
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,960
And if we do, in our hearts,

5
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,470
why do we so often
do nothing about it?

6
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,970
There must be more
to this life--

7
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,270
a purpose for us all,
a place to belong.

8
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,810
You were my home.

9
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,080
l knew
from the moment l met you...

10
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,550
that night, so many years ago.

11
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,490
Well, come on and let me know

12
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,250
Should l stay or should l go?

13
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,490
Should l stay
or should l go now?

14
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,470
Should l stay
or should l go now?

15
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,530
lf l go, there will be trouble

16
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,600
And if l stay,
it will be double

17
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,850
So come on and let me know...

18
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,630
Thanks a lot.

19
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,570
Should l stay
or should l go now?

20
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,610
Thank you.

21
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,910
lf l go,
there will be trouble

22
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,240
Thank you.

23
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,190
And if l stay,
it will be double

24
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,190
So, you've got to let me know

25
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,550
Should l stay or should l go?

26
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,220
Thank you!

27
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,490
Thank you very much.

28
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,110
Lovely.

29
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,470
l want to thank the band.

30
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,710
After that racket,
l can only appear good.

31
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,110
Now, Margaret Thatcher...

32
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,620
you've got to hand it to her.

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,350
Love her or hate her,
Margaret Thatcher is definitely

34
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,220
the strongest man
in the Tory Party.

35
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,950
Charley!

36
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,180
Hi, sis.

37
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,450
Oh, you're freezing.

38
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,460
l know... l couldn't get a cab--
God's punishment.

39
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,830
You don't believe in God.

40
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,950
l know.
So that's Henry, huh?

41
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,660
-Hm-mm.
-Very handsome.

42
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,960
Hi, l'm Charlotte.

43
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,360
How are you? Oh...

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,530
Oh, it's good to meet you.

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,540
Likewise.

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,700
l'm so sorry
l missed the wedding.

47
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,700
No, no, no, no.

48
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,670
l'm sure she's already told you,

49
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,110
l'm crap at appointments
and times and stuff.

50
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,110
Well, she did mention...

51
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,400
Mind you, she
is absolutely nuts,

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,210
but you married her,
so you must know, right?

53
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,910
We should introduce you around.

54
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,750
Come with me.

55
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,840
Mom, Dad, may l introduce you
to Sarah's sister, Charlotte.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,510
Yes, of course.

57
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,520
How do you do?

58
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,080
My parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Bauford.

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,020
Oh, thank goodness, you both
have the same last name.

60
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,030
Good.

61
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,220
Pleasure to meet you, Charlotte,

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,260
or do you say Charley?

63
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,520
Um, right now,
l'd say l'm a mess,

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,530
so if you don't mind...

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,090
l'll take you to the bathroom.

66
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,130
Okay.

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,100
Back in a sec.

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,100
Although, according to one
Ethiopian village log drummer,

69
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,940
it translates as ''l've just
eaten a sodden grape pie.''

70
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,130
Ha-ha.

71
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,780
Oh...

72
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,580
Sorry.

73
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,840
Look at you.

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,250
Oh, sweetie, you look beautiful.

75
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,250
Look at you.

76
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,880
Look at you...
you're in a dress.

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,360
Oh, please, a dress.

78
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,550
l look like lvana Trump
after a couple of rounds, baby.

79
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,560
Whew.

80
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,560
Come here.

81
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,600
What?

82
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,820
First, you've got
to be kidding me.

83
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,100
You know this is pointless.

84
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,830
Oh, l hate this.

85
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,040
So what do you think of him?

86
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,700
l think he's
an absolute sweetheart.

87
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,540
He's gorgeous, really, he is.

88
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,270
He is, and he's sweet
and he's funny and wild.

89
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,340
He's very English.

90
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,580
You married a very English
Englishman.

91
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,880
You're blushing!

92
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,850
How's home?

93
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,050
Home's good.
lt misses you.

94
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,180
Work?

95
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,690
Oh, you know, very exciting.

96
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,920
They gave me a story
about a ten-car pile-up

97
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,930
on 54th Street.

98
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,030
You know, whatever.

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,690
Looking up?

100
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,790
Oh, top of the news pile,
you know?

101
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,660
You will be.

102
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,640
Someday.

103
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,670
But on that note,

104
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,930
l think it's time
l left the stage

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,740
and brought on someone
very special indeed.

106
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,500
Thank you very much.

107
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,340
Hi, um...

108
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,940
l'm sorry to interrupt,
but Mr. Bauford's son, Henry,

109
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,750
would like to make
an announcement.

110
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,590
Thank you.

111
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,890
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

112
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,390
as you know, one of the reasons
we're here tonight

113
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,560
is to show our appreciation
to Lawrence Bauford

114
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,160
for all the great work
he's done

115
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,670
as Chairman of Aid Relief
lnternational.

116
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,940
Sir... Sir!

117
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,320
Sarah!

118
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,160
Oh, darling.

119
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,690
-She's cut.
-Oh God.

120
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,920
Are you all right?

121
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,270
You ask me,
it's a bloody rip-off.

122
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,070
1 ,000 quid
for an over-cooked meal

123
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,400
and a dry hump
on the dance floor,

124
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,470
but still, we're all
getting drunk for a good cause.

125
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,200
Right?

126
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,640
Cheers.

127
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,310
Get him out of here.

128
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,370
lt's a bit difficult...

129
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,380
Well, bloody do something.

130
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,650
20 quid a head right there.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,020
Diwy a room rental,
maybe another 20.

132
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,320
30 on catering.

133
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,090
lt's got to be 50 quid
on overhead.

134
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,250
There you go, Jojo.

135
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,620
That's your cut.

136
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,820
Oh, l'm sorry.

137
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,020
You haven't met.

138
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,330
This is Jojo.

139
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,040
Actually, he's curious
about your dinner

140
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,240
because when l met him,
he was so hungry

141
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,370
he was trying
to eat his own tongue.

142
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,280
Funny enough, they don't do
Caesar salad with that.

143
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,280
No, listen,

144
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,050
l'll be honest, and l do want
to be honest.

145
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,090
He was a pile of bones

146
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,140
in a pool of shit,

147
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,420
and l don't mean
civilized shit either.

148
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,890
This was the yellow stuff,

149
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,550
liquid fucking evil.

150
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,530
Anyhow, l've got 2000 kids
in my camp in Africa

151
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,660
with the same problem,

152
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,930
and some fucking asshole here
has pulled our funding.

153
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,300
So l guess l'm just going
to have to feed them flies.

154
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,670
Now, Jojo here,
he wanted to know why.

155
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,930
So l showed him this.

156
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,040
''Due to the repressive
political climate,

157
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,200
''we can no longer sustain
a relief presence

158
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,180
in Communist-supported
Ethiopia.''

159
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,770
ls that a fair description,
Larry?

160
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,480
Or did you want
a more positive spin?

161
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,070
All right, Dr. Callahan.

162
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,550
You've said your piece.

163
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,780
Now you can leave.

164
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,190
Why don't you come up here?
Come on.

165
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,310
The kid just wants to hear
in words he can understand.

166
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,480
2,000 lives,
what does that buy you?

167
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,490
A new car?

168
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,190
A new pair of tits for the wife?

169
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,860
Well, come on, don't be shy.

170
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,420
l've got a camp

171
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,900
with 30,000 people,
dying at 40 a day.

172
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,900
l've got measles, typhoid,
cholera...

173
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,130
every miserable fucking disease

174
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,140
known to man.

175
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,540
Six weeks from now,
they'll all be dead.

176
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,680
Come on.

177
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,340
Talk to me.

178
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,720
Oh, l get it.

179
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,590
lt's the monkey joke, right?

180
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,090
You want him to go...

181
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,680
for you, yeah?

182
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,890
Oh, he'll do that.

183
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,890
He'll do that for you.

184
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,370
Jojo...

185
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,810
300 calories in one banana--

186
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,980
more than he gets in a day.

187
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,560
He'll do whatever you want.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,430
Jojo!

189
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,450
All right, you want to get down
out of the van now, please?

190
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,720
Sir?

191
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,630
Excuse me, sir.

192
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,690
Can you get down
from the vehicle now, please?

193
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,730
Come on. ln you go.

194
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,510
Dr. Callahan, l presume?

195
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,010
l was there tonight.

196
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,450
l was compelled.

197
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,490
EGRlS.

198
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,620
Sounds pretentious enough
to be a charity.

199
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,360
No, wait a minute, l remember.

200
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,900
l was in lndia when

201
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,900
you lot were working the
borders with Afghanistan.

202
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,940
Rumors were, you got in.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,470
There's a lot of people
still dying over there.

204
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,630
They always do, Doctor.

205
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,800
Yeah, well, l'm no warrior.

206
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,400
l'm in the relief business.

207
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
So l gathered.

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,180
So, here we are--

209
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,880
you with your relief work,
me with my relief work.

210
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,650
And isn't it a strange
coincidence,

211
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,250
because l need
to get into Ethiopia,

212
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,260
and you're already there.

213
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,920
No thanks.

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,220
l'd fund your work

215
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,060
of course.

216
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,260
No.

217
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,700
''l've got a camp with 30,000
people, dying at 40 a day.

218
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,570
ln six weeks time,
they'll all be dead.''

219
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,070
Slight exaggeration perhaps,

220
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,700
but very effective.

221
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,510
Since when did the ClA
give a shit

222
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,840
about the starving in Africa?

223
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,910
l presume you are ClA,
Mr. Steiger.

224
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,820
ldle curiosity...

225
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,520
Your performance tonight,

226
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,820
was it a cry for help,

227
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,020
or a cry for attention?

228
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,860
l'd call it a press conference.

229
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,660
No, a declaration
of independence.

230
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,630
Freedom is an
expensive commodity.

231
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,670
You should see what
l paid for your bail.

232
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,400
No deal.

233
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,100
Passion is cheap, Doctor.

234
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,080
lf you're looking
for a dancing bear,

235
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,110
try the fucking circus.

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,620
Hmm. Cigarettes at dawn.

237
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,860
Either you're deliriously happy,
or you haven't slept.

238
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,170
Do you need me
to call you a cab?

239
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,830
No, l already called one.

240
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,030
How's your hand?

241
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,100
Oh, it's fine.

242
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,900
So, Henry, is he, uh...?

243
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,250
Oh, he's-he's still sleeping.

244
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,280
Oh.

245
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,510
So...

246
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,350
l'm going to miss you.

247
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,190
Yeah, me, too.

248
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,190
But, you know, listen,

249
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,560
if it gets too English
over here,

250
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,100
you give me a call,
and l'll send you

251
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,530
a nice American care package
full of macaroni and cheese

252
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,330
and apple pie,
and a pair of sneakers.

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,600
That'll go over well here in
fashionable London, l'm sure.

254
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,430
Hello?

255
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,940
-Cab for Ms. Jordan.
-Okay, thank you.

256
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,380
Well, it's here.

257
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,540
Tell Mr. Sleepy Pants,

258
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,050
that l said good-bye,
pip-pip, cheerio,

259
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,850
or whatever the hell
they do here.

260
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,850
l love you.

261
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,180
l love you, too.

262
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,410
Bye, sis.

263
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,420
-Take care.
-You, too.

264
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,290
...the boy escaped
while being transferred

265
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,890
to the immigration
facility at Heathrow Airport.

266
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,690
His body was found
early this morning

267
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,730
here under Junction Five.

268
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,060
lnitial reports suggest
he died of hypothermia.

269
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,040
A spokesman
for the lmmigration Department

270
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,900
blamed the security lapse
on staff shortages.

271
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,600
We are told that the boy
was arrested the previous night

272
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,700
in a disturbance at a charity
ball in a London hotel.

273
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,610
A man identified
as Nicholas Callahan,

274
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,510
a relief worker in Ethiopia,

275
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,020
interrupted the event
with an emotional plea

276
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,650
for more help in Africa.

277
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,920
At Junction Five,
Aidan Pickering, LNS.

278
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,720
When Dubuque started,

279
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,730
you could see how much
she owed to Van Gogh.

280
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,090
She didn't hide it;
it's in all her landscapes,

281
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,690
But if you look here, what she's
doing in this abstract

282
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,830
is something much more
calculated, more developed.

283
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,600
The way she takes the-the theme
of attraction and repulsion,

284
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,170
dark against light.

285
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,580
Over here, another piece,
which l think

286
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,050
has even more emotional depth.

287
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,080
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

288
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,850
Now, we do have...
other examples of her work,

289
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,690
which l think you should see.

290
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,730
Sweetheart, are you sure you
know what you're doing?

291
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,060
Yes, l do.

292
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,150
And before you say anything,
l've spoken

293
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,700
to all the relevant relief
organizations and embassies,

294
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,860
and with 40,000 pounds...

295
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,870
40,000 pounds?

296
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,100
What are you talking about?

297
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,540
Where are you going
to find 40,000...?

298
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,630
...and supplies from surplus
regions in Southern Sudan.

299
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,510
And from there,
l transport them to Tigre.

300
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,740
l've cleared out my savings,

301
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,400
l'm still short about 8,000.

302
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,110
But, Sarah, this isn't
how it's done.

303
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,110
You don't go...

304
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,740
Henry, Henry.
l've made up my mind.

305
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,450
Well, then send the money,
do charitable work, whatever,

306
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,490
but don't go roaring off

307
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,920
to some godforsaken hole
in Africa

308
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,250
just to salve your conscience.

309
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,260
lt's just too...

310
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,590
Too what?

311
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,750
Well, it's not the most
grown-up way to deal with

312
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,590
this situation.

313
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,720
Well, maybe l don't want
to grow up.

314
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,170
Fine...

315
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,610
Fine.

316
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,640
lf that's what you want,

317
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,400
-lt is.
-then fine.

318
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,500
Then...

319
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,880
l'll help you find the money.

320
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,040
Thank you.

321
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,610
l'll talk to Dad.

322
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,750
He knows everybody.

323
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,020
Mind you, Ethiopia is a bit...

324
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,420
lt'll be fine.

325
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,980
lt'll be fine.
We'll find the money.

326
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,890
Come with me.

327
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,520
Honey, even if l could...

328
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,620
You can't?

329
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,830
No, it's not that.

330
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,870
You know me, l'm not made
for that kind of thing.

331
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,670
l'm a city boy. l need
four walls and a bed.

332
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,400
Besides, l've got meetings
up to here

333
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,500
for the next month.

334
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,710
You should go.

335
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,310
You've got the right attitude.

336
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,480
Listen, l know this sounds
like Little Miss Bleeding Heart

337
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,920
and all that...
l just, l don't care.

338
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,790
l know l'm being crazy
and driving you crazy,

339
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,160
and of course l understand
you can't come, but...

340
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,820
you meet me off the plane?

341
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,800
You meet me off the plane?

342
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,840
Of course l'll meet
you off the plane.

343
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,630
Three years and no rain,
not a drop.

344
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,070
That, and war.

345
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,010
People leave their homes,
they walk for many days.

346
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,570
We only have ten camps
on the south side.

347
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,810
Too many people,
not enough camps.

348
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,750
Measles, you know measles?

349
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,880
Yes, of course.

350
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,430
We lose more people
to measles and diarrhea.

351
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,090
Many die, no vaccine.

352
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,890
-We brought some vaccines...
-Also cholera, everywhere.

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,230
We dig very deep now
for good water.

354
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,640
Starvation everywhere,
death is everywhere.

355
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,310
You speak English very well.

356
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,110
Missionaries teach me.

357
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,580
Yeah?

358
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,810
So are you married?

359
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,790
-Do you have a husband?
-Man? Bullshit.

360
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,910
l need no man.

361
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,180
They beg to marry me,
many times,

362
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,820
but l drive truck.

363
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,220
Lazy man, good-for-nothing.

364
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,320
l'm too old now anyway.

365
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,560
No man in my village
want woman over 18.

366
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,730
ln my tribe, it's 30.

367
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,200
Stop.

368
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,870
Stop the truck. Stop. Stop!

369
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,570
Abraha!

370
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,870
Abraha!

371
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,840
Abraha...

372
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,180
ls this your son?

373
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,690
This your son?

374
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,420
Abraha...

375
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,590
Abraha?

376
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,530
Ab-Ab...

377
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,430
No baby.

378
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,060
We go.
Too dangerous to stop.

379
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,030
We go now.

380
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,080
ls a waste.

381
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,680
Child and mother, both a waste.

382
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,190
Stupid baby woman.

383
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,650
Tula, shut up.

384
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,850
l'll give you four bags.

385
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,330
Four bags not enough.

386
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,370
l take one truck.

387
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,920
You want to tell them that
you're taking half their food?

388
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,470
How many are you?
50? A hundred?

389
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,560
My men fight...

390
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,200
l know, l know--
for the people.

391
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,170
Mm.

392
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,990
lt's good.

393
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,370
No. No, no, no, no.

394
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,440
Eight bags.

395
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,450
Four each truck.

396
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,140
This is fair.

397
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,780
Hmm, Mr. Elliott?

398
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,910
Fair, yes?

399
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,320
Welcome to famine relief.

400
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,830
Okay, kill it!

401
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,910
Hold his legs, okay?

402
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,230
Excuse me.

403
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,570
Excuse me.

404
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,570
This child,
his mother's in the truck.

405
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,800
She's wounded.

406
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,750
-Too late.
-What?

407
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,200
Too late, as in no point.

408
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,200
Why?

409
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,390
Why?

410
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,330
Well, quite apart from
any illnesses they may have,

411
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,890
they're too weak to survive.

412
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,300
You, just...

413
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,500
You just decide that?

414
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,130
lt's called triage.
l'm a doctor.

415
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,470
-l've got 30,000...
-l know.

416
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,030
l heard that already in London.

417
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,770
You did?

418
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,480
Yes. l still think
you should help them.

419
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,610
Oh, you do, do you?

420
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,650
Yes, l do.

421
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,150
l see. You pay
for these trucks,

422
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,590
so l have to indulge
some fucking white girl's idea

423
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,590
of heroism, right?

424
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,220
Well, why stop there?
Do you want a picture?

425
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,320
l can get you a picture

426
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,730
of ''poor little rich girl
holds dying black baby.''

427
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,760
You do your hair right,
you'll look great.

428
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,530
l saw the child from the truck.

429
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,900
l picked him up,
his mother was wounded.

430
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,900
l brought her, too.

431
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,400
Can you please look at them?

432
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,070
Seems fair.

433
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,220
Kat.

434
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,390
Hi.

435
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,360
Hi.
l'm Kat.

436
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,170
Okay, so...
l'm the chief administrator

437
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,730
and logistician, if that
doesn't sound too pompous,

438
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,100
and you've met Nick,

439
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,080
who's our team leader
and full-time doctor.

440
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,080
He's got a lot on his hands
right now.

441
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,850
So this is
the food-distribution center.

442
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,450
Low-tech but effective,

443
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,890
like the rest of us.

444
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,430
The food supplies l brought,
how long will they last?

445
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,360
Oh, three or four days, maybe.

446
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,630
That's it?

447
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,830
l'm afraid so, yeah.

448
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,370
What are you going to do
when the food runs out?

449
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,500
Well, we usually find a way.

450
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,040
Same old story really,
you know--

451
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,700
money, or the lack of it,

452
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,150
but with help, we get by.

453
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,410
Um, l don't think
you want to go...

454
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,540
ls it all right?

455
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,110
Sure. Yeah.

456
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,620
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Bauford.

457
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,230
Sorry about the mess.

458
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,100
You won't see this
in medical school.

459
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,440
Cut.

460
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,840
lf you're going to throw up,

461
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,910
close your eyes.

462
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,920
Think of ponies

463
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,250
and ice cream.

464
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,620
ls that... perfume?

465
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,920
You're wearing perfume in the
middle of the fucking desert.

466
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,550
Ha-ha.

467
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,090
The boy, has he been looked at?

468
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,800
Yes, ma'am. Checking him now.

469
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,240
One shed over.

470
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,570
As you instructed.

471
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,380
-What does it mean?
-Sew it up.

472
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,970
Monica, get her a Fanta.

473
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,760
lt's weird isn't it?

474
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,060
All those plans you have,

475
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,360
places to go, people to meet.

476
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,400
All that matters
in her whole world is that.

477
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,670
Just one suck of soda,
that's all she lives for.

478
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,800
She's in pain--
can't you give her something?

479
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,810
Oh, yeah, sure.

480
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,280
Monica, call down
to the pharmacy

481
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,640
for more morphine, could you?

482
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,650
Where do you think you are,
Saint Elsewhere?

483
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,940
She's in pain.

484
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,950
She's beyond pain.

485
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,910
Have you asked her that?

486
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,390
Hamadi.

487
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,750
Ask her if it hurts.

488
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,540
She, uh...

489
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,380
says she feels
the pain of hunger, but

490
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,040
she knows that death
more hungry than pain,

491
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,050
so, she gives thanks.

492
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,380
She gives thanks to you.

493
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,860
She calls you by a new name.

494
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,090
Matanay.

495
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,250
''He who steals from Death.''

496
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,500
He's got a fever,
and he's in shock.

497
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,700
lncrease the fluids.
Antibiotics.

498
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,880
You really think he's going
to sit up and take a drink?

499
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,880
l was just...

500
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,880
He's dying.

501
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,040
You'd better move his lips,

502
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,140
or he won't take a cup.

503
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,280
l was just trying to help.

504
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,290
To help, you have

505
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,380
to know what you're doing.

506
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,820
Look, l know
you think l'm stupid,

507
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,020
and you want me to go home.

508
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,620
You don't have
to waste any more time

509
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,390
trying to make that clear to me.

510
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,330
Get some H.E.M.

511
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,600
High Energy Milk.

512
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,610
Monica will give it to you.

513
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,940
You tease around his mouth
with your finger.

514
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,270
You let him suck it out,
small amounts only.

515
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,900
lf he revives, call the nurse.

516
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,110
lf he doesn't...

517
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,350
at least he'll have someone
with him when he dies.

518
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,900
How many?

519
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,840
Kat?

520
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,900
1 1 from last night.

521
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,240
12.

522
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,570
The ten-year-old.

523
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,550
That makes 39.

524
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,840
So there's more than yesterday.

525
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,850
l know.

526
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,150
Right, and you'd better hire

527
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,740
extra men from the camp
and get them digging more holes.

528
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,790
Put them on night shift
so nobody sees them.

529
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,760
Can't have people dying
of depression, eh?

530
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,130
How's the water coming, Joss?

531
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,530
Nothing so far.

532
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,230
Drive shaft
is close to buggering,

533
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,740
and we're down to two liters
per person per day.

534
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,570
What about the tankers?

535
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,440
Yeah, sure. That's piss
in a bucket, mate.

536
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,200
Basically, if we don't
get the new well

537
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,900
up and running, we're knackered.

538
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,540
Okay, so what
do you need exactly?

539
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,550
l just told you.

540
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,210
A new drive shaft.

541
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,980
Okay, l'm going to see
what l can do.

542
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,800
Well, the good news,
boys and girls,

543
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,760
is that the government's
finally coming tomorrow.

544
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,130
l got confirmation today

545
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,230
that Mr. Ningpopo himself
will be here.

546
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,100
For about an hour.

547
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,300
That long?

548
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,300
Well, you never know.

549
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,400
-We might get lucky.
-Right.

550
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,500
Here's what we're going to do.

551
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,910
First thing
in the morning, we're going

552
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,910
to break open the new supplies,

553
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,950
start immunizing
all the children

554
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,940
against measles,
youngest first,

555
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,540
up the line, until we run out.

556
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,050
Okay? Kat, Monica: l want you

557
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,640
to get onto that
as early as possible.

558
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,710
All right.

559
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,120
l'll set up the call chain
and check the syringes.

560
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,820
No, l'm going to need you
with me, and you, Tula.

561
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,050
-Joss.
-Yeah.

562
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,460
Sanitation.

563
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,320
l think you need
to take your team

564
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,760
and cut a new defecation area
somewhere beyond the camp.

565
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,760
Yeah, and let's just

566
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,760
chlorinate all the water, okay?

567
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,800
All of it.

568
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,390
Yeah, the tankard water
is absolutely fine.

569
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,400
Fuck the tanker water.
Just chlorinate the lot.

570
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,990
There's too much infection
to risk leaving it, okay?

571
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,160
Okay.

572
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,400
Okay.

573
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,530
Good.

574
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,510
All right, make sure
you get me your requests

575
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,600
for Ningpopo
as soon as possible.

576
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,170
Two hookers
and a single to Melbourne.

577
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,650
Business or coach?

578
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,890
Good night, Sarah.

579
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,920
Good night.

580
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,890
Oh, l forgot.

581
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,900
The boy's mother.

582
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,270
She died.

583
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,050
We've got about ten days left.

584
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,950
Maybe two weeks,
if we're lucky.

585
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,320
What happened with USAlD?

586
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,720
Nothing.

587
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,090
CARE?

588
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,630
CARE, USAlD, the OXFAM, WFB...

589
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,860
they don't want to know.

590
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,870
Everyone l spoke to

591
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,870
in Addis had an acute case

592
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,870
of compassion fatigue.

593
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,870
How 'bout the old man?

594
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,240
The trust fund?

595
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,740
My father was the politest
''fuck you'' l ever got.

596
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,410
What about Steiger?

597
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,310
Some small favors,

598
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,780
a little info on...

599
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,910
Yeah, stash a shitload
of weapons...

600
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,850
So what if he's fucking over
the Marxists...

601
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,350
l'm not getting into business
with those people.

602
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,650
Listen, Elliott, if it's
all we got, l don't see why...

603
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,890
-There is no way...
-Why not for, Christ's sake?

604
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,660
Because that's not how
we started!

605
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,930
And because l wouldn't
have it any other way.

606
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,230
What the hell is that?

607
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,370
Schumann, l think.

608
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,360
Hi.

609
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,870
''l dream of childhood.

610
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,540
''l dream of love.

611
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,350
''Of a garden where
a boy plays,

612
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,610
forever young.''

613
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,850
''Themes from Childhood.''

614
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,290
Part of a series
from Schumann's ''Lederhosen.''

615
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,920
<i>Lederhosen are trousers.</i>

616
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,460
Ah.

617
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,200
<i>The German for song is lieder.</i>

618
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,860
<i>Lieder.</i>

619
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,270
Yes, correct.

620
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,210
ls there something you wanted?

621
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,690
The baby.

622
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
You tried the H.E.M.?

623
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,460
Yes.

624
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,190
And?

625
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,200
And no change.

626
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,600
Sometimes it takes a while.

627
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,500
Hey, woman, come, come.

628
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,180
Yes.

629
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,310
One life.

630
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,190
Ningpopo's here.

631
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,970
Look right now
we're at 800 calories a day.

632
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,370
ln a few days
it will be down to 500.

633
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,370
The bottom line is,

634
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,600
we're not going to make
next week's distribution.

635
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,900
Not a chance.

636
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,770
And that raises
the issue of security.

637
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,640
lf l can't get these people
more food,

638
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,680
l can't guarantee
the safety of my staff.

639
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,880
Food, security.

640
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,680
l believe these are listed
as separate issues.

641
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:17,450
Yes, but l'm sure you'd
agree they're connected.

642
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,410
Well, if we could get
some emergency corn,

643
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,440
that'd be a start.

644
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,410
l will raise it with the WFB.

645
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,410
Thank you.

646
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,740
They owe us since
August anyway.

647
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,940
-Excuse me?
-Any emergency corn

648
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,210
would be greatly appreciated.

649
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,380
l'm sorry, excuse me,
who owes you?

650
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,720
The WFB.
Three months of corn.

651
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,780
lt'll be in your notes.

652
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,880
There's no reference
to the WFB in my notes.

653
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,820
Then your notes are wrong.

654
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,330
Okay, we can move on...

655
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,950
to the issue of security.

656
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,360
Our soldiers have no experience
of this order, Mr. Hauser.

657
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,900
Please, we have another meeting
at Kromer Camp at 4:00 p.m.

658
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,730
lf we can deal with
these matters separately

659
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,790
and in the proper order.

660
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,340
lt is no good to jump
from food to security.

661
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,340
This is not coherent.

662
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,500
Not coherent?

663
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,240
Listen, they don't get
enough food, they get hungry.

664
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,570
lf they get hungry,
they get desperate,

665
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,580
they wreck the camp.

666
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,740
That is a security issue.

667
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,910
Please do not raise your voice.

668
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,450
For Christ's sake, they're
all fucking dying out there.

669
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,180
Will you please
stop talking bollocks

670
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,120
and start getting some
food delivered now.

671
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,250
No excuses,
no money changing hands,

672
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,480
just do it.

673
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,530
l find this innuendo most
disturbing, Dr. Callahan.

674
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,620
l can assure you, not
a single dollar changes hands

675
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,250
without authorization.

676
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,060
Procedures of the
utmost importance...

677
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,260
Procedures, my fucking ass.

678
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,930
You've got friends
in the water-trucking business

679
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,930
whose sole aim in life

680
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,830
is to hike up the price
by restricting delivery.

681
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,840
You seriously telling me

682
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,430
those shitheads are
following procedure?

683
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,440
l find this outrageous,

684
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,440
especially coming from you.

685
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,700
What do you mean
especially coming from me?

686
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,440
To take a refugee boy
from the camp

687
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,600
without authorization

688
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,510
to die like an animal
in a country he does not know?

689
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,670
The death of a child

690
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,840
is not a minor
violation, Dr. Callahan.

691
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,050
l can assure you,

692
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,150
you are under
serious investigation.

693
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:14,700
What?

694
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,900
He'd never have given
us anything anyway.

695
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,640
Well, he certainly isn't
going to now.

696
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,910
What happened to his car?

697
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,750
Will that fit our wellhead?

698
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,820
Do kangaroos crap in the bush?

699
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,840
We've got no choice.

700
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,810
We need Steiger.

701
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,310
Dr. Callahan?

702
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,530
Sorry, l...

703
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,470
l just have some
traveler's checks.

704
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,880
l'm leaving tomorrow, so l...
l thought l'd leave them here.

705
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,610
Elliott usually deals
with all that.

706
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,170
Should l give them...?

707
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,010
No, l mean, it's okay,
l'll give them to him.

708
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,080
Okay.

709
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,890
So... is he going
to shut you down?

710
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,480
Maybe.

711
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,590
But we always turn up again...
somewhere.

712
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,860
l really admire you
for the work you do.

713
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,900
Oh, Jesus. ''Admire,''
what does that mean?

714
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,100
Why are you so difficult

715
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,870
-to talk to?
-Why are you?

716
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,930
Why do you never say my name?

717
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,700
Sorry?

718
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,800
You never say my name.

719
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,280
Why?

720
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:06,040
What's the first thing you
do when you get a cold?

721
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,450
What?

722
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,880
What is the first thing you
do when you get a cold?

723
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,820
Chicken soup, aspirin, scotch.

724
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:16,380
You ever just have the cold?

725
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,500
l don't under...

726
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,360
Taken nothing,
just have the cold.

727
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,360
-No.
-No.

728
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,900
And that's us, right?

729
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,090
We drown it, kill it, numb it.

730
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,760
Anything not to feel.

731
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,900
You know, when l was
a doctor in London,

732
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,600
no one ever said ''matanay.''

733
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,740
They don't thank you
like they thank you here

734
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,340
'cause here
they feel everything.

735
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,540
Straight from God.

736
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,380
There's no drugs,
there's no painkillers.

737
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:45,320
lt's the weirdest,
purest thing-- suffering.

738
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,690
And when you've seen that
kind of courage in a lit...

739
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,900
...in a child...

740
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,940
how could you ever want
to do anything

741
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,670
but just take them in your arm?

742
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,040
You remember that boy in London.
Jojo?

743
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,050
Yes, of course.

744
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,880
He was my first save,
ten years old.

745
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,320
So thin he could barely stand.

746
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:21,690
But he still found the strength
to bury the rest of his family.

747
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,360
We have no idea what courage is.

748
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:34,510
He used to write me
these little notes.

749
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:35,560
He helped me in the clinic.

750
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,910
He was good.

751
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,710
He was sweet, he was good.

752
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,180
He wanted to be like me,
l liked that.

753
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,720
l mean, it was silly
and childish,

754
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,510
but it made me feel good
about myself.

755
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,250
So l took him with me to London,

756
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,620
you know, my talisman,
my courageous Africa.

757
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,290
How could l be so bloody stupid?

758
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,990
How could l be
so totally selfish?

759
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:15,310
The point is...

760
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,820
he was my friend.

761
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,650
He had a name.

762
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,420
So now l have to remember him.

763
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,360
lf everyone l lose has a name...

764
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,560
Hey.

765
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,560
Hey.

766
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,900
You all set?

767
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,130
Yeah.

768
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,530
Said your good-byes?

769
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,700
Yeah.

770
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,070
Well.

771
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,070
Yeah.

772
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,070
Oh, um,

773
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,440
this is my friend at UNHCR.

774
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,840
She'll always know
how to get ahold of us.

775
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,750
And that's a very good
group of people.

776
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,840
lf you ever want
to jump in there...

777
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,940
Okay.

778
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,150
Um...

779
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,350
l'm so glad
that you came, Sarah.

780
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,420
lt meant a lot to us.

781
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,430
Oh, thank you.

782
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,550
No, no, l'm thanking you.

783
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,690
<i>Mikanalay.</i>

784
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,320
lt means ''thank you.''

785
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,960
<i>And then you say, ''Genzubka,''</i>

786
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,770
which means, ''You're welcome.''

787
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,770
<i>Genzubka.</i>

788
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,770
Yeah, pretty good.

789
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,370
Well, very Buddhist.

790
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,840
Do Buddhists hug?

791
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,880
Sure l hug, l'm American.

792
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,410
l hug everything.

793
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,690
Ah, Nick's up at the well.

794
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,990
-You want me to get him?
-No, no.

795
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,400
Good-bye.

796
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,660
Good-bye.

797
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,720
You take care of yourself...

798
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,500
and everybody else.

799
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,400
l'll try.

800
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:21,940
Keep in touch.

801
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,940
Jim.

802
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,280
Hey, come on.

803
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:41,280
Jim!

804
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,950
Baby, Mommy's got
some work to do.

805
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,110
Come on, honey.
Come here.

806
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,280
lt's okay.
lt's okay, sweetie.

807
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,620
Honey, l'm going
to count to five.

808
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,620
-No.
-One...

809
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,180
two, three...

810
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,480
l'll read you two chapters.

811
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,830
No. Three.

812
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,130
Okay, three.

813
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,330
You are nothing

814
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,700
but a minx-ish minx.

815
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,070
Daddy!

816
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:03,770
Yeah, hello.

817
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,830
Mommy says l can have
three chapters.

818
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:06,840
Three chapters?

819
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,400
Excellent.

820
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,670
Would you mind
reading to him tonight?

821
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,510
l have some work to do.

822
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,670
Sure.

823
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,480
Jim, go on, jump into bed.

824
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,810
-Oh!
-Quick kicks!

825
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,680
Dad'll be there in a minute.

826
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,380
So what's he reading?

827
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,860
lt's on his bedside table.

828
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:24,020
Right.

829
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,760
About tomorrow...

830
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,060
l'm in the office all day.

831
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,930
lt's just, l need
to keep looking for work.

832
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,030
l thought you were going
to make calls from home.

833
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,300
Well, l-l just should go in.

834
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,460
Half the city is looking.

835
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,940
l can't compete
unless l'm there.

836
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,200
Can't your father call somebody?

837
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,940
He's already done
everything he can.

838
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,740
Dad lost everything
in the market crash,

839
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,750
like everybody else.

840
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,940
l know that.

841
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,740
l know, l'm sorry.

842
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,750
l'm sorry.

843
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,450
So...

844
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,650
l think l should go in.

845
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,190
Henry, l arranged meetings,

846
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,620
especially because you said
you'd do the school run.

847
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,530
Well, can't we ask someone?

848
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,090
There must be people
at his school...

849
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,030
You call.

850
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,830
l'm sick of asking for favors.

851
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,700
Don't. Don't!

852
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,700
You didn't bother doing it
in the first place,

853
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:07,700
don't do it now.

854
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,700
l was trying to help.

855
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:09,710
No, you were bargaining.

856
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:11,000
What if l was?

857
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,610
ls that a crime?

858
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,380
You know, because l can argue...

859
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:18,920
l can shout.

860
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,210
l hate this situation.

861
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:25,090
l hate not having a job.

862
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,320
l don't see what good

863
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,760
it does to make each other
feel worse than we already do.

864
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,930
Sarah.

865
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,200
Look at this room--
it's a mess.

866
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,070
We'll sort it out.

867
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,610
Things will pick up.

868
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:48,140
There's a chance, l've got
a meeting with this guy

869
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,510
who's really big in futures,

870
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,850
and l'm going to try
and get a meeting with him.

871
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,580
We will sort it out.

872
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,090
He's waiting for you
to read to him.

873
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,560
Okay.

874
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,120
Thanks.

875
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:29,590
l understand.

876
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:33,420
Michael...
Michael, that's bullshit.

877
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,390
UNHCR sends more aid to Honduras
than any other UN agency.

878
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,450
Even as l speak...

879
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,430
Well, most people don't even
know where Honduras is.

880
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,090
...East and West Berliners alike
are tearing down

881
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,690
the greatest symbol
of Communist repression...

882
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,700
No.

883
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:50,170
North of Panama
in the Caribbean Sea.

884
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,730
But you must keep repeating it
to yourself to believe it.

885
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,400
The Berlin Wall
is finally coming down.

886
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,280
And the sense of hope
you get here...

887
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,820
Which is precisely
why l need aid.

888
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,870
November 9, 1989,

889
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,180
a night that marked the opening
of a new chapter

890
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,350
in world history.

891
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,790
Michael,
l have to call you back.

892
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,880
Okay.

893
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,460
UNHCR.

894
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:09,620
Sarah?

895
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:10,990
Yes. Who's calling?

896
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,890
Uh, it's me, Elliott.

897
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,560
Elliott?

898
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,890
Hi.

899
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,130
Hi!

900
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,030
How... how are you?
Are you okay?

901
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,040
Oh, oh, yeah.

902
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,040
Where are you?

903
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,400
Um, Oh, l'm actually,
believe it or not,

904
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,240
l'm here in a phone booth
in-in London.

905
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,250
Oh, my God.

906
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,140
You know, l'm sorry,
there's a terrible connection...

907
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,180
but nothing seems to work
in this shitty place.

908
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,340
When can l see you?

909
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,680
Oh, uh, well, um...

910
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,690
l'm in the Holland Park
Tube Station right now.

911
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,020
Uh, could you meet me
by the entrance to the park?

912
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,250
Yeah.

913
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,120
-Oh...
-Yes, yes, of course!

914
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,460
-Great.
-Um, uh...

915
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,620
1 :30, is that... is that okay?

916
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,690
Sounds perfect.

917
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,280
Henry?

918
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,280
Hi, honey.

919
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,840
Bea just popped around
to say hello.

920
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,890
Do you remember Bea?
She used to work with Dad.

921
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,010
Hi, there.

922
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,390
Hi.

923
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,790
l thought you had job interviews
today.

924
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,520
Uh, they all got canceled.

925
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,760
Oh.

926
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,370
l-l just came by to get
some warm stuff for Jimmy,

927
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,910
so l'm going to go pick him up.

928
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,050
Hello.

929
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,850
Hey.

930
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,190
He-He-Hey.

931
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,790
Oh...

932
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,430
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you.

933
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,200
Here, come, sit.

934
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,600
Oh, gosh, it's good to see you.

935
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,970
Well, you, too.

936
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,510
So you got my last letter?

937
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,340
Yeah. You were in Pakistan.

938
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,510
Pakistan?

939
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,180
That was months ago.

940
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,180
Haven't l...?

941
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,880
You've been busy saving lives.

942
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:17,610
lt's okay, l forgive you.

943
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:21,020
Well... well, we're not
in Pakistan anymore.

944
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:24,060
We're in Cambodia,
by the Thai border.

945
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,830
You okay?

946
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,390
How's home?

947
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:31,560
Fine.

948
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,400
Jimmy?

949
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:34,900
Gorgeous.

950
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,670
<i>But bien sur.</i>

951
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:42,110
So, you're in London, and you
called me out of the blue.

952
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,120
ls that because l'm with the
United Nations or just because

953
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,450
l'd never forgive you
if you didn't?

954
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,920
Both.

955
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,480
Tell me.

956
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,680
What do you know
about Cambodia?

957
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,690
There's a civil war going on,

958
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,860
Communist coalition forces
headed by the Khmer Rouge

959
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:03,490
versus Communist Vietnamese
running the government.

960
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,700
l believe the British
calls it political irony.

961
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,640
Yeah. Well, Nick calls
it a clusterfuck.

962
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,830
But that's Nick,

963
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:11,810
not one that minces words.

964
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,810
How is he?

965
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,510
ls he good?

966
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,880
He's Nick.

967
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,510
Was it his idea for you
to come here?

968
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,880
No. No, both of us.

969
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,750
l mean, l... l wanted
to see you anyway,

970
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,620
and you know,
l always do this...

971
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,160
Nick can't pitch to...
save his life.

972
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,460
Well, you saw that.

973
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,830
Sorry, where, where,
where was l?

974
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,130
Cambodia.

975
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,470
Ah, right.

976
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,900
Well...
according to Washington,

977
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,530
the place doesn't
officially exist,

978
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,910
although there's something
like half a million people

979
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,880
living under Khmer Rouge
domination.

980
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:50,040
Dysentery, measles,

981
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,140
pneumonia,
no vaccines, of course,

982
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,910
so death rates run
15 to 20 people a day

983
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:58,510
in every village, and there's
land mines, lots of them.

984
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,650
So, we have amputees
without prosthetics.

985
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,220
lt's not a happy place.

986
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,560
So what do you need?

987
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,600
Well, l put together
a shipment of supplies,

988
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,630
vaccines, medicines, the usual.

989
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,260
But there's so much corruption
out there, l was wondering,

990
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,360
l mean, the thing
would be if...

991
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,930
Elliott, just...
just say it.

992
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,570
lf we could put
a UN stamp on it.

993
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,240
l mean, the point is, the UN
name still means something.

994
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,080
You know, just a little bit
of extra protection.

995
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,950
Obviously, l would take
full responsibility.

996
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,680
You just do
the paperwork.

997
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:33,350
Well, we do have shipments going
into Thailand and Cambodia.

998
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,920
So, l'll attach your name
to the list.

999
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,330
Thank you.

1000
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,920
And l'll go with it.
l'll see it through.

1001
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,090
Oh, no, you don't need to.

1002
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,760
l know, but l do this now.

1003
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,960
Yeah, but Cambodia
is different.

1004
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,070
l'll see it through.

1005
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,260
So, what is it,
what do they want?

1006
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:13,260
Money, Miss Sarah.

1007
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,300
Shit! They see you,
they want more.

1008
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:16,630
Alway more money, huh?!

1009
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,310
-l'm not playing their games.
-What?

1010
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:23,810
l'm not giving them
any more money.

1011
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,900
They want their money.

1012
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,810
They've already gotten
the ten percent

1013
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,110
-that's written in the contract.
-Contract shit, you pay.

1014
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,650
-No.
-Miss Sarah.

1015
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,310
l'm not giving them
any more money.

1016
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,150
They need more, you pay.
You no say no.

1017
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,810
Tell them to get the
rest of that shipment

1018
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,410
-off the boat right now.
-What? Or what?

1019
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:40,420
What you do?

1020
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:41,820
This not Chelsea football.

1021
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:42,950
This Cambodia.

1022
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,990
You pay. You pay!

1023
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:03,450
lt's two weeks late.

1024
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,010
What the hell
is going on, Steiger?

1025
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,660
You want a beer?

1026
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,350
l want to know what's going on.

1027
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,730
Crates were late, so...

1028
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,730
Shit happens. So what?

1029
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,030
Have you got any idea how fast

1030
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,900
a measles epidemic
spreads in two weeks?

1031
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,060
l've got enough stains
in my laundry, Callahan.

1032
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,870
You're not my only child.

1033
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,800
Just give me the money.

1034
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,480
Bringing your titty
from the UN was a smart idea.

1035
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,250
You want to screw?
Take your pick.

1036
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,250
Twenty-five thousand.

1037
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,990
And tell that sorry excuse
for a colonel

1038
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,790
that it's 25 more
than he deserves.

1039
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:48,800
Mrs. Bauford is waiting.

1040
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:49,800
Listen, you piece of shit.

1041
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:50,960
Fucking with me is one thing,

1042
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,200
but if anything happens
to her...

1043
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,360
Then what?

1044
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,640
Remember, Callahan, l'm the guy
that makes you possible.

1045
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:59,370
You owe me, you took
the fucking money,

1046
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,000
now you will do this,
and you will do this right.

1047
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,380
What's the matter?
Scared of the dark?

1048
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,450
Now fuck off and save lives.

1049
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,770
How'd that happen?

1050
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,960
lf l can ask.

1051
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,270
Oh.

1052
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,170
Before time,

1053
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:11,180
l was sick, bad lung, TB.

1054
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,840
At this time no doctor
where l live.

1055
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,890
Khmer Rouge kill our doctor.

1056
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:19,750
So, l walk to border
for medicine,

1057
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:24,230
but l must cross
the mine field first.

1058
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,560
You never forget that sound.

1059
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,000
The first thing you hear
is click.

1060
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,730
lt's your foot priming
the land mine.

1061
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,290
Soon as you hear it,

1062
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,340
it's over.

1063
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,430
But your mind go crazy,
you know?

1064
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,380
You thinking, maybe if l jump,

1065
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:46,280
maybe if l find a rock
to match my weight...

1066
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:50,410
But it's nothing you can do.

1067
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,420
You hear the click
and big bye-bye.

1068
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,150
But,

1069
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:57,320
l was lucky.

1070
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,920
Just lose my leg.

1071
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,320
Any problems?

1072
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:29,980
None.

1073
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,640
You're not wearing perfume.

1074
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:09,290
So, are you going to tell me
where we're going?

1075
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:12,630
A place near Pailin,

1076
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,670
by the border.

1077
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,170
And the boat's
the best way to travel?

1078
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,180
You don't like my boat?

1079
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,100
l think it's very you.

1080
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,880
lt's safer.

1081
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,590
Avoids the road blocks,

1082
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,560
the Viet troops,
plus other assorted madness.

1083
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:36,350
You know, heart of darkness.

1084
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,590
The horror.

1085
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,060
Actually it is.

1086
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,530
Horrible.

1087
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,730
And now you're going
to tell me why.

1088
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,200
Well, Elliott's no good, is he?

1089
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,500
All he gives you is
the Buddhist version,

1090
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,630
all fucking temples

1091
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,970
and gentle people,
which is bollocks.

1092
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,140
The Khmer Rouge--

1093
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,480
rouge being very much
the appropriate color--

1094
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:58,950
used Pailin as a hideout.

1095
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,250
Everyone lives
in absolute terror.

1096
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,550
They use the women
as baby-making factories,

1097
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,920
the kids as mine sweepers,

1098
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:07,120
and just in case
we actually help anybody,

1099
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,720
they come and steal everything

1100
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:09,920
that we don't hide.

1101
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,020
So why do they let you
stay at all?

1102
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,260
They've got no doctors.

1103
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,610
l should be singing
''Old Man River.''

1104
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,670
Please don't.

1105
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,260
Colonel Tao,
how are you doing?

1106
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,240
lt's good to see you again.

1107
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:47,250
The boxes, they for who?

1108
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,790
Well, you know who they're for.

1109
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,950
l give you my word.

1110
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,650
This goes only
to the women and children.

1111
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,830
Wait, easy, that's medicine,
for Christ's sake!

1112
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,020
l don't understand,
what's the problem?

1113
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:28,990
lt's a laptop.

1114
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,290
Every NGO has got one.

1115
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,920
That's the way
we do business here.

1116
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,560
Don't throw those away.

1117
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,640
People's lives depend on that,
for fuck's sake!

1118
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,210
-Colonel...
-Sarah...

1119
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,210
l'm with UNHCR, United Nations.

1120
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,440
This cargo is protected.

1121
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:47,380
lf this shipment is harmed
in any way,

1122
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,970
your name will surface
in the follow-up investigation.

1123
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:50,020
l don't...

1124
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,170
l promise you,
l know nothing about this.

1125
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,300
Somebody must have...

1126
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,260
Colonel Tao, you know me.

1127
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,430
l swear to God,

1128
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,700
l don't...

1129
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,780
Son of a bitch!

1130
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,600
What was that?

1131
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,760
You explain it to me.

1132
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,130
l can't explain it to you.

1133
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,140
We were set up.

1134
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,330
l knew nothing about that book,

1135
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:25,800
what was in the box,
the equipment...

1136
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:28,430
Did you know about the guns?

1137
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,100
Did you know about the guns?

1138
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,410
Answer me!
Did you know...?

1139
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,610
Yes, l knew about them.

1140
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,850
l came here
to help these people,

1141
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,280
and the only way
l can do that

1142
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,010
-is if l transport guns.
-You don't have

1143
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:41,280
to transport guns
to help people.

1144
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,450
You do here.

1145
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,320
Right. So fuck the next person
that tries to bring

1146
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,880
a shipment full of medicine
in for people.

1147
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,930
Fuck them.

1148
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,160
As long as you get
what you need today,

1149
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:50,320
fuck everybody else!

1150
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,490
No one else comes here,

1151
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,790
so what do you want me to do?

1152
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:55,170
You want me to watch
thousands of kids die of measles

1153
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,640
'cause l wouldn't
bend the rules?

1154
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,900
ls that a price worth paying?

1155
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:59,800
Or am l actually killing
more than l save?

1156
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:02,170
You seriously believe that
l don't worry about that?

1157
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,710
That l don't think about that
every minute of every day?

1158
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,110
What's worse?
You tell me.

1159
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,240
You tell me what l should do.

1160
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:30,470
What happened?

1161
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:52,990
Never compromise
another organization

1162
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,620
for your own ever again.

1163
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:58,130
l won't.

1164
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:00,720
Sarah, you made it.

1165
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,430
Oh, good to see you.

1166
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,000
So, l believe congratulations
are in order?

1167
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:08,010
l know, can you believe it?

1168
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,010
Oh...

1169
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,740
What the hell happened?

1170
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:12,970
No guns--
confiscated by Tao.

1171
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:15,480
He found
these intelligence files.

1172
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,070
They freaked him out.

1173
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:18,080
What intelligence files?

1174
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:19,240
Well, how do l know?

1175
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,550
He was tipped off.
He was waiting for us.

1176
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,110
He found these documents.
He went fucking crazy.

1177
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:24,350
Well, if we don't have anything
for the Khmer Rouge,

1178
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,360
we're in deep shit.

1179
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:26,360
We leave in the morning.

1180
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:27,450
Take everyone with us.

1181
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:28,690
No, we need to leave
sooner than that.

1182
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,590
We've got all this vaccine.
l'm not wasting it.

1183
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,330
We don't have time.
We need to go now.

1184
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,590
Not until we vaccinate.

1185
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,030
This is not worth risking
our lives for.

1186
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,630
You do whatever you got to do.
l'm staying.

1187
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,060
Joss, remember to pack
the iodine.

1188
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,360
And the emergency kits--
how many we got?

1189
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:06,560
Joss?

1190
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,580
No, no. They...

1191
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:26,890
He says that we're thieves,
that we stole his files

1192
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,220
and his guns,
and he wants them back.

1193
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:31,280
Tell him the truth.

1194
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,020
And tell him that we're trying

1195
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:35,030
to save his bloody people.

1196
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,860
He doesn't give a shit
about the people.

1197
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,370
He just want the file.

1198
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,840
So tell him whatever he wants.

1199
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,540
Just try and buy us
some time.

1200
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,540
He wants us to...

1201
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:03,650
He wants us to what?

1202
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:07,690
He wants us to make amends now.

1203
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,060
He wants us to go to Pailin.

1204
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:11,360
You know what that means.

1205
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,330
He say now.

1206
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,330
Okay.

1207
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,130
Tell him that Sarah
is from the UN.

1208
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:20,110
And that the UN is very
important to Big God Ankha,

1209
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:22,170
and if anything happens to her
or to us,

1210
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,440
the UN will crucify him.

1211
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:39,790
He say you are a ClA agent
working for Vietnam.

1212
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:43,230
One of you must die.

1213
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:00,100
English doctor, you say
all you care about is my people.

1214
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,480
Life mean nothing.

1215
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:40,680
We serve only Ankha.

1216
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,590
Now you will see.

1217
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:44,280
For God's sake,
he's just a baby.

1218
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:52,600
Tell them to drop their guns.

1219
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,930
Tell them to drop
their fucking weapons now!

1220
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,830
No!

1221
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,400
Tell them to back off.
Back off!

1222
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,210
Tell them to back off.

1223
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,180
Tell them to back off.

1224
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,380
Look, as long
as we hold due west,

1225
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:25,820
we hit the river.

1226
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,220
That's about two miles.

1227
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:28,620
And the camp's up there.

1228
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,120
About another three miles north,
just over the Thai border.

1229
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:33,160
Oh, Jesus.

1230
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,790
Shit. That's Khmer Rouge.

1231
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,020
They've reached the village.

1232
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,860
At this rate,
they're going to catch up.

1233
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,820
Keep them moving.

1234
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,330
Keep them moving!

1235
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,060
Tell them we're nearly there.

1236
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,570
Sierra Tango 619.

1237
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,900
Sierra Tango 619.

1238
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,670
This is Outpost Grade Seven.

1239
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,220
Sierra Tango, come in.

1240
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:49,960
Me father.
Me father.

1241
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:08,880
Look! Look! Helicopter!

1242
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,920
Helicopter!

1243
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,490
Helicopter!

1244
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,960
Looks Vietnamese, mate.

1245
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,900
Good, that will keep them busy.

1246
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:01,540
Nick?

1247
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,170
lt wasn't your fault.

1248
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,580
Yes, it was.

1249
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,150
lf l'd have listened to him,

1250
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:15,990
none of this
would have happened.

1251
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,220
l couldn't even
bury him properly.

1252
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:21,160
l didn't even give him
a decent fucking burial.

1253
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:23,890
Elliott wanted to dedicate
his life

1254
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,590
to helping other people.

1255
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:30,130
And in the end,
he died for them.

1256
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,870
Be proud of him.

1257
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:39,610
Miss him...
but be proud of him.

1258
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:46,280
l don't know what
l'm going to do without him.

1259
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:50,620
l can't stop;
l've got to keep going.

1260
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,720
-There's so much...
-l'm worried about you, here.

1261
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,860
l'm worried that something
is going to happen to you.

1262
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:00,730
Every day for four years,

1263
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,890
every morning,
l wake up and l wonder

1264
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:04,560
if you're okay,
if you're still alive,

1265
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:05,760
where you are.

1266
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:07,530
Shall l ring down
for some room service?

1267
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,330
Chocolate cake...

1268
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,960
and some air-conditioning.

1269
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,370
That'd be lovely.

1270
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:24,250
How did you meet Henry?

1271
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,790
l was staring at a Roscoe.

1272
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:29,320
What's that,
some sort of dishwasher?

1273
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:30,860
lt was a painting.

1274
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,590
l used to work
at an art gallery.

1275
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:36,990
And one day, Henry came in.

1276
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:39,550
How old were you?

1277
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:42,760
Too young.

1278
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,210
But you stayed together?

1279
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:50,210
Yeah.

1280
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,300
We've both known that
the marriage has been over

1281
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,370
for a long time.

1282
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:58,280
But we stayed together
for Jimmy.

1283
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:00,680
You love him very much,
don't you?

1284
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,750
He's amazing.

1285
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:29,980
l'm going to have
to start making plans

1286
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:31,950
to go to New York.

1287
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,720
See Elliott's parents,
tell them what happened.

1288
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:37,020
How long will you be gone?

1289
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:39,390
l don't know, no idea.

1290
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,920
What is this?

1291
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:50,830
What are you doing?

1292
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,770
l'm absolutely crazy about you.

1293
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,500
l can't stop thinking about you.

1294
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,700
You're always in my mind;
you're in my heart;

1295
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,040
you're in every fucking bit
of me.

1296
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:03,140
But l can't go there with you.

1297
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:04,380
l can't do it.

1298
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:06,110
Look at what happens
to people around me.

1299
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:07,180
lt's not good.

1300
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,690
-l'm not good for you.
-That's not true.

1301
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,850
Listen, believe me,
if l could live this life again,

1302
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,480
l would never leave you
for a second.

1303
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,690
But you belong with your family,
and l belong here,

1304
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,700
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

1305
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,250
Because whichever way
you look at it,

1306
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:19,300
somebody gets hurt.

1307
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:01,630
One, two, three.

1308
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,500
-Oh.
-Oops.

1309
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:16,850
Oh!

1310
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:27,520
Happy birthday to you

1311
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,330
Happy birthday
to you

1312
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,430
Happy birthday, dear Sarah

1313
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:40,310
Happy birthday to you.

1314
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,810
Thank you.

1315
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,950
Thank you, baby.

1316
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,320
Oh, that was lovely.

1317
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:53,860
Lovely playing, lovely cake.

1318
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:54,980
My playing

1319
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:56,530
was lovelier than his cake.

1320
01:28:56,590 --> 01:28:57,580
Mom.

1321
01:28:57,730 --> 01:28:59,790
They were both exactly
as lovely as each other.

1322
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:01,690
l think you better
blow the candles out

1323
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:02,790
before the cake catches fire.

1324
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:05,530
Wait until they do you
a candle for each decade, dear.

1325
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,260
Then you'll know
you're past it.

1326
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,000
Didn't forget to make a wish.

1327
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:18,710
Got it.

1328
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,110
Oh!

1329
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,220
Mom, when are we going
to open the presents?

1330
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:31,560
Now.

1331
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,660
Many of you know her
from her work

1332
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:35,530
with the Elliott Hauser
Foundation

1333
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,000
for the lnternational Promotion
of Human Rights.

1334
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,930
ln more recent years however,

1335
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,300
she has become an active
lobbyist at Whitehall

1336
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:46,210
on issues of asylum
and refugee protection.

1337
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,210
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

1338
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,150
to introduce
our new spokesperson

1339
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,270
for the UNHCR
in the United Kingdom,

1340
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:56,820
Mrs. Sarah Bauford.

1341
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,560
Thank you.

1342
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:15,600
Thank you.

1343
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:17,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

1344
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:22,510
l feel very nervous to be
standing in front of you today.

1345
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,450
l also feel very honored.

1346
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,950
ln particular, because
UNHCR was the organization

1347
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:32,790
to which l was first introduced
by my friend Elliott Hauser.

1348
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,350
l know that my being
offered this post

1349
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,020
would have given him
enormous pleasure.

1350
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:39,860
Over 50 million people

1351
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:43,760
are refugees or displaced
persons in the world today.

1352
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:46,960
And because of closed minds
and funding shortfalls,

1353
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,500
we are only able to reach
half of those in need.

1354
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:02,440
So we rely on our partners,

1355
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,320
the network of aid groups
blazing a trail across crises,

1356
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:09,120
like El Salvador, Angola,

1357
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:12,560
Chechnya, Sri Lanka...

1358
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:16,760
those NGO's, the non-
governmental groups from OXFAM

1359
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:18,230
right down
to the smallest outfits

1360
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,730
run by people like Elliott
and...

1361
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,140
...and l pray for those
who survive him--

1362
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:32,080
who continue his work--

1363
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:34,620
without certainty or security--

1364
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,520
wherever they may be
in this world.

1365
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:41,910
Excuse me.

1366
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,070
Hey.

1367
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:57,400
Hey.

1368
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:58,630
Thanks for coming.

1369
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:00,400
Listen, l travel
thousands of miles

1370
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,040
to hear my sister
give a speech,

1371
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,510
l got a backache and jet lag.

1372
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,100
What's a taxi ride to the park?

1373
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:07,280
Sorry.
Are they angry?

1374
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:08,940
No. They don't care, Sarah.

1375
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,010
l think they actually
kind of enjoyed it.

1376
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:13,450
''She's nuts'' makes
for much better conversation

1377
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,890
than ''Nice speech.''

1378
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,390
l got a letter from Nick,

1379
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:20,220
and l think he's in trouble.

1380
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,360
Why? What did he say?

1381
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:24,590
Nothing, really.
Just little things.

1382
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,340
Well, where is he?

1383
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,740
He's in Chechnya.

1384
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:31,070
He's running
some sort of camp.

1385
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,630
l'm really not sure.

1386
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:35,270
l need to find him.

1387
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:36,810
So, you have contacts.

1388
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,810
You can find out where he is.

1389
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,370
So, please?

1390
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:42,780
Sarah, sweetheart,
you know as well as l do

1391
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:46,340
that Chechnya is
a very dangerous place.

1392
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:55,460
Yes, l can angle
a story there, l'm sure.

1393
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:58,930
lf l find out anything,
l will let you know. Okay?

1394
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,300
Okay. Okay.

1395
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:03,810
Okay.

1396
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,340
Thank you.

1397
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:13,570
Perhaps we are all refugees
from something,

1398
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,950
but l see now
there is nothing to fear;

1399
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:21,290
that the world we hold on to,
the lives we cherish,

1400
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:26,130
are a part of something greater
--something more.

1401
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,600
When l look at my children,
l see it so clearly--

1402
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,290
that hope--

1403
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:33,800
that chance of life--

1404
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:36,170
and l know
it's worth fighting for.

1405
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:39,970
''The wedding was
a splendid affair.

1406
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,980
''Everyone attended--

1407
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:44,810
''the dwarves, and the
animals of the forest--

1408
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,410
''and there were tears of joy

1409
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,780
''and songs of happiness,

1410
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:49,610
''and the prince
and the princess

1411
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,980
lived happily ever after.''

1412
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:55,620
How does it really end, Mummy?

1413
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:57,160
What do you mean?

1414
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:59,350
What do you think happens,
honey?

1415
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:03,200
She wakes up,
looks at the prince,

1416
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:06,570
and goes, ''Eww! Boys. Yucky!''

1417
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:09,770
Hello.

1418
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,770
Hi, Henry. lt's Charlotte.
ls Sarah there?

1419
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,100
Charlotte, hi.

1420
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,270
Uh... well, she's upstairs
with the kids right now.

1421
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,440
Can l take a message?

1422
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:19,210
Oh. Okay. Um...
Then could you just, uh...

1423
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:22,580
Just let her know that
l will call her later, okay?

1424
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,950
Well, l can take a message.

1425
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:29,920
Um... well, then, just tell her
that l've got some news, uh...

1426
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:33,950
and that l will... l will fax it
to her office in the morning.

1427
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:35,290
Okay?

1428
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:36,590
Right. Okay.

1429
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,290
Um... l'll pass that on.

1430
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:41,130
Okay. Thanks, Henry. Bye, now.

1431
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,670
Bye.

1432
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:57,320
That was Charlotte.

1433
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:01,190
She said, um...
she has some news.

1434
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:04,620
She'll fax you at the office.

1435
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:58,430
So this is it, is it?

1436
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:01,480
You kiss the children good-bye,
scribble a quick note, and then

1437
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:02,980
sneak off into the night.

1438
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,740
Have you any idea
how fucking cruel that is?

1439
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,540
l'm not sneaking off.

1440
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,240
l'm not leaving the children.

1441
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,480
You could have talked to me.

1442
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,290
l mean, writing a note--
it's, uh...

1443
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,950
l just thought
it would be easier.

1444
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:19,290
Than what?

1445
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,890
Than having
this conversation again.

1446
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:27,800
God, this is so...

1447
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:38,070
l should be back by Friday.

1448
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,710
Dinners are in the freezer.

1449
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:43,150
Their swimsuits
are in the dryer.

1450
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:45,810
They have swimming
tomorrow at 4:00.

1451
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:48,320
lt's all in the note.

1452
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,190
l want this to be as easy
as possible for them.

1453
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,130
And we'll talk about this.

1454
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,430
We'll talk about everything
when l get home.

1455
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:24,610
Sniper!

1456
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,070
Oh, God...

1457
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:56,720
This is total carnage,

1458
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:58,580
and not a single western leader
has said a thing

1459
01:39:58,720 --> 01:39:59,850
about what's going on here.

1460
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,290
There's no threats,
no criticism,

1461
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,450
no fucking comment.

1462
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:04,020
This place might
as well not exist.

1463
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:05,580
And now that
we're all they have,

1464
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,360
they want us to save face
for them.

1465
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:09,860
Well, fuck that. They should
get off their fucking asses

1466
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:11,730
and get the fuck out here. Shit.

1467
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,270
Sorry. l'm still swearing.

1468
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,770
Freeze it there.

1469
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,960
Can we cut?

1470
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:26,620
Okay.

1471
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,990
Roll tape.

1472
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,960
Basically, nothing has changed.

1473
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:36,120
People keep saying that
everything has changed.

1474
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:37,450
Not from where l'm standing.

1475
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,790
Chechnya, Somalia, Cambodia,

1476
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:41,190
Ethiopia--
it's the same shit every time,

1477
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:43,560
and it's just going to go on
and on until we stop pretending

1478
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:45,070
that our loyalty ends
with the asshole...

1479
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:10,960
You okay?

1480
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:12,690
What do you know?

1481
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:15,030
An English news crew
filmed it six days ago.

1482
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,690
The sound man is dead,
the cameraman is in a coma,

1483
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:19,060
and Nick has disappeared.

1484
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:20,860
We think it's bandits--

1485
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:23,060
Chechens looking for money--

1486
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,160
but there's been
no ransom demand.

1487
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,740
Sarah, l want you
to meet Bob Strauss.

1488
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:32,250
He's with the lCRC here.

1489
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,840
He's been helping us.

1490
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:37,480
Hi.

1491
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:39,020
No, sit. Sit, please.

1492
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:45,220
So, the, um...
net result right now

1493
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:47,020
is we don't know who took Nick.

1494
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,830
We don't know if he pissed off

1495
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,530
the Russians or the Chechens.

1496
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,730
We're pretty sure
there was a motive.

1497
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:53,860
What was he doing?

1498
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:54,930
l think you know

1499
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,200
he wasn't just
a doctor anymore.

1500
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:59,140
He, uh...
l'd have to say--

1501
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:00,900
and this is well known--

1502
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:03,380
Nick's activities
went quite a way

1503
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,940
beyond what you'd call
famine relief.

1504
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:05,950
How do we find him?

1505
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:09,010
Well, nobody l've spoken to

1506
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:11,140
has any leads yet.

1507
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,250
Can we offer a reward?

1508
01:42:14,990 --> 01:42:18,590
Can... can...
can we do something?

1509
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:21,130
The best thing for you
to do is to stay

1510
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,390
in the hotel for
a couple of days. Be patient.

1511
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,300
No. No.

1512
01:42:25,370 --> 01:42:27,130
No.

1513
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,670
Sarah.

1514
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,270
Sarah, listen to me.

1515
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:33,970
This place,
they will take journalists,

1516
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,480
Red Cross, anybody.

1517
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:37,480
Don't think for one second
that you are immune.

1518
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:38,980
l don't.

1519
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:40,850
Just listen
to what Strauss said.

1520
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,610
l don't care what Strauss said.

1521
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,480
Sarah, l love you.

1522
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:46,820
l want you to be safe. Go home.

1523
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:49,450
l swear to God, l will let you
know if we hear anything.

1524
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:50,460
Say it.

1525
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:51,460
What?

1526
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:52,590
Say it.

1527
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,330
People disappear here;
they don't come back.

1528
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,960
l'm not leaving
until l find him.

1529
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,640
Okay.

1530
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,330
Charley?

1531
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:39,170
Who is it?

1532
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:49,350
Mrs. Bauford?

1533
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,850
My name is Jan Steiger.

1534
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,390
l'm a friend of Nick's.

1535
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,860
May l?

1536
01:43:57,930 --> 01:43:59,390
We work together.

1537
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,230
On and off.

1538
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,560
You should move your bed.

1539
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:07,190
lt's too near the window.

1540
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:09,530
Were you working together here?

1541
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:12,400
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

1542
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,740
How'd you know where l was?

1543
01:44:13,810 --> 01:44:15,170
My sister?

1544
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:18,010
Oh, no, l'm not a journalist,
Mrs. Bauford.

1545
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,670
l'm more import/export.

1546
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:23,080
Cambodia, we nearly met.

1547
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:25,510
Actually,

1548
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:27,520
Nick mentioned you a few times.

1549
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:29,390
l most certainly would have.

1550
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,760
What do you want?

1551
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:33,320
What do you want, Mrs. Bauford?

1552
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,760
l want to know where Nick is.

1553
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:36,730
Last l heard,

1554
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,460
he was being held
in the mountains--

1555
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:39,730
a rebel position,

1556
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,570
about five, six miles
northeast of here.

1557
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:43,700
Whole area's under heavy
Russian shelling now,

1558
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:45,600
but l managed
to make radio contact.

1559
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:48,200
They were negotiating,
they knew who he was.

1560
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:53,520
But that was yesterday,
been nothing since.

1561
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:56,750
Chances are that he's dead.

1562
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,290
So why are you telling me this?

1563
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,820
l'm curious.

1564
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:05,830
l mean, you come
to this shit-hole in hell,

1565
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:09,260
and you think you can find him?

1566
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:11,320
What is it?

1567
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,830
ls this... love?

1568
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,270
ls that what it is?

1569
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:19,440
Okay, whatever.

1570
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:21,670
You're here.

1571
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:23,210
Now...

1572
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,250
if l get him back alive.

1573
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:27,750
l'll lose one less operative.

1574
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:31,120
lf he's dead, he's dead.

1575
01:45:31,190 --> 01:45:34,550
Of course l'm not stupid enough
to risk my own ass

1576
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:36,590
for some fucked-up big mouth.

1577
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:41,530
But you, you're willing
to risk your life for love.

1578
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:47,030
l'll trade with anything,
Mrs. Bauford.

1579
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,970
Anything at all.

1580
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:52,970
Fine.

1581
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:56,570
What do l do?

1582
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:59,140
l have a friend, a local.

1583
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,950
He can get you
into the mountains,

1584
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:05,150
but after that,
l'm just a spectator.

1585
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,690
Love.

1586
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:32,400
l'm looking for Nick Callahan,

1587
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,880
the English doctor.

1588
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:12,180
Come.

1589
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,350
Five minutes.

1590
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,270
Nick?

1591
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:43,910
Nick, it's Sarah.

1592
01:48:56,290 --> 01:48:57,590
l'm going to get you
out of here.

1593
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:59,290
We're going to get
out of here right now.

1594
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,390
There's a Red Cross camp
on the border.

1595
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:05,830
lt's about
four miles west of here.

1596
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:06,870
We can walk it.

1597
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:09,060
Damn it!

1598
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:10,700
Come on, get up.
Get up!

1599
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:12,000
Nick, get up!

1600
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:47,970
Nick? Remember?

1601
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,940
Remember l wrote to you?

1602
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:52,000
And l told you

1603
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,280
you have a daughter.

1604
01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:58,580
Anna.
You remember?

1605
01:49:58,650 --> 01:50:01,420
You're a dad.

1606
01:50:01,490 --> 01:50:05,390
And she needs you.

1607
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:11,130
She needs you to get up
and walk out of here.

1608
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,960
So get up.

1609
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,870
Get up, Nick.

1610
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,100
That was close.

1611
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:26,730
What?

1612
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:28,710
We need a lot
of money to do...

1613
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:31,110
lt won't be hard to track us.

1614
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:26,590
-l can't make it-- go!
-You can...

1615
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:28,360
Go, you've got to go.
Listen to me.

1616
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:29,730
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1617
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:30,920
They're not going to kill me.

1618
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,990
They're not going to kill me.
They need me alive.

1619
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:34,040
l'm worth money to them.

1620
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:35,930
lf they get you,

1621
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,800
they will rape you,
they will kill you.

1622
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:40,070
Y-You've got to go
and get help.

1623
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:45,480
Okay. Okay.

1624
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:47,540
Sarah!

1625
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:52,870
Sarah, go!

1626
01:54:52,950 --> 01:54:55,010
Go! You can make it.

1627
01:54:57,350 --> 01:54:59,510
Go!

1628
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:01,110
What are you...

1629
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:02,990
What are you doing?!

1630
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:04,690
For God's...

1631
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:08,560
Sarah, please!

1632
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:10,150
Stay. Stay.

1633
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:12,430
Go!

1634
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,530
l hope when
you're reading this letter,

1635
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:22,430
that l'm sitting there
next to you

1636
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,560
and you're telling me
that l'm stupid for writing it,

1637
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:28,770
and crazy
for trying to find you.

1638
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:31,570
But how could l not?

1639
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:33,810
lt's you.

1640
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:38,410
All this time,
so many years apart...

1641
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:41,420
l've missed you,

1642
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:45,520
but l have never been
without you.

1643
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:49,460
l've woken up with you
every morning

1644
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:52,130
and gone to sleep with you
every night.

1645
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,900
You have always been with me.

1646
01:56:54,970 --> 01:56:58,370
Your courage, your smile...

1647
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:01,410
your damn stubbornness.

1648
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:05,470
There has never been
any distance between us,

1649
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:08,410
and there never will be.

1650
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:12,220
l love you, Nick.

1651
01:57:12,290 --> 01:57:14,880
l love you.
