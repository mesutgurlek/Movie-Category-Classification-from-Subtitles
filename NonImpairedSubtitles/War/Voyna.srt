I'm Yermakov, Ivan.
And he was John.

9
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,198
So we're kind of namesakes.

10
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,076
We met in the summer of 2001.

11
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,599
For two months I'd been locked up
in the village of Verkhny Iskhoi

12
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,514
by Aslan Gugaev.

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,551
Backthen, none of our
lot had heard of him.

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,033
His detachment wasn't that big.

15
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,516
There were three of us there.

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,157
Me, Fedka and a Jew - a commercial.

17
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,830
A businessman from Vladikavkaz.
Called Semyon, I think...

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,039
Me and Fedka were sawing up wood
when they brought them in on a truck.

19
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,357
There were another
two of our guys with them...

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,869
Vladimir Gostyukhin

21
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,229
Yuri Stepanov

22
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,995
You killed my brother!

23
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,038
Yes, I killed your brother!
And a whole lot more!

24
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,432
I whipped your sorry black arses and
I'll keep whipping them

25
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,876
because you're enemies...

26
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,917
Did they pay you well?

27
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,317
Don't kill me! Please!

28
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,433
I just arrived,
I'm not guilty! Please!

29
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,870
My mum's all alone...

30
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,991
Scum.

31
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:59,673
THE WAR

32
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,395
Look down!

33
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,114
- What's he want?
- Something in English.

34
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,510
Take the bucket - it stinks!

35
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,918
- Who was shooting?
- They killed two of ours.

36
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,998
Give me your hand.

37
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,912
Shit happens...

38
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,590
Take the jug.

39
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,036
It'll be us next!

40
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,278
I didn't like her at first -
full of herself. Wouldn't even look at you.

41
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,911
I didn't understand
that she was just embarrassed.

42
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,870
We all crapped in the same bucket.

43
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,154
And I thought ginger
was a right weed.

44
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,714
In the hole, it's
every man for himself -

45
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,669
you're always hungry
and they beat you the whole time.

46
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,310
He wasn't too bad, though.
He looked after her.

47
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,790
A 'gentleman'.

48
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,792
And from the start with me...
because of my English, no doubt.

49
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,596
Back in Tobolsk I finished
computer school

50
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,429
and in Chechnya I'd get the news
by Internet for Aslan.

51
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,479
...and a whole lot more besides.

52
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,712
I whipped your sorry black arses and
I'll keep whipping them

53
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,592
because you're enemies...

54
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,589
Did they pay you well?

55
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,515
Don't kill me! Please!
I just arrived, I'm not guilty! Please!

56
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,511
My mum's all...

57
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,957
I'm worn out. Can't get any relaxation.
There's a war on...

58
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,356
When will it end?

59
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,672
When all the Russians
will live in the North.

60
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,509
You're white.
You've got the White Sea.

61
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,993
We're black.
We've got the Black Sea.

62
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,839
Why did you kill the lads?

63
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,237
It took me three years
to find that Lieutenant.

64
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,830
I paid thirty grand to get him.

65
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,833
He shot my brother.

66
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,588
I found him in Rostov.

67
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,311
He killed a lot more
good Muslims besides...

68
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,871
And the youngster?

69
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,475
Who needs someone like that?

70
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,353
He goes off to get some vodka.

71
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,791
There's a war on,
and he leaves his post.

72
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,032
Is that any way to carry on, Ivan?

73
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,309
No.

74
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,354
You're either a shepherd or a sheep.

75
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,839
Those who let themselves be skewered -
they're the sheep.

76
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,473
Russians.

77
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,639
There are people amongst you.

78
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,835
I saw one in jail near Virkhayansk.

79
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,636
A hardcore convict, strong,
like a Chechen.

80
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,949
If people like him led Russia,
you could win this war.

81
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,233
But you've got too few of them.

82
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,794
You're stupid and weak.
And you're led by half -wits.

83
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,436
You've given back
the Ukraine, Kazakhstan.

84
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,593
You've just given away
half the country for free.

85
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,838
Soon the Chinese
will take the Far East.

86
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,310
You're fighting us

87
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,351
while in Moscow I've got a hotel,
three restaurants, four brigades

88
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,468
in Petersburg, Moscow and Samara.

89
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,558
I milkthe Russians like cows

90
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,670
but we still get money
out of the state budget.

91
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,870
Do you know...

92
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,910
why you fight badly?

93
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,191
You don't know?

94
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,238
Because you're not fighting
for your Homeland!

95
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,469
You fight because you've been herded
out here like a sheep.

96
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,989
I know my ancestors going
back seven generations.

97
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,036
I'm a descendant
of the Murid, Hadji Kazi.

98
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,755
A hundred and fifty years ago
he was already cutting you lot up.

99
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,513
This is my land

100
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,157
and I'll clear it of unbelieving dogs

101
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,356
until there's not a Russian
from here to Volgograd.

102
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,551
Got it?

103
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,435
So, what are they writing
about us on the Internet?

104
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,792
The satellite's gone,
we'll catch another.

105
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,870
Aslan, tell your men
not to beat me round the head.

106
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,668
This is the Internet,
you've got to use your brains

107
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,235
and there's a lot in English.

108
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,837
And the foreigners asked if they
could have a wash.

109
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,194
Come here.

110
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,199
I'll pay! I'll pay!

111
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,715
In accordance with
the Shariat

112
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,117
taking money from Jews
for military actions

113
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,471
is considered legitimate.

114
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,274
And while you won't pay us

115
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,555
I'll pay!

116
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,109
we will cut your fingers off.

117
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,351
I tried to translate
what Aslan had said,

118
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,552
but John didn't understand.

119
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,635
So I just said they don't like Jews.

120
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,388
Can I have another cigarette?

121
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,673
He got it immediately about Jews,

122
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,273
but that it was all a put on for him,
that they were getting him ready...

123
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,752
What did the Jew's seventy grand
matter to Aslan?

124
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,396
They didn't mention a ransom
to John for a month.

125
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,709
They beat one guy
to frighten the others.

126
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,715
The main thing for them is to break a man,
so that he'll pay the money himself.

127
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,949
And they certainly know
how to break a man.

128
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,836
Then they took us away.

129
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,235
Where're they taking him?

130
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,436
You just worry about yourself.

131
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,196
Shut up, bitch!

132
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,674
- What's he want?
- Something to drink.

133
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,070
He can wait.

134
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,592
Nice place!

135
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,071
Been in long?

136
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,590
Captain Medvedev.
Give a proper report.

137
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,309
- What?
- Give a proper report.

138
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,879
Take it easy!

139
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,230
Right, attention!

140
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,155
Who are you?

141
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,515
Private Kulik.

142
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,476
Sergeant Yermakov.

143
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,759
Captured on May 10th, 2001,
during a battle on the road

144
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,478
from Alkhan Yurt to Urus Martan,
while carrying supplies.

145
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,313
And them?

146
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,279
They're commercial.
Actors from England.

147
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,835
They were doing
a theatre tour in Georgia.

148
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,792
Well, they're actors...

149
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,919
At ease.

150
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,993
We mustn't let things slip, lads.
There's a war on.

151
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,030
Is it your back, Comrade Captain?

152
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,717
Contusion and shrapnel
round the vertebrae.

153
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,310
Let me take a look. Fedka!

154
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,151
How did it happen?

155
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,916
How? We were on a transporter.

156
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,558
A rocket went straight through Kit,
a guy in my platoon.

157
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,639
I only worked it out
when I came round.

158
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,600
Whoever was inside
the transporter bought it.

159
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,597
So we were lucky...

160
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,239
You may have been lucky...

161
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,074
But what about your platoon?

162
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,870
I got concussed just like you,
Comrade Captain.

163
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,310
And the bullet's here...

164
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,714
How long had you served?

165
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,793
Two weeks to go before
my tour was over.

166
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,839
And him?

167
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,628
Still wet behind the ears.
His first year.

168
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,912
Captain Medvedev was a tough nut,
no doubt about it.

169
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,118
Everyone worked that out straight away.

170
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,518
You can't break a guy like that,
can't wear him down.

171
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,876
If we'd had more like him,
what an army we'd have had!

172
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,319
We all felt his strength,
his confidence.

173
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,156
He's lying there, can't even get up,
but he's got this calm inside him.

174
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,120
A commander.

175
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,638
And Margaret fell in love with him -
I new straight away.

176
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,117
- I think we're somewhere here.
- Here?

177
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,795
It seemed to me they took us further.

178
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,709
No. We didn't go faster
than 25 to 30 an hour.

179
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,353
And up into the mountains.

180
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,988
No, it's a mountain pass.

181
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,593
With machinegun placements.

182
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,356
I thinkthey're guarding
the road to Georgia.

183
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,676
If only we knew what that river is...

184
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,871
What's the difference?

185
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,588
Well, I'm getting hungry.

186
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,314
She says you have to exercise...

187
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,991
Careful, careful...

188
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,239
Here.

189
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,634
Like that?

190
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,553
Says they can't come up with two million,
even if they sell everything.

191
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,834
Says the government won't pay.

192
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,474
They're in negotiations
with the Russians.

193
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,590
He says they'll do everything.

194
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,956
Right, enough!

195
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,957
Same thing over and over
for half an hour!

196
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,112
What's she to him?

197
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,112
Fiancee.

198
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,197
He's not lying?

199
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,995
No.

200
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,633
Ask him if he could get
two million together.

201
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,951
Yes, he says he can.

202
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,197
Tell him the woman stays with me.

203
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,719
In exactly two months
he gives me two million.

204
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,475
If he doesn't, the whole lot
of us will fuck her

205
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,553
and then I'll cut her fucking head off.

206
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,954
Tell him.

207
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,317
Why're you using foul language?
Allah forbids it.

208
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,832
Speaking Russian is the same
as using foul language.

209
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,910
To Allah, all your words
are the same. Translate.

210
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,754
I didn't believe they'd let us go.

211
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,470
It wasn't the Chechen way.
Too smart for them.

212
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,189
And they like
to play with you:

213
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,510
tell you you're going
to be released.

214
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,552
Let you wash in the river.

215
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,633
Then you sit and wait
for two days, get ready...

216
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,871
Well, I expected a trick...

217
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,230
Come on, what's the hold up?

218
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,755
It's not an order.
Just a favour...

219
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
- Comrade Captain!
- You know the address?

220
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,069
I'll do everything,
if I get out before you.

221
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,031
I can't decide whether
to let you go or not.

222
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,710
The baksheesh for you is rubbish.

223
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,349
They're paying nothing.

224
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,955
And who'll get
on the Internet for me?

225
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,439
The Captain.

226
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,874
I know you put the wrong address
on the letter you wrote.

227
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,270
You said.

228
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,397
Alright, tell them about the Captain.

229
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,792
I'm tired - be a shame
to kill him.

230
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,197
I paid fifty thousand for him.

231
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,117
If they don't let my nephew go,
who'll give me that money back?

232
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,555
Tell them I'll wait
another month and that's it.

233
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,838
Will he get the money together?

234
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,357
I think so.
He wants to get married.

235
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,113
We're counting from today.
He's got two months.

236
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,631
0r he won't have
anyone left to marry.

237
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,590
Alright. Don't come back.

238
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,157
I won't let you go a second time.

239
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,948
How should he pass
the money on?

240
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,039
If he wants to,
he'll find a way.

241
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,478
Tell him to give
his number and I'll phone.

242
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,154
Give him this.
He can watch it later.

243
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,993
No, they're not taking us to Grozny.

244
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,878
No, definitely not to Grozny.

245
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,879
Don't get worked up.
They'll stop the car...

246
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,469
take us out and shoot us.
You know Aslan.

247
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,798
He let us go.
I don't know why.

248
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,879
No one paid for us,
that's for sure!

249
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,793
If it had been Khattab or Basaev,
that I'd understand...

250
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,559
there's politics involved.

251
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,876
But who's Gugaev?

252
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,191
Maybe it was a trade -off
with the local security service.

253
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,870
Someone told me it
happens all the time.

254
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,312
The FSB swap a gangster,
then get the credit.

255
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,672
They said they'd carried out
a secret service mission

256
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,749
to free us.
Well, the usual nonsense.

257
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,475
It didn't make any difference
to me who did what.

258
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,435
Could I have some more water?

259
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,279
What?

260
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,235
Yes, they should have.

261
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,836
No, they won't.

262
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,275
I don't know, cheap.

263
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,670
They don't pay a lot for a soldier.

264
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,912
We're not commercial,

265
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,471
just slaves really.

266
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,638
How much for a commercial?

267
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,433
Depends.

268
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,036
There's a market in Shatoi.
The prices go up and down there.

269
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,834
Buy one, order another...

270
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,268
'0rder'?

271
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,268
Well, how do you 'order' a murder?
Are you just off the moon?

272
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,352
But you're talking
about gangsters!

273
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,153
Chechens are gangsters.

274
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,038
- All of them?
- Yes.

275
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,191
That's the anger in you talking.

276
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,672
Well, you know best.
Listen, can I have a cigarette?

277
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,517
We were slaves.
We had to earn our food.

278
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,153
And what did you do?

279
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:34,118
Everything. In the fields,
sawing wood. All sorts.

280
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,839
Was it hard?

281
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,232
Not really. Anything's better
than sitting in the cellar.

282
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,154
0nly the nutcases
used to beat us.

283
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,519
They'd get high and have
some fun kicking us.

284
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,553
We wanted more food.
And there was no salt.

285
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,751
You coming to Petersburg?

286
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,311
No, I'm going home.

287
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,280
I want to be in time
to get into the Linguistics University

288
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,158
on the interpreter's faculty...

289
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,149
You don't know any English,
and the exams have finished.

290
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,394
My Mum was at school
with the rector.

291
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,870
And the military board will help.

292
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,397
Mum said I have
to be quickthough.

293
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,630
Tobolsk, via Petersburg.

294
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,879
Listen, if you're ever in Nizhny, here...

295
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,274
Ivan, you know, I...

296
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,592
Alright, Fedka.
Maybe we'll meet again...

297
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,478
Before going to the
Medvedev family

298
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,757
I told everyone in Chechnya
about the Captain

299
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,956
phoned headquarters

300
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,511
then managed to phone
the Interior Ministry.

301
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,999
Told the cops about
Gugaev's nephew in prison.

302
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,674
Just the way Aslan wanted.

303
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,518
When I went to see the Medvedevs,
I knew there was nothing doing.

304
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,311
They're good people,
spoke with me, gave me tea.

305
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,549
I just worried about my
socks making a stink...

306
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,632
- Please, help yourself.
- Thank you.

307
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,717
And what's he doing there?

308
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,355
Nothing. Waiting for
a prisoner exchange.

309
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,353
- Why don't they exchange him?
- Mother!

310
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,996
The Chechen was
sentenced to execution,

311
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,352
then the sentence was reduced.
He's a danger to society,

312
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,673
so they won't to let him go,
and it s taking forever.

313
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,433
But why's it taking forever?

314
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,993
Mother, put the tea on.

315
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,913
Why take forever?
Why keep a Chechen they...

316
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,357
wanted to execute anyway?
I don't understand.

317
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,316
I always said about those men
in their caps.

318
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,398
I never used to buy my oranges
from them in the market.

319
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,552
Tell me, is he really
in good health?

320
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,799
Yes. What can I say?
Do I look healthy?

321
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,510
Well, he's healthier than me

322
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,638
and he asked me
to tell you not to worry.

323
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,154
Asked me to tell...
asked me to tell...

324
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,793
My Dad's a hero. He's defending
our Homeland against gangsters.

325
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,194
He'll come back soon, and we'll
go to the zoo like we used to.

326
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,195
And then I went home to Tobolsk.
And John went to look for the money.

327
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,154
Ivan? Is it you?

328
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,835
I thought you were at the war!

329
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,716
Don't you remember me?
I'm Simakov, Stepan.

330
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,077
- So, all over then?
- What?

331
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,833
Well, the war!

332
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,233
We'll have to get them in!
I'll tell the lads.

333
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,598
- How's your dad doing?
- What about my dad?

334
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,470
Well, he's in hospital,
up on the hill.

335
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,833
Hi, Sliva.

336
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,389
Hi, Ivan.

337
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,428
Unfold it, and then put it through...

338
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,952
Nothing had changed at home.
In a word, Siberia.

339
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,228
Two years had passed -
it was like I'd never left.

340
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,313
Sliva still a bandit,
same as he was at school.

341
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,792
His parents got him out
of being conscripted.

342
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,876
It's a shame - would've seen
the world, worked some things out.

343
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,754
Most of the people there
haven't been further than Tyumen.

344
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,557
Mum had aged a lot though,
and Dad...

345
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,512
Hi, Zinka. My dad's here...

346
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,156
Ivan! We saw you on TV!

347
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,589
Zin, my dad's here...

348
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,988
Have you seen Katya?

349
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,238
Zin, my dad's here!

350
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,317
Eh, yes, yes...

351
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,199
Why do I drink, son?

352
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,436
Because life's become boring.

353
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,513
I lived until I was about forty

354
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,793
and that was it.

355
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,468
Misery, all of it.

356
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,869
No love, son.

357
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,231
It's good that you were at war.

358
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,913
War makes a man of you.

359
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,997
And that's what you should be.

360
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,750
A man has strength. It's all held
together by that strength.

361
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,478
I had strength, but it's gone.

362
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:47,916
If I could be up and
on my way to war now!

363
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,798
Don't be angry with me
about your mother

364
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,877
she's a good woman

365
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,875
but I've just fallen out
of love with her.

366
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,630
You'll understand later.

367
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,000
Remember, son:

368
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,116
if you fall out of love,
walk away!

369
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,354
You can't live without love.
You mustn't, son!

370
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,392
Hello, mum.

371
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,035
Ivan!

372
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,073
Everyone says they saw you
on television, but I missed it.

373
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,278
It's no big deal...

374
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:11,636
To our brothers, Sapek, Uvar,
Taran and Tolka

375
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,198
who are no longer with us.

376
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,274
They hadn't been at war.
0ur own Siberian lads killed them.

377
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,676
We all went to the same school.
Some my age, some older.

378
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,917
I didn't know Taran at all,
but Sashka Uvarov was a friend of mine.

379
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,070
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs

380
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,955
The position of the President
of the Russian Federation, Mr. Putin

381
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,359
is that we mustn't pay ransoms
to terrorists for hostages.

382
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,559
So I apologize.

383
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,716
I wanted to work with computers -
nothing doing.

384
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,629
You say you were in Chechnya,
and they start scratching their chins.

385
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,792
'We're using new
technologies here,' they say.

386
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,033
So I got knocked
back everywhere.

387
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,198
The military board
were no use either.

388
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,398
I could get work loading
trucks without them.

389
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,070
Ivan, let's get married.

390
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,349
Where will we live?

391
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,352
Dad will be out of the hospital
soon, then what?

392
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,348
Ivan, you asked me to wake you!

393
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,274
I'm up Auntie Val!

394
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,470
Put the tea on.

395
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,835
- Why aren't you at worktoday?
- Because it's Saturday.

396
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,912
I bought some good tea, 'Akbar'!

397
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,552
Aren't you from round here then?

398
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,116
'No -speaka -di -Russian'...

399
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,512
Ah, you want Ivan!

400
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,230
Should have said, instead
of mumbling away.

401
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,671
How did he get there?
I don't know.

402
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,076
Doesn't speak a word of Russian.

403
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,909
Alright, in Moscow they put him
on a plane, but in Tyumen?

404
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,074
He found the station,
bought a bus ticket

405
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,710
then on the ferry, then he
found me. Good going.

406
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,756
As soon as I saw him,
I knew.

407
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,158
Knew what?

408
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,716
What was going to happen.

409
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,670
...into the mountains
to hunt goats.

410
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,190
Let's see the documents.

411
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,915
And the cartridges?

412
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,635
As they should be by law, officer.
They're stored separately.

413
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,155
Alright. Good day.

414
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,279
- Can we have our own compartment?
- Not shy, are we?

415
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,830
We'll pay...

416
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,953
I can't make any promises.

417
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,638
Take Compartment Six for now
and we'll see.

418
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,916
Anything you say, my lovely!
I'll be hoping...

419
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,038
Be off with you, my 'Iovely'.

420
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,957
Why did I go?
Not for money, that s for certain.

421
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,952
But why? I don t know.

422
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,192
Maybe to get Aslan.

423
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,072
Probably because
of the Captain though.

424
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,552
I asked our commander about him,
I asked for help.

425
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,559
He's got connections
from back in Afghanistan.

426
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,954
He said, 'What're you worried about,
be happy you got out.

427
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,154
'It's not your war,
we'll manage without you.'

428
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,239
I got angry about it.

429
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,636
And I felt sorry for Ginger.
Where'd he be without me?

430
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,358
And why not ride to Vladikavkaz
and back for free?!

431
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,116
What were the gun and
the ammunition for then?

432
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,636
But we were going
to the Caucasus!

433
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,270
And the stuff was good,
I could always use it for hunting.

434
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,788
And he was paying!

435
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,516
Hi, guys. I'm Alexander Matrosov!
Where to?

436
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,113
That way.

437
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,875
I got it. I'll put the case
away, alright?

438
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,351
Hey, skinny!

439
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,396
American?

440
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,160
Alexander Matrosov.

441
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,073
This is John, and I'm Ivan.

442
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,314
Guys, I'm Alexander Matrosov!

443
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,794
No free compartment,
so I'll have to cramp your style.

444
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,712
Soon the scum will clear off.
But, for now, I'll play host!

445
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,358
- Anything else?
- Take it easy for the moment.

446
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,912
They're reliable guys.
They're responsible,

447
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,998
you say the word, and that's it!
No going back!

448
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,431
0f course, they're
black -arsed scum,

449
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,760
but they deliver the goods bang
on time and never screw you!

450
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,717
And you know some major
players down there?

451
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,839
Come on, Ivan!!
I'm Alexander Matrosov!

452
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,548
Well, I might have some
business for you, Matrosov.

453
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,159
Hey, scumbag!

454
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,951
Get us some more vodka,
and get us some nibbles...

455
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,112
Look, skinny's conked out.

456
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:10,318
He was a funny guy,
Alexander Matrosov.

457
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,231
He was buying heroin from
the Chechens and taking it to Russia.

458
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,513
We got very drunk
in the restaurant car.

459
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,995
I saw straight away
he was a con -artist.

460
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,437
I didn't tell him anything,
just checked him out...

461
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,629
Arriving in Vladikavkaz!
Do you want the ticket receipts?

462
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:26,511
Hello? Can I speak
to Alexander Kardanov?

463
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,070
Yes, Kardanov.

464
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,674
They'd talked a lot of rubbish
to John in Moscow.

465
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,596
There was no big shot ex-KGB guy
who exchanges hostages.

466
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,157
The guy said he was an FSB Major.

467
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,352
He knew we were coming
and was waiting.

468
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:52,072
When I met him I knew we'd
landed in a right mess.

469
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,349
But what was I supposed to do -
turn round and go home?

470
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,836
You were prepared
to kill, even then?

471
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:07,352
Journalist, you go off to play pool
back in Moscow.

472
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,991
What's your goal? To pocket
some balls, in order to win.

473
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,515
Well, this is war, this is...

474
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,714
Sergeant, what're you getting
so worked up for him about?

475
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:25,115
Comrade Major, it's not my money,
so I couldn't care less.

476
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,313
But ten percent is steep.
He hasn't got much as it is.

477
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,794
Gugaev knows how much we've got -
any less and he won't let her go.

478
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,314
He'll either rape her or cut
her ears off - I know.

479
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,674
And we're late - only four days left.

480
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,671
The ten percent isn't for me.

481
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,991
There's my people,
the people in Chechnya.

482
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,311
It's a big operation -
an illegal operation, Sergeant.

483
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,952
What if we said 50,000?

484
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:06,190
I wouldn't be sitting here, Sergeant.
What are we haggling for?

485
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,870
You ve got the money with you?

486
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,073
Who carries that kind of money,
Comrade Major?

487
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,429
What guarantees can you give?

488
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,957
Serious people in Moscow
gave you my number, Sergeant,

489
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,192
and I don't give out l0Us.

490
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,830
You've no choice, Sergeant. Without
me you're screwed, got it?

491
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,356
Day after tomorrow,
we meet here. I'll bring the money.

492
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,712
There s one condition -
I go with you.

493
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,235
We'd got tails everywhere.

494
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,233
I noticed when I got our bags
from the station.

495
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:00,635
Guys watching, gangster faces,
harder than our Siberian guys.

496
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:07,037
They weren't looking for me -
they didn't need me.

497
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,399
And John was in the tram.
So the game was on...

498
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,271
Listen, where're you from?

499
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,514
Nizhny Tagil.

500
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,756
Almost my neck of the woods.
I'm from Tobolsk.

501
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,433
- In for much longer?
- Five months.

502
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,514
- Conscript?
- 0n a contract.

503
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,432
Been to Chechnya?

504
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,949
What do you think
we're doing here?

505
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,390
What do you want?

506
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,993
I really need to get into Chechnya.
Give us some help...

507
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,192
I'm here for the first time,
we never went in from this side.

508
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,398
Always through Mozdok.
I've got no idea here.

509
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,353
If I got over the border,
I'd find my way from there.

510
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,154
Leave something behind
over there?

511
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,117
I was captured over there.

512
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,273
I've been in civvies for a month,
but I've got a debt to pay.

513
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,989
Tell me who I've got to talkto,
and whatever I've got I'II...

514
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,636
- Well, what have you got?
- What do you need?

515
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,473
What size do you take?

516
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,438
What've you got in here?

517
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,750
Nothing worth thieving!

518
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,869
That's a joke, right?
What're you looking at?

519
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,318
Is that it then?

520
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,718
Stay down! We'll be going
through their border now.

521
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,072
Don't sweat it - they're our guys
on the post.

522
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,598
See you round, guys!

523
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,713
You guys are totally fucking mad!

524
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,071
Tourist!

525
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,309
I'd noticed that he was
filming everything

526
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,590
mumbling to himself,
but so what?

527
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:53,909
When he spoke to me,
I understood, but otherwise...

528
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:01,909
But shooting a film? You've told me,
but I never would've guessed...

529
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,712
They're about to kill his
woman, and he's filming.

530
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,352
They're strange.

531
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:18,192
It's funny - in English 'to film' and
'to shoot' are the same word - 'shoot'.

532
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,591
I didn't know. He told me later.

533
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,308
Anyway, we went on,
just the two of us.

534
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,636
Keep up!

535
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,153
Shit, the map's too small!

536
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,551
Shit!

537
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,911
Idiot!

538
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,070
You're working well.

539
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,033
Where's your owner?

540
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,238
Are you deaf?

541
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,795
Nice!

542
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,596
He was nearly broken then.

543
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,752
I didn't go near him for
the rest of the day.

544
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,869
He mumbled into his camera,
I had a bit more to drink and slept.

545
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:55,159
I thought, if he keeps moaning,
I'll hand myself in to our guys.

546
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,995
The bastards had all our
military locations on their maps.

547
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,595
I even knew where I'd go.

548
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,953
But the next morning he's as fresh as
a cucumber. 'Come on,' he says, 'let's go.'

549
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,872
Waiting for a bus?

550
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,955
End of the road, darky.

551
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,269
Russian! I'm just a shepherd!
I've been tending my flock!

552
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,753
Listen, scum, I know a lot.
0ne word of bullshit and I'll shoot.

553
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,470
If you hear the word 'three',
you're no longer living.

554
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,154
- Name?
- Ruslan Shamaev!

555
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,790
- How many slaves?
- No slaves, I just tend a flock...

556
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,712
0ne, two...

557
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,959
0K! Two, ages ago, but my brother
tookthem for a debt I owed him!

558
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,271
When did you shave the beard off?

559
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,791
Two weeks ago! They made me! I'm
a simple fellow, I live in the mountains!

560
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,077
Where?

561
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,232
Nizhny Alkun!

562
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,989
Where's Aslan Gugaev?!
0ne, two...

563
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,038
- He was in Katan-Yurt...
- Three...

564
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,039
Russian! I know! I'll show you!
Whatever you want!

565
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,995
Careful, scum.
You're my slave now.

566
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,313
And if you screw up,
I'll blow your head off.

567
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,438
Gugaev. 0ne...

568
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:43,475
0n the pass! Protecting
the mountain pass!

569
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:46,359
Now we're talking!

570
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,792
Get up and show me on the map.

571
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:55,035
If I have any doubts about what you say,
it's over - I've counted to three.

572
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,989
I don't know Russian so good.
You speak fast.

573
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,034
I shoot even faster!

574
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,108
We're here. Where's Aslan?

575
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,195
Not here.

576
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,471
Well done.

577
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,394
You've passed the first test.
Let's try the second.

578
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,791
Where?

579
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,470
0ver there. My hand's tied,
I can't point.

580
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,719
- Here?
- No. There!

581
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,831
There, you've passed
the second test.

582
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,794
Just the third one left.

583
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,876
Now, my shepherd friend, you show us
how to get there fast and safe.

584
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:05,551
And so that you don't think I'm joking,
I'll tell you straight:

585
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:12,556
me and the Lone Ranger are finished
anyway, same as you! Got it?!

586
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:19,151
But, if we complete our NAT0 mission,
I give you my word as a Russian paratrooper:

587
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,559
I'll let you go!
You can go tend your flock!

588
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,837
But, you know how difficult
these things can be...

589
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,514
Albatross Four!

590
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,553
Albatross Four!

591
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:42,308
Ruslan Shamaev. Nizhny Alkun.
Check his identity and report back.

592
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:49,796
If I'm not on the wire tomorrow, kill all
his relatives. All of them. 0ver.

593
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,753
This is Beslan Khatuev's jeep.

594
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,913
His brother's disappeared.
Everyone's looking for him.

595
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:11,873
We won't get there in this jeep.
We have to go across the glacier.

596
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,115
Faster that way.

597
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:21,797
Ruslan believed us, especially when
we dumped the Landrover.

598
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,354
Get up! Move it!

599
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,957
Get a move on!

600
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,429
I said move it!

601
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,833
Don't worry.

602
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:13,790
I've told them to leave your family
for now. But they're fierce...

603
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,470
I'll do everything, Russian!

604
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,473
Let's take a break.

605
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,036
I know a way through the ravines.

606
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:09,996
There's no one round here.
All the villages are deserted.

607
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:14,631
After the deportations, the Chechens
didn't come back.

608
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,754
- You're from Moscow, yes?
- Yes.

609
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:26,197
- You have a university there?
- Yes.

610
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,755
You studied there?

611
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,514
Everyone in Moscow studies there.

612
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,197
My uncle lives in Moscow.
He didn't study there.

613
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,949
But he's not Russian, is he!

614
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:46,870
My eldest son is very clever.
I want him to study in Moscow.

615
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,475
Have you got contacts there?

616
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,189
Yes, but it's expensive.

617
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:59,392
I've got money. I want our clan
to have a politician!

618
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,070
But he's not
very good at reading.

619
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:07,115
That's not important anymore.
You just need contacts.

620
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,910
You'll help, yes?

621
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,518
No problem. If your son survives.

622
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:59,754
Come on! Hold on John!

623
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,234
Who did the jeep belong to?

624
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,357
Beslan Khatuev.

625
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,636
What's his call-sign?

626
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:46,599
I don't know Khatuev's - honest!

627
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,916
Who's do you know?

628
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,830
Loads. Who's do you need?

629
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,192
Get Gugaev.

630
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,916
Gugaev!

631
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:49,674
Salaam, Aslan! How's the Internet
doing without me? It's Ivan.

632
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:57,998
Salaam, Ivan. What do you want?

633
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:01,039
Just to say 'Salaam'...

634
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:05,597
I heard the Englishman is
bringing the money.

635
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:11,669
He's late. I'm waiting, for now...

636
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,395
How are my friends?

637
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,359
They're fine.

638
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:26,919
I'm sure they are.
He's bringing the money.

639
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:32,510
But first you promise before Allah
that you won't trick us.

640
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:36,549
0K. Who'll hand over the money?

641
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:42,148
'0K' isn't good enough -
promise before Allah!

642
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:48,194
I've got a witness here.
A Muslim believer.

643
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:53,111
I swear before Allah! When?

644
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,999
In four days time. 0ver and out.

645
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,875
We'll see how faithful
you are to Allah.

646
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,355
We have to get there
in two days. Got it?

647
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:33,197
We got there in a day and a half.
Ruslan took us across some goat-tracks

648
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,355
in from the Georgian side
which was totally unguarded.

649
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,790
All we had to do was
make the exchange.

650
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:58,239
Russian, he won't keep his word.

651
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,832
I heard how he spoke.
All Gugaevs are lying dogs!

652
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,877
0ur families have always
lived close together

653
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,437
on either side of the mountain pass.

654
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:19,909
He's our blood enemy! They always
stole our cattle through the pass.

655
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:23,955
0ur grandfathers fought,
even made peace.

656
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:28,074
In the second war they took
60 sheep from us.

657
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,749
'I'm a fighter, you're
a shepherd,' he says.

658
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,476
'Your father's brother wanted
to kill my grandfather.

659
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,634
But he got scared, and you're
just the same!' he says.

660
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:42,994
Why're you telling me all this?

661
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:48,115
Tomorrow he'll kill the American,
then you, and then he'll kill me.

662
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:53,430
You won't answer the radio,
so my family will be killed too.

663
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,188
That's right.

664
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:35,151
So, proud Chechen shepherd,
can you use thing?

665
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:41,071
Not all Chechens can tend a flock,
but all Chechens can shoot.

666
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:47,753
You have a chance to save
the honour of your clan.

667
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:08,549
Russian, tell yours to leave my family
alone. They'll kill you...

668
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,718
maybe...

669
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:15,716
I'm your family now, got it?!
Protect me, and you'll save them.

670
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:19,828
If I see it's all over for us,
then I'll tell them.

671
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,191
Let's go.

672
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:29,271
In his book and film, John says you were
beating the Chechen shepherd...

673
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,112
...and then you just give him weapons.

674
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,516
So what?

675
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,109
Weren't you afraid he'd
shoot you in the back?

676
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:40,797
0f course not, I had
his family as hostages.

677
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:41,954
Salaam, Aslan.

678
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,559
Salaam, Ivan.

679
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,030
You're a mountain man, Ivan.

680
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,469
I live on the plains.

681
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,915
We brought the ransom.
Let's go.

682
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,999
- Where're the keys?
- There.

683
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,397
Ruslan!

684
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,549
No! 0bey your orders!

685
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,630
You won't get out of here!

686
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:16,152
Then you won't get the money.
Tie his hands!

687
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,869
What about your oath, Aslan?

688
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,237
Go to the machinegun.

689
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,279
Tell your people already.

690
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,471
It's still too early!

691
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,034
Morning, Comrade Captain!

692
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,113
Hello, Sergeant. Give us a smoke.

693
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:30,358
We'd landed ourselves right in it.
We couldn't use Aslan for cover.

694
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,192
No way backthrough the pass
with the Captain.

695
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:42,512
We could go down through the village,
but there were a lot of beards down there.

696
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:48,836
The Captain said it: climbing a tree
is easy, getting back down's the hard part.

697
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:54,549
He's a great guy. He thought
of using the river.

698
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,835
They weren't expecting that.

699
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:20,439
Comrade Captain, we need air support.
We're finished without it.

700
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,440
We're too far off to use the radio.

701
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,872
Let's try the satellite phone.

702
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:39,718
You're well-stocked, Sergeant!

703
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,432
How does it work?

704
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:53,992
Simple - we need to catch a satellite.

705
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,435
I'll tune it in.

706
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,112
Hello! Give me HQ chief,
Colonel Malykhin!

707
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:11,837
Captain Medvedev! Move it!

708
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:15,232
Great line!
If only we had these...

709
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:31,875
It's Captain Medvedev. Hi, Kolya.

710
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:37,433
Listen, we're surrounded -
send some air support!

711
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,633
There's five of us, two English.

712
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:47,715
The Shatoi region, south of Itum-Kali,
coordinate 34.

713
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:53,475
There's an abandoned village with
a big old tower! We're in the tower.

714
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:58,158
Yes, they're firing at us!

715
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,073
I think we can hold out for an hour.

716
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,273
There's nowhere to land.

717
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,229
Alright then.

718
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:15,072
So? Are they coming?

719
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,910
Lads, give us a cigarette.

720
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:03,070
- Long to go?
- Seven months.

721
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:09,230
- Just back from Chechnya?
- From Grozny.

722
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:15,391
Here. It's a bonus from NAT0

723
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:20,109
for the fight against
international terrorism.

724
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:27,430
It s English money - almost
two thousand dollars.

725
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,670
You know the rest.

726
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:37,480
John made a film and
became famous.

727
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:42,669
I'm being prosecuted for killing citizens
of the Russian Federation -

728
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:46,279
I was a civilian, after all.

729
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:50,469
John put it all in the film,
about the woman in the jeep

730
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:54,355
and the old man with his kid at Aslan's.

731
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:57,074
How did he shoot it all?

732
01:54:57,320 --> 01:55:01,233
He wrote a book as well -
'My Life in Russia'.

733
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:05,951
He didn't come to the court case,
of course. Gave evidence over there.

734
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:12,039
But the brave shepherd Shamaev
turned up, detailing how I tortured him

735
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:16,599
how I cynically slaughtered
Chechen women and children.

736
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:20,953
He lives in Moscow now.
His son's at university there.

737
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:27,554
Margaret never did marry John.

738
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:31,668
I gave the Captain all the money -

739
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:35,828
I knew what was waiting
for him back home.

740
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:41,473
His wife wrote, said they'd done
some expensive operations.

741
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:47,034
He's stuck up for me.
He's a good man.

742
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:52,238
I don't thinkthey'll put me away,
but who knows.

743
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:55,832
0ur lot in Tobolsk keep
looking to Moscow:

744
01:55:56,120 --> 01:56:01,797
what will Putin say,
will there be legal reforms?

745
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:08,032
Still haven't seen that film.
It'd be fun to watch it now.
