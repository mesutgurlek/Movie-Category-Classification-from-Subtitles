1
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:51,683
[No active fire at this time
and the location of the place]

2
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,291
<i>Kandahar province,
Southern Afghanistan,</i>

3
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,727
<i>the birthplace of the Taliban.</i>

4
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,664
<i>It's 54,000 square kilometres
of brutal insurgency,</i>

5
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>conflicting agendas,</i>

6
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,235
<i>tribal rivalry and blood feuds.</i>

7
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,373
<i>This is the Canadian forces area
of operation. We wear it.</i>

8
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,510
<i>And every day, we drive deeper
into the furnace of enemy country.</i>

9
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,413
<i>It's one hell of a rough road.</i>

10
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,471
Checking dope,

11
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,840
up 15 left one.

12
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,243
Wind gusts 15 to 20.

13
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,180
Left to right.

14
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,483
Hold left hand side of target.

15
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,252
On.

16
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:11,723
And buddy's got a shovel.

17
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,793
- Could be a farmer.
- On a road?

18
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,629
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's a road, man.

19
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,699
Could be a really shitty farmer,
like, constantly puzzled, you know?

20
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,902
He's in the village, asking everybody,
"why are my crops so lousy?"

21
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,239
No one has the heart to say,
"hey, buddy, you can't grow,

22
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:30,742
like, anything on a road."

23
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,745
Will you shut the fuck up?

24
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,916
Bad move.

25
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,253
He's got a shell casing
shaped like a 122,

26
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,689
orange det cord
sticking out of the nose.

27
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,657
Three niner Alpha, 66.

28
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,460
I have pid, positive ID
on one times insurgent.

29
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:54,366
66, this is three
niner Alpha. Over.

30
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,741
Black head dress, holding
a 122 mm shell casing

31
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,544
with orange det cord
emanating from the top...

32
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,446
emanating?

33
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,449
Coming out of the top.

34
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,517
And now he's placing
the projectile

35
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,488
- into the hole.
- One rude hyena, 650 meters to the north northwest

36
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,791
of grid Quebec Quebec 41768134.

37
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,694
Three niner Alpha acknowledge.

38
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,968
When he stands back up, engage.

39
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,337
Stand by.

40
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,552
Send it.

41
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,935
Three niner Alpha, 66.

42
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,338
Three niner Alpha send.

43
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,974
Engaged in center mass.
No motion.

44
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,878
At grid Quebec Quebec 41768134.

45
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:19,718
Moving to rv extraction
at grid Quebec Quebec 41998226.

46
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,793
One times insurgent vsa.
We are pushing higher assets to confirm.

47
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:31,029
Three niner Alpha, Roger.
Your ride's en route.

48
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,430
One times insurgent kia
at grid Quebec Quebec

49
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,667
41768134.

50
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,938
What's up?

51
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,144
Take a look at that culvert.

52
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:55,847
Cover the stretch of road
50 meters to... to the left.

53
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,918
Three one Charlie, this is 66.
What's your eta?

54
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:07,459
Three one Charlie, this is 66. Advise you
hold your position. Do not crest the hill.

55
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,494
I say again, do not
crest the hill.

56
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,730
We've got something weird on the road.
Gonna have a look. Wait out.

57
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,116
Hickey, get the coyote
on the patch just ten meters

58
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,052
left of the culvert.
Put a round in it.

59
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,938
- What do you think?
- It's probably nothing.

60
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,243
Hickey, put a round
in the patch next to it.

61
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,196
- Could be just a bad patch of road.
- Yeah, what if you're wrong?

62
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,599
When have I ever been wrong?

63
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,235
- My sister?
- Yeah, that was bad.

64
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,904
Hickey, just for fun?

65
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:29,274
Chamber up a raufoss. Line up
on that patch dead ahead of us.

66
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,261
- Stand by.
- Send it.

67
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,004
- You okay?
- Ah, fuck!

68
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,679
We're blown.

69
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,927
- Ambush!
- Go! Go! Go!

70
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,931
- Go! Get the fuck out of there!
- Covering!

71
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,046
Covering!

72
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,688
Covering! Moving!

73
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,370
Three niner Alpha, Roger. Out.

74
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,672
Hey, we got a tick.
We got troops in contact.

75
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,709
Three one Charlie, three niner Alpha.
Do you acknowledge last from 66?

76
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,982
66. Negative. Do not crest the hill. The road
is filled with ieds. You are the target.

77
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:20,619
Can you circle the Ridge,
get us on the back side?

78
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,688
Break break.

79
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,191
66, three niner Alpha.
What's the force size?

80
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:29,928
66. Two-zero to two-five hostiles.
Am seeking strong point. Wait out.

81
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,229
Fuck!

82
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,933
- They're still on us! Fuck!
- Fucker!

83
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,235
- They got us cut off!
- We need to find a strong point!

84
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,337
I got a village!

85
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:53,251
- Contact!

86
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,226

87
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,367

00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,441
Covering! Go!

95
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,011
We got a door straight ahead!

96
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,414
Fuck, it's blocked!

97
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,056
- 66...
- Covering! - We still have contact.

98
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,460
We're moving into village. We'll strong
point from there. Send grid, over!

99
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:11,096
- Get lavigne on zero, asap.
- You're on with zero, ma'am.

100
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,931
Zero, this is three niner Alpha.

101
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,437
Three niner Alpha,
this is zero. Roger that.

102
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,274
We'll see what we got in the air. Over.
Tac-p, what lines we flying right now?

103
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,310
- Two ship, but they're not in range, sir.
- Get 'em there. Push 'em hard.

104
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,445
- Fires, get me a pss-sof grid.
- Roger that.

105
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,785
Convoy is en route and zero

106
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,286
is pushing fast air but you're
going to have to hang in there.

107
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,058
We gotta find another
point of entrance!

108
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,029
Rpg!

109
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:51,803
- They blew a hole!
- There's an opening! - Go through it! Go!

110
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,239
Thank you, mister Taliban!

111
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,145
Salaam alaikum.

112
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,148
Clear!

113
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,928
- Clear!
- Let's go!

114
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,231
Someone clear this door.

115
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,936
Alright, Ryan, we got
a compound dead up there.

116
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,506

00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,434
They're surrounding us.

124
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:33,271

- I think he wants to help.

125

127
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,617
66. We are holed up inside
compound at grid... Travis?

128
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,253
Quebec Quebec 41338921...

129
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:52,023
Quebec Quebec 41338921.
We have a section plus

130
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,259
of insurgents
encircling compound.

131
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:58,930
We need qrf extraction
for 4 pax, Asa-fucking-p.

132
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,499
We got an elder
with crazy eyes, he's...

133
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:05,670
He's asking us inside. I'm moving in.
We'll strong point from there. Over.

134
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,574
- Did he say 'crazy eyes'?
- Yeah.

135
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,510
- Can I get a description of the elder?
- 66, this is zero.

136
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,281
66. Did you not hear me?
We need qrf extraction now!

137
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:20,518
It's important.
Describe the friendly. Over.

138
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,022
66. Elder is about...

139
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:28,092
I don't know, he's Afghan old.
Weird eyes, different colours.

140
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,995
Break break. Zero, they're jammed here,
we gotta get them out!

141
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,031
Three niner Alpha,
we're pushing. Will advise.

142
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,967
Fuck!

143
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,407
Let's move in.
Come on. Let's move in.

144
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,409
I got it.

145
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,679
- Clear!

146
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,514
Everybody take a corner.

147
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,653
Three niner Alpha, 66. Looking
for status on that ride home?

148
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,689
66, three niner Alpha.

149
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:01,259
Qrf is two-zero Mikes out and
you're danger close for artillery.

150
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,261
You're gonna have to hunker down.
We'll get you out of there asap.

151
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:06,297
66, Roger. Out.
We're on our own.

152
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,299
- What, they can't get anything to us?
- Not for a while.

153
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,103
Okay, guys, let's arm up.

154
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,422
What the fuck?

155
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:44,102
- Grenade. I need a grenade.
- I got one. Here.

156
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,119
Ryan. What do you think
they're doing?

157
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,187
Same as us, getting ready.

158
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:16,401
- You see anything?
- They got an '82 recoilless.

159
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,603
Oh, great.

160
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,685
- Everybody okay?
- Good. - Yeah.

161
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,422
- I'm good. You?
- What's he doing?

162
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,824
I don't know.

163
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,801
They killed him.

164
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,273
- Gents, it's been a privilege.
- Likewise.

165
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:59,410
- Kill every fucker that comes through those doors.
- Roger that.

166
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,456
Hold your fire!

167
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,631
- Taliban?
- No Taliban.

168
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,802
We're safe?

169
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,804
You trust him?

170
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,873
Let's gear up.

171
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:35,379
Let's go!

172
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,689
- Thank you.
- Clear!

173
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,765
Clear!

174
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,535
Clear.

175
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,639
Where the hell did they go?

176
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,908
Three niner Alpha, 66.
We're clearing the village.

177
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,848
Three niner Alpha,
acknowledge. Rv Quebec Quebec

178
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,353
40128883. Over.

179
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,361
Zero, this is three niner Alpha.

180
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,363
66 coming home. Over.

181
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,733
Zero acknowledge.

182
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,335
Fuck...

183
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,532
<i>Kaf.</i>

184
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,702
<i>You might as well be on Mars
as in Afghanistan.</i>

185
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,704
<i>We're out in the middle
of the desert,</i>

186
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,839
<i>surrounded by a forest
of razor wire.</i>

187
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:12,610
<i>It's a coalition force from over
forty-five different nations.</i>

188
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,880
<i>Two-thirds of the soldiers deployed
here never even see the country,</i>

189
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,717
<i>they just see blast walls
and defects, Tim horton's.</i>

190
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,720
<i>Nobody even knows how many
people are on this base;</i>

191
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,591
<i>thirty-five, forty-five,
sixty thousand.</i>

192
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:30,695
<i>It's here, inside the wire, that we organize
everything that goes on outside the wire,</i>

193
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,763
<i>and half the time
we got it wrong.</i>

194
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,899
<i>But that means half the time
we got it right.</i>

195
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,771
<i>It's a vast organism that consumes
14 metric tons of food a day</i>

196
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:44,976
<i>and shits into a lake that fills
the air with 30% fecal matter.</i>

197
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:51,382
<i>In kaf, you breathe
your own shit.</i>

198
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,353
<i>I'm building a road, gentlemen,</i>

199
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,389
I'm building a big fucking road
and it's going like a dagger

200
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,492
into the heart of the enemy
and it is fucking him up.

201
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,728
And every morning he wakes up,

202
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,863
and I'm standing there and I'm punching
him right in his fucking face.

203
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:10,368
Now we've never been this deep
into the heart of panjaway,

204
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,771
but hyena road is in there
and she is in there to stay.

205
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,774
And they don't like it, 'cause we're
fucking with their freedom of movement.

206
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,278
So they're going after our dump trucks
and our gravel trucks and our workers.

207
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,314
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying

208
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:26,851
I've lost 36 civilians in the last four
months and this bullshit's got to stop.

209
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,453
- And I'm going to need a little help from you.
- General,

210
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,024
- I am just one man...
- you're bashir daoud Khan, bdk.

211
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,925
You're one man with a militia.

212
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,497
And I'm your partner in peace.

213
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,767
So I need your eyes
and your ears

214
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,935
and I need you
and your son to be

215
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,705
at our little dedication ceremony...
how many clicks there, shorty?

216
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,676
- Fifteen, sir.
- Fifteen clicks of hardtop into the horn.

217
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:55,079
Your presence there
would be very meaningful.

218
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,723
Hyena road is a gift

219
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,926
to all Afghans.
It would be an honour

220
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,063
for my father and I
to attend your ceremony.

221
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:16,734
Out-fucking-standing.

222
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,840
- Thank you, general.
- Thank you, sir.

223
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,088
Look at that little prick.
He's like caligula.

224
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,826
It'd be a hell of a lot easier to get hyena
built if that prick would stop breathing.

225
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,628
Yeah, right there you're right.
Look, I'm gonna hop a flight.

226
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,897
I wanna get out to sper and
run down a lead on an elder.

227
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,934
- Tell Armstrong I'll call in from the fob.
- You don't wanna hang with me?

228
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,737
Oh, you know there is
nothing I'd rather do,

229
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:56,874
but the future of western civilization
depends on my ass getting out to sper.

230
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:59,737
<i>Alexander the great marched into this graveyard
about twenty-five hundred years ago.</i>

231
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:04,442
<i>Easy to march in; Hard
to march out. His words.</i>

232
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,644
<i>He and his mother wrote
to each other all the time.</i>

233
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,813
<i>And one day he got a letter
from her saying, "what the hell?</i>

234
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,949
<i>"You conquered most of the known
world in like a day and a half,</i>

235
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,685
<i>what are you doing bogged down
in Afghanistan?"</i>

236
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:17,021
<i>He grabbed a bag and
shoveled it full of dirt</i>

237
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:19,557
<i>and had it sent back to Greece
with a message to his mother:</i>

238
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,461
<i>"Take this dirt and dump it around
the palace, see what happens."</i>

239
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,859
<i>So Alexander's mother spread
the dirt all around the palace.</i>

240
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:58,262
<i>Later that night a couple of attendants
showed up, to make sure she was alright.</i>

241
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,698
<i>One says, go ahead, after you.</i>

242
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,968
<i>And the other one says, no, after you.
And the first one says, no,</i>

243
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,971
<i>I insist. And the second one says,
don't you tell me what to do,</i>

244
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,106
<i>and they both pull their swords
and they go at it</i>

245
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,175
<i>until they kill each other.</i>

246
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,078
<i>Alexander's mother watched all this
and wrote a note to him saying,</i>

247
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,248
<i>okay, okay, now I get it.</i>

248
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,051
<i>And he wrote back, saying, yeah,
even the dirt is hostile.</i>

249
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:25,055
<i>In Afghanistan, dogs fight dogs,</i>

250
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,125
<i>birds fight birds, men kill men.</i>

251
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,794
Fire!

252
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:48,145
- Mind if I join you?
- Not at all, warrant, please.

253
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,091
Hey, I got an update
from the engineer

254
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:05,029
on that stretch of hyena from yesterday.
They cleared 8 ieds in all.

255
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:08,299
Something went wrong with the last one...
the guy lost his leg above the knee.

256
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:12,670
They airlifted him to landstuhl.

257
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,072
- I think we need to talk.
- Hey, uh...

258
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,943
Hi, jenn, sorry to interrupt here. Ryan,
I'm Pete Mitchell, one of the effects guys

259
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:23,347
at brigade. Didn't mean to wreck your meal,
but you mind if I have a word with you?

260
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,282
Sure.

261
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:29,053
Catch up to you later.

262
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:39,763
I was in the toc when you guys
had that engagement in haji baba.

263
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:44,602
You were fucking lucky.

264
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:48,639
- Come all the way out here to tell me that?
- No.

265
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,342
No, I came out here because...

266
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,011
And I could be way out of line
here but, you know,

267
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,347
manifestly you and jenn got
a little something going.

268
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,184
On behalf of the entire battle
group, I'd just like to express

269
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:03,687
our collective fuckin' jealousy.

270
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,023
You got a girl?

271
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:09,760
Yep. Woman of
my dreams back home.

272
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:12,630
- Does she know what you do?
- My wife?

273
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,399
No, she thinks I work
inside the wire

274
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,836
and I'm going to leave it that way.
Let her sleep easy at night.

275
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,708
Tell me something.

276
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,845
How much you do you know
about pashtunwali?

277
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,848
Well, whatever's in
the handbook. You know,

278
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,018
- it's a tribal code. It's old.
- Oh yeah.

279
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,389
It's so old they look upon islam
as a kind of recent add-on.

280
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:41,358
What are those?

281
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,661
They're dates.
They're local.

282
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,764
They help you shit.

283
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,203
The code has got a bunch of,
well, they call them pillars,

284
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,206
and one of them is panah,

285
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,742
which means 'protection',
more or less.

286
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,311
So when that elder invited you
into his home he gave you panah:

287
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,847
No harm could come to you.

288
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,352
- So I owe him, you mean?
- Well, he did it

289
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:12,189
for Allah, he didn't do it for you. But you
are still breathing so that'd be your call.

290
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,362
This elder,

291
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,198
did he speak any English?

292
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,401
No.
Just a couple words.

293
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,705
- Any marks about him, any scars?
- No,

294
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,040
- but he had weird eyes.
- Weird how?

295
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,943
His left eye was brown.
His right eye was deep blue.

296
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,849
So who is this guy?

297
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,819
Why'd he... why'd he
give me this panah?

298
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,855
That's what I want to know.

299
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,891
I got a patrol going back into
the village in the morning.

300
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,395
I'd really like it if you'd come
along with me, help me ID the guy.

301
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,099
- Yeah, sure, I'll be there.
- O900.

302
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,167
- Alright.
- Alright.

303
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,937
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah.

304
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,447
What are you thinking?

305
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,216
Hmm...

306
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,219
I'm thinking about our hotel
room in Cyprus.

307
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,295
Umm...

308
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,100
Okay, I'm gonna say something

309
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:06,069
and I'm gonna say it for both of
us and it's going to be shitty

310
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,806
and it's got to be said.

311
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,844
Fuck me.

312
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:17,481
You know that I am completely
crazy about you. And Cyprus was...

313
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,087
Cyprus was perfect.

314
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,927
We're perfect. But we can't keep
doing this. We both know that.

315
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,162
If we get caught,

316
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:36,133
- I'm gonna get cashiered. This is my career.
- It's mine, too.

317
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:40,137
I know, this is what I'm
saying. When we rotate home,

318
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:43,507
we'll see. But right now, while
we're here, it's gotta stop.

319
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,348
So this is it?

320
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,184
I think it has to be.

321
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,927
This is like fucking armageddon.

322
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,263
I know.

323
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,268
You know there is nothing
that I would rather do

324
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,571
than climb over there and
fraternize the shit out of you.

325
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,341
Hmm...

326
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,445
You can't dump me
in one sentence

327
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:26,016
and say something
like that in the next.

328
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,891
Ah...

329
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,198
Now, when you get to the grape
fields, if you see wire,

330
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,936
you see metal, you see plastic
or newly turned dirt?

331
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:22,139
Don't step on it. If you didn't
drop it, don't pick it up.

332
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:26,176
Try to stay at least five body lengths
between the next man in the patrol.

333
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,646
When we get in the village,
you're going to see women dressed in bags.

334
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:33,951
Please don't stare at them. I know you've
probably seen that in Toronto or Paris,

335
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:38,121
but you haven't seen it here. Here,
those bags are like magnets for your eyes.

336
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:42,326
If you get caught staring at them,
it's gonna fuck shit up for us.

337
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,630
Quick clot, tourniquet,

338
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,433
- bandage.
- I don't know how to use any of that.

339
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:53,637
Ma'am, if it has to be used,
it won't be you using it.

340
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,219
Salaam alaikum.

341
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,357
Hey! Eyes.

342
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,698
- Salaam alaikum.
- Alaikum salaam.

343
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,667
This is my ptm.

344
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,104
In my job, it is a great honour to
meet elders such as yourself today.

345
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,173
And if you chose so,
it is a good day.

346
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:06,643
But I was hoping to meet
another elder in this village?

347
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:22,759
He insists that "I'm the only
elder and there is no other".

348
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,762
Strange, because someone
told me there was another

349
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:28,498
important man who lived in this
village, but I forget his name.

350
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,836
But this person said you couldn't forget him
because he had two different coloured eyes.

351
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,788
Hey! Hey. What's in your head?
You're too high.

352
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,591
You can see the women without
their bags. Get down. Get down!

353
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:58,195
- Sorry, sir.
- I think you know who I mean.

354
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:03,200
- He says he's a ghost.
- Even ghosts have to live somewhere.

355
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:15,612
He says most of them
live in kandahar city.

356
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:37,300
- Haji, what the fuck are you doing?
- The carpets are dusty.

357
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,504
The entire country is dusty.

358
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,472
Come on, let's have some tea.

359
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,609
- Step into my office.
- How are you doing, Pete?

360
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,811
How is your family?
How is your time?

361
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,148
It's good. How is yours?

362
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,683
Have you heard from Kabul?
When will you see 'em?

363
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:57,254
Soon. Insha Allah.

364
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,889
You're frowning.

365
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:04,327
I thought you were crazy, but I was
wrong and I don't like to be wrong.

366
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,596
My cousin says maybe it is him.

367
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:10,233
- In k-city?
- He thinks so. Why is he back?

368
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:14,704
- If it's even him.
- But the eyes?

369
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,442
If it is him, do you think
you can get me in to see him?

370
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,778
My uncle has arranged it
for tomorrow.

371
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,314
Tell him I'm gonna
bring along another guy,

372
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:27,384
- the master sniper with the battle group.
- One other thing.

373
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:30,820
- It's not relational...
- related. - Related, yes.

374
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,223
I'm hearing something
about an attack.

375
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,926
- In k-city?
- Soon. That's all I know.

376
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:37,961
As soon as I find out more,
I will tell you.

377
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:40,497
Okay.

378
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,966
How are you?
You need anything?

379
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:46,236
- No, I'm good.
- You always say you're good.

380
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:49,940
I'm Afghan.

381
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,742
Oh listen, I got you...

382
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:56,479
- I got you some of that shampoo.
- What?

383
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:00,217
Some of that hand cream
you guys are so crazy about.

384
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:06,389
- Thank you, this is great.
- You're welcome, my friend.

385
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,960
This is my favourite.

386
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:13,263
Guys, listen up. This is
straight from the brass. Guys!

387
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:16,833
Listen. Alright... no more
fraternizing with goats!

388
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,336
You bunch of goat-fuckers.

389
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:23,240
Okay, listen up. All four dets are out
tonight, all ops are observe and report,

390
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,942
except for you, Travis. You guys
are on that bend in hyena

391
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,477
where that fucking tree is,
so keep your eyes peeled.

392
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:33,950
I've been seconded to intel for the
day so I'm heading into k-city.

393
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,952
Wilf here is going to step up.

394
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,622
Nice. Wilf!

395
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:42,392
Alright, I got some bad news.

396
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,996
They grabbed a couple of guys
from 10th mountain dog company.

397
00:37:45,998 --> 00:37:48,765
- What?
- Yeah. I don't know the details

398
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,767
but there was an ied
of some sort,

399
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,902
and the tallies
grabbed two of them.

400
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,973
- Are they alive?
- Yeah.

401
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,748
Fuck!

402
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,719
You can blow me up with an ied,

403
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:14,357
shoot me with an ak, fucking
run me over with a lav...

404
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:20,697
I'm fucking fine with that! But do not
let me be taken alive by these...

405
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:24,301
Fucking medievalists.

406
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,736
You good?

407
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,908
- What exactly do they do to you?
- It's unspeakable.

408
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,779
- New comm logs. Fill them out.
- What do you mean... - hey.

409
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,815
Unspeakable means we don't
fucking speak about it.

410
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,639
Targets down.

411
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,874
Let's back up.

412
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,856
- First time, wilf, how do you feel?
- Good.

413
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,827
- Ready to go?
- No, not quite. I gotta take a shit.

414
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,030
- What? Why?
- Why, I don't know, maybe 'cause my lower intestine

415
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,032
is full of shit?
Give me your bag.

416
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,868
- Alright, fine.
- Thanks.

417
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,443
What a beautiful night...

418
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:44,514
You know, if they get this place
together, I'd come back.

419
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,916
- Bring Joey camping.
- Camping.

420
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,918
- Yeah.
- In kandahar?

421
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,821
Why the fuck not?

422
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,924
Number two totally offloaded.

423
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,528
Good to go.

424
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,065
Three niner Alpha,

425
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,935
this is 66 bravo. Ready
for extraction. Over.

426
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,072
Let's move.

427
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,093
- It's a beautiful morning.
- Has been for two hours.

428
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:34,631
- How long until the convoy?
- Should be on the move, five, ten Mikes, maybe.

429
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:38,802
These a&a dudes...
You trust these guys?

430
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:41,604
With my life.

431
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,073
It's their war.
We're just along for the ride.

432
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,075
Hey, walid...

433
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,979
- Huh?
- What's he got going on the tunes?

434
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:57,487
- Leif Garrett.
- You're shitting me. Come on, put it out for all to hear.

435
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,677
On the move. Mount up.

436
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,834
Gulf niner whiskey,
we're falling in. Over.

437
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,756
We'll take this right.

438
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,797
This is Gulf niner whiskey,
we're breaking off. Thanks for the tow.

439
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,132
Pete, anywhere here.

440
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,211
- Who is that guy?
- He's called the cleaner.

441
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:38,681
He's the bravest man I've ever
known. My greatest ally here.

442
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:41,384
He works for us but can't be seen with us,
if you know what I mean.

443
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,620
His family's up in Kabul,

444
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:46,222
and he hasn't seen them
or slept in the same bed

445
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:48,691
more than three nights running
in the last two years.

446
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:51,761
Why is he doing it?

447
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:54,831
Love of country?
I honestly don't know.

448
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,934
Can't just be for
the money we pay him.

449
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:55,291
- Salaam alaikum.
- Alaikum salaam.

450
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,355
He says his name is Mohammed.

451
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:30,860
Yeah, of course it is.
This bread looks very good.

452
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:38,334
My friend, Ryan.
We have been friends,

453
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:42,739
we have known each other and loved
each other for many, many years.

454
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:45,408
And you helped my friend
in the village of haji baba.

455
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,084
And I would like to repay you
for that kindness.

456
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,053
Now you must need something?

457
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,322
Perhaps new prayer rugs
for your mosque.

458
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:02,125
I would like to help with that.

459
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,433
- How much is that?
- I have no idea.

460
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,969
This is for your village.

461
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:32,822
He says, "only a fool accepts a gift
without knowing what it's for."

462
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,296
There was a legendary warrior,
a mujahedeen in the jihad

463
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,132
against the Soviets. He was
called 'the lion of the desert'.

464
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:58,214
He says he's heard of this man.

465
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:02,585
The word is that he's back.
He's once again mujahid.

466
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:05,321
Have you heard anything
about these rumours?

467
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,435
May I ask where you're from?

468
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:30,880
- He says his village is called Abdullah jan.
- Ah, so you're Pakistani?

469
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,929
"I've been a Pakistani
for many years,

470
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:49,565
a Muslim for fourteen hundred and
a pashtun for five thousand."

471
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:50,967
I understand.

472
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,274
If you hear anything
about the lion,

473
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:00,476
I would greatly appreciate it.

474
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:22,098
- So he's Pakistani?
- No.

475
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,001
No, that was just
a kind of test.

476
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:28,571
Abdullah jan is just
the ruins of some village

477
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,274
across the border
from spin boldak.

478
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:34,977
Nobody's really lived there for a
couple hundred years, least of all him.

479
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:39,348
- So he's not just some guy from a village.
- No, he's not.

480
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,684
He's the lion of the desert.

481
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:44,020
That's what his people
called him.

482
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:53,095
The Russians, they called him the
ghost because they couldn't kill him.

483
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,999
They shot him four times,
they blew him up twice.

484
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:59,268
And each time,

485
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,472
his guys would get him up over the mountains
and into the red cross tents in Pakistan.

486
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,942
Then they'd get him stitched up

487
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:09,145
and he'd be back out there
blowing Russians out of the sky.

488
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,551
We just met a very big gun.

489
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,454
He's like a rommel or a patton.

490
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:22,959
This guy beat the red army, and
he was a kid when he did it.

491
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,361
When the Russians pulled out,

492
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:28,631
I'm going back to my grape
fields,

493
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:31,133
I don't want any part
of your stupid civil war.

494
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,102
Just leave me alone.

495
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,671
Which they did,
and it was kinda weird

496
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,640
because generally speaking,

497
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,676
the tallies went after anybody
who stood against them. But him,

498
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:43,412
for some reason they just
left him alone.

499
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,650
- But now he's back.
- He's back,

500
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:51,354
and I gotta figure out why. A guy like him,
with his influence? He could prob...

501
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:13,075
we have multiple bombers, vehicle borne and
coordinated. Reporting civilian casualties,

502
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:17,146
multiple civ-kia, city center... -
got a VD-ied southwest kandahar city.

503
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:20,116
- Multiple casualties.
- In air reports taking fire

504
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:22,084
at route one and
Alpha seven-five.

505
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,455
- Must have hit the engine block.
- Goddamn.

506
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:30,359
Peter, where is the convoy?
We lost the convoy!

507
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,732
- Zero, golf niner whiskey.
- I have contact. Over.

508
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,701
Yeah, golf niner whiskey.
We have contact

509
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:48,144
zero, Roger. Be advised we
have reports of multiple sbvied

510
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,413
in vicinity of police
headquarters. More to follow.

511
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:52,615
Golf niner whiskey, send.

512
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:58,421
I advise you, try and exit city, move to
camp Nathan Smith, ride this one out.

513
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:01,824
Golf niner whiskey. Wilco out.
There's another explosion. Let's go.

514
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,627
We're gonna have to move,
head north.

515
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:08,397
- Goddamn, I can't get the radio...
- forget the radio! We'll use my mbiter.

516
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,801
Let's go. We got to move.

517
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:21,577
- Fuck. I'm gonna have to blow it.
- Walid?

518
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,380
- Yeah.
- Come... come here. Behind the car.

519
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,086
Frag out.

520
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,494
Mitchell, grab walid.
Punch up to that corner,

521
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,697
- cover my 6.
- Roger. Stay with me.

522
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,568
Clear.

523
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:49,205
Dick.

524
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,377
Let's go.

525
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,382
They're moving
on the fucking rooftops.

526
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,755
Clear. Let's go.

527
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,294
Rpg!

528
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,401
- You good?
- Yeah, good.

529
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,374
- Can you shoot?
- Me? Fuck no. I'm intel.

530
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:31,180
Zero, golf niner whiskey.
I have pid on multiple hostiles,

531
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:34,150
40 meters east of last position.
Engaging. Wait out.

532
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,620
- Zero, Roger.
- Moving. - Covering.

533
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,432
Target, one o'clock!

534
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,277
Target down! Mitchell,
come up to me.

535
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:03,646
- Move it.
- Go, go, go!

536
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,617
Hold up!

537
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,686
I need you to punch left.

538
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,557
- Down that alleyway. I'll cover you. You good?
- Yeah, good to go.

539
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,593
Standby.

540
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:20,629
Go!

541
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,676
Clear!

542
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:36,645
Clear.

543
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:40,416
This is bad.

544
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:44,587
You piss with the dick
you got. Move it.

545
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:56,465
- Changing mags. Cover me.
- Covering.

546
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,337
Moving.

547
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:09,545
Rooftop, 9 o'clock.

548
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,926
Clear.

549
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,411
- Shoot him.
- I don't shoot kids.

550
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,859
- Clear.
- Clear.

551
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,636
No, no. It's my guy. It's my guy.
It's the cleaner. Go, go, go, go.

552
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:25,354
Haji, where did you get
this truck?

553
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:28,490
- My uncle!
- Of course.

554
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,559
I hung around, you never know
about this city.

555
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:33,996
I heard the gunfire. Came
looking for you. We got lucky!

556
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:41,937
Zero acknowledge. Goddamn.

557
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,880
Can you get that in
to Armstrong?

558
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,717
Ho, ho, ho. That was balls out,

559
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,919
flat-out fucking insanity.

560
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:59,455
Five suicide bombers,

561
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:02,691
a rack of rpgs,
17 dead, 37 wounded.

562
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,494
- I gotta get a coffee.
- Do we know what they were after?

563
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:09,732
Yeah. Police headquarters. We just got caught
up in it. And that is kandahar Karma, baby,

564
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:13,469
that's what that is. And I got
to say you handled your rifle

565
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,838
like you got ice in your veins.

566
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,475
All those tallies were using aks, which is
a great weapon if you're in a phone booth.

567
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:22,811
You work the city a lot?

568
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:26,749
- A fair bit, yeah.
- You got a weird job.

569
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:29,551
Oh yeah, and... and you don't?

570
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,520
Me? No.

571
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:33,522
No, everybody knows the rules:

572
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:35,924
You pick up an ak, an rpg,
you're gonna hear about it.

573
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:38,527
There's no grey area.

574
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,730
Well, except back home where they think what
you do is a little too... I don't know...

575
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,067
premeditated. But my shit?

576
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,102
Hearts and minds?
They lap that stuff up.

577
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,038
It's got a moral ring to it,
even if it's mostly just PR.

578
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,940
You believe that?

579
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,910
These people here?

580
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:58,447
They got no use for what
we have on offer.

581
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,983
They don't want Justin bieber,
or tom Jefferson,

582
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:03,452
or our fucking pornography.

583
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,789
They just want our money and
a little bit of stability.

584
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,792
- So how do we win?
- There is no winning.

585
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:12,494
There's just an end state and
that's gonna get laid down

586
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:14,530
by foreign policy, not by us.

587
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,465
You're a cynical man.

588
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:19,535
Not about this country, I'm not.

589
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:23,472
- Not about these people.
- Me neither.

590
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:26,208
And I gotta believe that
if I put a 6-dollar round,

591
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,877
just one bullet
in the right place,

592
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,146
I could change everything.

593
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:35,150
You may be right.

594
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:39,221
You gonna stick around at sper?

595
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:41,824
No, I'm gonna hop a flight.
Should grab my gear.

596
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:43,892
I'll be in touch.

597
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,862
I'll be around.

598
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,914
Don't say anything, just listen.

599
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,983
I know our situation.
I know it doesn't make sense.

600
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:11,153
But you need to hear this
from me. I love you.

601
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:15,591
Right down to the bone, right down to the
goddamned fucking marrow. You need to know that.

602
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:19,761
Ditto. All of it.

603
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,272
- Haji, what are you doing?
- Cleaning the chairs.

604
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:33,642
- It's not your job.
- Well, whose job is it? - Well, it's nobody's.

605
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:36,245
This is why
you have dirty chairs.

606
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:39,114
I need some tea. Come on.

607
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:43,252
Why would he even agree to a meeting
if he has absolutely nothing to say?

608
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:45,854
Maybe he just wants the coalition
to know that he's back.

609
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:49,558
Maybe, but for what?

610
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,561
We need to know
who's in that village.

611
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:55,163
Can you get into the tazkera registry,
find out who lives there?

612
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:58,934
I have an uncle, he works
in the governor's palace.

613
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,136
God, how many uncles
do you have?

614
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:04,873
Many.
Tell me...

615
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,279
What do you think of my hair?
I've been using the shampoo.

616
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:13,815
It looks silky smooth
and very manageable.

617
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:16,118
And my hands?

618
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,687
Soft. Like a baby's bum.

619
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:22,591
You're the best.

620
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,913
Hey there, chewey.

621
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,848
I need a favour.

622
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,318
I'm looking at a village
at this grid marker,

623
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,322
- any events in the last, I don't know, say the last six months.
- Come on, Pete...

624
00:59:53,324 --> 00:59:56,892
I know, I should go through Armstrong, but I
don't even know what I'm actually looking for.

625
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:59,227
And I don't feel like doing a
whole work-up just on a hunch.

626
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:03,732
- You want a visual, I assume.
- Anything with eyes, yeah. - I'll let you know.

627
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:07,169
Thank you.

628
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:36,064
- Anything useful?
- Maybe.

629
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,734
What do I owe you?

630
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:41,903
- I'll take your beer allotment at the end of the month.
- I only get two, same as you.

631
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:44,873
- And I'll take them both.
- Alright, they're yours.

632
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:49,177
And you can clear all this shit
off. Thanks, chewey.

633
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,116
Oh, yeah, and one of these days,

634
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,251
I'm gonna spool up
a fire mission

635
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,654
and train my triple seven
on your backside.

636
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,761
Okay.

637
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,298
Hey, haji.
What you got for me?

638
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,168
Oh, it's bad. It's bashir's.

639
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,737
You're kidding me.
Bdk owns that land?

640
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,773
You're sure?

641
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:20,942
Alright, listen, can you get
out to sper tomorrow?

642
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:23,679
Yes, no problem.

643
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:26,448
you're just a contractor
working on a school or...

644
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,784
I don't know, a fucking
kite factory or something.

645
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:32,120
- Okay.
- Take care, my friend.

646
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:45,133
Have you had any tenderness
in your breasts, or nausea,

647
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,836
- or just the spotting?
- No, just the spotting.

648
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:50,272
I'm really managing my cycle.

649
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:52,974
I haven't had my period
in six months.

650
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,744
I don't know, maybe
I missed a pill or...

651
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,413
- Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
- Yeah.

652
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:01,249
If we find something,

653
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:05,220
- what do we do? You know I'm supposed to report it.
- Well. I'm asking you not to.

654
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,489
As a friend, okay?

655
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,860
Oh, my.

656
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,178
Oh, my god.

657
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,419
Okay...

658
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:39,981
How's Joey?

659
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:47,522
Oh, come on, honestly?

660
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:51,827
He really misses me?

661
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:57,065
I miss you, too, baby.

662
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,501
A "wide open prairie" miss you.

663
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,875
Oh, Jesus,

664
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:09,277
you have no idea
how much I miss them.

665
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,948
Hang on.

666
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,406
I had to go back because this
op was pretty early in the roto,

667
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:42,510
but the dets observed between 15 and
20 tallies moving across the field.

668
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:44,980
Because of the force size,
they didn't engage.

669
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:48,516
Company command requested the grid.
They called it in, artillery beat

670
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:51,019
- the shit out of them.
- There was some fast air in there as well, right?

671
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:53,622
- Yeah, I believe so. He had two a10s.
- And they destroyed the field?

672
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:55,891
That's what wart hogs do.

673
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:59,461
Well, see, this matters
because, as it turns out,

674
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:02,063
the field is "owned"
by bashir daoud Khan.

675
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:05,166
- Bdk?
- See, bdk leases the field

676
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:09,471
to the farmer who's basically...
He's like a slave, right?

677
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:12,374
The farmer works the field,
and then at the end of the poppy season,

678
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:15,644
he's got to hand over 5,000 usd.

679
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:18,046
Whatever he gets on top of that
he gets to keep,

680
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:20,248
which is probably, like, 800 bucks,
somewhere around the national average.

681
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:24,653
Now, in this particular case,
the tallies go running around the field,

682
01:05:24,655 --> 01:05:27,555
isaf blows the shit out of it,

683
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:31,626
and the crop is ruined. And now, well, the farmer,
he's got less than Adam before the apple.

684
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:35,096
Well, bdk shows up and says,
"hello, where's my 5,000 usd?"

685
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,934
And the farmer says, "well, the crop was
ruined, you know? No fault of my own."

686
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:42,037
Bdk says, "I don't give
a shit, I'm evil.

687
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:46,074
I will have my 5,000 dollars. And you have
'x' amount of time to come up with it."

688
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:48,443
Wow, this guy sounds like
Tony soprano.

689
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:51,279
- Yeah. But without the therapist.
- We Afghans,

690
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,214
we're not very big on therapy.

691
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,987
- Alright, so why are we looking at this farmer?
- His name is Abdul Malik.

692
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:02,624
His father's name is haji Malik.
Lion of the desert.

693
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:06,728
His father is the ghost?
Holy shit.

694
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:10,598
And we think this is why the ghost has
returned... to protect the honour of his family.

695
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,501
And there's some bad history
between bdk and the ghost.

696
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:15,737
Now, I don't want things to go
haywire because I want the ghost.

697
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:18,106
I want him to work with us
because he could be

698
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:20,308
a powerful ally for what we're
trying to achieve down here.

699
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:23,611
- Maybe we'll actually get hyena built.
- So, where do I fit in?

700
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:26,614
Well, we think the date
for payment is close, yeah?

701
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:30,085
Two, three days, kinda thing.
So I need eyes on that village.

702
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:33,488
I need to know about the comings and goings,
the who, the what... all that kind of thing.

703
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,992
Alright. I got my snipers spread
all over the area of operation.

704
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,094
But I could re-deploy,
rotate the dets...

705
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:42,263
two days on, two days off, sort
of thing. Starting tonight.

706
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:44,599
Outstanding!

707
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,637
- You ever try a date?
- No, thank you.

708
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:14,496
- Comms check?
- Check. Check.

709
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:17,799
- Comms check to wilf?
- Check. Roger you.

710
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,801
- Aka training magnate?
- Check.

711
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:22,504
So you guys are gonna be dropped
off somewhere about here...

712
01:07:22,506 --> 01:07:25,206
- Aka smelly shit?
- Check.

713
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:28,276
- You guys make your way up into the mountain here.
- Aka douchebag?

714
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:11,146
Brr!!

715
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:29,631
- You seeing anything, tank?
- Negative. - Alright, take a break.

716
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:32,300
Roger that.

717
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:35,837
Hey, putts?

718
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:43,545
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

719
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:48,349
Perry como? In a combat zone?

720
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,885
- It was on shuffle.
- Unacceptable.

721
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:54,722
Completely inappropriate.

722
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,786
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said about...

723
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,288
Changing everything,
you know, with one bullet.

724
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:30,291
You really believe that?

725
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,529
Yeah, I believe that.

726
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,898
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Yeah.

727
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:40,702
Yeah.

728
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:42,804
Look at this.

729
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,544
Okay, what the fuck is this?

730
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:51,679
I'm a terrible dancer.

731
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:55,016
You're an unbelievably
bad dancer.

732
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:57,785
But I'm a great shot.
And I've always been.

733
01:10:57,787 --> 01:11:00,521
Ever since I was a kid.

734
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:02,890
It might have been irresponsible
to put a weapon in my hand,

735
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:05,560
but people would get hunting licences -
they didn't even have a gun-

736
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:07,562
just so that I could hunt
on their behalf.

737
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:11,266
I used to shoot hard to shoot game.
Put food on people's tables

738
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:14,402
when times were hard... - sir,
captain boland wants to see you both.

739
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:17,438
We're on.

740
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:30,618
66 bravo, three niner Alpha.
Send. Over.

741
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:34,022
66 bravo. We got a convoy
heading our way. Over.

742
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:40,728
66 bravo, three white suburbans,

743
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,698
coming in fast... looks like
they're up-armoured. Over.

744
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,000
Three niner Alpha, what's
happening in the village?

745
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:51,673
66 bravo, all is quiet. Over.

746
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:54,709
They're not ready,
they got no... goddamn it.

747
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,784
- Okay, what's going on here?
- I don't know yet.

748
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:06,788
- Get everyone up.
- Roger.

749
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:09,657
Holy shit. 66 bravo,

750
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,360
we've got two vips exiting
the vehicle. First, 40's,

751
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:15,029
black hair, bad dye job,
beady little eyes.

752
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:17,532
Can he confirm vip is bdk?

753
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:21,402
66 bravo, three niner Alpha.
Is vip bdk? Can you confirm?

754
01:12:21,404 --> 01:12:25,807
66 bravo, confirming.

757
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:35,883
Three niner Alpha,
this is 66 bravo.

758
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:39,087
We've got Taliban,
counting four.

759
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:43,658
- He's got tallies with him?
- A guy like bdk plays both sides of the fence.

760
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,894
66 bravo, three niner Alpha, do you have
clearance? Are they carrying weapons?

761
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:50,365
Wednesdays, Fridays, he's with us.
Tuesdays, Thursdays, he's with the tallies,

762
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:54,001
and on days off they're
both running narcotics.

763
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:56,804
Negative. No weapons.
But they're in costume.

764
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:59,407
Black turbans, black man jams.

765
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:02,877
These guys are not even trying
to hide who they are. Over.

766
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,633
66 bravo. We have hostile action
against civilians.

767
01:13:25,635 --> 01:13:28,002
Three niner Alpha.
Clarify hostile action.

768
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:30,838
They're taking kids,
little girls.

769
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,940
Three niner Alpha. Do you have
imminent threat? Over.

770
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,042
66 bravo. Negative.

771
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,660
Authorize to engage? I am
getting ready to take the shot.

772
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,929
No, I'm stepping in.

773
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:59,000
- 66 bravo, this is golf niner whiskey. Sit tight. Over.
- What the fuck?

774
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:02,203
- Take them down!
- Unless they pull out weapons, we can't get involved.

775
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:05,139
66 bravo. I can intervene.

776
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:08,876
Golf niner whiskey. Negative.
Unless you see a weapon, do not intervene.

777
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:12,046
66 bravo. They are
taking little kids.

778
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:14,215
66 bravo.

779
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:17,084
Clarify. Are you
fucking kidding me?

780
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:20,555
Golf niner whiskey. Unless
you see a weapon, do not engage.

781
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:22,590
- We gotta do something!
- Your guys will stand down!

782
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,759
- Jesus Christ!
- Settle down, warrant.

783
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:27,528
Fuck!

784
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,134
Fuck!

785
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,978
- Hey, you're out of line here!
- Why didn't you override?

786
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,048
Because it's an intel op, it's their call. It's
the rules of engagement and you know that!

787
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:50,017
- It's a fucking crime!
- Hey, we need to talk.

788
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:53,221
No, you know what, we're good.
We're good. Hey, Mitchell.

789
01:14:53,223 --> 01:14:56,157
What are those girls,
like, 8, 10 years old? Huh?

790
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,893
And we just stand there? What's
going to happen to them, huh?

791
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:01,629
They're gonna be sold,
that's what's gonna happen.

792
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:04,999
Bdk will hand them over to the tallies.
The tallies will put them on the market.

793
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:08,970
Whatever they get above five they're going
to keep, but bdk will get his 5,000 dollars.

794
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:12,673
And then, I don't know, they're gonna
end up in some shitty marriage in Dubai.

795
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,176
Or worse, they're gonna end up
sucking dick in some brothel

796
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,678
outside of fort mcmurray.

797
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,680
You know this
and we don't intervene?

798
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,149
We didn't intervene because
we didn't have imminent threat.

799
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:25,052
Those are the rules of engagement.
I had to make that call.

800
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:28,623
And we didn't intervene because bdk is
protected by a roof on top of which

801
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:32,527
is a great big fucking sign that
reads "CIA." He's their asset.

802
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,096
Now, if you want to bring down our general
and fuck up the entire battle group,

803
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,732
be my guest, go ahead,
shoot him.

804
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:41,736
- What kind of fucking war are we fighting here?
- Oh, come on, it's not one war.

805
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:45,706
It's a whole bunch of different wars.
And mine, it's like a 3D chess game.

806
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,742
Half the time I don't even know
who the fuck I'm playing against.

807
01:15:47,744 --> 01:15:51,646
We're not playing games here!

808
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:53,681
No, we're not.

809
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:55,883
But we're not here so kids
can fly kites either.

810
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:59,287
- Then what the fuck are we doing here?
- We are rolling back the clock.

811
01:15:59,289 --> 01:16:03,658
And we are stacking the deck so this time
the complete fuckin' crazies don't win.

812
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:07,094
- Haji, did you get all of that?
- Yes, the relay was clear.

813
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:12,099
He's going to have to react.

814
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:14,101
He will make badal.

815
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:17,104
Okay, badal is another one

816
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:20,708
of those tribal pillars.
It's like... come on, sit down.

817
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:24,579
Sit down.

818
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:29,684
Badal basically means, like,

819
01:16:29,686 --> 01:16:32,153
revenge or... it's like "an eye
for an eye" kind of thing.

820
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:34,622
It's more about honour.
If the leader

821
01:16:34,624 --> 01:16:38,893
of the family cannot restore honour
to them, then he must leave forever.

822
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:41,762
- So the ghost has no choice. He must act.
- Now, here's the thing:

823
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:45,032
Bdk served under the ghost in
the war against the Russians.

824
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:47,368
The story goes that a Russian
chopper went down

825
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,870
and bdk ass-raped
one of the pilots.

826
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:53,074
And as punishment, the ghost embarrassed
him in front of the rest of the muj.

827
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:56,911
- So, you see, badal continues.
- Bdk is a bad guy and he needs

828
01:16:56,913 --> 01:17:01,282
to be brought down. Now, we can't do it.
But the ghost can. To do that,

829
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:03,651
we gotta boost the stature of
the ghost. And we're gonna start

830
01:17:03,653 --> 01:17:06,253
by inviting the ghost to
the ceremony for hyena road.

831
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:10,024
Put them together?
Badal is possible.

832
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:13,094
I'm also gonna offer up the safe house.
If they meet on hyena road,

833
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:15,930
it's political. If they meet at
the safe house, it's personal.

834
01:17:15,932 --> 01:17:17,999
Either way, there's
gonna be fireworks.

835
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:20,801
Okay, there's a flight heading
back to kaf in about 10, 11 Mikes.

836
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,870
I'm gonna hop on it.
Now, I need you

837
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:25,306
to set up a meeting with the ghost.
We'll do it at the safe house.

838
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,775
And I need your team
to scope out security

839
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:30,211
at the ceremony site
and at the safe house.

840
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,683
Ryan. Ryan...

841
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,788
Don't think I don't feel
for those girls, 'cause I do.

842
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,691
And we'll do what we can
to find them.

843
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:48,195
But right now, in the bigger
picture, we need the ghost.

844
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:38,265
- Travis said you were looking for me.
- Yeah.

845
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:42,403
Alright, look, I'm sorry.
I lost my shit.

846
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:47,374
But you know me. And you know
that most of the time,

847
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:50,444
I'm proud about what we do here and I'm
proud about how we go about doing it,

848
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,413
but... those were kids.

849
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:57,284
And if we can't help them,
what's the point of doing all this?

850
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:00,454
I don't have an answer for that,

851
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:04,892
and for what it's worth, I agree with you. But
that's not what I wanted to see you about.

852
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:09,864
Do you mind just
closing the door?

853
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:19,139
Here...

854
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:22,443
Have a seat, I just have
to show you something.

855
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:41,528
What's this?

856
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:44,598
Uh, that's our baby.

857
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:48,135
It was Cyprus, I guess.

858
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,313
That's one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.

859
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:07,321
The most beautiful thing.

860
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:10,457
This kind of changes
things, doesn't it?

861
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,160
Yeah, it changes everything.

862
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:15,529
I think that in terms of the
brass we're going to be okay,

863
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:18,065
because it happened
while we were on leave,

864
01:22:18,067 --> 01:22:21,402
but we've got to figure out
what we're gonna do.

865
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:24,705
Figure out what we're gonna do?

866
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,610
We're gonna have a baby.

867
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:33,347
Is that what you want?

868
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:40,087
Yeah, of course it's
what I want. More than anything.

869
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:43,257
Okay, good. I'm glad.

870
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:45,526
You know, you're
making me crazy.

871
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:49,096
Yeah, I know,
I'm making myself crazy.

872
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:52,032
- What did you think I'd think?
- I don't know, I just was...

873
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:55,202
I was nervous. We didn't...

874
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:00,140
...leave things very well.

875
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:03,210
Come here, come here.

876
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:05,245
We're gonna have a baby.

877
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:13,520
You sure it's mine?

878
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,239
Niner niner, tac on base.

879
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:42,549
Cocks. Another ied hit
out on hyena.

880
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:46,487
One kia. A guy out of Kabul,
father of how many, shorty?

881
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:49,656
- Five, sir.
- Five. Fuck.

882
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:52,659
Fighting these pricks is like
nailing jell-o to the wall.

883
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:57,498
I cannot keep losing civilians
if we're gonna get hyena built,

884
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,635
and if we're gonna prevail down
there, hyena's gotta go through.

885
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:04,338
I've gotta get out there,

886
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,340
get on the ground, gotta get
my leopard ii's rolling

887
01:24:06,342 --> 01:24:08,375
and I've gotta blow them
fuckers out of their beds.

888
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:11,245
I've gotta find
their weapons caches.

889
01:24:11,247 --> 01:24:13,647
I've gotta fuck with their command
and control, and I cannot do that

890
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:14,649
bouncing around goddamn
helicopters.

891
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:20,154
Now that's the kinetic imperative, Pete.
So I'm gonna need a little help from you

892
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:23,290
non-kinetic types. I need you effects
guys to go in there and work your magic.

893
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:26,193
Understood, sir,
and we are working on it.

894
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:29,663
My Afghan guy's telling me that
bdk is behind all of this shit.

895
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:32,699
The more the security situation
deteriorates, the more money he's making

896
01:24:32,701 --> 01:24:35,302
out of all the gravel trucks and all
the other stuff he's into us for.

897
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:37,404
- Fucking horrible little man.
- If he was out

898
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,673
of the picture, getting hyena through
would be a hell of a lot easier.

899
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:43,544
If he got knocked off
his perch, I would not weep.

900
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:46,680
- Understood, sir.
- I hear the ghost is back.

901
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:49,383
- Yes, sir.
- Is he a threat?

902
01:24:49,385 --> 01:24:52,519
Just the opposite. I think
he could be a powerful ally.

903
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:55,255
I don't care how you do it, just make
sure my civilians aren't getting hit

904
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,257
every time they drive
a fucking truck down there.

905
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,227
- Understood, sir.
- Thanks, Pete.

906
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,340
Haji, what the fuck
are you doing?

907
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:16,477
What? You can't see
out of these things.

908
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:20,114
- There's nothing to see.
- No, not the way they are, no.

909
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:24,251
Okay, get in touch with
the ghost. The meeting is on.

910
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:27,254
- You have approval?
- It's always better

911
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:30,224
to ask for forgiveness than
permission, you know that.

912
01:25:30,226 --> 01:25:33,560
We'll meet him
at the safe house.

913
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,780
This house is a key feature...
it's our asset, a safe house.

914
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:29,383
We'll set up our op here

915
01:26:29,385 --> 01:26:31,451
at the summit
of the saddleback Ridge.

916
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:34,821
And that'll give us clear line of
sight to both sides of the hill.

917
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:37,191
Here, at the safe house,

918
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:39,793
and here, where the ceremony
is going to take place.

919
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:44,364
- What's the range?
- It's comfortable, 1150, 750 meters both sides of the hill.

920
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:47,734
- What about extraction?
- We'll ex-fil down the back side,

921
01:26:47,736 --> 01:26:51,338
through the grape fields, and
get picked up on route hyena.

922
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,974
How's this house gonna play?

923
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:55,642
That's unknown.

924
01:26:55,644 --> 01:26:58,879
There's an offer out
to the ghost and bdk to show.

925
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:02,616
Intel thinks they'll show up either
at the safe house or at the ceremony.

926
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:05,285
So we need eyes on both.

927
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:07,487
Alright, this is a tricky op,

928
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:11,692
so I'll take lead. Wilf,
you'll stand this one down.

929
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:14,494
Alright, let's gear up.

930
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,565
I would like to thank you
for meeting with me.

931
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,771
He says,
"the honour is mine."

932
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:40,887
He says, "I'm surprised to be here.
I used to come to this house many times."

933
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:45,325
- He's asking you, do you know who used to own this house?
- Mullah Omar.

934
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,402
He saved his ears
but he lost his eye.

935
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:59,273
- What does that mean?
- Same, same. - Same, same what?

936
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:02,409
Same, same, same, same.

937
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:05,312
If you ever need to use this house,
for whatever reason, it's yours.

938
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:13,720
There was an event in panjaway the
other day, the village of haji baba.

939
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:17,724
Two little girls were taken out
of the arms of their father.

940
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:27,034
And he says, "why
have you come to me?"

941
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:29,569
Because the little
girls were taken

942
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:32,639
by bashir daoud Khan.

943
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,879
My general is
a compassionate man.

944
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:41,548
He's a student of pashtunwali.

945
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,851
And he would like to help you,
to help all Afghans,

946
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:47,921
to help the village
of haji baba.

947
01:28:57,398 --> 01:29:00,734
And he would be very honoured
if you would accept this gift.

948
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:03,537
Five thousand us dollars.

949
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:09,109
He would also be honoured
if you would attend

950
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:12,479
the ceremony for hyena road.

951
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:25,125
He's saying, "why me?
I'm a simple grape farmer."

952
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:27,527
He understands this.

953
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,831
But your presence would do him a great
honour as an elder of the region.

954
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,671
"Who else will be there?"

955
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:41,475
Bashir daoud Khan.

956
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:57,958
"I have known this man,
bashir, since he was a boy."

957
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:13,874
"He brought great dishonour to our cause.
And he was punished by my own hands."

958
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,992
"Thank your general
for his kindness.

959
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:36,062
And it will be
my honour to attend."

960
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:46,640
He says that chicken hates you.

961
01:30:51,646 --> 01:30:54,448
Yeah, haji, it's me. Yeah,

962
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:57,451
I'm watching him walk up
the side of a mountain.

963
01:30:57,453 --> 01:31:00,086
Yeah, he says he's gonna show up, but I got
the feeling he's got something up his sleeve,

964
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:03,523
so I'm gonna need you to get your eyes and
ears out there, see what you can learn, okay?

965
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:07,594
Yeah. Wa alaikum salaam.

966
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:12,833
Okay, let's get our gear,
we'll go.

967
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:28,648
Whoa.

968
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,784
Local meat?

969
01:31:30,786 --> 01:31:34,221
Heavenly father,

970
01:31:34,223 --> 01:31:38,625
please protect
those little girls.

971
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:43,497
And watch over them
and bring them home.

972
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,519
Listen, I'm not sure I was
entirely clear about all this,

973
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:08,822
so I want to spell it out.

974
01:32:08,824 --> 01:32:12,626
I'd like it very much if...

975
01:32:12,628 --> 01:32:14,794
If you'd marry me,
captain bowman.

976
01:32:14,796 --> 01:32:18,164
I would also
like that very much,

977
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:21,801
warrant officer Sanders.

978
01:32:30,711 --> 01:32:34,281
Okay, I've gotta go. We're
heading out. I've gotta get up.

979
01:32:34,283 --> 01:32:37,851
Let me help you with that kit.

980
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:58,338
We're crazy.

981
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:01,608
Fucking certifiable.

982
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,880
Be careful, okay.

983
01:33:06,882 --> 01:33:09,649
I promise.

984
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:21,094
You're driving me crazy.

985
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:54,060
- Hey, jenn.
- Hey.

986
01:33:54,062 --> 01:33:56,763
So how do you think this is
going to play out?

987
01:33:56,765 --> 01:34:00,934
Hard to say, a lot of variables. If the
plan holds, we're golden. Anything shifts,

988
01:34:00,936 --> 01:34:03,670
- who knows?
- We got niner niner tac en route now.

989
01:34:03,672 --> 01:34:07,007
Okay, everybody, here we go. General's on his
way. You were down at the ceremony site?

990
01:34:07,009 --> 01:34:10,677
Yeah, on my way here;
Usual motley crew.

991
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:14,147
Goats everywhere. Shit
all over the goddamn place.

992
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:17,651
You know what I'd like to see? I'd like
to see this country host the Olympics.

993
01:34:17,653 --> 01:34:19,653
That would be awesome!

994
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:22,722
66, three niner Alpha. Sitrep?

995
01:34:22,724 --> 01:34:24,958
Three niner Alpha, 66.

996
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,128
Good visual, clear line of sight
both sides. Over.

997
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:40,340
66.

998
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:42,909
Niner niner tac in sight,
one click out.

999
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:49,349
I bet you not one vip
is gonna be there.

1000
01:34:49,351 --> 01:34:52,686
- They're not gonna show.
- I think they'll be there, sir.

1001
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:56,423
- It's important to them.
- Twenty-five bucks says they're a no-show.

1002
01:34:56,425 --> 01:34:59,726
You're on, sir.

1003
01:34:59,728 --> 01:35:02,262
I love your enthusiasm, shorty.

1004
01:35:02,264 --> 01:35:05,398
Fuck.

1005
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:14,474
Go, go, go. Move your ass now!

1006
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:26,920
66. Niner niner,
attach has landed. Over.

1007
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:36,296
You're gonna owe me twenty-five bucks,
you realize that, don't you?

1008
01:35:36,298 --> 01:35:39,332
I'm an optimist, sir.

1009
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:41,835
You're a fucking idiot, shorty.

1010
01:35:41,837 --> 01:35:44,404
Roger that, sir.

1011
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:58,785
Three niner Alpha, 66. I have convoy
in sight on approach road. Over.

1012
01:35:58,787 --> 01:36:01,087
Three niner Alpha,
white suvs, confirm?

1013
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:05,191
66. Confirming three white
suvs, up-armoured. Over.

1014
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:15,168
66. Convoy is turned north
off approach road

1015
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:17,437
heading in direction
of safe house. Over.

1016
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:21,074
- Three niner Alpha acknowledge.
- Okay, everybody, we're on. Bdk's going for it.

1017
01:36:21,076 --> 01:36:23,810
The ghost and bdk
will meet at the safe house,

1018
01:36:23,812 --> 01:36:27,313
not at the ceremony site.
So this is probably gonna get personal.

1019
01:36:27,315 --> 01:36:30,183
- You got that relayed at asic?
- You're hooked up now, sir, go ahead.

1020
01:36:30,185 --> 01:36:32,919
One one zulu,
it's golf niner whiskey.

1021
01:36:32,921 --> 01:36:35,822
Requesting cell phone trap
at grid Quebec Quebec

1022
01:36:35,824 --> 01:36:38,458
36698537. Over.

1023
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,295
Golf niner whiskey, this is
one one zulu. You're in luck.

1024
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:44,798
We got a high asset sitting
on top of your grid marker.

1025
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,300
Running traps... now.

1026
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:03,583
Three niner Alpha, 66.
Convoy has stopped. Over.

1027
01:37:03,585 --> 01:37:05,552
Three niner Alpha, Roger.

1028
01:37:05,554 --> 01:37:07,921
Golf niner whiskey,
one one zulu. We have a trap.

1029
01:37:07,923 --> 01:37:10,023
Three signals.
You want them all up?

1030
01:37:10,025 --> 01:37:12,358
One one zulu, golf niner
whiskey, negative.

1031
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,527
Can you just feed them to us
one by one? Over.

1032
01:37:14,529 --> 01:37:17,530
- What are you doing?
- He's turning their cell phones into listening devices.

1033
01:37:17,532 --> 01:37:19,833
But don't ask me how.
I have no idea.

1034
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:24,838
One one zulu, first trap
coming at you.

1035
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:33,479
One one zulu, golf niner whiskey, negative.
You can drop that trap. Over.

1036
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:36,983
One one zulu, good copy.
Number two coming at you.

1037
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:46,492
Yeah.

1038
01:37:46,494 --> 01:37:49,462
One one zulu, golf niner
whiskey, that's our guy.

1039
01:37:49,464 --> 01:37:52,565
Call sign bravo delta kilo...
that's bdk.

1040
01:37:52,567 --> 01:37:55,268
Thanks for your help. Out.

1041
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:08,615
Three niner Alpha, 66.
Front door is opening,

1042
01:38:08,617 --> 01:38:11,217
call sign ghost is stepping out.

1043
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:13,953
Call sign ghost is alone.

1044
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:18,291
He shouldn't be alone.
He should have guys with him.

1045
01:38:18,293 --> 01:38:20,393
So what does that mean?

1046
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:34,107
The ghost says that bashir has
insulted the honour of his family.

1047
01:38:34,109 --> 01:38:37,911
For a young man, a former
student, this is a great sin.

1048
01:38:47,054 --> 01:38:50,356
The ghost says he has just given
him five thousand us dollars.

1049
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:55,495
He says this will satisfy
the question of the money.

1050
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:06,072
The ghost says yes, but
the debt is not yet resolved.

1051
01:39:19,421 --> 01:39:22,989
This is so fucked up.

1052
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:25,058
Copy that.

1053
01:39:33,535 --> 01:39:36,302
His son? How the fuck
did I not have this intel?

1054
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,480
He says he wants his son
returned to him.

1055
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:50,183
He says that he wants
to see his son.

1056
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:59,692
'And so you shall'.

What is bdk doing?
Do you have hostile intent?

1063

Standby.

01:41:19,307 --> 01:41:21,407
Send it.

1074
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:30,316
Good hit.

1075
01:42:17,732 --> 01:42:21,534
Nine niner tac, on the move.

66, golf niner whiskey.
Do you have any idea what you've just done?

1078
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:36,182
66. Yeah, I think I do.

1079
01:42:36,184 --> 01:42:39,218
I had imminent threat toward
a civilian. I intervened.

1080
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:42,155
Yeah, you did intervene, 66, and you intervened
in something you know nothing about!

1081
01:42:42,157 --> 01:42:45,558

1082
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:48,494
- You just fucked him!
- You fight your war, captain, and I'll fight mine.

1083
01:42:50,732 --> 01:42:54,300
I saved his life.

1084
01:42:54,302 --> 01:42:57,637
It wasn't yours to save! Now he's got
nothing! You understand that? He has nothing!

1085
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:00,873
That's enough, captain! This
is my cp, you will back off.

1086

- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1088
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,387
Do you think he knows
we just saved his bacon?

1089
01:43:14,389 --> 01:43:18,658
- I think it might be more complicated than that.
- How?

1090
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:21,194
What could possibly...

1091

1092
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:31,971

- How far away are the birds?

1102
01:44:03,638 --> 01:44:06,239
Ma'am, they are at least 30 minutes out.
They moved back to escort niner niner tac.

- My uncle.

1161
01:51:56,977 --> 01:51:59,445
Is every single adult male

Well, be safe.

Call me when
you're back. Fuck.

1167
01:52:14,729 --> 01:52:17,963

- This man, Ryan, he was your friend?

1168
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:22,801
Yeah. Yeah, he was.

1169
01:52:22,803 --> 01:52:25,003
I don't have too
many friends here.

1170
01:52:25,005 --> 01:52:27,406
You have me.
I'm your friend.

Honour guard, inward turn!

1178
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:22,487
<i>Alexander the great fought a
counter-insurgency in Afghanistan</i>

1179
01:54:22,489 --> 01:54:25,123
<i>that lasted almost three years.</i>

1180
01:54:25,125 --> 01:54:28,393
<i>And by the end of those years, he was
drinking heavily and completely paranoid.</i>

1181
01:54:28,395 --> 01:54:33,131
<i>One night, he got into a row with a guy
named cleitus the black, a loyal friend.</i>

1182
01:54:33,133 --> 01:54:35,400
<i>Cleitus accused him
of certain things</i>

1183
01:54:35,402 --> 01:54:38,036
<i>and Alexander threw
a spear into his heart.</i>

1184
01:54:38,038 --> 01:54:41,073
<i>As he watched his friend die,
he lost his mind.</i>

1185
01:54:41,075 --> 01:54:43,876
<i>Five years later,
Alexander was dead.</i>

1186
01:54:49,182 --> 01:54:51,884
<i>As the Afghans say...
You might have the clocks,</i>

1187
01:54:51,886 --> 01:54:54,286
<i>but we've got the time.</i>
