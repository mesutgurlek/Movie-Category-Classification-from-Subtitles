1
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,194
- Psycho, pull off the stone.
- I'll pull them all off just choose.

2
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,198
Let's do this.

3
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,516
Is it deep enough?

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,599
how deep are we goin to sepel it?

5
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,989
ten meters?

6
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,196
It's deep enough.

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,392
still half meter.

8
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,835
we didn't sleep for days.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,718
Samucha, you are having fun,

10
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,678
keep it up.

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,593
Asshole.

12
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,477
- Yossi is not going to like it.
- He can keep digging, i'm dead tired.

13
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,236
Bro, everything ok?

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,630
You're mean with him.

15
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,997
- Take it easy, we were just joking.
- Really?

16
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,276
What's up? it was only a joke.

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,353
He wouldn't hurt anybody,

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,352
it's against his tibetan religion.

19
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,196
- What a bad smell!
- it's all rotten.

20
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,351
come on, discusting!

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,510
It's an ecological disaster.

22
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,271
it's full of worms.

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,439Are
Are we gonne ask for food supply
or we should wait for the next one?

24
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,717
It's going to be all right,
if we won't die for the bad smell first.

25
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,998
Which smell?

26
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,512
Pull everything off.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
- what's that ?
- A transistor that i got.

28
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,074
You upgraded yourself,
with high tech.

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,959
Naah, it doesn't connect.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,389
Adams, you idiot, help me out.

31
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,029
The commander is coming..

32
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,071
what's up bro, are you stoned?

33
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,356
You never know!

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,276
They are tired,
let them rest a bit.

35
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,156
Come on guys, let's finish and leave.

36
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,270
- It's not deep enough.
- I told you.

37
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,553
- It's ok.
- No it's not.

38
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,959
Yaniv, do you wanna say some
last words?

39
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
- It's to hard for me.
- Do u want me to start?

40
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,438
yes, Sir.

41
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,274
- You have been good cows...
- And chickens.

42
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,670
Amen. drop inside
that smelly stuff.

43
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,519
Come here a second please.

44
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,755
- I will leave with Lior for an hour.
- where?

45
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,754
we need to check the zone
for the training tomorrow.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,629
- Didn't you do it last week?
- Something doesnt feet me there.

47
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,872
maybe i should come with you,
i wouldn't mind to change view alittle.

48
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,236
It doesn't bother you, ain't it Jagger?

49
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,192
For me it's ok.

50
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,518
Lior already know the zone,
we'll make it quick.

51
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,639
Let' them rest, i want them to work
properly.

52
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,075
We'll be back in an hour.

53
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,516
Next time, don't be so sad.

54
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,912
Let's go, Lior.

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,718
- Come on!
- I'm not a swiss, wait.

56
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,520
- There is no time.
- What a bugger!

57
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,479
- What did you say?
- What a bugger!

58
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,795
Yossi!

59
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,189
Is it rape Sir?

60
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,279
For similar sentences
i send other soldiers to jail.

61
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,231
Focus, please.

62
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,390
- I cannot believe it.
- What can i do, i'm an animal.

63
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,513
It's a rabbit!

64
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,956
He is looking at us.

65
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,239
Hurry up!

66
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,877
Ofir, shut your mouth.

67
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,918
Gotta pee, Damn...
Call Yossi for me!

68
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,754
Ask him out,
Or you'll have to deal with me.

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,549
- I'm afraid.
- About what?

70
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,877
Yaeli, in the worst scenario
send him to hell.

71
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,799
Ciao, Goldi.

72
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,516
Gotta go, they are calling me.

73
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,676
Hi guys!

74
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,993
what a crazy bud!

75
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,279
- Ofir, how are you doing?
- Great. You look good!

76
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,430
i wear the lens.

77
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,592
you look good as well,
did you have an hair cut?

78
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,148
- How are you doing?
- Freezing out.

79
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,868
- Did you come back this morning?
- Yes.

80
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,351
Refrigerators got broken
and the meat got spoiled.

81
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,117
do you know where is Jagger?

82
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,153
Where is Yossi?

83
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,671
Went with Jagger to the field to
check the model.

84
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,113
- Didn't they go already?
- Is there some problem.

85
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,752
I'm going in.

86
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,228
Do you have the key to your room?

87
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,032
- It's on the door.
- Fine.

88
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,589
I'm going to be a bit busy,
do not disturb me.

89
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,356
Do you need anything?

90
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,559
warn the chef that i'm here, 
i'll be hungry later.

91
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,909
Already?

92
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,436
Don't get your head bigger.

93
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,915
- What is it?
- A transistor, a gift from my mom.

94
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,116
Who knows if it connects here.

95
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,629
Rita!

96
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,876
I cannot believe
you are going to leave.

97
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,680
Why don't you leave as well?

98
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,831
We'll leave for the east.

99
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,833
Why you insist to stick in the army,
you already got yourself an officer.

100
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,191
- You can't be without me.
- Calm down.

101
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,553
Let's go under the light

102
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,030
not under the shadow.

103
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,510
Till when we are goin to continue...

104
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,593
Do you really like
this gay music.

105
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,070
Here Radio Normality.

106
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,198
We have online Yossi,
a tough, commander of company,

107
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,193
a real fag
who ask to listen Meir Ariel.

108
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,076
Tell me something

109
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,678
of your moments of fear,

110
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,748
it's easier

111
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,239
let them put it in your ass.

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,992
come,

113
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,950
let's loose the fog.

114
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,790
Let's go under the light

115
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,589
and not under the shadow.

116
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,514
Till when we are going to continue...

117
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,235
Generally
i bang only the fighters.

118
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,032
This time i say:

119
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,113
''Oneg, if you do the pilot,
i'll be a parachooper.''

120
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,432
- Is Oneg his real name?
- I swear! It's too cute.

121
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,558
In the tibetan buddism
it's a good name to have.

122
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,155
I almost forgot,
i brought some movies,

123
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,516
hope you like them.

124
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,117
Adams, check
if there is some tibetan movie for you.

125
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,918
Give it to me.

126
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,397
''Stand by me'' ?

127
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,108
Where is ''Fuck me 2''
and ''horny Mission 3''?

128
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,151
I need you.

129
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,438
Stand ease.

130
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,590
It's all garbage !

131
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,757
Tell him the kitchen is closed.

132
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,389
- What's missing?
- What doesn't it missing!

133
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,473
there is nothing fresh,
a part from some chiken.

134
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,790
just boxes and they all stinks.

135
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,871
Prepare for him a sushi of meat,

136
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,350
He likes it very mutch.

137
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,953
Everything is going to be all right.

138
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,875
Hadad, open ten boxes
of meat, Sasi, warm the water.

139
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,271
Its going to be all right, go.

140
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,630
wait, do you want to help?

141
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,835
Get some aromatic grass.

142
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,196
Hadad, move your ass.

143
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,036
Did you know that 2 years ago
i travested myself as a rabbit?

144
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,111
you should see the pictures!

145
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,510
With the ears like this.

146
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,195
Shit, what are you doing here?

147
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,670
please verify that at the check point
they aren't masturbating themselves.

148
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,752
i'm serious.

149
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,236
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

150
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
- You know where is Yoel?
- No.

151
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,111
Yossi, wait a sec!

152
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,233
wait!

153
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,189
i see also Goldi is here.

154
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,952
Say, Isn't Jagger back with you?

155
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,391
Yes, he is in the control point,
why?

156
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,313
You and Jagger are close, right?

157
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,395
In which sense? what did you hear about that?

158
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,115
that you are a sort of couple. no?

159
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,234
What?

160
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,671
Well, that you are his friend.

161
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,393
I like him very much

162
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,635
and i thought to ask him out,

163
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,236
maybe one of these days,
during the weekend.

164
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,438
I don't know...

165
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,796
Are you sure you really want it?

166
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,314
Sometime female soldiers think
to be in love with their commanders

167
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,310
but it's an illusion, the uniform
and ranks can be confusing.

168
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,468
i'm not confused, i'm sure
i feel something for him.

169
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,871
Jagger is fantastic.

170
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,628
No offense,
but he is not likr other men.

171
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,075
Not only cause he is cute,
with those lips...

172
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,960
also that, but not only that.

173
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,511
he's simple,

174
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,237
and different.

175
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,516
I guess he realy has it.

176
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,112
You know if he has someone already?

177
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,760
Have you been here the whole time?

178
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,591
No, i just arrived.

179
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,276
- Everything ok here?
- Yes, fine.

180
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,557
If it's true, why not saying perfect?

181
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,992
Are you ok?

182
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,959
Perfectly.

183
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,038
Let's go eat.
Where have you been?

184
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,796
This place is dirty like hell.

185
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,077
Did you tell him?

186
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,754
Disgusting, have to wash my hair.

187
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,833
- Maybe you should come with me?
- Don't know, haven't seen Jagger yet.

188
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,428
What are you doing?
I told you for 5 minutes.

189
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,393
Do you think this is
the way to cut?

190
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,713
-Have you been told you are a nazi?
-I'm an artist.

191
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,518
A nazi artist.

192
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,116
Make sure the bread is on the table,
i can take care of myself.

193
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,875
I'm starving... Yaniv!

194
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,155
On my way!

195
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,550
Did you come to eat
or something happened?

196
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,677
There are good news.

197
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,997
First of all the spring rolls ''California''
home made.

198
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,879
Get some.

199
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,279
Heavenly. You're a genious!

200
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,240
- What are you doing here?
- i have no clue.

201
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,799
Sure?

202
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,309
what do you mean?

203
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,391
You have been the whole morning
with Yossi. He didn't say anything?

204
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,710
I doubt he knew something about it.

205
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,878
They are more than
simple warnings,

206
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,032
they are already in the stripe,
they'll get in today

207
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,236
and it's going to get ugly.

208
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,516
And this should be the good news?

209
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,115
Yaniv, give me more please!

210
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,956
Why bad?
War is always a good thing.

211
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,232
The smell of burned meat
early in the morning !

212
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,869
Relax, where is your sense
of humor go?

213
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,153
Tonight we are going to kick their asses,
or we are screwed.

214
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,393
Grilled chicken with triumph
local grass and zenzero.

215
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,950
Weather you like it or not,
you won't leave here,

216
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,873
you won't go to Cordon Bleu school,
promise !

217
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,192
I promise to invite you in some years
to my restaurant,

218
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,476
french,lebanese, not to miss.

219
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,472
- There is bad karma on this table.
- What ?

220
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,828
The light of their aura is terrible.

221
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,830
There is a limit to everything.

222
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,833
They were 3 days
in the mog under the snow,

223
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,230
it's not wise
to let them out again.

224
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,199
Did you become gay?
are you their mom ?

225
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,070
I have a mission to accomplish,
did you forget?

226
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,595
No, but we came back just an hour ago

227
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,276
they are tired,
they can't get into action again.

228
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,673
And with the full moon
they will see us till turkey.

229
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,674
- Why don't you bomb them from the top?
- bullshit!

230
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,475
Who cares of the full moon!

231
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,271
In a while you'll tell me
that Mercury is retreating.

232
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,234
I hate the idea for
another ambush tonight!

233
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,233
Let's hope it will be a traumatic ambush,

234
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,438
I forgot why i became comando.

235
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,638
in an ambush you can't do nothing,
you just eat salami and chocolate.

236
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,474
we only miss the waitress
that serve cappuccino

237
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,154
to be
as the fags of Shenkin.

238
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,039
''Any interest in
the menu of the day?''

239
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,033
Animal,
i hope you die in lebannon.

240
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,951
You would like to fuck
as the fags of Shenkin,

241
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,192
they screw like
you'll never fuck in your whole life.

242
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,477
Did you take it in the ass?
You walk in a odd way...

243
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,234
What are all these bullshits?

244
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,511
We are just joking.

245
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,716
why are you laughing?

246
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,149
Psycho,

247
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,636
what would you do if i'd tell you
i'm a fag?

248
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,672
- Can i speak to you honestly. sir?
- Go ahead.

249
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,550
You are cute as a female,
i'd screw you.

250
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,155
I thought you didn't know what's 
going on there.

251
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,791
I'm out.

252
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,710
Let's focus on the details.

253
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,870
Let's finish eating first.

254
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,558
do you mind
if i say it to the soldiers now?

255
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,074
Be my guest.

256
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,471
Guys, we're going to
another ambush overnight.

257
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,949
I know you planned to rest,

258
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,677
but listen,
it won't be any easy.

259
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,309
everyone will be responsible
of their own stuff.

260
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,031
I don't want surprises tonight.

261
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,868
It's 10 past 13:00,
there is not mutch time,

262
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,198
i see you in an hour
in the instructions room.

263
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,390
Its going to be allright, don't worry.

264
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,753
warm?

265
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,991
Tell me something,

266
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,675
It doesn't bug you he is married ?

267
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,913
On the contrary, i'm here
to have fun, not to get married.

268
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,752
- Are you in love with him?
- What are these questions?

269
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,832
You might be laughing, but in high school
i used to like the guys like Yoel.

270
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,517
At the beginning he tried to
do the sensitive man,

271
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,115
but who looks for preliminares?

272
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,239
Thus i told him: ''Leave to me
the clitoris, you take care about the fucking.''

273
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,350
- And what did he say?
- It's what he wanted to hear.

274
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,273
really?

275
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,995
I don't know what to say.

276
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,437
I'm looking for somehting different,

277
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,433
someone who is male,
but also with good manners,

278
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,990
that hugs me,
caress me and kiss me everywhere.

279
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,310
But in the end, he fucks you , ain't it?

280
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,075
well!

281
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,236
- Stop teasing me.
- I'm not teasing you.

282
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,074
I understand what you say,
but i decided,

283
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,118
i'm going to bed only
with someone i'm inlove with,

284
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,032
this way it will be perfect,

285
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,518
with the bathroom
full of foam, and the candels

286
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,228
romantic music and chapmpagne

287
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,591
slowly, slowly...

288
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,159
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

289
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,278
- I know why the commander arrived.
- Wh?

290
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,318
- The ambush.
- Are you sure?

291
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,989
Bugger!

292
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,676
Talk with Yossi, i have to go
to give rest to the sentinel.

293
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,995
You really have no limits!

294
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,154
We should meet
when we're home once.

295
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,359
- Do you have a crash for me?
- Yes, but not like for Jagger.

296
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,556
Bitch, give me a kiss.

297
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,435
- Who is the cutest here?
- Me?

298
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,715
Bravo!

299
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,315
- He is not here.
- wait for him.

300
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,313
Mission to accomplish,
did you forget?

301
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,518
Ciao.

302
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,272
How much violence, what nerve,

303
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,711
with so much compassion i cuddle.

304
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,835
people suffer to much from love.

305
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,992
Beg me tonight,

306
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,597
cry for me.

307
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,910
No matter how difficult is,
i'm always under the impression

308
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,755
that is not enough,

309
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,433
that there is still a lot to do

310
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,997
and i get scared and run away.

311
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,950
i can't be happy.

312
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,948
and i can't be sad.

313
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,111
the world is tough,

314
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,955
i can make it only with the force,
just with crazy acts.

315
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,988
I hope everything burn,

316
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,835
whispering, beg me,

317
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,353
beg me...

318
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,920
i came to your window to play

319
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,518
with guitar and flowers...

320
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,717
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't stay for the dessert.

321
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,071
Yossi, The commander is looking for you.

322
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,673
On my way.

323
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,355
Hi.

324
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,149
- is my bed comfortable?
- Sorry, didn't know it's yours.

325
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,197
Doesn't matter, I'm only joking.

326
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,911
- Do you like it?
- I don't know it.

327
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,156
You look great today.

328
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,917
Goldi made me up.

329
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,914
- Isn't it too much?
- No, but you don't need it.

330
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,996
- I'm waiting for Jagger, do you know where he is?
- No.

331
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,390
- Ok, i'm leaving.
- Wait, i have to talk to you.

332
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,471
What's up?

333
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,718
- You are hopeless with him.
- With whom?

334
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,559
with Jagger?

335
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,270
i don't think he is the guy for you.

336
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,517
How do you know?

337
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,751
did he talk about me?

338
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,717
did he tell you anything?

339
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,871
take it easy.

340
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,674
and even if you are not his type,
it's his problem.

341
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,750
Yaeli, everyone
would like to have you.

342
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,831
you smell so good.

343
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,669
Ofir!

344
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,751
what are you doing, are you crazy?

345
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,874

You sleep with someone only for love..

346
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,551

347
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,593

348
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,794
hi.

349
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,350
Hi and bye, you can't stay here.

350
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,751
- i have to tell you something.
- it will have to wait.

351
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,197
- but I...
- Yaeli, you're in the way.

352
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,278
- what's wrong?
- something got into my eye.

353
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,751
let me check.

354
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,634
check it out.

355
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,229
shit!

356
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,431
- and now?
- the lens came out.

357
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,232
- Enough!
- It calms me down.

358
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,471
you are getting on my nerves.

359
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,712
what is it?

360
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,871
it used to belong to my mother,
it comes from hungary.

361
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,076
it's an hungarian play-station.

362
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,072
- ''Bamba'', the food of the gods.
- without the bag.

363
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,196
do you know how noisy it is?

364
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,189
- Leave her alone, how is she supposted to know?
- Boys, don't fight!

365
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,030
this is for you, open a big mouth.

366
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,191
and this is for you.

367
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,072
let's go.

368
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,993
give me few minutes
to fill the bag of good food.

369
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,629
there is no time, find your friend,

370
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,878
move your ass
and come to the car.

371
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,872
i'm waiting for you.

372
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,599
- we have to go.
- wait a sec, my lens dropped.

373
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,037
found it.

374
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,516
come on, Yoel is gettin nervous.

375
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,558
- Moment, let me say bye to Jagger.
- Ciao, honey.

376
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,358
lets go already Yael

377
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,231
i'll check on you all the time,
don't worry.

378
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,751
everything is going to be all right.

379
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,029
- it will be perfect.
- let's go.

380
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,391
how far is the village?

381
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,158
do you care to focus?

382
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,789
we checked it out
already a hundred times.

383
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,191
- you can never be sure enough.
- you're right.

384
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,069
tell me Yossi,

385
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,549
would you stay with me
if they would cut my leg?

386
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,631
could make it easier in some positions...

387
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,677
and if i'd burn my face
or i'd have one eye only?

388
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,639
- with or without the eye?
- with and without.

389
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,358
sort of ''The english patient''.

390
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,637
- i don't like hearing you talking this way.
- what's better?

391
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,440
- that it ill be injured like that, or die?
- enough!

392
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,511
and what if i die?

393
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,714
and what if i die without
you telling me today you love me?

394
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,236
and what if i die instead?

395
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,629
Sorry.

396
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,552
tell me something
about your moments of fear.

397
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,871
it's easier
to take it in the ass...

398
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,756
Enough, someone could come in.

399
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,108
i was forgetting,
it is too gay for you.

400
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,510
let's see something more male-style.

401
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,673
i suck again an aubergine...

402
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,510
Grow up! What do you want from me?

403
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,192
i'm sorry that it's not easy for me, sorry
that i can't surprise you with a fucking ring,

404
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,317
this is not fucking american movie!

405
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,158
Yes sir.

406
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,677
No problem sir.

407
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,275
- Idiot!

408
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,637
- Sir, you wanna fuck with me sir?
- Listen.

409
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,472
No, you listen.

410
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,473
Next holiday we take 1 room
in the hotel,

411
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,508
with double bedroom,
king size or queen size,

412
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,911
i'm tired
of separated beds.

413
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,631
and when i leave, you'll meet
my mother, my father and my dog.

414
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,711
cause i'm tired, do you understand?

415
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,152
i'm really tired.

416
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,998
this is the deal,
i've never promised you anything,

417
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,755
or you accept this situation
or you get out of my life.

418
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,150
things will change very soon.

419
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,071
what is it this junk?

420
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,239
do you want to enlight
the road till damasco ?

421
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,629
sorry sir.

422
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,076
what's the problem?

423
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,799
jump.

424
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,116
I guess you didn't understand
that this is going to be a hot ambush.

425
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,909
you thought i was going to distribute
blankets and chocolate?

426
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,749
with hot ambush
i meant it's going to be cold

427
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,477
and this cause you are going to loose blood,

428
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,915
cause Samucha
enlightned us with the watch

429
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,276
and Sasi went out with the broken stretcher.

430
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,431
i know you are tired

431
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,638
and that not everyone
understand why we go out again,

432
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,950
but you don't have to know always everything.

433
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,596
i'm asking you to make an effort,

434
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,593
be professional
and be caeful.

435
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,596
because i have no intention
to meet your mothers soon.

436
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,393
not today, not tomorrow
maybe at your wedding

437
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,517
if you remember to invite me.

438
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,114
start couting yourself.

439
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,312
- One.
- Two...

440
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,597
Twelve and the last one.

441
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,553
we'll meet
in 15 minutes in that location

442
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,878
check again
your equipment.

443
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,270
Ofir, paint your face dark

444
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,878
- screw me and let's end it.
- what is your problem?

445
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,838
what's my problem?

446
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,152
It's since i've met you that everyone
say you are so cute

447
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,557
and you deserve everything.

448
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,597
you stick with Yossi

449
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,593
and you screw Yaeli
even if you don't care about her.

450
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,910
Instead i love her.

451
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,835
why are you laughing?
do you think you're better than me?

452
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,957
what is wrong with you?

453
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,070
Yaeli is cute, but i don't screw her
nor i plan to do it.

454
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,193
The soldiers are waiting for your orders,
Sir.

455
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,469
- Lior?
- What?

456
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,559
Nothing, forget about it.

457
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,318
what have i told you?
no news, good news.

458
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,516
this woman doesn't get laid because
his boyfriend is a soldier.

459
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,910
difficult for them to find intimacy.

460
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,318
she will find it when she will have
someone to screw with!

461
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,313
surely he gat laid somewhere else,
she shoudld do the same.

462
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,676
everybody do it.

463
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,116
let's say whose more manly?

464
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,271
Popay or plutu?

465
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,315
plutu.

466
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,833
- Plutu or Van Damme ?
- Plutu.

467
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,751
Salami with choccolate?

468
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,274
you don't know what you are missing,
it's a perfect combination!

469
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,669
Sure.

470
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,753
have you always been
so picky on tastes?

471
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,596
just since when i'm in the army.

472
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,120
it's a way
to put some order in my head.

473
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,158
to find a corner for me
in this shit.

474
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,152
Come on!

475
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,071
neither a little taste?

476
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,269
Check out the moon, it's so close!

477
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,150
- did you fall asleep?
- No.

478
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,799

Vardale, that's Yossi,

570
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,754
he was the Lior's commander.

571
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,797
thanks for coming.

572
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,394
he says that Lior was the best
second in command he ever had.

573
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,271
and everybody loved him,

574
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,517
all the soldiers.

575
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,228
Sit down.

576
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,717
Its true,

577
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,796
everybody loved Jagger

578
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,037
Sorry, loved Lior.

579
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,753
we called him Jagger
because he was like a rockstar

580
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,796
i loved him too

581
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,189
very much.

582
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,870
i tried to tell him
the day that everything happened.

583
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,633
i believe he also loved me
but he didn't have the time to tell me that.

584
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,351
it's funny,

585
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,712
all in a sudden i realize,
about how little i knew him.

586
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,838
we all were busy
with our things

587
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,674
who thought
that we were going to be short in time?

588
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,915
i don't know,he never talked

589
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,750
even when i asked him,
he has always been discreet.

590
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,511
i think about my son and i realize
that i know nothing about him.

591
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:42,115
i didn't know if he has a girlfriend,
i didn't know about you.

592
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,948
i realize not to know him
at all,

593
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,232
i neither know
which was his favourite movie

594
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,436
or his favourite song.

595
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,517
''Come''.

596
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,271
what did you say?

597
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,991
''Come'', by Rita,

598
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,231
it's the song he liked the most

599
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,519
he liked it
even changing the words.
