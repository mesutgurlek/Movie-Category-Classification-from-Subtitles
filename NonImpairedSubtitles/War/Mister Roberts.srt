1
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,761
Now hear this!

2
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,458
Now hear this!

3
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:13,595
Reveille!

4
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,632
I repeat!

5
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,142
Reveille!

6
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,177
Attention all hands!

7
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:27,649
Because another cigarette butt...

8
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:32,249
...has been found in the container
of the Captain's palm tree...

9
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:36,486
...there will be no movies again tonight.

10
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,157
That is all.

11
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,724
All right, hit the deck!

12
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,767
Rise and shine! Greet the new day!

13
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,471
Off your hock and grab your sock!

14
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:53,711
Okay, Chief, you've done your duty.

15
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:56,446
Now get your big fat cat out of here!

16
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,601
Now hear this!

17
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:26,404
Now hear this!

18
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:30,041
'C' and 'E' and 'S' divisions...

19
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:34,612
...and all pharmacist mates
will air bedding today.

20
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,719
Positively!

21
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:47,263
Doc, what are you doin' up so early?

22
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:50,563
l heard you were working cargo today,
so l thought l'd get ready.

23
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:55,872
On days when work's to be done, l can
always count on a big turnout at sick hall.

24
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:00,536
l attract some very rare diseases
on cargo day.

25
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,274
That day when they knew you had
five ships to load...

26
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:07,512
...l was greeted with six more cases
of ''beriberi''...

27
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,884
...''double beriberi'' this time.

28
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:12,319
So help me, l'm going down
to the ship's library...

29
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,950
...and throw that old copy
of Moby Dick overboard.

30
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:18,685
What are you giving them these days
for ''double beriberi''?

31
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,464
Aspirin, what else?

32
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,824
Something wrong, Doug?

33
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,562
We missed you when you went
on watch last night.

34
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:32,368
l gave young Ensign Pulver another drink
of alcohol in orange juice...

35
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:35,811
...and it inspired him to relate
further amorous feats of his.

36
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:40,515
Did he tell you about the time
he overwhelmed a 45-year-old maiden...

37
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:45,856
...by the simple tactic of being the first
man in her life to ask her a direct question?

38
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:52,191
No, but some of the things he related
positively bordered on the supernatural.

39
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,696
l don't know what to do
about young Pulver.

40
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:59,726
Perhaps l should report his record
to the American Medical Association?

41
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:03,865
There is something wrong, isn't there?

42
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,206
l've been up all night, Doc.

43
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,743
What's the matter? What is it?

44
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,819
l saw something last night
that just about knocked me out.

45
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:16,649
What happened?

46
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:18,718
l was up on the bridge.

47
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:21,317
l was just standing there
looking out to sea.

48
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:23,953
l couldn't bear look at that island anymore.

49
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,162
All of a sudden l noticed something, little
black specks crawling across the horizon.

50
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:33,532
l looked through the glasses
and it was a formation of our ships...

51
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:35,505
...that stretched for miles.

52
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:39,665
Carriers, and battleships and cans.
A whole task force, Doc.

53
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:42,607
Why didn't you break me out?
l've never seen a battleship.

54
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,616
They came out and passed
within a half mile of that reef.

55
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:49,713
Carriers so big
they blacked out half the sky.

56
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,590
Battlewagons sliding along, dead quiet.

57
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,295
l could see the men on the bridges.

58
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:02,628
And this is what knocked me out, Doc:

59
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:04,657
Somehow...

60
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:07,797
...l thought l was on those bridges.

61
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:12,907
l thought l was riding west
across the Pacific.

62
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,180
l watched 'em till they were out of sight.

63
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:20,445
And l was right there on those bridges
all the time.

64
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,288
l know how that must have hurt, Doug.

65
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:29,387
And then l looked down from our bridge
and saw our captain's palm tree.

66
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:32,997
Our trophy for superior achievement!

67
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,697
The Admiral John J. Finchley Award
for delivering...

68
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,896
...more toothpaste than toilet paper...

69
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:44,431
...than any other navy cargo ship
in the safe area of the Pacific!

70
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,241
-Read this, Doc. See how it sounds.
-What is it?

71
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:53,546
My application for transfer.
l've been rewriting it since l got off watch.

72
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:55,347
-Another?
-This one's different.

73
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,015
l'm trying something new.
A stronger wording. Read it carefully.

74
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:04,328
''From Lieutenant J.G. Douglas Roberts
to Bureau of Naval Personnel.

75
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,523
''April 16, 1945.

76
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,726
''Subject: Change of duty request form.''

77
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,769
-Boy, this is sheer poetry!
-Go on, Doc.

78
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:17,271
''For two years and four months
l've served on this vessel as cargo officer.

79
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:22,438
''l feel my continued service aboard can
only reduce my usefulness to the Navy...

80
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:25,780
''...and increase disharmony
aboard this ship.''

81
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,044
How about that?

82
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:30,817
''lt is therefore urgently requested...

83
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,484
''...that l be ordered to combat duty,
preferably aboard a destroyer.''

84
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,550
l've got a chance, haven't l?

85
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,590
Listen, Doug....

86
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:44,196
You've been sending in a letter
every week for goodness knows how long.

87
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:47,238
Every week, the Captain screams
like a stuck pig...

88
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,466
...''disapproves'' your letter and forwards it.

89
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,169
That's just my point, Doc.
He does forward it--

90
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:57,475
The captain of a Navy ship is the most
absolute monarch left in this world.

91
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:58,538
l know that.

92
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,814
lf he endorsed any letters ''approved,''
your orders would come through like that.

93
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:05,645
But ''disapproved,'' you haven't a prayer.

94
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:09,318
You're stuck on this old bucket. Face it.

95
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:12,424
lt's still a chance, Doc. lt's still a chance.

96
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,058
l'm sorry you ever saw that task force.

97
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:24,507
l've got to go down to my hypochondriacs.

98
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,915
-Good morning, Mr. Roberts.
-Good morning, Dowdy.

99
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:47,888
lt's hotter up here than it is
down in that mess hall.

100
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:55,028
Look at that cruddy island! Smell it!

101
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:59,668
lt's so hot it already smells like a hog pen.

102
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:02,640
Think we'll get out of here today?

103
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:06,150
l don't know. There are three LCMs
coming alongside for supplies.

104
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:07,679
Are they getting up yet?

105
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:12,689
Yeah, they're startin' to stumble around
down there, the poor, punch-drunk....

106
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:20,024
When are you goin' to the Captain again
and ask him to give this crew a liberty?

107
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:23,090
These guys ain't been off this ship
for over a year except on duty.

108
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,796
The last time l asked the Captain
was last night.

109
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,134
-What'd he say?
-He said ''no''!

110
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,071
We've gotta get these guys ashore.
They're goin' Asiatic.

111
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:37,910
When you see him again, Mr. Roberts....

112
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:40,075
You know l will, Dowdy.

113
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,817
ln the meantime,
have Dolan type that up for me.

114
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:44,682
Your letter? Yes, sir.

115
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:10,508
Now hear this! Now hear this!

116
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,173
Sweepers, man your brooms.

117
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:15,849
Give her a clean sweep-down fore and aft.

118
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:19,279
Sweep down all ladders
and all passageways.

119
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:22,524
Do not throw trash over the fantail.

120
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:34,166
Now sick call will commence immediately.

121
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:38,264
Now.

122
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:42,008
When l woke up this morning--

123
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,412
And remembered you were working cargo.

124
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:46,179
Continue.

125
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:48,515
Honest, Doc, l couldn't even straighten up.

126
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:51,519
l guess it's the old appendix again.

127
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:54,518
That appendix of yours
certainly gets around.

128
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:56,922
Now it's on the wrong side.

129
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:59,889
Two aspirin! Mark for duty. Next.

130
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:03,334
Aspirin? For a floating appendix, Doc?

131
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:07,259
Yeah, it's the latest thing.
l'll have one with you. Next!

132
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,178
Well, where do you hurt?

133
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:17,643
lt's my head, Doc. lt's my head.

134
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:19,308
Dizzy?

135
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:21,575
lt's terrible!

136
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,610
Ringing in your ears?

137
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:27,054
-Well, l mean it's all the time, Doc.
-Like bells?

138
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:29,159
That's it, Doc, like bells!

139
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:31,955
Like that, Doc.

140
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:36,857
How do they go, ''dong-dong,'' ''ding-ding,''
or ''ding-dong''? lt's important.

141
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,801
''Ding-dong''? ''Dong-ding''?

142
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,066
No second guessing. Too bad.

143
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:48,707
They should go ''dong-dong.''
One aspirin! Mark for duty.

144
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:53,512
There is now available at the ship's store
a small supply of peanut brittle.

145
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:59,220
The ship's store will be open
from 1300 to 1315.

146
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,922
lnsigna, l've got a real special job for you.

147
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:06,656
You stay right here
and clean these binoculars for the bridge.

148
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:09,357
Let me work up forward, Chief.

149
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:12,034
l don't want to be around this crud,
Mannion.

150
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:15,095
-Yeah, Chief, take lnsigna with you.
-Get lost!

151
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:17,269
Cut it out, the both of you!

152
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:20,775
l'm tired of you two bellyachin'!
Now go on and get scrapin'!

153
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:46,102
Which end of these binoculars
do you look through?

154
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,468
l guess it's optional, lnsigna.

155
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,802
lt depends on what size eyeball you've got.

156
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:00,177
What time would it be in San Francisco?

157
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:03,014
About midnight last night.

158
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:05,252
Midnight last night?

159
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,385
The Japs must have took over that island!

160
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,752
There's a red and white flag
on that new building.

161
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:15,390
Japs? We ain't been
within 5,000 miles of any Japs.

162
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,592
Japs, you hear that, Wiley?

163
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:19,396
Smart, ain't he?

164
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:31,538
That's a hospital flag.

165
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,886
They've got a fancy building on that island.

166
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:40,382
Yeah, they've got big windows and--

167
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,187
Holy Cow!

168
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,826
Holy Cow! They've got nurses
on that island!

169
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:52,630
That nurse, she's taking a shower!

170
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:59,470
Look! On the second story.
She's a blonde! See?

171
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,976
-Get off my back!
-Knock it off!

172
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:06,749
l've never seen such a beautiful girl!

173
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:11,582
She sure is taking a long time
in that shower.

174
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:14,524
Yeah, honey....

175
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:19,026
Come on over here by the window!

176
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:22,763
How do you use this thing?

177
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,605
There's another one over by the wash basin
taking a shampoo!

178
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:31,434
Oh, she's got a bathrobe on.

179
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:34,543
What a stupid way to take a shampoo,
with a bathrobe on!

180
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:37,170
What's stupid about it?
Do you think she wants to--

181
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,780
-Wow!
-Please, fellas! Come on!

182
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:42,581
-Didn't l tell you she was beautiful?
-Yeah, man!

183
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:45,213
l can't even see the island.

184
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,955
Well, so long, blondie!

185
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,120
There goes the other one!

186
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:52,554
lmagine that pig not takin' a shower?

187
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,393
Come on, girls, who's next?

188
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,933
l'm getting it! l'm getting it, yeah!

189
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:04,140
But there ain't no one in there now.

190
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,835
Hey, try mine!

191
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:12,544
They must think we got
nothing better to do than stand here.

192
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:13,943
Do you see anything?

193
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,077
No, you've been panting on the lens.

194
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,643
These glasses is gettin' heavy!

195
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:20,156
We're wasting manpower. Let's take turns.

196
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,015
l'll take the first watch.

197
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:30,858
Look!

198
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:33,699
There goes a sea gull.

199
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,380
Look at 'em now, will you!

200
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:01,949
See anything, Mannion?

201
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:16,173
They're gone.

202
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,605
Why, you dirty miserable cheat!

203
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:21,270
Oh, it's too bad! There were three
a minute ago. One was about to take--

204
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:22,744
Peepin' Tom.

205
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:39,863
Knock it off!
lnsigna, did you hear me? Knock it off!

206
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,664
Wiley, get out of here!

207
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:45,531
Stop it!

208
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:48,037
l'll kill him! Do you hear me? l'll kill him!

209
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:54,100
All right. Get below, all of you,
and slosh your heads!

210
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:59,212
Hold it right there, Mister!

211
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,685
What's that man doing on deck
without a shirt?

212
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:05,119
l was just speaking to him about that,
Captain.

213
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:09,323
l want that man put on report. l don't
want no one on deck without a shirt.

214
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:11,686
ls that clearly understood?

215
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:14,196
All right, keep your shirt on.

216
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:16,958
All of you.

217
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,803
Last night, down in the compartment,
l stopped three of them fights...

218
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:28,640
...worse than that.

219
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:30,874
They've gotta have a liberty, Mr. Roberts.

220
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,182
Yeah, they sure do.

221
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,745
Call a boat for me. l'm going ashore.

222
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:39,353
-What are you gonna do?
-l just got a new angle.

223
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:40,549
You're not goin' over the Captain's head?

224
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:43,525
No, l'm goin' around his end.
Get the lead out, Dowdy.

225
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:47,156
''lf l could be with you
One hour tonight

226
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:50,194
''lf l was free to do
The things l might

227
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:53,462
''l'm tellin' you true
l'd be anything but blue

228
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,833
''lf l could be with you''

229
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:04,980
Hey, what's new, Doug boy?

230
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,380
l'm going to take a launch
over to the island.

231
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:09,151
Over to the island?

232
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:11,513
Hey, how would you like some company?

233
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:15,457
l'll go get some aspirin for Doc
at the new hospital they're building.

234
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:19,991
What's the matter?

235
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:23,129
Why, Frank Thurlowe Pulver...

236
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:27,169
...you mean to say you'd be willing
to unglue yourself from that sack...

237
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:29,035
...to do a favor for someone else?

238
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:32,303
Let's not have any more
of that usual attitude towards Pulver boy!

239
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:33,535
l said one simple thing--

240
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,306
Okay, Frank, okay. Hurry up.

241
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:48,718
Just in case, Pulver boy. Just in case!

242
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:11,514
See you later, Doug boy.

243
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:50,845
Welcome aboard!

244
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,321
Oh, my goodness! Attention!

245
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,826
This is gonna be all right. You girls
just got in here, huh? Where're you from?

246
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,794
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

247
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,729
How many of you girls are there?

248
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,597
Captain, aren't you gonna answer
our salute?

249
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:09,263
Sure, yeah.
lf it'll make you feel any happier.

250
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:12,335
We thought maybe we were
doing it wrong, Captain.

251
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:14,604
You see, we haven't had much experience.

252
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:16,178
Well, that's wonderful.

253
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,608
ls that your battleship
in the harbor, Captain?

254
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,414
Not exactly. No.

255
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:28,818
ls there anything you want?
l mean, anything in particular?

256
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:33,420
No. Nothing l can think of, in particular.

257
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:37,831
Oh, aspirin! What am l saying?
l've got a requisition right here.

258
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:40,631
All right, right this way.
Get back to work, men.

259
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:41,829
Carry on, men.

260
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:51,843
-l'm actually not captain of that AK.
-No kidding.

261
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:53,978
l'm the Exec.

262
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:58,611
-Certainly must have a lot of ''b.f.''
-Who me? What do you mean--

263
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:03,150
Battle fatigue. With all this aspirin.
Seen a lot of action?

264
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:07,925
Well, l sure as heck haven't seen
much action this past year.

265
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:13,125
You mean battle action?
Well, l got a little shrapnel in my left leg.

266
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,031
lt gives me a twinge now and then.

267
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:17,903
-l hear that scotch works wonders.
-You like scotch?

268
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:22,345
l was acquiring a taste for it
before they shipped us out.

269
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,404
-Here is your aspirin.
-Thanks.

270
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:28,749
Would you like to come out to the ship
this afternoon?

271
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:30,077
Sorry.

272
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:33,518
lt just so happens l have a bottle
of Red Label in my cabin.

273
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,191
Have a shore boat at the dock
at 1800 minus ten.

274
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,888
Oh, will l? 1800 minus ten.

275
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:41,763
-That's ten minutes to six.
-Yeah.

276
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,857
l see l caught your interest.

277
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,704
l don't want these other girls to hear,
but if you were to come over alone...

278
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:52,639
...this afternoon....

279
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:57,709
Here's your letter. l typed it up.

280
00:23:57,781 --> 00:24:00,648
Just sign your old John Henry here
and l'll take it to the Captain.

281
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:03,881
Then hold your ears. Mr. Roberts?

282
00:24:05,556 --> 00:24:09,856
lt's only you, Ensign Pulver.
What are you doing in Mr. Roberts' locker?

283
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:13,726
There was a shoebox in there somewhere.
l can't find it.

284
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:17,567
Somebody stole it, that's all.
There's just nothin' they'll stop at!

285
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:19,896
Broken right into the sanctity
of a man's own locker!

286
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,598
ls Mr. Roberts back from the island yet?

287
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,441
As soon as he gets back,
have him sign this baby.

288
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:30,913
What is it? lt's the best letter
Mr. Roberts wrote yet.

289
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:34,818
lt's gonna blow the old man
right through the overhead!

290
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:37,513
This letter's liable to get him transferred.

291
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:40,489
-Let me see that.
-Get a load of this line right here.

292
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,059
''lncrease disharmony aboard this ship.''

293
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:45,628
Ain't that a kick?

294
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,963
l can't wait to jab this baby
in the old man's face.

295
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:53,564
You know how he gets sick
when he gets extra mad at Mr. Roberts.

296
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:58,106
When l deliver this letter,
l'm gonna take along a wastebasket.

297
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,635
Let me know when Mr. Roberts gets back.

298
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,881
lt was the most vicious fight
you ever saw in your life.

299
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:16,358
Even after Dowdy and l broke up the fight,
l figured l had to do something right away.

300
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:19,223
Frank, has Dolan been in here
with my letter?

301
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:23,233
l don't know, Doug boy.
l just came in here myself.

302
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,869
Doug, you don't know anyone
on that island, do you?

303
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:29,997
Yeah, the port director. The guy
who decides where to send this ship next.

304
00:25:30,574 --> 00:25:32,235
A liberty port, for instance.

305
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:36,443
Dowdy tipped me off. He used to drink
a quart of scotch every day of his life.

306
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,474
You didn't give that shoebox to that
port director?

307
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,916
l did, compliments of the Captain.

308
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:45,115
You've been hoarding a quart of scotch
in a shoebox?

309
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:48,152
l was gonna break it out
the day l get off this ship.

310
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:50,357
Resurrection day!

311
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:53,761
You wasted that bottle of scotch
on a man?

312
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,591
Will you name me another sex
within 1,000 miles?

313
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:00,898
What's eating you anyway, Frank?

314
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:04,168
Well, look at the fancy pillows!

315
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:08,576
-Somebody expecting company?
-Good Lord!

316
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,740
'' Toujours l'amour.''
''Souvenir of San Diego.'' ''Oh, you kid! ''

317
00:26:16,153 --> 00:26:18,121
''Tonight or never.''

318
00:26:18,722 --> 00:26:21,418
''Compliments of
the American Harvester Company.''

319
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:25,585
''We plow deep while others sleep.''

320
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:35,135
Doc, that new hospital hasn't got nurses,
has it?

321
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:37,173
lt didn't have yesterday.

322
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:38,936
lt has today.

323
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:43,104
How did you find out that they were there?

324
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,180
lt just came to me all of a sudden.

325
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:50,578
l was lying on my bunk here
this morning, thinking.

326
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:54,382
And there wasn't a breath of air.

327
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:57,888
All of a sudden a funny thing happened.
A little breeze came up.

328
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:00,692
l took a big deep breath and said to myself:

329
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:03,164
''Pulver boy,
there's women on that island! ''

330
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:11,601
Doc, you know a thing like that could make
a bird dog real self-conscious.

331
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:15,010
They flew in last night. Knockouts!

332
00:27:15,078 --> 00:27:19,071
And one big blonde especially. Of course,
she went for me right away. Naturally.

333
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:22,147
So l started to turn on the old personality,
and l said:

334
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:25,380
''Will nothing make you come out
to the ship with me?''

335
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:29,357
And she said,
''Yes, there is one thing and one thing only:

336
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:32,927
''A good stiff drink of scotch.''

337
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,265
l'm sorry, Frank. l'm really sorry.

338
00:27:41,071 --> 00:27:42,971
Your first assignment in a year.

339
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,703
l was gonna bring her right in here.
l had all my old pillows out.

340
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:50,605
l'd slip her a couple of fast slugs
of scotch and....

341
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:55,081
Without that scotch she wouldn't--
She just wouldn't, that's all!

342
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:03,390
Doc, let's make some scotch.

343
00:28:04,428 --> 00:28:05,292
Scotch?

344
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:07,830
As naval officers,
we're supposed to be resourceful.

345
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:11,299
Frank here's got a great opportunity.
Let's fix him up.

346
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:14,125
Right.

347
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:19,506
Frank, where is the rest of that alcohol
we were drinking last night?

348
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:27,241
-Now, that ain't even the right color.
-Quiet, boy.

349
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:29,677
Color?

350
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,521
Coke. You got any?

351
00:28:32,756 --> 00:28:36,920
l haven't seen a Coke in four months.
No, it's five months.

352
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,325
l forgot l had it.

353
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:55,004
What shade would you like?

354
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:56,871
Shade?

355
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:58,778
Pale, smokey?

356
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:01,175
Well, l told her Red Label.

357
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:17,695
-Red Label?
-Red Label.

358
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:21,132
lt may look like it,
but it sure won't taste like it.

359
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,640
Doc, what does scotch taste like?

360
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,313
lt tastes like....

361
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,148
You know what it's always tasted
a little like to me?

362
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,044
lodine.

363
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:40,688
Of course.

364
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,863
One drop of iodine, for taste.

365
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:00,006
Let me try that.

366
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:04,670
This calls for a medical opinion.

367
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:11,947
How about it?

368
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,248
We're on the right track.

369
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:20,360
Now we need something extra for age.
What have you got there, Doug?

370
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:25,529
Seltzer, some fruit salts, hair tonic....

371
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:29,864
Hair tonic! That's got a coal tar base.

372
00:30:33,977 --> 00:30:36,309
One drop of hair tonic, for age.

373
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:40,609
That'll age the daylights out of it.

374
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,209
That's it!

375
00:30:58,135 --> 00:31:00,569
You know, it does taste a little like scotch.

376
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,076
Do you know, it does.

377
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,579
That dumb little blonde will never know
the difference!

378
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:19,484
All right, Frank,
Doug and l made the scotch...

379
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:21,982
...the nurse is your department.

380
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:25,152
''She won't know the difference
She won't know the difference''

381
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:26,284
Thanks, Doc.

382
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,092
''She'll never know the difference''

383
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,498
You won't know the difference,
will you, baby?

384
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:35,265
No, you won't. No, you won't.

385
00:31:36,106 --> 00:31:37,698
Thank you, Doc. Thanks, Doug.

386
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:40,737
Gee, you guys are wonderful to me.

387
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,371
Don't mention it.
l think you almost deserve it.

388
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,272
You do really? Or are you just givin' me
the old needle again?

389
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:51,617
What do you really think of me? Honestly.

390
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:58,788
Frank, l like you.

391
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:02,756
There's no getting around the fact
you're a real likeable guy.

392
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,700
-But....
-But what?

393
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:11,105
Well, l also think
you're the most hapless, lazy...

394
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:15,445
...disorganized and, in general,
the most lecherous person...

395
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:17,070
...l've ever known in my life.

396
00:32:17,147 --> 00:32:19,081
-l am not!
-You're not what?

397
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:20,480
l'm not disorganized.

398
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:23,781
Have you ever in your life
finished one thing you set out to do?

399
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:25,754
You sleep 16 hours a day.

400
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:28,919
You pretend you want me to improve
your mind, but you've not finished a book...

401
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:31,460
-...l've given you to read.
-l finished God's Little Acre.

402
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:32,756
l didn't give you that.

403
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:36,094
He's been reading God's Little Acre
for over a year now.

404
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:40,164
He's underlined every erotic passage
and added exclamation points.

405
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,300
And after a certain pornographic climax
he's inserted the words: ''Well written! ''

406
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,107
You're the laundry and morale officer.
l doubt if you've ever seen the laundry!

407
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,613
l was down there last week!

408
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:53,945
-And you're scared of the Captain.
-l am not!

409
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:57,416
Then why do you hide in the passageway
every time you see him coming?

410
00:32:57,587 --> 00:33:01,387
l am not. l'm scared of myself.
Scared of what l might do to him.

411
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,289
What you might do to him!

412
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,254
He lies in his sack all day long
and bores me silly...

413
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,820
...with great moronic plots
against the Captain.

414
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:10,363
He's never carried out one of them.

415
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:12,765
-l haven't, huh?
-No, Frank, you haven't.

416
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,967
Whatever happened to those marbles you
were gonna put in the Captain's overhead...

417
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,941
...so they'd roll around all night
and keep him awake?

418
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:23,708
Now you've gone too far!

419
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:28,214
Now you've asked for it!

420
00:33:38,795 --> 00:33:40,228
What does that look like?

421
00:33:41,164 --> 00:33:42,722
Five marbles.

422
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:46,901
l've got another one in my pocket.

423
00:33:47,837 --> 00:33:48,929
Six...

424
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:50,995
...marbles.

425
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:56,675
l'm looking for marbles all day long!

426
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:06,151
You asked me what l thought of you.
Well, l'll tell you.

427
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:09,449
The day you finish one thing
you've started to do...

428
00:34:09,993 --> 00:34:13,554
...the day you actually put those marbles
in the Captain's overhead...

429
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,830
...then have the guts to knock
on his door and say...

430
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,094
...''Captain, l put those marbles there! ''...

431
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:21,598
...that's the day
l'll have some respect for you.

432
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,540
That's the day l'll look up to you as a man.

433
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:26,598
Okay?

434
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:29,567
Okay.

435
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:35,517
Where's Dolan with my letter?
l'm gonna go find him.

436
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:36,643
Wait a minute, Doug.

437
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,984
l wouldn't send a letter like that in
if l were you.

438
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:42,252
You'll get yourself in trouble saying
things like ''disharmony aboard this ship.''

439
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:47,786
You know, if you did say ''disharmony,''
or ''harmony'' or....

440
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:49,798
-Where's that letter?
-l don't know.

441
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:52,093
What's the big idea?

442
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:54,636
l just wanted to talk to you
before you signed it.

443
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,537
Please don't sign that letter, Doug.
Now, please don't.

444
00:34:58,842 --> 00:35:01,777
They'll transfer you.
You'll get your can shot off, boy.

445
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:06,578
Doc, will you tell him what you told me
last night, about how stupid he is?

446
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,313
Yes, Doc. Maybe you'd like
to tell me to my face.

447
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:15,591
Yes, l would.

448
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,620
You are stupid, Doug, and l can prove it.

449
00:35:18,962 --> 00:35:21,260
You quit medical school
just to get into this thing...

450
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:23,765
...when you could be saving lives today.
Why?

451
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,494
Has it ever occurred to you
that the guys fighting this war...

452
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:28,264
...might also be saving lives?

453
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:30,435
Your's and mine, for instance.

454
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,839
l'd rather practice that kind of medicine.

455
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:34,500
That's exactly what you're doing!

456
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:35,703
Are you kidding?

457
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:40,546
Look, whether you like it or not,
this sorry old bucket does a necessary job.

458
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:43,379
And you're the guy
who keeps lumbering along.

459
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:46,353
lt could be that right here on this bucket...

460
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:49,319
...you're deeper and more truly
in this war than you'd ever--

461
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:52,361
Doc, in a minute you'll start quoting
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

462
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:54,320
That is a lousy thing to say.

463
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:55,762
We've got nothing to do with the war.

464
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:59,700
Maybe that's why we're on this ship,
because we're not good enough to fight.

465
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:02,962
'Cause our glands don't secrete
enough adrenaline or...

466
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:06,404
...our great-great-grandmothers
were afraid of the dark or something.

467
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:08,376
What is it you want to be? A hero?

468
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:10,743
Hero? You haven't heard a word l've said!

469
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:13,149
Look, the war's way out there and l'm here.

470
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:15,582
l don't want to be here.
l want to be out there.

471
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,119
l'm sick and tired of being
a lousy spectator.

472
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:22,218
l just happen to believe in this thing and
l want to feel l'm good enough to be in it.

473
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,760
Good enough! Doug, you're good enough.

474
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:27,722
lt's just that you haven't the opportunity.

475
00:36:28,298 --> 00:36:32,496
That's mostly what makes
physical heroism: opportunity.

476
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,896
lt's a reflex.

477
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:39,274
l think that 75 out of 100 young males
have that reflex.

478
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:44,002
You take any one of them,
say even Frank Thurlowe Pulver here...

479
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,816
...put him into a B-29 over in Japan
and do you know what you'd have?

480
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:49,315
No, l don't, Doctor.

481
00:36:49,385 --> 00:36:52,252
Pulver, as a Congressional Medal
of Honor winner.

482
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:57,089
Pulver, who single-handed shot down
23 attacking Zeros.

483
00:36:57,827 --> 00:37:01,991
Pulver, who with bare hands held together
the severed wing stretch of his plane...

484
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:07,903
...and with bare feet successfully landed his
mortally wounded plane on his home field!

485
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,500
lt's reflex.

486
00:37:12,742 --> 00:37:14,004
Like the knee jerk.

487
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:18,939
Strike the patellar tendon in a human being
and you produce the knee jerk. Look.

488
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:26,686
What's the matter, Doc?

489
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:32,016
Nothing. But stay out of B-29s,
Frank, my boy.

490
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:35,430
You've made your point very vividly, Doc...

491
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:38,196
...but l still want to get in this thing.

492
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:41,465
l'm gonna keep on sending in
these letters until l do.

493
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:46,073
-Yes, l know you are, Doug.
-l haven't got much time.

494
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,611
That task force l saw was on its way
to start our last big push in the Pacific.

495
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:54,146
l'm gonna catch it.

496
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,775
LCM's coming alongside.

497
00:37:57,253 --> 00:38:00,848
Will Mr. Roberts report
topside immediately?

498
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:03,554
Mr. Roberts! Topside!

499
00:38:06,129 --> 00:38:09,326
Doc, what are you gonna give Doug
for his birthday?

500
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:12,927
l hadn't thought of giving him anything.

501
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:16,233
l'm gonna show him that he's got
old Pulver figured out all wrong!

502
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,105
What does that look like to you?

503
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:22,912
Just what it is. The cardboard center
of a roll of toilet paper.

504
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:26,471
-l suppose it doesn't look like a firecracker?
-No, it doesn't.

505
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:28,913
And l suppose that doesn't look like a fuse?

506
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,952
lt looks like a piece of string.

507
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,284
You just wait until old Pulver
gets through with it!

508
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:37,087
l'm gonna get me some black powder
from that gunner's mate and--

509
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,391
Oh, no! This is not gonna be
any peanut of a firecracker.

510
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,791
l'll pack that thing solid with that stuff
they use to blow up bridges:

511
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:47,093
Fulminate of mercury!

512
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,067
Boy, on the night of Doug's birthday...

513
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:52,733
...l'm gonna throw that
under the old man's bunk and bam!

514
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:03,349
Captain, it's me! lt is l, Ensign Pulver!

515
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:07,288
l just threw the firecracker
under your stinking bunk!

516
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:19,426
The Captain wants you to hang on
to whatever fresh fruit you have left.

517
00:39:19,502 --> 00:39:21,129
He wants it for his own mess.

518
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:25,605
Better get braced for a storm, Mr. Roberts.
Dolan took in your letter a while back.

519
00:39:25,675 --> 00:39:28,166
Stand by bow line, ready to cast off!

520
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:29,302
You fellas squared away?

521
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:32,609
Thanks, Lieutenant. You wouldn't want
to swap movies, would you?

522
00:39:32,682 --> 00:39:36,277
-Sure, what you got?
-Hoot Gibson in The Sheriff's Daughter.

523
00:39:37,186 --> 00:39:38,244
Shove off.

524
00:39:40,223 --> 00:39:42,851
LCM-2, come alongside.

525
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:46,088
Hey, Chief! Copper just passed out.

526
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:48,123
Get him up here!

527
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,159
Give him to me.

528
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,204
Easy boy, easy.

529
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:03,341
lt's murder down there, Mr. Roberts.
Can't we take our shirts off?

530
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,244
Sure, take them off.

531
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:13,688
Kennedy, give Mannion a hand.
Get him back to Sick Bay.

532
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:17,417
Go on, take your shirts off.

533
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:18,926
Thank you, sir.

534
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:28,660
The boat, watch it!
Dowdy, get a defender over.

535
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,134
The Captain wants to see you
on the bridge.

536
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,265
Tell him l'm busy.

537
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:34,708
Slammer, give him a hand on that line!

538
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:36,705
Watch it!

539
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:46,018
This is what they want.

540
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:49,620
''One ton dry stores, one gross dundries...

541
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:52,889
''...20 cartons toothpaste,
1 /4 ton frozen food.

542
00:40:52,962 --> 00:40:55,556
''Fresh fruit, if available.'' Scratch that.

543
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:57,895
They've been out two months.

544
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,399
-No fresh fruit in two months?
-No, sir.

545
00:41:02,038 --> 00:41:05,337
Give them a couple of crates of oranges,
compliments of the Captain.

546
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:09,842
Sling ready, sir.

547
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,769
Take it away.

548
00:41:16,452 --> 00:41:17,919
All right, Mister!

549
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:21,180
We'll have this out right here and now.

550
00:41:21,557 --> 00:41:23,957
What do you mean telling me
you're too busy?

551
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:25,651
We were having trouble.

552
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:28,094
You didn't want me leaving the deck
with a ship coming--

553
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:31,292
When l tell you l want to see you,
l mean now!

554
00:41:31,634 --> 00:41:33,568
Mister, l mean jump!

555
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,368
Understand?

556
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:37,065
Yes, sir. l'll remember that next time.

557
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,732
You'd better remember!

558
00:41:40,843 --> 00:41:43,334
You think you're pretty cute
with this letter...

559
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:46,576
-...trying to get me in bad with the Admiral.
-l'm not, Captain.

560
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:49,846
What do you mean writing
''disharmony aboard this ship''?

561
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:51,749
Because it's true, Captain.

562
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:57,019
Any disharmony aboard this ship
is my own doing!

563
00:41:57,894 --> 00:41:59,293
That's true, too, Captain.

564
00:41:59,362 --> 00:42:02,092
And it ain't gonna be any letter
that leaves this ship.

565
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:05,625
Any criticism of this ship
stays on this ship!

566
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:09,571
l've got a good reputation with the Admiral
and l ain't gonna lose it on account of...

567
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:12,972
...any letter written
by some smart aleck college officer!

568
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:17,074
You retype this.

569
00:42:18,281 --> 00:42:21,409
Cut out that ''disharmony'' crack
and l'll send it in.

570
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:26,084
But this is the last one, understand?

571
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:29,087
Every man in the Navy has the right
to send in a request for transfer.

572
00:42:29,158 --> 00:42:31,023
No one can change their wording.

573
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,060
That's the Navy regulations.

574
00:42:35,331 --> 00:42:36,923
How about that, Dolan?

575
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:39,401
That's what it says in the book, sir.

576
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:42,097
Well, it's a stupid regulation!

577
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:45,797
We wouldn't stand for it
in the Merchant Marine, l tell you.

578
00:42:46,976 --> 00:42:51,310
All right, l'll send this one in. Just as it is.

579
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:56,074
But ''disapproved,'' like l always do.

580
00:42:57,153 --> 00:42:59,553
But there's one thing l don't have to send...

581
00:42:59,922 --> 00:43:02,049
...and that's a letter
that hasn't been written.

582
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:06,789
And, Mister, l'm telling you here and now,
you ain't gonna write any more.

583
00:43:07,763 --> 00:43:11,859
You bring me one more
and you'll regret it the rest of your days.

584
00:43:12,935 --> 00:43:14,926
You've got a job right here.

585
00:43:15,605 --> 00:43:19,598
And, Mister, you ain't never
gonna get off this ship!

586
00:43:20,376 --> 00:43:22,867
Now get on with your work.

587
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:32,218
Where are your shirts?

588
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:35,023
Where are your shirts?

589
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,615
-Captain--
-Shut up!

590
00:43:37,126 --> 00:43:38,457
Where are your shirts?

591
00:43:39,428 --> 00:43:41,658
Get those shirts on and be quick about it!

592
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,660
l'm sorry, put your shirts on.

593
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:51,639
Just one minute, Mister!

594
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:55,800
Who's captain of this vessel?

595
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:59,139
That is the rankest piece of insubordination
l ever seen.

596
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:05,613
You've been getting pretty smart lately,
buttering up to Mr. Roberts here.

597
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:10,550
But this time you have gone too far!
And l'm making you a little promise.

598
00:44:11,227 --> 00:44:13,195
l am never going to forget this.

599
00:44:13,396 --> 00:44:16,297
And as a starter, you're on report.

600
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:20,493
Every one of you who appeared on deck
without a shirt, on report!

601
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:22,795
You're not putting these men on report.

602
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:26,533
-What do you mean l'm not?
-l'm responsible. l gave them permission.

603
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,676
You disobeyed my standing order?

604
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:32,971
Thanks a million for the fresh fruit,
Lieutenant!

605
00:44:39,155 --> 00:44:40,713
You gave that man oranges?

606
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,414
Yes, sir, l'm afraid l did.

607
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:46,823
Ten days! You just got yourself ten days
in your quarters! Ten days!

608
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:48,588
Do you relieve me here?

609
00:44:48,898 --> 00:44:51,799
You heard me. You get to your cabin
before l make it 20 days!

610
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:55,268
Another launch alongside, Mr. Roberts.
You want it port or starboard?

611
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:57,238
l've been relieved, Chief.

612
00:44:57,673 --> 00:44:59,607
Where do you think you're going?

613
00:45:00,509 --> 00:45:03,239
To my room for ten days. Or was it 20?

614
00:45:03,379 --> 00:45:06,405
l'll tell you when to get to your cabin!
Get back to your job!

615
00:45:06,482 --> 00:45:09,042
-Captain, you told me--
-Never mind what l told you.

616
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:10,380
l'm telling you.

617
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:21,158
Who is that officer? You, boy!

618
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:26,464
Yes, you. Come here.

619
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:42,313
Are you one of my officers?

620
00:45:42,852 --> 00:45:43,841
Yes, sir.

621
00:45:44,787 --> 00:45:46,311
What's your name again?

622
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:48,217
Ensign Pulver, sir.

623
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:57,892
l'm glad to see there's someone aboard
this vessel who knows how to salute.

624
00:46:04,273 --> 00:46:06,833
How is it l don't see you around much,
Pulver?

625
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,601
l've often wondered
the same thing myself, sir.

626
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:12,480
What's your job?

627
00:46:12,848 --> 00:46:15,681
Officer in charge of laundry and morale, sir.

628
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:19,348
How long have you been aboard?

629
00:46:26,028 --> 00:46:27,586
Fourteen months, sir.

630
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:30,290
Fourteen months!

631
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:39,033
Spend most of your time
in the laundry, huh?

632
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,271
Yes, sir. Most of the time.

633
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:44,543
-You do a very good job.
-Thank you, sir.

634
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:46,137
-Except for one thing.
-Sir?

635
00:46:46,649 --> 00:46:48,844
l don't like starch in my pajamas.

636
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:51,716
-You'll watch out for that, won't you?
-Yes, sir.

637
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:54,347
Fine. You're doing very good work, Pulver.

638
00:46:55,991 --> 00:46:58,824
You must come to my cabin sometime
and have dinner.

639
00:47:16,212 --> 00:47:18,646
Cut it out, Doug. Now knock it off!

640
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:20,779
Cut it out! He's got his nerve.

641
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:24,314
Wait till next week, Doug,
when he gets his laundry.

642
00:47:25,354 --> 00:47:29,290
Doug, l'm gonna get some starch.
You know, some of that real thick starch...

643
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:31,683
...like they use on nurses' uniforms--

644
00:47:44,173 --> 00:47:48,439
And when old Roberts said that, l thought
the Captain was gonna lose his marbles!

645
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:52,306
Nothing stops old Roberts!

646
00:48:02,491 --> 00:48:03,651
Nice goin', Mr. Roberts.

647
00:48:03,726 --> 00:48:06,923
lt was really beautiful
the way you read the old man off.

648
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:09,427
You're gonna send in another one
next week?

649
00:48:09,498 --> 00:48:13,798
He sure is! And it's my turn to shove it
right under the old man's nose.

650
00:48:14,036 --> 00:48:16,800
Yeah, but you've got a promotion
coming up, haven't you?

651
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:18,339
But could he stop that?

652
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:19,972
Promotion? This is Mr. Roberts!

653
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:22,977
You think he gives a good hoot
about another lousy stripe?

654
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,110
We've gotta write a real hot one
next week, huh, Mr. Roberts?

655
00:48:27,183 --> 00:48:28,980
We'll use asbestos paper.

656
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:35,615
He'll fix the old man's clock. You wait!

657
00:48:40,863 --> 00:48:45,425
All men who have not been put on report
for three weeks...

658
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:50,363
...can now go swimming for ten minutes.
That is all.

659
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:08,451
How do l look?

660
00:49:09,124 --> 00:49:11,592
You don't mind me borrowing
your binoculars, do you?

661
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,992
lt's okay, Frank.
Won't they get in your way?

662
00:49:15,898 --> 00:49:17,058
Now hear this!

663
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:21,964
Now hear this!
Station launch coming alongside....

664
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:25,463
She's here! Now you guys
stay away from that cabin.

665
00:49:32,047 --> 00:49:34,538
Last one in is an ensign!

666
00:49:55,237 --> 00:49:58,172
Your permission to come aboard, sir?
Where's the skipper?

667
00:49:58,741 --> 00:50:00,538
Never mind, l'll find him.

668
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:05,537
-Request permission to come aboard, sir.
-Permission granted.

669
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:07,081
Hop aboard.

670
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:12,813
-Request permission to come aboard, sir.
-Permission granted.

671
00:50:13,656 --> 00:50:16,318
Request permission to come aboard, sir.

672
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,628
Request permission to come aboard, sir.

673
00:50:22,364 --> 00:50:24,457
Request permission to come aboard, sir.

674
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,026
Request permission to come aboard, sir.

675
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:30,663
Well, that's all.

676
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,398
Cobinna had to wash her hair
but she'd just love to come another time.

677
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:44,914
How would you girls like to look
around the ship...

678
00:50:44,987 --> 00:50:47,251
...while the Lieutenant and l
discuss a little business?

679
00:50:48,824 --> 00:50:50,724
Men, the nurses!

680
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,786
l wouldn't think of leaving them
unprotected!

681
00:50:54,863 --> 00:50:57,661
Right this way. Pardon me. Right up here.

682
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:04,363
That's it. There we are, right here.

683
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,739
-This is Doc. Girls, Mr. Roberts.
-Hi!

684
00:51:08,677 --> 00:51:11,942
Ensign Pulver is executive officer.
What's your job?

685
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:17,008
Laundry and morale officer.
Glad to have you aboard.

686
00:51:17,086 --> 00:51:19,714
Oh, are you laundry and morale? So am l!

687
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:24,252
Why don't you just take the girls
off somewhere and tell them all about it?

688
00:51:24,393 --> 00:51:28,386
Gee, l wish l could. But l've gotta clean up.
l did a lot of laundry today.

689
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:30,020
Sure.

690
00:51:31,634 --> 00:51:33,431
Maybe Doc will show them Surgery.

691
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:36,897
Oh, Doc, oh yeah.
Girls, this is our surgeon.

692
00:51:38,741 --> 00:51:40,436
You just go right off with Doc.

693
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:43,578
Don't let the grey hair
and the baggy eyes bother you.

694
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:46,307
He's a very likeable--
He has a great sense of humor.

695
00:51:47,883 --> 00:51:52,013
l'd be delighted to take these young ladies
of the medical profession to my Surgery.

696
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:56,447
But unfortunately we haven't had a chance
to clean up since our last enemy action.

697
00:51:57,259 --> 00:51:59,056
Come on, let's see the ship!

698
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:14,770
Flemish up the lines out there,
will you, Dowdy?

699
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:17,277
-What?
-Yeah. New man....

700
00:52:24,753 --> 00:52:27,119
More salt, Cookie.
Put some more salt in there.

701
00:52:27,289 --> 00:52:29,917
Now, girls, up here is where we have the--

702
00:52:31,794 --> 00:52:33,625
Follow me right up here, girls.

703
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:47,239
Now, girls, this is the uh....
That's a gun.

704
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:49,309
-lmagine.
-ls this the poop deck?

705
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:51,641
You boys must be the lookouts?
Could l borrow these?

706
00:52:51,714 --> 00:52:54,012
Sorry, sir. lt's top secret.

707
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:57,515
Captain's orders, Miss. You know, bifocals.

708
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,683
-l can make an exception in your case.
-Thank you.

709
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:04,852
Look at the fish jumping over there!

710
00:53:04,927 --> 00:53:05,916
lt's a whale!

711
00:53:05,994 --> 00:53:07,985
-A real interesting cloud formation!
-Where?

712
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:10,531
You can see your hospital
right from over the rail here.

713
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:12,624
Ensign Pulver!

714
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:20,997
Hey, l can!
Why, you can almost reach out and--

715
00:53:27,983 --> 00:53:28,972
Glasses.

716
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:42,922
Well, you certainly can see Cobinna!

717
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:50,600
We've gotta get back and hang
those window curtains right away!

718
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:53,033
Ten hut!

719
00:53:54,376 --> 00:53:55,604
Right, haste!

720
00:53:56,645 --> 00:53:58,374
Forward, march!

721
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:07,816
So long, harmless.

722
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:16,530
l was just getting the hang of this thing!

723
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:19,126
Now we've got nothing to look forward to!

724
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:21,328
Just that same cruddy island!

725
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:23,136
You gotta rub it in?
Why don't you shut up?

726
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:24,563
You gonna make me?

727
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,438
-How'd you find out?
-We seen them taking a bath.

728
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:31,138
Through this glass, Mr. Roberts,
we could see all of them.

729
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,941
You heard what she said.
They're gonna hang some curtains.

730
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:38,980
Them nurses was pretty to look at!

731
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:42,886
They've got a ten minute boat ride.
You've still got ten minutes.

732
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:46,826
Yeah, but it wouldn't be any fun
when you know you're gonna be rushed.

733
00:54:46,895 --> 00:54:50,456
This is the first real good day
this bucket's ever had.

734
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:52,597
lt's all over now.

735
00:54:53,135 --> 00:54:56,263
Maybe you've got time now
to listen to a little piece of news.

736
00:54:57,139 --> 00:55:01,838
''When in all respects ready for sea,
on or about 1600 today...

737
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:07,605
''...the AK-601 will proceed at ten knots

the ship will make maximum use...

''...of the recreational facilities of this port.''

741
00:55:23,932 --> 00:55:25,092
That means liberty!

742
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:28,102
-That don't mean liberty?
-That's exactly what it means.

743
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,866
Somebody must have been drunk
to send us to a liberty port.

744
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:33,134
-The old man seen them orders?
-Saw them before l did.

745
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,199
Elysium, where is that?

746
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:39,139
''Elysium is the largest

''Elysium City, its capital,

Wait till we get there!

754

Nice port, huh, Mr. Roberts?

759
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:21,308
We finally made it, Mr. Roberts!

760
00:57:56,084 --> 00:57:58,484
You! On deck. Off.

761
00:57:59,221 --> 00:58:02,384
Get them cannibals off this vessel!
Get them off!

762
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,951
Chief, will you tie this?
lt's been so long, l sort of forgot.

What are you gonna do
when you get ashore?

Kid will probably go to the first saloon.
lce cream saloon, eh, Booksie?

765
00:58:46,635 --> 00:58:48,000
l haven't thought much about it.

766
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:51,369
l've got my camera Ma sent me.
l guess l'll just wander around.

767
00:59:03,618 --> 00:59:04,880
Hey, Lindstrom!

768
00:59:06,154 --> 00:59:09,749
l've got good news for you.
You can take off them liberty whites.

769
00:59:10,525 --> 00:59:12,720
l ain't got the duty tonight!

770
00:59:12,794 --> 00:59:15,558
That's right. You and Mr. Roberts
got the duty tonight.

771
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,029
Now hear this!

772
00:59:17,399 --> 00:59:19,799
Here we go! Here we go!

773
00:59:21,903 --> 00:59:23,962
This is the Captain speaking.

774
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:28,000
l just found out that there's
men on this vessel expecting liberty.

775
00:59:29,177 --> 00:59:33,079
I don't know how this rumor got around,
but I'd like to clear it up right now.

776
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:36,311
On account of cargo requirements
and security conditions...

777
00:59:36,384 --> 00:59:38,852
...which have just come
to my personal attention...

778
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,151
...there will be no liberty
while in this here port!

779
00:59:44,025 --> 00:59:45,117
That is all.

780
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:03,075
Come in, Mr. Roberts.

781
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,646
Twenty-eight seconds! Pretty good time.

782
01:00:09,851 --> 01:00:11,079
You see, l've been expecting you.

783
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:13,417
Okay, when does this crew get liberty?

784
01:00:13,889 --> 01:00:16,414
ln the first place,
just kindly hold your tongue.

785
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:18,089
l'm still Captain here.

786
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:21,257
-When are you gonna let this crew ashore?
-l'm not.

787
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,196
lt was not my idea
coming to this liberty port.

788
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:28,169
lt seems one of my officers arranged it
with a certain port director.

789
01:00:28,436 --> 01:00:31,530
Gave him a bottle of scotch whiskey,
compliments of the Captain.

790
01:00:32,407 --> 01:00:35,069
The port director was kind enough
to send me a thank-you note...

791
01:00:35,143 --> 01:00:36,610
...along with our order.

792
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,777
Sit down, Mr. Roberts.

793
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:47,580
Now l admit l was a little provoked
about not being consulted...

794
01:00:48,256 --> 01:00:51,453
...then l got to thinking
maybe we ought to come to this port...

795
01:00:51,626 --> 01:00:52,854
...so as you and me could have a talk.

796
01:00:52,928 --> 01:00:55,226
All right. Take it out on me,
but not the men.

797
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:58,630
Don't you hear that music?
Don't you know it's tearing the guys apart?

798
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,895
They're breakable, Captain! l promise you.

799
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:03,866
Now you listen to me.

800
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,501
l've got two things l want to show you.

801
01:01:22,457 --> 01:01:24,482
That is the cap of a full commander.

802
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,487
l'm going to wear that cap some day,
and you're going to help me.

803
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:32,798
lt won't do any harm to tell you
that you helped me win that palm tree...

804
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:34,095
...by working cargo.

805
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:36,837
Don't let this go to your head.

806
01:01:37,339 --> 01:01:40,206
When Admiral Finchley awarded me
that palm tree, he said:

807
01:01:40,275 --> 01:01:44,143
''You've got a good cargo officer.
Keep him at it. You're going places.''

808
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:47,742
And l went right out and bought that hat.

809
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:51,252
And nobody is gonna stand
between me and that hat!

810
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,544
Certainly not you.

811
01:01:56,057 --> 01:01:58,025
Now last week it was agreed...

812
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:01,255
...that there was to be no more
of these ''disharmony'' letters.

813
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:02,489
l didn't say that.

814
01:02:03,131 --> 01:02:06,100
And what do l find on my desk
this morning? Another one.

815
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:10,496
lt says here, ''friction between me
and the commanding officer.''

816
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:14,538
That ain't goin' in, Mister.

817
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:16,406
How are you gonna stop it?

818
01:02:18,246 --> 01:02:19,235
l ain't.

819
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:23,141
You are.

820
01:02:25,487 --> 01:02:28,513
Just how much do you want this crew
to have a liberty?

821
01:02:28,823 --> 01:02:31,087
Enough to stop this ''friction''?

822
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,921
Enough to stop writing letters ever?

823
01:02:34,996 --> 01:02:37,521
'Cause that's the only way
this crew is going to get ashore...

824
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,124
...this day or any other day.

825
01:02:44,939 --> 01:02:46,907
Now we've had our little chat.

826
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:49,474
What do you say?

827
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:53,747
How did you get in the Navy?

828
01:02:54,683 --> 01:02:56,548
How did you get on our side?

829
01:02:57,952 --> 01:03:02,651
You ignorant, arrogant, ambitious...!
Keeping 62 men in prison...

830
01:03:02,957 --> 01:03:05,551
...'cause you got a palm tree
for the work they did!

831
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,423
l don't know which l hate worse,
you or that other malignant growth--

832
01:03:09,764 --> 01:03:11,493
How'd you ever get to be
commander of a ship?

833
01:03:11,566 --> 01:03:14,364
l realize in war time they have to scrape
the bottom of the barrel...

834
01:03:14,436 --> 01:03:15,596
...but where'd they ever scrape you up?

835
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,503
There's just one thing left for you, Mister.
A general court-martial!

836
01:03:18,573 --> 01:03:20,006
Fine, court-martial me!

837
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:24,409
l'm asking for it! lf l can't get transferred,
l'll get court-martialed! l'm fed up!

838
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,077
You'll need a witness.

839
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:31,884
Call your messenger.
l'll say it over again in front of him.

840
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:36,784
Go on, call him. You want me to call him?

841
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:49,465
You're a smart boy, Roberts.

842
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:53,538
But l know how to take care of smart boys.

843
01:03:54,476 --> 01:03:57,741
l hate your guts, you smart college guys!

844
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,749
l've been seeing your kind around since
l was ten years old, working as a busboy.

845
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:06,909
''Oh, busboy, it seems my friend
has thrown up on the table.

846
01:04:07,355 --> 01:04:09,448
''Clean up that mess, boy, will you?''

847
01:04:09,824 --> 01:04:13,851
And then when l went to sea as a steward,
people poking at you with umbrellas.

848
01:04:14,562 --> 01:04:18,726
''Oh, boy! You, boy!
Careful with that luggage, boy! ''

849
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:22,129
And l took it. l took it for years!

850
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:25,272
But l don't have to take it anymore.

851
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:31,403
There's a war on and l'm Captain of this
vessel. Now you can take it for a change.

852
01:04:32,347 --> 01:04:36,147
The worst l can do to you is
to keep you right here, Mister!

853
01:04:36,818 --> 01:04:40,982
And here is where you're going to stay!
Now, get out!

854
01:04:55,303 --> 01:04:57,396
What do you want for liberty, Captain?

855
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:04,701
You are through writing letters ever.

856
01:05:10,151 --> 01:05:11,140
Okay.

857
01:05:11,653 --> 01:05:12,950
And that's not all.

858
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:16,317
You're through talking back to me
in front of the crew.

859
01:05:16,391 --> 01:05:18,689
When l give an order, you jump!

860
01:05:21,996 --> 01:05:23,588
-ls that all, Captain?
-No.

861
01:05:25,033 --> 01:05:26,694
Anyone know you're in here?

862
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:28,958
No one.

863
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,159
Good.

864
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:33,569
Then you're not to go blabbing this around
to anyone ever.

865
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:35,131
Might not sound so good.

866
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,942
l don't want you to take credit
for getting this--

867
01:05:38,012 --> 01:05:39,809
You think l'm doing this for credit?

868
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:42,247
-You think l'd let anyone know?
-l've gotta make sure.

869
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,751
-You've got my word, that's all.
-Your word!

870
01:05:45,653 --> 01:05:48,679
You college boys make such a great show
of keeping your word.

871
01:05:54,095 --> 01:05:57,155
Now hear this!
This is the Captain speaking.

872
01:05:58,099 --> 01:06:00,590
l've got further word
on the subject of liberty.

873
01:06:01,703 --> 01:06:05,434
lt gives me great pleasure to announce
liberty for the starboard section--

874
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:08,205
The whole crew, or there's no deal!

875
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:10,132
l mean it.

876
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:19,252
Correction. Liberty for the entire crew
will commence immediately.

877
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:22,881
You don't have to tell them again.
They heard you.

878
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:26,419
Look at those crazy bugs!

879
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:29,490
Listen to them!

880
01:07:04,632 --> 01:07:06,930
l've got a bunch of real beauties
for you this time!

881
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:08,559
-Can they walk?
-Walk?

882
01:07:08,703 --> 01:07:10,295
Some of them can't even crawl.

883
01:08:00,288 --> 01:08:02,153
Well, they're peaceful anyhow.

884
01:08:02,423 --> 01:08:04,653
All right, lads. Come on, lend a hand.

885
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:29,816
Hiya, Mr. Roberts!

886
01:08:32,153 --> 01:08:33,518
Evening, Mr. Roberts!

887
01:08:36,524 --> 01:08:38,424
-Duty officer, sir.
-That's right.

888
01:08:39,594 --> 01:08:42,825
Colonel Middleton presents
his compliments to the Captain, sir...

889
01:08:42,897 --> 01:08:46,264
...and wishes him to know that these men
made a shambles...

890
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:48,598
...of the Colonel's testimonial dinner-dance.

891
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:51,469
You men crashed a dance
for Army personnel?

892
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:54,273
Yes, sir.
And they made us feel unwelcome.

893
01:08:54,842 --> 01:08:56,332
The Army started a fight, huh?

894
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:58,208
No, sir, we started it.

895
01:08:58,312 --> 01:08:59,677
And we finished it.

896
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:03,776
Tell Mr. Roberts how many of you
Army bums is in the hospital.

897
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:08,619
Thirty-eight soldiers of the U.S. Army
have been hospitalized.

898
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:12,757
And the Colonel himself has
a very bad bruise on his left shin.

899
01:09:15,096 --> 01:09:16,586
That's not all, Lieutenant.

900
01:09:17,131 --> 01:09:19,429
There were young ladies present,
50 of them...

901
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,661
...from the finest families of Elysium.

902
01:09:22,236 --> 01:09:23,225
Well, sir....

903
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:30,037
Two of these young women were
somewhat mauled.

904
01:09:30,978 --> 01:09:32,946
One of them actually got a black eye.

905
01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:35,943
Six others had their clothes
torn from them.

906
01:09:36,417 --> 01:09:38,351
They ran screaming into the night.

907
01:09:38,419 --> 01:09:40,387
They haven't been heard from since.

908
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:42,886
What are you going to do about it?

909
01:09:43,224 --> 01:09:47,320
l'm due to be relieved here in 15 minutes.
l'd be glad to lead a search party.

910
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:52,491
No, sir, the Army will take charge
of that end.

911
01:09:53,434 --> 01:09:56,733
Colonel Middleton will want to know
what punishment you'll give these men.

912
01:09:56,804 --> 01:09:59,500
You tell him l'm sure our captain
will think of something.

913
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:01,337
-But, sir--
-That's all, Sergeant.

914
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:03,636
-Thank you, sir.
-Good night!

915
01:10:06,814 --> 01:10:08,975
-So long, you guys!
-See you around.

916
01:10:13,921 --> 01:10:15,889
What have you got to say for yourselves?

917
01:10:15,957 --> 01:10:17,652
Okay if we go ashore again?

918
01:10:18,226 --> 01:10:19,750
What do you say, Doc?

919
01:10:23,397 --> 01:10:25,592
-Anybody got a fractured skull?
-No!

920
01:10:27,468 --> 01:10:29,197
They pass the physical.

921
01:10:29,837 --> 01:10:31,998
Go and take a shower
and get into some clothes.

922
01:10:32,073 --> 01:10:34,371
We've just got time to get back
to the dance!

923
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:39,437
Hey, Mr. Roberts! l'm drunk as a goat!

924
01:10:40,715 --> 01:10:42,444
Show him how drunk l am!

925
01:10:43,451 --> 01:10:47,683
Mr. Roberts, when l first saw her
she was eating.

926
01:10:48,656 --> 01:10:52,649
And you know,
she just ate her way into my heart.

927
01:10:54,061 --> 01:10:57,963
She was eating a little old palm tree!

928
01:10:58,733 --> 01:11:01,065
There you are, kid! Chow!

929
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,101
Wait a minute!

930
01:11:05,173 --> 01:11:06,367
What's her name?

931
01:11:07,842 --> 01:11:10,367
-l don't know, sir.
-She's got a nameplate.

932
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:12,540
Her name is....

933
01:11:15,683 --> 01:11:16,775
''Property of.''

934
01:11:17,318 --> 01:11:18,785
What's her last name?

935
01:11:20,421 --> 01:11:21,683
Her last name?

936
01:11:22,723 --> 01:11:24,714
''Rear Admiral Wentworth.''

937
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,158
Okay, hit the sack. l'll take care of her.

938
01:11:28,329 --> 01:11:32,095
Okay, Mr. Roberts.
See that she gets a good square meal!

939
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:35,693
Come on, baby.

940
01:11:37,071 --> 01:11:39,062
Hey, Kennedy, where you been?

941
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,467
Okay, you're relieved.

942
01:11:41,976 --> 01:11:44,001
Request permission to go ashore, sir.

943
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:52,152
Did one of your men turn up with a--

944
01:11:52,854 --> 01:11:53,980
Oh, there she is!

945
01:11:55,323 --> 01:11:57,518
Thanks. Come on. Come on.

946
01:11:57,592 --> 01:11:59,856
Your papa's over there worried about you.

947
01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:03,492
Say, Mr. Roberts, where's your relief?

948
01:12:03,564 --> 01:12:05,395
He'll be along any minute now.

949
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,699
Any minute now.

950
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:10,101
What are you looking so cocky about?

951
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:11,695
Am l looking cocky?

952
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,940
Maybe it's because for the first time since
l've been on this ship, l'm seeing a crew.

953
01:12:17,478 --> 01:12:19,571
What do you think you were living with
all this time?

954
01:12:19,647 --> 01:12:21,808
With 62 separate guys.

955
01:12:22,116 --> 01:12:25,711
There's a big difference. Now in one night,
these guys are bound together.

956
01:12:27,188 --> 01:12:29,315
l think now maybe they're strong enough
to stand...

957
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:33,019
...all the miserable, endless days
ahead of us.

958
01:12:33,861 --> 01:12:35,852
l only hope l'm strong enough.

959
01:12:38,933 --> 01:12:40,696
Tomorrow you and l are going over there...

960
01:12:40,768 --> 01:12:43,896
...to take advantage of the groundwork
that's been laid tonight.

961
01:12:44,505 --> 01:12:46,996
You and l are going
to give ourselves a liberty.

962
01:12:51,112 --> 01:12:52,909
Get a load of Pulver.

963
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:58,015
Hello Frank, how was your liberty?

964
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:04,747
''l'm telling you true
l'd be anything but blue

965
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:07,390
''lf l could be with you''

966
01:13:22,843 --> 01:13:25,175
All right, you men know your posts.

967
01:13:28,215 --> 01:13:29,477
Officer of the deck?

968
01:13:30,117 --> 01:13:33,985
l hope you don't mind, but l've stationed
my men along your starboard side.

969
01:13:34,588 --> 01:13:38,991
l'm sorry, but this ship is restricted
for the rest of its stay in Elysium.

970
01:13:39,627 --> 01:13:44,394
Your captain is to report to
the island commander at 7:00 this morning.

971
01:13:45,266 --> 01:13:47,860
l recommend that he's there on time.

972
01:13:48,436 --> 01:13:50,904
The Admiral is a pretty tough cookie
when he's mad.

973
01:13:51,672 --> 01:13:53,663
He's madder now then l ever seen him.

974
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:55,941
What in particular did this?

975
01:13:57,044 --> 01:13:59,979
A little while ago, six men from your ship...

976
01:14:00,081 --> 01:14:02,982
...broke into the home
of the French colonial governor...

977
01:14:03,718 --> 01:14:07,586
...and started throwing things
through a plate-glass living-room window.

978
01:14:08,856 --> 01:14:11,256
We found some of the things on the lawn.

979
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,191
A large world globe...

980
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:18,589
...a small love seat, a lot of books...

981
01:14:19,533 --> 01:14:21,626
...and a bust of Balzac...

982
01:14:23,037 --> 01:14:24,334
...the French writer.

983
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:28,636
We also found an Army private, first class...

984
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,875
...who was unconscious at the time.

985
01:14:32,413 --> 01:14:34,472
He claims they threw him, too.

986
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:37,174
-Through the window?
-That's right.

987
01:14:38,452 --> 01:14:40,852
lt seems he took him there for a little joke.

988
01:14:41,055 --> 01:14:43,387
He didn't tell him it was
the governor's house.

989
01:14:43,891 --> 01:14:45,358
He told them it was a....

990
01:14:47,828 --> 01:14:50,126
Well, what we call in Alabama--

991
01:14:51,365 --> 01:14:53,333
We call it the same thing in Nebraska.

992
01:14:54,201 --> 01:14:56,169
That's about all, Lieutenant.

993
01:14:57,338 --> 01:15:00,671
lf it makes you feel any better,
Admiral Wentworth says...

994
01:15:00,741 --> 01:15:05,508
...this is the worst ship he's ever seen
in his entire naval career!

995
01:15:07,148 --> 01:15:09,082
-Good night, Lieutenant.
-Night.

996
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:26,856
Schlemmer, are you all right?

997
01:15:26,934 --> 01:15:28,526
Get up here, you idiot!

998
01:15:29,837 --> 01:15:31,304
What are you trying to do?

999
01:15:34,341 --> 01:15:35,308
Get up here!

1000
01:15:35,876 --> 01:15:38,470
l forgot my motorcycle!

1001
01:15:38,813 --> 01:15:40,075
Come back here!

1002
01:15:58,165 --> 01:16:00,190
Kicked out! Kicked out!

1003
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:02,796
The first time l've ever been
kicked out of a port!

1004
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,599
You're going to pay for this!

1005
01:16:04,872 --> 01:16:07,773
Now get the gangway up
and we're going to get out of here.

1006
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:20,376
Chief, bring in the gangway.
We've been kicked out of port.

1007
01:16:21,555 --> 01:16:24,524
Bookser ain't aboard, sir.
He didn't come back last night.

1008
01:16:25,826 --> 01:16:29,421
Get that gangway up, Mister!
And l mean now!

1009
01:16:30,164 --> 01:16:31,131
Yes, sir.

1010
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:52,016
Come on, Booksie! Come on!

1011
01:17:05,332 --> 01:17:06,890
l'm surprised at you!

1012
01:17:07,067 --> 01:17:08,557
Yes, sir, so am l.

1013
01:17:08,802 --> 01:17:10,201
Where did you meet her?

1014
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,136
-At a church social.
-All night?

1015
01:17:13,274 --> 01:17:17,040
We went for a walk down on the beach.
We sat there and counted the stars.

1016
01:17:18,212 --> 01:17:20,180
Honest, sir, that's all.

1017
01:17:21,382 --> 01:17:23,145
-Better get below.
-Yes, sir.

1018
01:17:48,742 --> 01:17:50,573
All present and accounted for, sir.

1019
01:17:54,114 --> 01:17:55,445
Right here, Mister.

1020
01:18:01,055 --> 01:18:04,547
Well, l guess you're mighty proud
of yourselves...

1021
01:18:05,459 --> 01:18:07,757
...getting me kicked out of port, that way.

1022
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:11,691
Well, we are going to erase this blot
from my record...

1023
01:18:12,233 --> 01:18:15,066
...if we have to work 24 hours a day!

1024
01:18:16,503 --> 01:18:17,902
Right, Mr. Roberts?

1025
01:18:18,772 --> 01:18:19,830
Yes, sir.

1026
01:18:21,075 --> 01:18:24,670
We are going to move more cargo
than we ever moved before.

1027
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,005
-Right, Mr. Roberts?
-Yes, sir.

1028
01:18:30,217 --> 01:18:32,082
Mr. Roberts is going to see to it...

1029
01:18:32,419 --> 01:18:35,582
...that you men tow the line at all times.

1030
01:18:37,725 --> 01:18:39,022
That's right, too...

1031
01:18:40,828 --> 01:18:42,022
...isn't it, Mister?

1032
01:18:42,896 --> 01:18:43,988
That's right, sir.

1033
01:18:44,265 --> 01:18:45,960
You know as well as l do...

1034
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,569
...that Mr. Roberts is a man
who keeps his word.

1035
01:18:50,971 --> 01:18:53,633
And, Roberts, you do a good job...

1036
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:57,142
...and one of these days there may be
a promotion in it for you.

1037
01:18:57,211 --> 01:18:59,076
An extra little bar on that collar.

1038
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,548
That'd be all right, wouldn't it, Mister?

1039
01:19:04,952 --> 01:19:06,886
Wouldn't that be all right, Roberts?

1040
01:19:08,989 --> 01:19:10,456
Yes, sir, if you say so.

1041
01:19:10,991 --> 01:19:12,652
You just heard me say so!

1042
01:19:14,194 --> 01:19:15,161
Take over.

1043
01:19:16,964 --> 01:19:18,556
See they work up a sweat.

1044
01:19:23,504 --> 01:19:26,905
l just gave an order
and l ain't heard no answer!

1045
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:30,041
l'm waiting.

1046
01:19:32,179 --> 01:19:33,203
Aye, aye, sir.

1047
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:34,909
That's better.

1048
01:19:35,749 --> 01:19:37,307
That's more like it.

1049
01:19:49,263 --> 01:19:52,892
Deck division, bring out the chippers
and scrapers and get after that rust.

1050
01:19:54,268 --> 01:19:56,862
Engineering division, air bedding. Fall out.

1051
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,081
What's he taking all that guff for?

1052
01:20:12,486 --> 01:20:14,283
''Yes, sir.'' ''No, sir.''

1053
01:20:14,588 --> 01:20:16,021
''Aye, aye, sir.''

1054
01:20:16,256 --> 01:20:19,851
Hey, Killer, do you really think
he's bucking for a promotion?

1055
01:20:20,194 --> 01:20:23,220
Who, Mr. Roberts?
He's just tired, that's all.

1056
01:20:24,865 --> 01:20:27,026
Yeah, that's right. He's just tired.

1057
01:20:27,701 --> 01:20:29,760
Mr. Roberts, l got something here.

1058
01:20:30,104 --> 01:20:33,130
A little love letter from the Bureau came in
just this morning.

1059
01:20:33,273 --> 01:20:36,504
Get a load of this.
''To all ships and stations:

1060
01:20:36,643 --> 01:20:40,374
''Heightened war offensive has created
urgent need aboard combat ships...

1061
01:20:40,514 --> 01:20:42,106
''...for experienced officers.

1062
01:20:42,216 --> 01:20:46,619
''All commanding officers are directed
to forward with their endorsement...

1063
01:20:46,987 --> 01:20:50,718
''...all applications for transfer from officers
with 24 months sea duty.''

1064
01:20:51,024 --> 01:20:52,355
You've got 29 months.

1065
01:20:52,459 --> 01:20:54,950
Does that put old stupid
behind the eight ball or don't it?

1066
01:20:55,028 --> 01:20:58,896
Here's your letter, all typed up and ready
to go. Just the old John Hancock.

1067
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,296
Go ahead, Mr. Roberts.
l want to hear him explode.

1068
01:21:02,369 --> 01:21:04,530
Yeah, he'll go right through the overhead!

1069
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:07,407
l want to look it over first.

1070
01:21:07,841 --> 01:21:10,173
What's to look over?
lt's just a standard form--

1071
01:21:10,244 --> 01:21:13,645
l'm not going to stand here and argue!
l told you l want to look it over.

1072
01:21:13,714 --> 01:21:16,581
Get back to your typewriter
before l put you on report!

1073
01:21:23,056 --> 01:21:25,524
All right, don't just stand here.

1074
01:21:54,221 --> 01:21:57,088
...from the headquarters
of the Allied Command in Europe.

1075
01:21:57,191 --> 01:22:00,092
I repeat,
there is no official announcement yet.

1076
01:22:00,527 --> 01:22:02,586
The report that the war
in Europe has ended...

1077
01:22:02,663 --> 01:22:04,893
...has come from only one correspondent.

1078
01:22:04,965 --> 01:22:08,799
It has not been confirmed by other
correspondents or by Allied Headquarters.

1079
01:22:08,969 --> 01:22:11,335
But here is one highly intriguing fact:

1080
01:22:11,872 --> 01:22:13,931
That report has not been denied.

1081
01:22:14,508 --> 01:22:16,408
Turn that thing off, will you, Doc?

1082
01:22:18,946 --> 01:22:21,972
Has Doug ever said anything to you
about wanting a promotion?

1083
01:22:22,483 --> 01:22:26,476
Of course not. l doubt if he's even
conscious of what rank he is.

1084
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:30,420
He never thinks about a promotion.
All he ever thinks about is the war news.

1085
01:22:30,691 --> 01:22:34,092
Anybody who says he's bucking
for another stripe is a dirty liar!

1086
01:22:34,194 --> 01:22:35,126
Who says he is?

1087
01:22:35,195 --> 01:22:38,858
lnsigna, Mannion, some of those
other guys. l heard them talking.

1088
01:22:39,299 --> 01:22:42,530
Outside the porthole,
talking loud on purpose so l'd hear them.

1089
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:45,565
Must've guessed l was lying here
in my sack.

1090
01:22:46,073 --> 01:22:47,904
What's happened to Doug, anyway?

1091
01:22:48,108 --> 01:22:49,336
How would l know?

1092
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:52,902
He's spoken about ten words to me
in as many days.

1093
01:22:53,213 --> 01:22:54,510
l'll find out though.

1094
01:22:55,415 --> 01:22:57,007
He won't talk, Doc.

1095
01:22:57,317 --> 01:23:00,411
l followed him all around the room
this morning while he was shaving.

1096
01:23:00,487 --> 01:23:02,250
l begged him to talk to me.

1097
01:23:02,589 --> 01:23:05,581
l said, ''You're a fella who needs a friend,
and here l am.

1098
01:23:06,026 --> 01:23:08,119
''What's all this trouble
between you and the crew?

1099
01:23:08,195 --> 01:23:10,322
''You tell me and l'll fix it up like that! ''

1100
01:23:10,397 --> 01:23:14,333
Then l gave him a lot of good advice.
Things like: ''Keep your chin up.''

1101
01:23:14,535 --> 01:23:15,524
You know what he did?

1102
01:23:15,602 --> 01:23:18,332
He walked right out of this room
just as though l wasn't here.

1103
01:23:18,405 --> 01:23:19,702
And l was here.

1104
01:23:20,507 --> 01:23:23,601
Mr. Roberts is turning out to be
like an officer, ain't he?

1105
01:23:41,795 --> 01:23:45,561
Doug boy, we thought you were up in
the radio shack listening to the war news.

1106
01:23:45,799 --> 01:23:47,994
Don't you want to go out
and get a cup of coffee?

1107
01:23:48,068 --> 01:23:51,367
-Yeah, sure. l'll go with you.
-No, l don't want to. You go ahead.

1108
01:23:53,373 --> 01:23:56,206
Will you get out anyway?
l want to talk to Doc.

1109
01:23:56,677 --> 01:24:00,113
All right. l'm goin' for a cup of coffee.
No, l'm not.

1110
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:02,114
l'm going to the radio shack
and listen to the war news.

1111
01:24:02,182 --> 01:24:03,774
You're not the only one interested.

1112
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:05,442
See you later, Doc.

1113
01:24:12,593 --> 01:24:14,026
Transfer me, will you?

1114
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:17,858
Transfer me to the hospital
on this next island. You can do it.

1115
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:21,692
You don't need the Captain's approval.
Just put me ashore for examination.

1116
01:24:22,336 --> 01:24:24,827
Say there's something wrong
with my eyes or my feet or my head.

1117
01:24:24,905 --> 01:24:26,566
You can trump up something.

1118
01:24:29,076 --> 01:24:30,270
What good would that do?

1119
01:24:30,344 --> 01:24:34,337
Plenty. l'd lie around that hospital
for a couple of weeks till the ship sailed.

1120
01:24:34,748 --> 01:24:37,649
l'd be off this ship! Will you do it, Doc?

1121
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:46,124
What's really the matter?

1122
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:52,398
l just put Dolan on report.

1123
01:24:54,735 --> 01:24:55,724
On report?

1124
01:24:57,504 --> 01:24:58,528
Why?

1125
01:24:59,306 --> 01:25:02,537
l gave him an order. He didn't carry it out
fast enough to suit me.

1126
01:25:05,812 --> 01:25:07,245
No, that's not true.

1127
01:25:08,415 --> 01:25:09,541
lt's the war.

1128
01:25:10,651 --> 01:25:14,451
l heard the news. The war was ending
and l couldn't get to it.

1129
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:19,689
There's Dolan, giving me guff about
something, and all of a sudden l hated him!

1130
01:25:20,227 --> 01:25:21,888
l hated all of them.

1131
01:25:22,729 --> 01:25:26,290
lf they think l'm bucking for a promotion,
that l walk ten feet across the room...

1132
01:25:26,366 --> 01:25:27,765
...to get anything from that captain...

1133
01:25:27,834 --> 01:25:30,064
...l'm through
with the whole ungrateful mob!

1134
01:25:30,504 --> 01:25:32,404
Does this crew owe you something?

1135
01:25:32,506 --> 01:25:33,973
What do you mean by that?

1136
01:25:34,374 --> 01:25:35,932
You talk as if they did.

1137
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:43,181
That's exactly how l'm talking.

1138
01:25:45,318 --> 01:25:47,616
Doc, that shows you how far gone l am.

1139
01:25:49,022 --> 01:25:51,047
l'm blaming them for something that--

1140
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:53,259
What? Something what?

1141
01:25:55,195 --> 01:25:59,564
Doug, you've made some sort of an
agreement with the Captain, haven't you?

1142
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,025
Agreement? l don't know what you mean.

1143
01:26:02,169 --> 01:26:04,569
Doc, turn on the radio!

1144
01:26:04,905 --> 01:26:07,533
This broadcast will bring you
a special newsflash.

1145
01:26:07,808 --> 01:26:11,574
The war is over in Europe!
The war is over in Europe!

1146
01:26:12,012 --> 01:26:15,004
Germany has surrendered unconditionally
to the Allied Armies.

1147
01:26:15,248 --> 01:26:18,308
The surrender was signed
in a schoolhouse in the city of Reims.

1148
01:26:19,853 --> 01:26:23,584
l would remind you that there is still
a minor skirmish here in the Pacific.

1149
01:26:23,924 --> 01:26:25,391
l'll miss that, too.

1150
01:26:26,393 --> 01:26:29,590
But this is the greatest day in the world.
We've got to celebrate.

1151
01:26:29,996 --> 01:26:32,396
-How about it, Frank?
-Yeah, we've gotta celebrate.

1152
01:26:32,466 --> 01:26:35,629
What'll it be? Alcohol and orange juice
or orange juice and alcohol?

1153
01:26:35,702 --> 01:26:37,329
Doc, that's not good enough.

1154
01:26:38,171 --> 01:26:40,969
We've gotta think of something
to lift this ship out of the water...

1155
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:42,975
...and turn it around the other way.

1156
01:26:45,312 --> 01:26:47,303
You're gonna blow your lids
when you hear this idea!

1157
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,143
Oh, what a sweet idea!

1158
01:26:49,449 --> 01:26:52,043
You said l never finish anything l start.
Boy, you're wrong.

1159
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:54,280
Tonight l started something
and l'm gonna finish it.

1160
01:26:54,354 --> 01:26:56,618
-Wait a minute, what is it?
-A firecracker.

1161
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:00,656
We're gonna heave a firecracker
under that old man's bunk, and bam!

1162
01:27:02,362 --> 01:27:06,162
Wake up, you unpatriotic old slob!
lt's V-E Day!

1163
01:27:06,733 --> 01:27:10,829
Did you ever see such a hand-painted,
hand-packed firecracker in your life?

1164
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:14,399
lt's the most beautiful firecracker
l've ever seen, but will it work?

1165
01:27:14,474 --> 01:27:16,772
Sure it will! Well, l think it will.

1166
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:19,936
Haven't you tested it?
lt's gotta work, it's just gotta.

1167
01:27:20,013 --> 01:27:23,005
l'll take it to the laundry, my laboratory.
l've got all the makings there.

1168
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:25,643
lf this one works,
l can make another in two minutes.

1169
01:27:25,852 --> 01:27:29,686
We'll wait here. Be sure you've got enough
to make it loud. What about powder?

1170
01:27:29,756 --> 01:27:32,350
Powder? This ain't no popgun.
lt's a firecracker.

1171
01:27:32,459 --> 01:27:34,859
l used fulminate of mercury!

1172
01:27:38,498 --> 01:27:42,025
Fulminate of mercury? That stuff's murder.
Do you suppose he means it?

1173
01:27:42,235 --> 01:27:45,466
Of course not! Where would he get
fulminate of mercury?

1174
01:27:46,473 --> 01:27:48,737
l don't know. He's pretty resourceful.

1175
01:27:49,643 --> 01:27:52,271
-Well, how about a little drink?
-Right.

1176
01:27:53,914 --> 01:27:57,748
Doc, l've been living with a genius.

1177
01:27:59,486 --> 01:28:03,252
This makes everything worthwhile, a whole
year and a half he spent in his bunk.

1178
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:07,089
How else could you celebrate VE Day?

1179
01:28:07,761 --> 01:28:10,229
A firecracker under the old man's bunk!

1180
01:28:14,901 --> 01:28:16,766
-To better days.
-Right.

1181
01:28:18,205 --> 01:28:22,403
And to a great American,
Frank Thurlowe Pulver...

1182
01:28:23,543 --> 01:28:27,741
...soldier, statesman, scientist.

1183
01:28:28,849 --> 01:28:30,749
Friend of the working girl.

1184
01:28:49,002 --> 01:28:50,264
What was that?

1185
01:28:51,071 --> 01:28:54,905
l don't know what it was, Captain,
but l'll try and find out.

1186
01:28:58,311 --> 01:29:02,907
Hey, there! Up on the bridge!
ls there anything wrong up there?

1187
01:29:15,595 --> 01:29:17,392
Help! Help!

1188
01:29:22,369 --> 01:29:24,633
This may be pretty bad, Doug.

1189
01:29:35,815 --> 01:29:38,113
Geez, that stuff's terrific!

1190
01:29:39,452 --> 01:29:40,578
Are you all right?

1191
01:29:40,787 --> 01:29:43,654
Yeah, l'm great.
You should have been there!

1192
01:29:43,924 --> 01:29:45,915
You're not burned or anything?

1193
01:29:45,992 --> 01:29:50,088
No, but that laundry's kind of beat up.
You know those laundry machines...

1194
01:29:50,563 --> 01:29:52,861
...are clear on the other side of the room.

1195
01:29:52,933 --> 01:29:57,029
There's a new porthole on the starboard
side. The electric eye went right through.

1196
01:29:57,337 --> 01:30:01,034
l guess a steam line must have busted.
l was up to here in lather!

1197
01:30:02,275 --> 01:30:07,178
Soapsuds were flying all around.
lt was absolutely beautiful!

1198
01:30:07,881 --> 01:30:10,247
What was it? Has anybody found out?

1199
01:30:11,418 --> 01:30:16,219
lt was the laundry, Captain.
A steam line must have busted.

1200
01:30:17,023 --> 01:30:18,115
Any damage?

1201
01:30:18,558 --> 01:30:23,723
We can't get in there.
The passageway is solid soapsuds.

1202
01:30:24,397 --> 01:30:26,524
Well, tell those men to be more careful.

1203
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,595
Aye, aye, sir.

1204
01:30:42,349 --> 01:30:46,080
Frank, our celebration is
just getting started.

1205
01:30:46,653 --> 01:30:49,315
The night is young and our duty is clear.

1206
01:30:49,489 --> 01:30:52,253
-What now?
-We're gonna get the rest of your stuff.

1207
01:30:52,325 --> 01:30:55,260
You proved that it worked.
You just hit the wrong target, that's all.

1208
01:30:55,328 --> 01:30:58,923
We're gonna make another firecracker
and put it where it really belongs.

1209
01:31:00,967 --> 01:31:04,334
All of my stuff was down in the laundry.
lt all went up.

1210
01:31:06,573 --> 01:31:08,939
l'm sorry, Doug. l'm awful sorry.

1211
01:31:09,442 --> 01:31:10,773
That's okay, Frank.

1212
01:31:11,344 --> 01:31:13,437
-You're not sore at me, are you?
-What for?

1213
01:31:13,513 --> 01:31:15,811
-For spoiling the celebration.
-Of course not.

1214
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:18,383
lt was a good idea, wasn't it?

1215
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:22,319
lt was a great idea. l'm proud of you.
lt just didn't work, that's all.

1216
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:24,821
-Where are you going?
-Out on deck.

1217
01:31:24,891 --> 01:31:26,449
Wait, l'll clean up and come.

1218
01:31:26,526 --> 01:31:30,428
l'm gonna turn in after that.
lt's okay, Frank.

1219
01:31:36,269 --> 01:31:39,170
He was happy there for a minute.
Did you hear him laughing?

1220
01:31:43,109 --> 01:31:45,407
Did you find out
what's the matter with him?

1221
01:31:46,346 --> 01:31:48,109
No, he wouldn't tell me.

1222
01:31:49,649 --> 01:31:52,777
But l know one thing he's feeling tonight
and that's panic.

1223
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:57,521
Tonight he feels his war is dying
before he can get to it.

1224
01:32:02,695 --> 01:32:03,821
l let him down.

1225
01:32:05,698 --> 01:32:08,132
He wanted to celebrate and l let him down.

1226
01:32:08,568 --> 01:32:11,696
We hope that the King and Queen
will come out.

1227
01:32:11,805 --> 01:32:14,399
The crowds are cheering. Listen to them.

1228
01:32:16,609 --> 01:32:20,602
At any second now
we hope to see Their Majesties.

1229
01:32:20,847 --> 01:32:22,542
The color here is tremendous.

1230
01:32:22,615 --> 01:32:26,449
Everywhere rosettes!
Everywhere gay red, white and blue hats!

1231
01:32:26,653 --> 01:32:28,712
What's all that jabberin' on the radio?

1232
01:32:28,822 --> 01:32:30,881
Something about the King and Queen.

1233
01:32:37,197 --> 01:32:40,291
A steam line busted in the laundry.
They're cleaning it up now.

1234
01:32:40,366 --> 01:32:42,129
lt ain't even worth going to see.

1235
01:32:43,803 --> 01:32:46,101
Come on, Dolan,
don't let them get you down.

1236
01:32:49,843 --> 01:32:52,744
What was them croquette things
we had for chow tonight?

1237
01:33:00,487 --> 01:33:01,476
Good evening.

1238
01:33:03,156 --> 01:33:05,784
You fellas hear the news?
The war is over in Europe.

1239
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,217
Yes, sir, we heard.

1240
01:33:07,293 --> 01:33:10,126
Sure, maybe somebody'll get
on the ball out here now.

1241
01:33:12,298 --> 01:33:13,492
Dolan, l....

1242
01:33:15,335 --> 01:33:20,363
l guess l kind of blew my top.
l'm sorry. l'm taking you off report.

1243
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:22,873
Whatever you want, sir.

1244
01:33:23,843 --> 01:33:25,868
Well, l guess l'll hit the old sack.

1245
01:33:26,446 --> 01:33:27,811
Yeah, me too.

1246
01:33:28,681 --> 01:33:30,808
-Yeah, l think so.
-Good night.

1247
01:33:32,218 --> 01:33:34,015
l didn't realize how late it was.

1248
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,303
Since I talked to you 35 minutes ago...

1249
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:58,503
...the picture's changed a little bit
here in Times Square....

1250
01:33:59,546 --> 01:34:02,481
Our boys have won this victory today.

1251
01:34:04,117 --> 01:34:06,051
But the rest is up to you.

1252
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,681
You, and you alone must recognize
our enemies...

1253
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:16,895
...the forces of ambition, cruelty,
arrogance and stupidity!

1254
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:22,134
You must recognize them.
You must destroy them!

1255
01:34:23,036 --> 01:34:26,437
You must tear them out
as you would a malignant growth...

1256
01:34:27,273 --> 01:34:29,867
...and cast them
from the surface of the Earth!

1257
01:35:58,131 --> 01:36:01,328
Sound the general alarm!
Sound the general alarm!

1258
01:36:02,035 --> 01:36:04,595
Sound the general alarm.
Off to the deck!

1259
01:36:24,223 --> 01:36:25,781
What happened?
What happened?

1260
01:36:26,225 --> 01:36:27,453
Must be an air raid!

1261
01:36:27,527 --> 01:36:30,291
Submarine! Must be a submarine!

1262
01:36:30,396 --> 01:36:31,328
What happened?

1263
01:36:31,397 --> 01:36:33,228
-Submarine!
-Must be an air raid!

1264
01:36:40,707 --> 01:36:43,642
Secure that life raft!
He didn't say abandon ship!

1265
01:36:44,444 --> 01:36:47,902
All right, now, wait a minute!
Laundry detail report to forward gun!

1266
01:36:49,582 --> 01:36:51,209
l'm coming! Where's the gun?

1267
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:52,716
-lnsigna?
-Yeah.

1268
01:36:52,885 --> 01:36:54,614
Are you supposed to be up there?

1269
01:36:54,687 --> 01:36:56,678
Yeah. We was up here last year.

1270
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:59,255
Dowdy, where's my battle station?

1271
01:36:59,325 --> 01:37:02,089
l don't know where your battle station is.
Look around!

1272
01:37:03,129 --> 01:37:06,963
Ask a man politely where his battle station
is and he says, ''Look around! ''

1273
01:37:07,467 --> 01:37:09,435
Engine room manned and ready.

1274
01:37:09,535 --> 01:37:11,901
All battle stations manned and ready.

1275
01:37:11,971 --> 01:37:13,336
All except mine.

1276
01:37:15,942 --> 01:37:18,342
All battle stations manned and ready,
Captain.

1277
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:40,829
All right. Who did it?

1278
01:37:42,535 --> 01:37:44,025
Who did it?

1279
01:37:44,971 --> 01:37:50,273
You are going to stand sweating at those
battle stations until someone confesses!

1280
01:37:51,511 --> 01:37:53,945
It's an insult to the honor of this ship.

1281
01:37:55,214 --> 01:37:58,183
The symbol of our cargo record
has been destroyed...

1282
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:03,213
...and l'm going to find out who did it
if it takes all night!

1283
01:38:03,956 --> 01:38:06,618
Symbol of our cargo record. What's that?

1284
01:38:06,759 --> 01:38:08,192
l don't know.

1285
01:38:20,706 --> 01:38:23,197
Stefanowski, find some battle station.

1286
01:38:28,614 --> 01:38:31,276
-The palm tree's gone.
-Hey, come on, come on!

1287
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:34,581
-The palm tree. The palm tree's gone.
-The palm tree's gone.

1288
01:38:37,457 --> 01:38:39,084
Read me that master list.

1289
01:38:41,727 --> 01:38:42,751
Abernathy.

1290
01:38:42,962 --> 01:38:44,190
No, not Abernathy.

1291
01:38:44,263 --> 01:38:45,389
-Baker.
-No.

1292
01:39:05,685 --> 01:39:07,585
-O'Neill.
-No, not O'Neill.

1293
01:39:08,221 --> 01:39:09,245
Pulver.

1294
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:17,652
Pulver wouldn't have the guts.
Go on, go on.

1295
01:39:18,231 --> 01:39:19,323
Roberts.

1296
01:39:21,033 --> 01:39:23,524
Roberts! That's the one!

1297
01:39:24,403 --> 01:39:27,463
Get him up here. Get him up here,
right now! Get him up here!

1298
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:28,939
Mr. Roberts will report...

1299
01:39:29,008 --> 01:39:31,169
...to the Captain's cabin on the double.

1300
01:39:40,152 --> 01:39:43,121
Mr. Roberts will report
to the Captain's cabin on the double.

1301
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:44,349
Give me that!

1302
01:39:45,558 --> 01:39:48,891
Roberts! Roberts, you get up here
in one quick hurry!

1303
01:39:49,362 --> 01:39:52,525
Roberts, get a move on.
I'm giving you an order!

1304
01:39:52,798 --> 01:39:54,265
Do you hear me, Roberts?

1305
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:58,895
This is it. You get a move on
and get up here, or this is finally...

1306
01:39:59,171 --> 01:40:02,868
...finally the showdown. We are going
to have it out right here and now.

1307
01:40:03,209 --> 01:40:05,939
Do you hear, Roberts?
Get up here now!

1308
01:40:06,779 --> 01:40:08,144
You want to see me, Captain?

1309
01:40:08,214 --> 01:40:11,513
You did it! Don't stand there and lie to me.
Confess it!

1310
01:40:14,654 --> 01:40:16,986
Confess what? l don't know
what you're talking about.

1311
01:40:17,056 --> 01:40:19,581
You know what l'm talking about
because you did it!

1312
01:40:19,992 --> 01:40:23,086
You've double-crossed me!
You've gone back on your word!

1313
01:40:23,329 --> 01:40:24,159
No, I haven't, Captain.

1314
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:28,223
Oh, yes, you have! Yes, you have.
I kept my part of the bargain.

1315
01:40:28,401 --> 01:40:31,996
I gave this crew liberty!
I gave this crew liberty...

1316
01:40:32,204 --> 01:40:34,195
...but you've gone back on your word.

1317
01:40:34,373 --> 01:40:36,364
You promised me on your word of honor!

1318
01:40:36,642 --> 01:40:39,907
I kept my word. I haven't written
any more letters.

1319
01:40:42,281 --> 01:40:45,273
l'm not talking about your stinking letters.

1320
01:40:45,651 --> 01:40:47,619
l'm talking about what you did tonight!

1321
01:40:47,687 --> 01:40:51,054
Tonight? l don't understand you, Captain.
What do you think l did tonight?

1322
01:40:51,123 --> 01:40:52,522
You know what you did!

1323
01:40:54,226 --> 01:40:55,887
You stabbed me in the back!

1324
01:40:57,263 --> 01:40:58,730
You stabbed me in the--

1325
01:41:07,974 --> 01:41:12,274
Will the Doctor please report
to the Captain's cabin on the double!

1326
01:41:19,285 --> 01:41:23,244
Will the doctor please report
to the Captain's cabin on the double!

1327
01:41:30,863 --> 01:41:32,888
Hey, Lindstrom, where is the old man?

1328
01:41:33,065 --> 01:41:35,363
He's sittin' in a chair, leaning way forward.

1329
01:41:35,635 --> 01:41:36,932
What's the Doc doing?

1330
01:41:37,069 --> 01:41:39,037
Doc's holding a wastebasket.

1331
01:41:39,138 --> 01:41:40,298
What wastebasket?

1332
01:41:40,439 --> 01:41:42,464
The one the old man's got his head in.

1333
01:41:44,377 --> 01:41:45,844
There he goes again!

1334
01:41:46,979 --> 01:41:48,446
They got him to the couch.

1335
01:41:50,683 --> 01:41:52,014
That's it.

1336
01:41:53,185 --> 01:41:56,882
Now we mustn't let ourselves
get angry, Captain.

1337
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:59,487
We know that, don't we?

1338
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:12,637
Look out, here they come.

1339
01:42:16,409 --> 01:42:18,536
We'll not need the stretcher now.
Sorry.

1340
01:42:20,146 --> 01:42:21,170
Chief?

1341
01:42:22,615 --> 01:42:23,604
Yes, sir.

1342
01:42:23,816 --> 01:42:26,717
Pass the word to the men
to secure from general quarters.

1343
01:42:32,024 --> 01:42:33,286
See you later.

1344
01:42:36,128 --> 01:42:39,097
Now hear this! Now hear this!

1345
01:42:39,298 --> 01:42:41,129
Secure from general quarters.

1346
01:42:46,172 --> 01:42:47,696
Good night, Mr. Roberts.

1347
01:42:48,074 --> 01:42:49,905
Good night, Reber.

1348
01:43:41,227 --> 01:43:43,923
Okay, Mr. Roberts. l'll take these down
to the gangway.

1349
01:43:43,996 --> 01:43:48,092
The boat from the island should be out
here any minute for you. l'll let you know.

1350
01:43:48,334 --> 01:43:49,926
Never thought you'd be taking this trip,
did you?

1351
01:43:50,002 --> 01:43:52,334
l'll be off this bucket before l even wake up.

1352
01:43:52,505 --> 01:43:54,473
They're flying you all the way
to the Livingston?

1353
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:58,237
l don't know. Dispatch said,
''Transfer, travel by air, if possible.''

1354
01:43:58,544 --> 01:44:00,637
They're landing planes at Okinawa now.

1355
01:44:00,713 --> 01:44:03,113
That's where my can's
probably running around.

1356
01:44:04,049 --> 01:44:07,246
Okinawa?
You be mighty careful, Doug boy.

1357
01:44:09,789 --> 01:44:12,781
Doc, l even got a destroyer:
the Livingston.

1358
01:44:13,259 --> 01:44:15,989
l know a guy on the Livingston.
He don't think it's so hot.

1359
01:44:16,061 --> 01:44:19,189
Here your are, Mr. Roberts. l typed up
three copies of the radio dispatch.

1360
01:44:19,265 --> 01:44:21,733
l have to keep one copy
and here's two for you.

1361
01:44:22,101 --> 01:44:26,936
You are now officially detached
from this here bucket. Let me be the first.

1362
01:44:29,041 --> 01:44:31,771
How about these orders?
l haven't sent in a letter for a month.

1363
01:44:31,844 --> 01:44:33,971
Listen, l can tell you exactly
how that happened.

1364
01:44:34,046 --> 01:44:37,573
You see, those guys in Washington
need men awful bad for combat duty.

1365
01:44:37,817 --> 01:44:39,478
They lookinged through
some of the old letters...

1366
01:44:39,552 --> 01:44:41,315
...and come across one of yours.

1367
01:44:41,453 --> 01:44:45,082
Listen, we can't stand here
beating our gums. The old man says:

1368
01:44:45,658 --> 01:44:49,526
''lf he ain't out of here in one hour,
l'll throw him off! ''

1369
01:44:50,129 --> 01:44:52,029
-ls that all he said?
-That's all he said.

1370
01:44:52,097 --> 01:44:55,533
After fighting this thing for two years,
you'd think he'd say more than that.

1371
01:44:55,601 --> 01:44:59,867
Guard, I don't want no man closer
than ten feet! Understand?

1372
01:45:00,506 --> 01:45:01,438
What's that?

1373
01:45:01,674 --> 01:45:04,302
A new botanical garden.
Ain't you heard?

1374
01:45:05,477 --> 01:45:08,844
When we anchored this morning,
he sent Olsen out with a special detail.

1375
01:45:08,914 --> 01:45:10,347
Dug up a new palm tree.

1376
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:15,213
He's already set a 24-hour watch on that
new baby, with orders to shoot to kill!

1377
01:45:16,055 --> 01:45:19,684
That reminds me, Ensign Pulver,
the Captain wants to see you right away.

1378
01:45:20,125 --> 01:45:21,888
-What about?
-l don't know, sir.

1379
01:45:22,027 --> 01:45:25,724
l'll come back to say good-bye later,
Mr. Roberts. Come on, Ensign Pulver.

1380
01:45:26,332 --> 01:45:29,529
l bet those guys down in the laundry
starched his pajamas again!

1381
01:45:32,371 --> 01:45:34,464
-You're pretty happy, aren't you?
-Yep.

1382
01:45:34,773 --> 01:45:37,037
You're happy about it, too, aren't you, Doc?

1383
01:45:37,376 --> 01:45:39,276
l think it's the only thing for you.

1384
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,009
What do you think of the crew now?

1385
01:45:43,082 --> 01:45:45,243
They're all right. They're nice guys.

1386
01:45:47,219 --> 01:45:49,050
How do you think they feel about you?

1387
01:45:49,121 --> 01:45:52,147
They like me well enough,
till the next guy comes along.

1388
01:45:53,058 --> 01:45:55,117
You don't think you're necessary to them?

1389
01:45:55,194 --> 01:45:57,754
Doc, no officer is necessary to a crew.

1390
01:45:59,265 --> 01:46:01,597
Are you going to leave this ship
believing that?

1391
01:46:01,667 --> 01:46:02,895
lt's nothing against them, Doc.

1392
01:46:02,968 --> 01:46:06,495
They're too busy lookin' out for themselves
to worry about anybody else.

1393
01:46:07,273 --> 01:46:09,741
Well, take a good, deep breath, Buster.

1394
01:46:14,013 --> 01:46:16,413
What do you think got you your orders?

1395
01:46:16,815 --> 01:46:20,012
Prayer and fasting?
Sending in enough box tops?

1396
01:46:20,653 --> 01:46:22,883
Dolan said one of my old letters turned up.

1397
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:26,587
This crew got you transferred.

1398
01:46:27,192 --> 01:46:29,558
They were so busy
thinking about themselves...

1399
01:46:29,628 --> 01:46:33,894
...that they took a chance of landing
in prison for five years, every one of them.

1400
01:46:34,934 --> 01:46:38,802
You couldn't send in a letter for transfer,
so they sent one in for you.

1401
01:46:39,672 --> 01:46:41,799
They knew the Captain wouldn't
sign it approved...

1402
01:46:41,874 --> 01:46:44,536
...so they didn't bother him.
They signed it for him.

1403
01:46:45,077 --> 01:46:47,136
Doc, what do you mean?
They forged the Captain's name?

1404
01:46:47,212 --> 01:46:48,543
That's it exactly.

1405
01:46:51,684 --> 01:46:54,016
lt was quite a thing to see, Doug...

1406
01:46:54,353 --> 01:46:56,787
...the Captain's name-signing contest.

1407
01:46:56,989 --> 01:46:59,685
Every man in the crew trying his best...

1408
01:46:59,925 --> 01:47:02,951
...to copy that little scrawl of the Captain's.

1409
01:47:04,296 --> 01:47:07,026
Then the judges decided the winner.

1410
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:11,193
At the time, there was some criticism
of their decision...

1411
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:13,636
...on the grounds that the judges
were drunk.

1412
01:47:14,273 --> 01:47:17,401
But apparently from the results,
they chose pretty well.

1413
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:20,305
How did you find out about it?

1414
01:47:21,547 --> 01:47:23,208
Well, it was a great honor.

1415
01:47:24,917 --> 01:47:27,112
l'm the only officer aboard who knows.

1416
01:47:28,787 --> 01:47:30,118
l was a contestant.

1417
01:47:31,056 --> 01:47:32,546
l was also a judge.

1418
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:37,554
This double honor was accorded me
because of my character...

1419
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:40,023
...charm, good looks...

1420
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,830
...and because the medical department
contributed...

1421
01:47:43,969 --> 01:47:46,995
...four gallons of grain alcohol
to the contest.

1422
01:47:50,676 --> 01:47:52,735
Who won? Who signed it?

1423
01:47:55,047 --> 01:47:58,847
l'm not at liberty to say.
Basically, they all did.

1424
01:47:59,985 --> 01:48:02,283
And with just one idea in mind:

1425
01:48:03,622 --> 01:48:05,988
To do something for Mr. Roberts.

1426
01:48:10,896 --> 01:48:12,454
l wish you hadn't told me.

1427
01:48:15,167 --> 01:48:17,863
lt makes me look pretty silly
after what l just said.

1428
01:48:19,772 --> 01:48:21,330
But l didn't mean it, Doc.

1429
01:48:22,841 --> 01:48:25,002
l was afraid to say what l really feel.

1430
01:48:26,979 --> 01:48:28,446
l love those guys.

1431
01:48:30,082 --> 01:48:32,607
l think they're the greatest guys
on this Earth.

1432
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:38,320
All of a sudden l feel there's something
terribly wrong about leaving them.

1433
01:48:40,826 --> 01:48:42,293
What can l say to them?

1434
01:48:42,828 --> 01:48:45,023
Nothing. You don't know about it.

1435
01:48:47,066 --> 01:48:51,969
After you're safely aboard your new ship
l'm supposed to write and tell you about it.

1436
01:48:53,839 --> 01:48:56,239
At the bottom of the letter l'm to say:

1437
01:48:57,743 --> 01:48:59,973
''Thanks for the liberty, Mr. Roberts.

1438
01:49:02,014 --> 01:49:03,777
''Thanks for everything.''

1439
01:49:29,241 --> 01:49:31,334
l'm the new cargo officer.

1440
01:49:32,978 --> 01:49:36,004
And that ain't all. l've gotta have dinner
with him tonight.

1441
01:49:36,215 --> 01:49:37,239
He likes me!

1442
01:49:39,251 --> 01:49:40,240
Come in.

1443
01:49:41,553 --> 01:49:42,281
What's that?

1444
01:49:42,354 --> 01:49:45,084
Fire and rescue party!
We heard you had a fire in here.

1445
01:49:45,491 --> 01:49:46,685
No, but as long as you're here--

1446
01:49:46,758 --> 01:49:51,195
A false alarm, then? ln that case,
we might as well drink this stuff.

1447
01:49:53,565 --> 01:49:56,125
What's in that?
A new batch of jungle juice?

1448
01:49:56,668 --> 01:49:58,863
ln the handy new portable container.

1449
01:50:15,654 --> 01:50:16,848
Everybody loaded?

1450
01:50:17,055 --> 01:50:19,615
All right, you guys, you can come in now.

1451
01:50:29,902 --> 01:50:31,062
What is it?

1452
01:50:32,271 --> 01:50:33,238
Open it.

1453
01:50:39,311 --> 01:50:40,710
What is it, Doug?

1454
01:50:45,717 --> 01:50:47,275
lt's a palm tree, see.

1455
01:50:47,619 --> 01:50:49,553
lt was Dowdy's idea.

1456
01:50:50,556 --> 01:50:53,320
Mannion made it.
He cut it out of sheet brass.

1457
01:50:53,625 --> 01:50:55,422
Mannion drew the words on it, too.

1458
01:50:55,494 --> 01:50:57,189
Stefanowski thought up the words.

1459
01:50:57,262 --> 01:51:01,062
Booksie gets credit for the ribbon, from
a box of candy he got from his mother.

1460
01:51:02,868 --> 01:51:06,304
Read the words, Mr. Roberts.

1461
01:51:08,373 --> 01:51:09,772
''Order of....''

1462
01:51:22,821 --> 01:51:24,516
''Order of the Palm.

1463
01:51:25,157 --> 01:51:27,682
''To Lieutenant J.G. Douglas Roberts.

1464
01:51:28,527 --> 01:51:33,328
''For action against the enemy,
above and beyond the call of duty.''

1465
01:51:40,772 --> 01:51:43,366
lt's very nice,
but l think you've got the wrong guy.

1466
01:51:43,909 --> 01:51:46,434
We know, sir.
But we'd like you to have it anyway.

1467
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,047
Okay, l'll keep it.

1468
01:51:50,249 --> 01:51:52,217
Stefanowski thought up the words.

1469
01:51:53,151 --> 01:51:54,311
They're fine words.

1470
01:51:55,787 --> 01:51:58,119
The boat's here, Mr. Roberts.
l put your gear in.

1471
01:51:58,190 --> 01:52:00,090
They want to shove off right away.

1472
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:10,498
-We haven't had our drink yet.
-No, sir.

1473
01:52:11,036 --> 01:52:14,199
You won't get any jungle juice
aboard that destroyer, Mr. Roberts.

1474
01:52:14,673 --> 01:52:16,004
That's right, Dowdy.

1475
01:52:27,519 --> 01:52:30,283
Good-bye, Doc. And thanks.

1476
01:52:31,290 --> 01:52:34,191
Good-bye, Frank.
Remember, l'm counting on you!

1477
01:53:29,081 --> 01:53:31,948
Mail call will be
on the forward hatch immediately.

1478
01:53:40,892 --> 01:53:43,417
Newspapers. Eight weeks old.

1479
01:53:46,798 --> 01:53:50,666
Ensign Pulver, we just heard.
No movies again tonight!

1480
01:53:51,169 --> 01:53:51,965
Why not?

1481
01:53:52,037 --> 01:53:56,201
He said we was making too much noise.
We wasn't making too much noise.

1482
01:53:56,808 --> 01:53:58,400
Talk to him, will you, Ensign Pulver?

1483
01:53:58,477 --> 01:54:01,537
What me? To the Captain? Yeah.

1484
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:06,849
-Bookser?
-Yes, sir.

1485
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:08,916
-Lindstrom?
-Yes, sir.

1486
01:54:09,354 --> 01:54:10,981
-Dolan?
-Here, sir.

1487
01:54:11,223 --> 01:54:13,453
-Stefanowski?
-Right here, sir.

1488
01:54:24,536 --> 01:54:27,300
My mother, all she ever says is,
''Stay away from Japan.''

1489
01:54:28,573 --> 01:54:29,597
What's your news, Doc?

1490
01:54:32,077 --> 01:54:34,637
My wife got some new wallpaper
for the living room.

1491
01:54:36,848 --> 01:54:37,837
Pretty.

1492
01:54:42,687 --> 01:54:43,745
Alabama.

1493
01:54:44,856 --> 01:54:46,653
l shall read that one later.

1494
01:54:47,993 --> 01:54:50,461
-Hey, Doc. This is from Doug.
-Yeah?

1495
01:54:50,529 --> 01:54:51,860
What does he say?

1496
01:54:51,930 --> 01:54:55,195
Hey, you guys. You want to hear a letter
from Mr. Roberts?

1497
01:55:01,206 --> 01:55:02,468
''Dear Frank....

1498
01:55:03,175 --> 01:55:05,541
''This will be short and sweet...

1499
01:55:06,044 --> 01:55:08,706
''...as we're shoving off
in about two minutes.''

1500
01:55:09,714 --> 01:55:11,773
This was dated three weeks ago.

1501
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:13,581
Does he say where he is?

1502
01:55:13,652 --> 01:55:17,315
Yeah, he says, ''My guess about
the location of this ship is exactly right.''

1503
01:55:17,389 --> 01:55:19,357
That means he's around Okinawa.

1504
01:55:23,161 --> 01:55:25,254
He met Fornell.

1505
01:55:25,964 --> 01:55:28,524
That friend of mine, guy named Fornell
l went to college with?

1506
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,862
This is what he says:

1507
01:55:30,035 --> 01:55:34,199
''Fornell says that you and he used
to load up your car with liquor in Omaha...

1508
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:38,106
''...and sell it at an indecent profit
to the fraternity boys at lowa city.''

1509
01:55:38,176 --> 01:55:39,507
''How about that?''

1510
01:55:40,011 --> 01:55:41,205
We did, too!

1511
01:55:43,281 --> 01:55:45,647
''This part is for Doc. l've been....''

1512
01:55:46,184 --> 01:55:48,675
Go ahead and read it. lt's for both of us.

1513
01:55:49,354 --> 01:55:53,347
''Doc, l've been aboard this destroyer
for two weeks now...

1514
01:55:53,425 --> 01:55:56,394
''...and we've already been through
four air attacks.

1515
01:55:56,761 --> 01:55:58,729
''l'm in the war at last, Doc!

1516
01:55:59,164 --> 01:56:02,190
''l've caught up with that task force
that passed me by.

1517
01:56:02,667 --> 01:56:06,262
''l'm glad to be here.
l had to be here, l guess.

1518
01:56:06,872 --> 01:56:10,205
''But l'm thinking now of you, Doc,
and you, Frank.

1519
01:56:10,775 --> 01:56:15,474
''And Dolan, and Dowdy, and lnsigna
and everyone else on that bucket.

1520
01:56:16,314 --> 01:56:20,774
''All the guys everywhere who sail
from Tedium to Apathy...

1521
01:56:21,453 --> 01:56:25,651
''...and back again,
with an occasional side trip to Monotony.

1522
01:56:27,192 --> 01:56:30,992
''This is a tough crew on here,
and they have a wonderful battle record.

1523
01:56:32,097 --> 01:56:35,828
''But l've discovered, Doc,
that the unseen enemy of this war...

1524
01:56:36,201 --> 01:56:39,261
''...is the boredom
that eventually becomes a faith...

1525
01:56:40,238 --> 01:56:43,002
''...and, therefore, a terrible sort of suicide.

1526
01:56:43,942 --> 01:56:47,469
''l know now that the ones
who refuse to surrender to it...

1527
01:56:47,946 --> 01:56:49,914
''...are the strongest of all.

1528
01:56:50,749 --> 01:56:54,241
''Right now l'm looking at something
that's hanging over my desk.

1529
01:56:54,753 --> 01:56:56,812
''A preposterous hunk of brass...

1530
01:56:56,888 --> 01:57:00,483
''...attached to the most bilious piece
of ribbon l've ever seen.

1531
01:57:00,926 --> 01:57:04,191
''l'd rather have it
than the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1532
01:57:05,230 --> 01:57:07,960
''lt tells me what l'll always be proudest of:

1533
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:11,997
''That at a time in the world
when courage counted most...

1534
01:57:12,771 --> 01:57:15,535
''...l lived among 62 brave men.

1535
01:57:17,375 --> 01:57:22,039
''So, Doc, and especially you, Frank,
don't let those guys down.

1536
01:57:23,882 --> 01:57:27,283
''Of course l know that by this time
they must be very happy...

1537
01:57:27,519 --> 01:57:30,852
''...because the Captain's overhead
is filled with marbles.

1538
01:57:34,626 --> 01:57:38,756
''And here comes the mail orderly.
This has to go now. l'll finish it later.

1539
01:57:39,130 --> 01:57:42,429
''Meanwhile you guys can write too,
can't you? Doug.''

1540
01:57:43,602 --> 01:57:45,229
May l see that, Frank?

1541
01:57:46,671 --> 01:57:48,298
This one's from Fornell.

1542
01:57:49,674 --> 01:57:52,905
''l'd rather have it
than the Congressional Medal of Honor.''

1543
01:57:55,947 --> 01:57:58,381
Well, l'm glad he found that out.

1544
01:58:07,158 --> 01:58:08,625
What's the matter?

1545
01:58:13,398 --> 01:58:14,763
What's the matter?

1546
01:58:22,273 --> 01:58:24,002
Frank, what is it?

1547
01:58:29,748 --> 01:58:31,272
Mr. Roberts is dead.

1548
01:58:34,819 --> 01:58:36,309
This is from Fornell.

1549
01:58:37,722 --> 01:58:40,987
They took a Jap suicide plane
and killed everybody in a twin 40 battery...

1550
01:58:41,059 --> 01:58:43,459
...and went right on through
and killed Doug...

1551
01:58:43,728 --> 01:58:46,219
...and some other officer, in the wardroom.

1552
01:58:48,166 --> 01:58:50,498
They were drinking coffee when it hit.

1553
01:58:56,708 --> 01:58:57,800
Coffee?

1554
01:58:58,576 --> 01:59:02,444
Could l have that?
l'd like to post it for the crew.

1555
01:59:07,619 --> 01:59:10,782
Post this instead. lt's theirs.

1556
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:01,637
Yes, who is it?

1557
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:07,440
lt is l, Ensign Pulver, and l just threw
your stinkin' palm tree overboard.

1558
02:00:10,615 --> 02:00:13,743
Now what's all this crud
about no movie tonight?
