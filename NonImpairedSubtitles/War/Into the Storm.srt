1
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,978
"Then out spake brave Horatius,

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,811
The Captain of the Gate:

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,545
'To every man
upon this earth

4
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,007
Death cometh
soon or late.

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,147
And how can
man die better

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,715
Than facing
fearful odds,

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,695
For the ashes of his fathers,

8
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,493
And the temples of his gods?"'

9
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,651
This is the BBC Home Service.

10
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,552
The German army invaded
Holland and Belgium early this morning

11
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,489
by land and by landings
from parachute.

12
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,789
The armies
of the Low Countries are resisting.

13
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,527
An appeal for aid has been made
to the Allied governments

14
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,261
and Allied troops are
moving to their support.

15
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,429
His Majesty's government
and the French government

16
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,769
are taking immediate steps
to come to the assistance

17
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,536
of Holland and Belgium.

18
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,805
The Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain,

19
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,472
whose conduct of the war
has been roundly criticized,

20
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,071
has summoned leaders
of his party

21
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,276
to an emergency meeting
at 10 Downing Street.

22
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,343
Now I had hoped to remain

23
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,321
as prime minister through
the current crisis,

24
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,220
but I've just been told

25
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,657
that the Labour party
will not serve under me.

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,031
Therefore I shall
resign immediately.

27
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,625
One of you will lead
the new government.

28
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,933
Winston, would it be
possible for you

29
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,099
to discharge the duties
of minister of defense

30
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,336
under the direction
of Edward Halifax

31
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,775
as prime minister?

32
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,109
What is your opinion?

33
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,794
I think Winston would be
the better choice.

34
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,823
Yes, I think so too.

35
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,597
Huh.

36
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,571
Mr. Churchill has arrived, sir.

37
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,342
Thank you.

38
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,747
I feel very uneasy about this.

39
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:34,014
People say he's unreliable.
Is that true?

40
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,045
Impulsive, sir,
might be a kinder word.

41
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,287
If only it could've
been Lord Halifax.

42
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,294
He would've made
the most...

43
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,660
perfect prime minister.

44
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:48,064
- Perfect.
- At 4:35 this morning,

45
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,729
Hitler's troops invaded
Holland and Belgium

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,570
and the Luftwaffe has
been bombing airfields

47
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,098
all across Holland
and northern France.

48
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,976
Panzer divisions are
moving through Luxembourg

49
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,844
towards the Belgium frontier.

50
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,372
Our troops and the French
are marching north

51
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,248
to block the German advance.

52
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,483
- How many of our men?
- All of them.

53
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,251
The entire army.

54
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,356
It's an extraordinary coincidence...

55
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,055
Hitler attacking the west

56
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,859
and you becoming prime minister
all on the same day.

57
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,866
Could be coincidence, sir.

58
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,561
Could be destiny.

59
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,597
And what happens if we fail

60
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,835
to stop Hitler in Belgium?

61
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,403
One must assume
he'll go for France.

62
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,472
Just 21 miles.

63
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,314
Is that enough to save us?

64
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,272
...with the chief of
the Imperial general staff.

65
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,605
At 10:00, telephone call
to the French prime minister.

66
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,042
Mr. Attlee at 10:30.

67
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,602
Cabinet photograph at 11:00.

68
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,848
- Sawyers.
- Sir.

69
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,879
A further meeting
of the War Cabinet at 5:00.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,548
Drinks with
Lord Beaverbrook at 6:30,

71
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,921
then dinner with Mr. Bracken,
Sir John Anderson

72
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,825
- and the Duff Coopers.
- And what about my sleep?

73
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,556
Sleep, sir?

74
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,123
I need at least one hour's
unbroken sleep in the afternoon,

75
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,658
otherwise I can't function...
sleep and a bath.

76
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,568
You'd better call
the second meeting

77
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,401
of the War Cabinet
for 11:00 tonight.

78
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,170
- Yes, sir.
- Colville... is that right?

79
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,803
- Yes, sir.
- Related to Lord Crewe?

80
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,780
- My grandfather.
- Mmm, give him my greetings.

81
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,407
I met my wife at his house
on Curzon Street.

82
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,886
It is my intention to form
a national government,

83
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,980
a grand coalition of all parties

84
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,888
united for the duration
of the war.

85
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,588
Conservatives and Labour
are equal partners.

86
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,062
And as leader
of the Labour party,

87
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,895
you shall be my deputy.

88
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,993
I shall be both prime minister
and the minister of defense.

89
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,199
We have a heavy burden
to carry, my dear Attlee.

90
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,605
People trust us.

91
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,201
We must tell them the truth.

92
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,235
We must never let them down.

93
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,043
If you could go to the middle, sir, with
the Conservative ministers on the right

94
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,209
- and the Labour ministers on the left.
- No no, that's all wrong.

95
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,947
This is a national government.
The photograph must reflect that.

96
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,150
Attlee, sit here next to me.

97
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,784
Come along, everyone.

98
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,953
Halifax, sit next to Attlee.

99
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,257
Hurry up.

100
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,235
Gentlemen.

101
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,237
The latest reports indicate

102
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:49,230
that the Germans are advancing
rapidly towards Calais.

103
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,334
The main thrust was
through here... the Ardennes.

104
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:55,143
We were trying to stem
the invasion of Belgium to the north.

105
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,313
We've been outmaneuvered,
gentlemen.

106
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,682
So that means
our troops are cut off?

107
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,951
- Yes, sir.
- And we can't link up

108
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,548
to the main French force
to the south?

109
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,058
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid that's correct.

110
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,364
If the German advance
cannot be stopped,

111
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,764
we might have to order
our troops back to England.

112
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,860
The question is,

113
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,633
365,000 men...

114
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,606
the entire British army...

115
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,734
how many can we get back?

116
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,535
Perhaps 50,000...

117
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,376
if we're lucky.

118
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,454
- Admiral Pound.
- Yes, sir?

119
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,117
As a precautionary measure,
the admiralty should assemble

120
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,092
as many small vessels as it can

121
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,186
in readiness
for a large-scale evacuation.

122
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,595
That's already in hand, sir.

123
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,861
Tugboats, yachts, fishing craft,

124
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,095
lighters, barges, pleasure boats...

125
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,865
everything must
be called into service.

126
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,168
Well, if we are forced to evacuate,

127
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,301
we must assume
the Germans will attempt to invade us

128
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,743
very shortly thereafter

129
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,373
beginning, one assumes,
with air attacks.

130
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,111
Unrestricted air attacks

131
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,982
aimed at breaking public morale.

132
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,919
They'd also try to starve us

133
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,014
by attacking shipping and ports.

134
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,254
- True.
- Invasion would follow.

135
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,261
What about tanks?
How many have we got with the army?

136
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,456
- How many are being made?
- The plan is to evacuate

137
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,864
women and children
from southern coastal towns.

138
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,265
Sounds a bit extreme.

139
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,166
The PM wants to know
how much mustard gas we have.

140
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,694
I had a chat with
the Italian ambassador.

141
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,570
He made it clear

142
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,872
that if we were
to approach his government,

143
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,778
with a view to discussing
a general European settlement,

144
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,113
- we would not be rebuffed.
- What exactly does he mean by that?

145
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,711
That Mussolini is prepared
to act as an intermediary

146
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,722
between us,
the French and Hitler.

147
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,850
Any hint of negotiation would
destroy the morale of our people.

148
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,953
I think perhaps not
in the present circumstances.

149
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,590
The ambassador was
most conciliatory...

150
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,499
not all all extreme,
very well-mannered.

151
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,595
Of course, they would expect
something in exchange.

152
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,402
- Oh, of course.
- Such as what?

153
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,032
Malta, perhaps.

154
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,940
Gibraltar.

155
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,002
Perhaps Uganda.

156
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,016
Winston?

157
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,418
My dear Edward,

158
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,979
if I thought we could get out
of our present difficulties

159
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,357
by giving up Malta, Gibraltar
or a few of the African colonies,

160
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,021
I'd jump at it,

161
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,656
but Hitler cannot be trusted.

162
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,563
No point in talking
with the Eyeties.

163
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,296
The French are very keen
we should give it a try.

164
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,769
To hell with the French.

165
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,999
If they're not prepared to fight,
let them give up.

166
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,203
I will not allow this country to be
dragged down a slippery slope.

167
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,677
What is the point
of becoming a slave state?

168
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,647
Winston, for the love of God,
will you face facts?

169
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,981
We could lose a quarter
of a million men at Dunkirk.

170
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,953
Nations that
go down fighting rise up again.

171
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:52,116
Those that surrender tamely
are finished.

172
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,887
We cannot win this war

173
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,326
without a devastating loss
of life and resources.

174
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,095
Don't destroy everything
you most want to preserve.

175
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,639
This is the BBC Home Service.

176
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,801
Belgium has surrendered.

177
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:14,108
In preparation for invasion,
15 towns on the...

178
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,086
What's the matter?

179
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,954
I've been on the telephone
with General Gamelin.

180
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,900
Bloody French...
they're worse than useless.

181
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,597
"Where is your
strategic reserve?" I asked him.

182
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,540
"There is none," he said.
Can you believe it?

183
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,701
I despair.

184
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,115
Sometimes I despair.

185
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,710
Of course you do. If you didn't,
you wouldn't be human.

186
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,331
I was thinking about
the afternoon I delivered

187
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,424
my statement to the House.
Do you remember?

188
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,764
We came back here for tea.

189
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,738
There were some people
on the pavement outside...

190
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,833
- not many, five or six.
- I remember.

191
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,503
One of them was
a middle-aged man...

192
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,239
a shopkeeper perhaps,
or a bus driver.

193
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,009
He was full
of hope and trust.

194
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,812
"Good luck, Winnie," he said.

195
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,952
"God bless you."

196
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,888
- I mustn't let him down.
- You won't.

197
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,515
I might.

198
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,760
Halifax is no fool.

199
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,060
What he says is full
of wisdom and good sense.

200
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,963
I hear his voice,

201
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,896
but the face I see

202
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,134
is that man outside #10.

203
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:56,146
Whether it was part of my duty

204
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,616
to consider entering

205
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,677
into negotiations with Herr Hitler...

206
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,316
but it's idle to think
we'd get better terms

207
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,052
than if we fought it out.

208
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,126
And I'm convinced
that every man of you

209
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,564
would rise up

210
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,364
and tear me down
from my place

211
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,928
if I were for one moment

212
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,439
to contemplate

213
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,999
- parley or surrender.
- Yes.

214
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,638
If this long island history of ours

215
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,172
is to end at last,

216
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,708
let it end

217
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,812
only when each one of us

218
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,291
lies choking in his own blood
upon the ground.

219
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,555
Hear hear!

220
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,060
Hear hear!

221
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,669
Hear hear!

222
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,421
"Early today,
the prime minister,

223
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,126
his wife, his youngest daughter

224
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,000
and members of his personal staff
flew to Bordeaux...

225
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,504
his first trip abroad
since the end of the war.

226
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,440
After a hectic month
of electioneering,

227
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,239
Mr. Churchill has gone away
for a well-deserved holiday."

228
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,803
- "Well-deserved" is right.
- "The election results

229
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,577
will not be announced
until July the 26th.

230
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,641
And although
Mr. Churchill is expected to win,

231
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,209
the outcome is
by no means certain."

232
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,221
Oh, this is bad news.
I don't want to hear it.

233
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,156
"A poll in 'The Daily Express' says
the Conservatives will win,

234
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,355
whereas 'The News Chronicle'
predicts a Labour victory."

235
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,091
I don't want
your father to see that.

236
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,408
The big, unanswerable
question is

237
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,208
how the servicemen voted.

238
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,343
We allow three weeks to enable

239
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,251
the servicemen abroad to cast
their votes, and nobody foresaw

240
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,255
how crucial
those votes might be,

241
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,655
- least of all me.
- Just stop worrying about the election.

242
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,991
- Try to relax.
- Well, it's not my fault, Clemmie.

243
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,623
- I didn't want this blasted election.
- I know. I know that.

244
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,033
Why don't you try
some painting this afternoon?

245
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,267
Oh, I'll have forgotten
how to do it.

246
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,004
Oh, of course you haven't.

247
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,604
- It's like riding a bicycle.
- Riding a bicycle?

248
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,048
- Or swimming.
- What on earth are you talking about?

249
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,915
Once you can do it,
you don't forget.

250
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,987
- Do try, please.
- Well, I might.

251
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,255
Where's the money coming from?
That's what I'd like to know.

252
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,460
For us, I mean, in the unlikely event
of the Labour party winning.

253
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,990
They won't win.
No one thinks they'll win.

254
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,060
We can't live on an MP's salary

255
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,004
Impossible.
Where's the money coming from?

256
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,031
Writing. Surely you're bound
to get lots of offers.

257
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,600
And pay 19/6
in the pound income tax?

258
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,237
Not bloody likely!

259
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,078
A blasted welfare state...
who wants it?

260
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,279
Country can't afford it.
Don't they realize that?

261
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,186
We did not fight
this damn war

262
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,782
so the Labour party
could take over

263
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,452
and destroy everything
we believe in.

264
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,995
What about
the First Sea Lord?

265
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,026
Has he responded
to my memorandum?

266
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,833
Yes, sir. He telephoned earlier,
but you were in a meeting.

267
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,432
I believe he spoke to Robert.

268
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,500
Robert?
Robert who, for God's sake?

269
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,739
Hard enough to know people
by their surnames,

270
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,805
Christian names make life
bloody impossible.

271
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,544
Yes, Pim?

272
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,213
Sir, Calais has fallen.

273
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,485
- Is this confirmed?
- Yes, sir.

274
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,186
The evacuation of our troops
from Dunkirk has begun.

275
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,217
Thank you, Pim.

276
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,957
Sir?

277
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,626
Sir, I have a boat moored
in the Isle of Wight.

278
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,295
I think I could be of use, sir,

279
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,500
if you could do without me
for three or four days.

280
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,506
- Do what you can, Pim.
- Sir.

281
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,180
We must prepare ourselves, sir.

282
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,557
The loss of life will
almost certainly be immense.

283
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,761
Tell Lord Gort

284
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,563
wounded men to be
evacuated last.

285
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,800
"A week ago today,
Mr. Speaker,

286
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,174
I feared it would
be my hard lot,

287
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,749
umm...

288
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,046
to announce the greatest
military disaster

289
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,488
in our long history.

290
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,689
The whole root, core

291
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,459
and brain
of the British army

292
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,627
seemed about to perish
upon the field

293
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:21,128
or to be led into
an ignominious captivity."

294
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,640
Give me it.

295
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,576
"An ignominious
and starving captivity.

296
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,074
Suddenly the scene
has changed...

297
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,781
the scene has cleared." Good.

298
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,781
"The crash and thunder has,
for the moment..."

299
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,021
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
The prime minister has asked

300
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,122
- not to be interrupted.
- "...but only for the moment...

301
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,395
died away.

302
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,958
The miracle of deliverance

303
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,402
achieved by valor,

304
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,338
by perseverance,

305
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,500
is manifest to us all.

306
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,567
And the Royal Navy,

307
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,238
with the help of countless
merchant seamen

308
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,512
and using nearly
1,000 ships of all kinds,

309
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:10,045
have carried
over 335,000 men

310
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,819
out of the jaws
of death and shame

311
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,190
to their native land.

312
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,662
We must be very careful

313
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,756
not to assign to this deliverance

314
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,495
the attributes of a victory.

315
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,800
Wars are not won
by evacuations.

316
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,740
Our thankfulness
at the escape

317
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,676
of our army
and so many men,

318
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,942
whose loved ones have passed
through an agonizing week

319
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,473
must not blind us to the fact

320
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,611
that what has happened
in France and Belgium

321
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,180
is a colossal military disaster.

322
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,462
We are told that
Herr Hitler has a plan

323
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,863
for invading
the British Isles.

324
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,027
This has often been
thought of before.

325
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,560
I have, myself,
full confidence

326
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,631
that if all do their duty,
if nothing is neglected,

327
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,665
and the best
arrangements are made,

328
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,144
as they are being made,

329
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,205
we shall
prove ourselves once more

330
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,410
able to defend
our island home,

331
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,750
to outlive
the menace of tyranny,

332
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,255
if necessary for years,

333
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,226
if necessary alone.

334
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,821
Even though
large tracts of Europe

335
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,889
and many old and famous
states have fallen

336
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,334
or may fall into
the grip of the Gestapo

337
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,862
and all the odious
apparatus of Nazi rule,

338
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,273
we shall not flag or fail.

339
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,073
We shall go on to the end.

340
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,343
We shall fight
on the seas and oceans.

341
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,647
We shall fight
with growing confidence

342
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,846
and growing strength
in the air.

343
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,185
We shall defend our island,

344
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,555
whatever the cost may be.

345
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,222
We shall fight on the beaches.

346
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,730
We shall fight
on the landing grounds.

347
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,563
We shall fight in the fields

348
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,125
and in the streets.

349
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,501
We shall fight in the hills.

350
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,802
We shall never surrender."

351
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,116
Sawyers!

352
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,105
Sorry, Clemmie.
I need my paints.

353
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,875
This fool left them
on the terrace.

354
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,314
Sorry, Mrs. Churchill,
I didn't realize...

355
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,875
Come along.
Come along.

356
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,547
- Why on earth did you put them here?
- It's such a nice view, sir.

357
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,078
I thought you might
like to paint it.

358
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,353
I'm the one who decides
what view to paint.

359
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,326
Mind your own
damn business!

360
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,457
- Where are the other paints?
- What other paints?

361
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,329
You've left half
of them behind.

362
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,494
For God's sakes, Sawyers,
who told you to bring only these?

363
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,696
I haven't touched
your paints, sir.

364
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,706
Where's the cobalt?
Where's the Hooker's green?

365
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,503
Where's the burnt sienna?

366
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,168
You've left everything at home!

367
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,573
You're an absolute
bloody fool, Sawyers!

368
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,221
Would you mind that picture,

369
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,452
for God's sakes?!

370
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,223
- Winston.
- We won't disturb you again.

371
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,662
- Promise.
- Winston, please.

372
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,498
- What is it?
- Please stop behaving like this.

373
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,560
- Like what?
- All this fuss about

374
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,071
a few tubes of paint.

375
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,672
Painting was your idea,
remember?

376
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,045
It will take my mind
off the election, apparently.

377
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,141
And you really mustn't speak
to Sawyers like that.

378
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,175
- Like what?
- How would you like to be shouted at?

379
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,086
- He doesn't mind.
- Of course he minds!

380
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,556
- Didn't you see his face?
- He takes it in his stride.

381
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,116
- He knows what I'm like.
- We'd be lost without Sawyers,

382
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,595
- and well you know it.
- Lost? What do you mean, lost?

383
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,758
- He's not going anywhere.
- Just treat him with respect, Winston.

384
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,360
- What are you talking about?
- You treat him like a servant!

385
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,599
- That's what he is!
- It's people like him who won the war!

386
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,766
I see. You're in one
of your left-wing moods.

387
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,799
God, you're a patronizing bully.

388
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,049
Prime Minister,
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

389
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,488
I'm sorry to disturb you
in the evening, sir.

390
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,794
- What's happened?
- The French have surrendered.

391
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:50,393
- We are alone?
- Yes, sir.

392
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,665
Arrangements have been made
for you, Her Majesty

393
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,332
and the princesses
to be evacuated from London.

394
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,036
We must consider when it would
be prudent to make such a move.

395
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,271
Do you think
an invasion is imminent?

396
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,542
It all depends
on air supremacy.

397
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,381
Hitler needs to control the air
before he launches an invasion,

398
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,410
but we are fully prepared
for any eventuality.

399
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,446
If Hitler uses poison gas,
we shall do the same.

400
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,220
We have the deadliest gasses
in the world...

401
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,523
mustard, anthrax.

402
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,222
Everything is tested
and ready for use.

403
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,662
When might it happen?

404
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,996
Anytime between now
and the end of September.

405
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,092
After that, the weather
and the tides will be against him.

406
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,137
The queen and I have
talked about this.

407
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,901
The children could not
possibly go without her,

408
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,379
she won't go without me

409
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,814
and I shall not leave London

410
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,783
under any circumstances.

411
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,820
Very well, sir.

412
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,054
There is something else.

413
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,649
Now that the French
have surrendered,

414
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,887
we must assume that their navy

415
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,089
will soon be in German hands.

416
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,563
That must not happen.

417
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,499
We must keep control
of the Mediterranean.

418
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,833
Without access to the Suez Canal

419
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,735
our oil supplies will be cut off,

420
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,467
which would of course
be disastrous.

421
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,943
I've told the French
they must continue to fight,

422
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,172
sail their ships to a British port

423
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,010
or scuttle the entire fleet.

424
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,142
If they accept none
of these choices,

425
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,052
I've ordered
Admiral Somerville

426
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,318
to bombard the French fleet
in the port of Oran.

427
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:22,224
We have to show the world,

428
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,228
and in particular
the United States,

429
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,856
that we mean to fight on.

430
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,872
Message from
Admiral Somerville, sir.

431
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,816
Since the deadline
has passed,

432
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,343
he's opened fire
on the French ships.

433
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,413
He says he's being
heavily engaged.

434
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,169
How many Frenchmen killed?

435
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,798
1200.

436
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,974
You know, when Joe Kennedy
came back from London

437
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:19,006
and delivered his considered
ambassadorial opinion

438
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,009
he said Winston Churchill
is a drunk,

439
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,715
a warmonger, a bully.

440
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,520
Joe Kennedy's an appeaser.
He's bound to say that.

441
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,424
True.

442
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,019
On the other hand,
to be fair to Joe

443
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,793
when I first met Winston,
I didn't like him either.

444
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,427
It was 20 years ago,

445
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,733
a big formal dinner in London.

446
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,998
He acted like a stinker.

447
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,906
The sort of British snob I detest.

448
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,039
But as I say,
that was 20 years ago.

449
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,208
And now?

450
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,480
He may be a drunk,
he may be a warmonger,

451
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,647
but he's certainly a fighter.

452
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,093
"Prime Minister to President,
personal and secret.

453
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,995
I trust you realize that
the voice and force

454
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,226
of the United States may
count for nothing

455
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,894
if they are withheld too long.

456
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,565
You may have a completely
subjugated Nazified Europe

457
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,166
established with
astonishing swiftness,

458
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,972
and the weight may be
more than we can bear.

459
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,503
We must ask therefore

460
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:26,142
for whatever help
and reinforcements you can provide

461
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,711
as a matter of life and death.

462
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,120
Mr. President,
with great respect

463
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,925
I must tell you that
in the long history of the world,

464
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,830
this is the thing
to do now."

465
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,502
Good morning, sir.

466
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,476
On your feet, gentlemen...
the prime minister!

467
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,616
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

468
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,284
Have you been in action today,
Flight Lieutenant?

469
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,555
No, sir.
B-flight did the early patrol.

470
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,824
- Not seen much trade since.
- How about you?

471
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,832
- How many Huns have you brought down?
- Four, sir, maybe five.

472
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,766
- I got two on Monday.
- Very good.

473
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,201
The next two days'll be crucial.

474
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,400
If Hitler wins the battle of the air,
he wins the Battle for Britain.

475
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,465
- It depends on you.
- Would you like a mug of tea, sir?

476
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,273
Good God, no!
My wife drinks that.

477
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,041
I'm sure we can find you

478
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,945
something stronger
in the officer's mess, sir.

479
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,143
I wouldn't like to get
anyone into trouble.

480
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,675
Seeing as it's you, sir,
I'm sure it'll be fine.

481
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,551
- Johnny Walker or Haig, sir?
- Scramble!

482
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,114
Angels Twelve
over Maidstone! Scramble!

483
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,526
Contact!

484
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,685
What reserves do we have?

485
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,888
There are none.

486
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,693
They're so young.

487
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,098
And so few of them.

488
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,331
And yet...

489
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,840
on these few young men,
these boys,

490
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:08,244
we are entrusting the future
of our entire nation and Empire.

491
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,977
Never has so much been owed
by so many to so few.

492
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,980
Make a note, Jock.

493
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:23,460
"Never on the field
of human conflict

494
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,794
has so much been owed
by so many

495
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,628
to so few."

496
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,134
I might use that later.

497
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,364
"The gratitude of every
home in our island

498
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,567
goes out to the British airmen who,
undaunted by odds,

499
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,042
are turning the tide
of the world war

500
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,637
by their prowess
and by their devotion.

501
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,876
Never in the field
of human conflict was so much

502
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,079
owed by so many
to so few."

503
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,884
Not bad, eh?

504
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,284
I gather you're making a fuss
about our southern area defenses,

505
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,090
- is that so?
- I wouldn't call it a fuss,

506
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,528
- Prime Minister.
- That's what I was told.

507
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,397
"Major General Montgomery's
been making a fuss,"

508
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,663
they said. I want to know why.

509
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,602
See for yourself, sir.

510
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,705
Sir.

511
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,371
Static guns...
what's the point of that?

512
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,077
It's absurd to try and defend
the coastline of England

513
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,177
with guns in static positions.

514
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,883
The Germans would bypass the whole
lot of them as they did in France.

515
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,017
What we need is mobility.

516
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,222
Might I remind you
that our army vehicles

517
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,197
are lying in heaps of charred wreckage
on the beaches of Dunkirk?

518
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,700
Busses! Plenty of busses
in the country after all.

519
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,725
My division should be given busses

520
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,068
and transported rapidly
to wherever they're needed.

521
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,039
Hmm.

522
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,838
What we have here
is worse than useless.

523
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,674
Your commanding officer

524
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,112
seems perfectly satisfied
with things as they are.

525
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,616
Well, he's wrong.

526
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,518
- He's wrong and you're right?
- Precisely so.

527
00:30:56,554 --> 00:31:00,251
And if he were here,
I would tell him so to his face.

528
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,926
Very well.
Busses you shall have.

529
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,591
Now that that matter is settled,
we'll have lunch.

530
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,430
And a drink. I'm sure you could
do with a drink, Major General.

531
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,767
I neither drink nor smoke
and am 100% fit.

532
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,069
Well, I both drink
and smoke and I'm 200% fit.

533
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,742
- Everything all right, Bunny?
- Yes, sir. Ready when you are.

534
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,374
Very good.
Come along, everyone.

535
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,511
What does a humble AT say to
the chief of the Imperial general staff?

536
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,079
- "Good luck" might be appropriate.
- I gather you're busy

537
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,990
- raising money for the war effort.
- I do what I can.

538
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,689
Mama's chairman of the Red Cross Appeal
Committee. We're very proud of her.

539
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,426
I never thought I'd be
married to a chairman.

540
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,559
One expects
she'll come downstairs

541
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,660
in a pin-striped suit
and MCC tie.

542
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,971
Come along, Brookie.
Come and sit here.

543
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,242
We have a film show
every weekend.

544
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,112
Special treat today...

545
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,447
my favorite film.
Best film ever made.

546
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,453
All right, Bunny.
Ready when you are.

547
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,512
Switch off
the light there, Jock.

548
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,928
Sorry. A silly joke.

549
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,658
Mary is quite right...

550
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,496
we're all very proud of you.

551
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,838
Ah!

552
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,239
"Alexander Korda presents"...

553
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,301
you see this?
A great friend of mine, Alex.

554
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,212
A brilliant fellow.
Has everybody got a drink?

555
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,115
- Do sit down, Winston.
- Right.

556
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,678
Lord Hood advised me
to instruct you...

557
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,057
instruct...

558
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,525
Quite all right, Captain.
I have no secrets from Lady Hamilton.

559
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,290
Your indecisive defeat
of the Danes...

560
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,197
Ah! Here he comes.

561
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,893
Here he comes now...

562
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,233
Nelson victorious after
the Battle of Copenhagen.

563
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,297
A peace with
Napoleon Bonaparte...

564
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,866
but, gentlemen, you will never
make peace with Napoleon!

565
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,074
He doesn't mean peace today.
He just wants...

566
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,911
Listen to what he has to say.
Damn clever.

567
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,941
- Winston!
- Substitute the name Hitler

568
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,977
for Napoleon
and you'll see what they're getting at.

569
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,886
- Shh!
...one purpose: to destroy our Empire!

570
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,948
- Clever stuff.
- Shh!

571
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,516
Napoleon can never be
master of the world...

572
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,529
- Very timely.
- Years ago I said the same thing.

573
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,463
I begged them,
I entreated them not to give way.

574
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,159
but they wouldn't listen to me
and they paid the price.

575
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,532
You cannot make peace
with dictators!

576
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,504
- England...
- Expects...

577
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,735
- That...
- Every...

578
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,834
Man...

579
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:36,176
Will do...

580
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,239
His...

581
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,250
Duty.

582
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,686
Here they come,
the buggers.

583
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,974
Hurry along, sir.
Hurry along, madam.

584
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:24,116
Ah! Clemmie,
do go down to my room.

585
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,130
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Where are you going?

586
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,756
- Back in a minute. Back in a minute.
- Winston!

587
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,630
Mrs. Churchill, please.

588
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,506
- Good evening, Mrs. Churchill.
- Good evening, Captain Pim.

589
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,644
Where's Winston going?

590
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,706
Up to the roof I'm afraid.
He likes to see what's going on.

591
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,320
I was looking at him
at dinner last night

592
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:03,356
and Winston was
full of plans and ideas.

593
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,665
He was telling jokes,
quoting poetry.

594
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,329
I thought
"He's like a little boy playing

595
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,399
an enormously elaborate game
of make-believe.

596
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,542
And to his great delight,
it's suddenly come true."

597
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,362
Who was that on the telephone?

598
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,364
Do you really want to know?

599
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:10,595
- I do.
- It was the local mayor

600
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,604
inviting us to an evening
of Basque folk dancing.

601
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,572
Oh God, how fearful.

602
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,073
- I hope you said no.
- I said yes.

603
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,236
Diplomacy, Winston.

604
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,939
Oh Lord.

605
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,503
Perhaps you should join in.

606
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,312
Be good for you...
a bit of exercise.

607
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,397
- Wing Commander Maddox?
- Yes, sir.

608
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,802
- Victoria Cross?
- Yes, sir.

609
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,035
"It is ordained that
the Victoria Cross

610
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,044
shall only be awarded

611
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,046
for most conspicuous bravery,

612
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,447
or some pre-eminent act of valor

613
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,713
or self-sacrifice
or extreme devotion to duty

614
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,515
in the presence
of the enemy."

615
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,882
Isn't that what it says
on the Royal Warrant?

616
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,391
Yes, sir.

617
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,195
The Battle of Britain
was won by men like you.

618
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,495
This country owes you

619
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,694
its life and liberty.

620
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,108
You feel very humble
and awkward

621
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,609
in my presence,
don't you?

622
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,168
Yes, sir.

623
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,612
Then you can imagine

624
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,312
how humble and awkward
I feel in yours.

625
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,649
- Good news from Bletchley.
- Sir?

626
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,458
The boffins have unbuttoned
a cipher message

627
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,330
from Berlin to the commander
of the 16th Army.

628
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:53,463
All invasion barges are to be returned
to their base in Germany.

629
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:57,270
- Excellent!
- Herr Hitler has left it too late.

630
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,798
Buggeration!

631
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,403
Can't invade now
till the spring.

632
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,107
Who knows what might happen
between now and them?

633
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,619
Shan't tell
Roosevelt just yet.

634
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,520
No, sir.

635
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,116
Don't want the Yanks
to think we're out of danger

636
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,559
- until we're sure we are.
- Tell them his name.

637
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,529
Puggy-wuggy.

638
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,996
You loved that little dog,
didn't you?

639
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,329
I adored him
when I was a little girl.

640
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,561
He walked awfully like Papa.

641
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,871
Well, when I was a boy,
I used to collect toy soldiers.

642
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,741
I had 1500 of them all arranged
on a long trestle table.

643
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:37,305
I organized battles,
invasions, entire wars.

644
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:41,546
I used to pretend I was the greatest
general the world had ever known,

645
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,314
and my brother Jack
always played the enemy.

646
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,549
- Excuse...
- One day my father came

647
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,149
into the nursery
and obviously impressed

648
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,854
with the orderly ranks
of my infantrymen,

649
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,353
"Would you like
to enter the army?" he said.

650
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,798
"Oh yes, sir," I said.
"That'd be splendid."

651
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,802
So off I went to Sandhurst.

652
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,827
Well, I thought
he'd sent me there

653
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:04,773
because he had discerned in me
qualities of military genius.

654
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,437
In fact, it was because he thought
I was too stupid for the bar.

655
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,173
Yes, Sawyers. What is it?

656
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,685
The Japanese have attacked
the Americans, sir.

657
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,211
- I've been listening on the wireless.
- What?!

658
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,917
Somewhere near Hawaii, sir.

659
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,518
God, why didn't
you say something?

660
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,529
I shall declare war on Japan.

661
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,292
- Excuse me.
- Yes yes.

662
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,356
Prime Minister,
you can't declare war

663
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,334
because of something you've
heard on the wireless.

664
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,836
Don't tell me
what to do, Colville!

665
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,838
If I want to declare war,
I'll bloody well declare it!

666
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,568
- Please, sir.
- Mr. President,

667
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,066
- what's all this about Japan?
- It's quite true.

668
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,307
They've attacked us
at Pearl Harbor.

669
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,441
We're all
in the same boat now.

670
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,816
This is momentous news,
Mr. President.

671
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,387
Tonight I shall sleep the sleep

672
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,553
of the saved and the thankful.

673
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,260
Where are you taking those?

674
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,964
Mr. Churchill wants
them pressed, madam.

675
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,769
He wants to take them
to Washington.

676
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,872
Is that all right, Mrs. Churchill?

677
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,505
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Sawyers.

678
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,615
When are you
going to Washington?

679
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,449
Thursday. Sorry... what?

680
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,456
- Winston.
- I didn't hear what you said.

681
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,924
- Of course you did.
- No need to be cross.

682
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,484
- I was going to tell you later.
- This is madness.

683
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,019
Winston, you'll make yourself ill.

684
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,429
I have to see the president.

685
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,093
Talk to him on the telephone.

686
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,931
I need to meet him face to face.

687
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,164
Why? You're exhausted.

688
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,571
You're working
16 hours a day. You cannot...

689
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,575
They have the men.
They have the resources.

690
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,578
So far we've managed
to avoid losing this damn war.

691
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,240
We cannot win it
without the Americans.

692
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,977
That's why.

693
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:05,359
Now, you know Winston's
going to America.

694
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,832
- Yes, I heard.
- I very much want you to go with him

695
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,925
as his doctor and his friend.

696
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,936
A bit difficult...
he hasn't asked me.

697
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,597
Well, he will.
I can arrange that.

698
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,368
Please. He needs someone
to look after him.

699
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,672
He's hopeless
with ordinary life...

700
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,541
hopeless. He knows
nothing about it.

701
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,547
Did you know
he's never been on a bus?

702
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,209
He's only been
on the Underground once...

703
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,945
that was during
the General Strike.

704
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,010
He went round and round
on the Circle line,

705
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,352
didn't know where to get off,
had to be rescued.

706
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,517
- Why don't you go with him?
- Oh, that wouldn't be a good idea.

707
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,083
More of a hindrance than a help.

708
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,617
I'm sure that's not true.

709
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,187
I think it is.

710
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,133
I'm afraid I'm not
the ideal wife for him.

711
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,965
I can't keep up with him.

712
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,664
I think you look after him
wonderfully well.

713
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:51,197
Do you?
That's very kind of you.

714
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,705
The point is,
he was born for this.

715
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,911
I wasn't and I have to cope
with that somehow.

716
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,578
I have to.

717
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,179
But some days, Charles,

718
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,316
I feel totally
and utterly exhausted.

719
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,696
All right.
I'll talk to Winston.

720
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,698
If it's helpful for me

721
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,563
to go with him to America,
then of course I'll go.

722
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,636
And you must
take care of yourself.

723
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,697
You need looking after too.

724
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,248
I'd been discussing
the situation with General Marshall.

725
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,556
He agrees with
your recommendation.

726
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,154
Our joint strategy
should be Europe first.

727
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,460
Good, I'm delighted to hear it.

728
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,467
The situation in the Pacific is

729
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,662
nowhere near as bad
as some people think.

730
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,763
Singapore is impregnable...
an island fortress.

731
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:59,742
I've got a first-class general
in control of the garrison.

732
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,904
You can rely on Singapore.

733
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,005
Good. Excellent.

734
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,642
Now regarding Europe...

735
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,653
it's my view we are
in no position

736
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,814
to even consider
an invasion this year.

737
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,449
- Agreed.
- Good man.

738
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,516
The Russians are
very unhappy.

739
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,687
One understands why,
of course...

740
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,560
the Red Army's
being butchered.

741
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,761
Stalin desperately needs
a second front.

742
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,564
I've told him
"This is impossible.

743
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,400
We don't have the men
or the equipment."

744
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,499
As you can see,
Mr. President,

745
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,407
I have nothing
to conceal from you.

746
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,049
My old schoolmaster,
Dr. Peabody,

747
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,849
taught us that
the trend of civilization

748
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:47,118
- is forever upward.
- Let's hope that's true.

749
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,126
I think it is.
He's been a great influence

750
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,219
throughout my entire life...
Dr. Peabody.

751
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:56,358
He once said
"To believe is to be strong.

752
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,028
Doubt cramps energy.

753
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,367
Belief is power."

754
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,570
Mmm.

755
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:08,669
My feelings about belief
tend to change.

756
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:12,512
I was very antireligious
when I was young.

757
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,946
Exposure to danger
changed that.

758
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,179
No matter what
my intellect told me,

759
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:23,022
I've always found myself
asking the Almighty

760
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,790
for special protection
when facing the enemy.

761
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:30,863
- A reluctant believer?
- Perhaps.

762
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,835
The one thing I'm sure of:

763
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,600
Whether you believe
or disbelieve,

764
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,938
it is a wicked thing
to take away men's hope.

765
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,074
And what do
you make of him?

766
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,881
I like him. Mmm.

767
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,082
But not, I think,
as much as he likes me.

768
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,256
"...the German
and Japanese level.

769
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,200
Anybody likes to play rough,

770
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,601
we can certainly play rough too.

771
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,607
Hitler and his Nazi gang
have sown the wind.

772
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,973
Let them reap the whirlwind."

773
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,841
Don't work too late, sir.

774
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,005
You need your rest...
busy day tomorrow.

775
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,345
"Neither the length of the struggle
nor any form of severity

776
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,682
which it may assume
shall make us weary"...

777
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,382
- Is there anything else you want?
- Where's the brandy?

778
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,619
- On the side table.
- Very good.

779
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,856
Not Hine I'm afraid, sir,
but passable.

780
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,022
Bloody awful martinis
before dinner.

781
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:37,659
I can't imagine why the president
likes such a filthy drink.

782
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,602
Each man to his own, sir.
I'll say good night then.

783
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:42,969
Yes yes, good night.

784
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,870
"There will be no haltings

785
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,775
or half measures.

786
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,543
There will be

787
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,812
no compromise or parley."

788
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,409
Yes.

789
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,781
"When I warned
the French government

790
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,724
that Britain would fight on alone

791
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,194
no matter what they did,

792
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,323
their generals told
their prime minister

793
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,731
and his cabinet...
and his cab...

794
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,827
and his divided cabinet...

795
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,203
and his divided...

796
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,401
and his divided cabinet

797
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,307
'In three weeks'...

798
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:26,672
'In three weeks,

799
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:30,653
England will have
her neck

800
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,587
wrung like a chicken.'

801
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,853
Some chicken!

802
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,621
Some neck!

803
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,060
Some chicken!

804
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,892
Some neck!"

805
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,999
Oh!

806
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,845
Thompson. Thompson.

807
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:03,114
- What's the matter, sir?
- Fetch the doctor.

808
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,417
- I'm not feeling well.
- Right.

809
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,284
Here we are, sir.
All right, all right.

810
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,419
I'll go fetch the doctor.

811
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,310
- Is he all right?
- He's had a heart attack...

812
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,710
fairly minor,
but a heart attack nevertheless.

813
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,647
He should be kept in bed
for at least six weeks,

814
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,480
but that's impossible.

815
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,145
If the American newspapers
got wind of it,

816
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,676
the whole damn world
would be told

817
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,313
Winston's an invalid
with a dicky heart

818
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,153
and that'd be disastrous.

819
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:45,651
Nobody must hear
of this... nobody.

820
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,290
Not Mrs. Churchill
and not even him.

821
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,811
Speak up.
Don't mumble.

822
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,379
This is Mr. Churchill.

823
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,220
I want to speak to
the party chairman.

824
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,126
Then get ahold of him.
Tell him I rang.

825
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,129
I'm in France.
He knows the number.

826
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,063
Get him to
telephone me here at...

827
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,999
Winston?

828
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,695
No, on second thought

829
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,761
I'll telephone him.

830
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:31,262
Tomorrow, yes.
Roughly the same time.

831
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,538
Winston, are you there?

832
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,272
Yes, come in.

833
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,406
We're taking Mary to Biarritz.
Had you forgotten?

834
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,847
- No no, of course not.
- What are you doing?

835
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,648
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?

836
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,247
I could scarcely
make it any clearer.

837
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,451
I'm sitting here
in my room doing nothing.

838
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,357
Are you so bored
with my company?

839
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,522
- Clemmie, for heaven's sake.
- And what about Mary?

840
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,758
She has been so looking forward
to spending time with you

841
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,562
and you have scarcely
spoken to her.

842
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,432
She seems happy enough.

843
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,801
Can't you try
to enjoy this holiday

844
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,829
and forget about the election
just for a bit?

845
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,603
The answer is no, I can't.

846
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,475
If I sit on the terrace or the beach,
I sit there thinking about it.

847
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,238
At least
if I come up here,

848
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,580
phone party HQ,
they can tell me the latest news

849
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,586
and I can
go back to you

850
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,589
with a clear mind
and no hidden anxieties.

851
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,622
Nothing is going to happen until
the election results are announced.

852
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,823
You know that.
There is nothing you can do.

853
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,963
Yes, I know that,
but I don't feel it.

854
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,410
It may be foolish

855
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,244
and I know it's annoying,

856
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,518
but I like to have
the illusion I'm in control.

857
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:57,254
Haven't you got a single general
who can win battles?!

858
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,091
This is beyond belief!

859
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,359
I mean, talk about
bloody incompetence!

860
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:04,890
Who is responsible?
I told President Roosevelt

861
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,527
Singapore was impregnable!

862
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,539
It seems the garrison is not
as well fortified as we thought.

863
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,938
I gave him my word!

864
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,841
Most of the guns
can only fire seaward,

865
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:17,506
which leaves our troops
vulnerable to an attack from the north.

866
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,105
Well, why weren't
we told about this?

867
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:22,050
I'm afraid we were misinformed
by the Joint Intelligence Committee.

868
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:26,044
Bloody hell.
You listen to me, General Brooke.

869
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,388
I expect every inch
of ground to be defended.

870
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,951
This is the key to our imperial strength
in Southeast Asia.

871
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:34,156
Send a telegram immediately:

872
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,688
There must be no thought
of saving the troops

873
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,667
or sparing the population.

874
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,408
"I speak to you all

875
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:49,640
under the shadow of a heavy

876
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,638
and far-reaching military defeat.

877
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,208
Singapore has fallen.

878
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:59,279
This is one
of those moments

879
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:02,416
when the British race
and nation

880
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,451
can show their quality

881
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,122
and their genius.

882
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,894
This is one
of those moments

883
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:13,994
when it can draw
from the heart of misfortune

884
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:17,234
the vital impulses of victory.

885
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:22,241
Here is a moment to display

886
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,271
that calm and poise

887
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,408
combined with grim determination

888
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,215
which not so long ago

889
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:34,952
brought us out
of the very jaws of death.

890
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:38,552
- So far..."
- Hear Winston last night?

891
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:42,053
- I did.
- Hot air, I thought, didn't you?

892
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,567
The country's not in the mood

893
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,263
to be fobbed off
with fine phrases.

894
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,169
"Let us move forward,

895
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:51,572
steadfastly together

896
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,974
into the storm

897
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,501
and through the storm."

898
00:51:56,546 --> 00:52:00,448
The prime minister
wins debate after debate

899
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,282
and loses battle after battle.

900
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,778
- Hear, hear!
- The country is beginning to say

901
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:10,418
he fights his debates like a war

902
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,452
and the war like a debate.

903
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,522
What about Dieppe, Winston?

904
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,534
Have you forgotten what
a disaster that was?

905
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:22,834
4,000 men lost!
And Malaya!

906
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,671
Not a single objective
accomplished!

907
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,671
The prime minister is exercising

908
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,977
a tremendous dictatorship.

909
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,347
He is the most arrogant

910
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,046
and intolerant member
of this House.

911
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,716
He appointed himself
minister of defense.

912
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:44,056
The responsibility
for the current sad state

913
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,824
of military affairs is his.

914
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,763
So far as I am concerned,

915
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,359
had I to choose between
Hitler and the prime minister,

916
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,929
I should not know exactly
on which the choice had to fall.

917
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,394
You must stop brooding.

918
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,896
- I'm not brooding.
- You are.

919
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,491
You're brooding about
that wretched debate.

920
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,125
Ignore it, Winston.

921
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,726
Nobody takes them seriously.

922
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,965
It's left-wing Labourite nonsense.

923
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,405
- Is it?
- You know it is.

924
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,779
I knew I'd get the blame,

925
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,216
and in many ways
I deserve it.

926
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:46,086
You once said to me...
do you remember?

927
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,386
- when you first
became prime minister,

928
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,258
"I was born for this."

929
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,728
You were, Winston.

930
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,865
Too many disasters.

931
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,210
I feel I must assure you, sir,

932
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,682
that if you wish me
to hand over my responsibilities

933
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,810
to some other person,
I would feel,

934
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,343
in many ways, it is the right
and proper thing to do.

935
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:24,225
If you're trying
to offer your resignation,

936
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,957
please don't.
I'd be awfully glad if you didn't.

937
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:31,023
The people need you, Winston.

938
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,167
Perhaps, sir.
Perhaps not.

939
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,230
Of course they do.

940
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,742
So do I.

941
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:43,507
No. No, you'll just have
to buckle down and...

942
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,377
what's your phrase?

943
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,713
- keep buggering on.

944
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:50,276
That's right, sir...
KBO.

945
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,380
Of course the loss of Singapore
came as a dreadful shock.

946
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,392
I hadn't expected it
to fall so quickly.

947
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,326
None of us did, sir.

948
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,886
If our army can't fight
any better than this,

949
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,659
we shall lose the Empire.

950
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,600
Thank you, sir.

951
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,968
The situation in the North Atlantic
is even more worrying.

952
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,497
Admiral Donitz
and his U-boats are wreaking havoc.

953
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,409
Unless we can find a way
of protecting our supply convoys,

954
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,177
we'll be starved to death.

955
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,842
KBO, Winston.

956
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,446
KBO, sir.

957
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,481
Bloody U-boats.

958
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,821
Some of the chaps have
had a brilliant idea.

959
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,388
- And what's that?
- Icebergs.

960
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,060
Icebergs?

961
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:41,366
We disguise
our merchant ships as icebergs.

962
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,532
Think of the Titanic.

963
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,975
Enormous icebergs floating
throughout the North Atlantic.

964
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,138
U-boat commander would look
through his periscope

965
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,410
and see only icebergs.

966
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,883
Icebergs travelling
in formation, sir,

967
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,443
at a steady eight knots?

968
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,115
Yes, well, we'd have to
work on the details.

969
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:03,091
And with smoke coming
out of a funnel?

970
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,754
Well, think about it.
I'm sure it could work.

971
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,922
It just needs
a little bit of ingenuity.

972
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,061
There was
something else as well.

973
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,468
Oh, yes.

974
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,667
Yes yes, floating harbors
for the invasion of Europe.

975
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,699
Isn't that a little premature, sir?

976
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,507
We've got to think ahead.

977
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,172
The huns'll blow
everything to buggery.

978
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,943
We need a floating harbor.

979
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,850
No invasion can work
without a harbor.

980
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,787
The Americans think otherwise,
but they're wrong.

981
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,290
Eisenhower has no idea
how to fight a battle.

982
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,986
He's never even seen
active service.

983
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,756
- Are you off?
- Yes, sir.

984
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:43,129
- Best wishes to your wife.
- Thank you, sir.

985
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:46,533
I was thinking of having
a long weekend in the country.

986
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,671
Would that be all right?

987
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,666
A holiday.

988
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,870
Holidays are
a peacetime concept.

989
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,212
A change is
as good as a rest,

990
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,514
and as we're off to see
Joe Stalin next week,

991
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,850
I'd advise
against the country.

992
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,822
A waste of time.

993
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,984
Yes, sir. Good night.

994
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,360
The first thing I did when
I was assigned to Bomber Command

995
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,993
was to examine the effect
of night raids on Germany.

996
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,367
The results are
most discouraging.

997
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:24,032
It seems our night bombing
is so inaccurate

998
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,303
that it's scarcely doing
any damage at all.

999
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,106
Most of the bombs drop
on empty fields.

1000
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:32,080
We're killing more cows
than Germans.

1001
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,605
And your solution?

1002
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,346
Either we abandon
night bombing altogether

1003
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,321
or the objectives of night bombing
should be radically changed.

1004
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,516
Obviously we can't
give up night bombing,

1005
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,856
it's the only thing
we can do to hurt Germany.

1006
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,020
We've got to show Stalin
we're doing something

1007
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,586
to ease the pressure
on the Red Army.

1008
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,689
- And so?
- At the moment

1009
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:53,259
we aim our bombs at specific targets
and usually miss them.

1010
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:56,397
If we were to drop bombs
on a much wider area...

1011
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:59,567
an area, say, that we knew
contained factories,

1012
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,134
railway lines,
important roads...

1013
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,908
we'd stand a much greater
chance of success.

1014
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,712
Wouldn't such an area
also contain houses...

1015
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,242
houses for the civilians
who work in the factories?

1016
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,518
A certain number of people would
be dehoused, it's true.

1017
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,492
- "Dehoused"?
- Like the people of Coventry,

1018
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,724
Portsmouth, the East End.

1019
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:24,028
- That's a feeble argument, Harris.
- Feeble? In what way?

1020
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,932
You're talking
of the deliberate slaughter

1021
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,960
of civilian men,
women and children.

1022
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,733
There's bound to be
moral objections.

1023
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:30,830
Well, bugger that, Attlee.

1024
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,035
Everybody used gas
in the last war

1025
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:36,204
without a word of complaint
from the Somme-seeking defeatists.

1026
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,237
On the other hand,
the bombing of open cities

1027
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,078
was regarded as forbidden.
Now everybody does it.

1028
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,380
It's simply a matter
of fashion changing,

1029
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,147
like long or short skirts
for women.

1030
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,415
War is war, Attlee.

1031
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,355
Let them have it, Harris.

1032
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,791
Never maltreat
the enemy by halves.

1033
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,299
- How do I make it work?
- Just switch it on, sir.

1034
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,181
There's a switch
on the back.

1035
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,152
- Off. On.
- Fuck!

1036
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,729
Marshal Stalin proposes a toast

1037
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,998
to the health of his friend
Prime Minister Churchill

1038
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,766
on this, his birthday!

1039
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,201
Prime Minister Churchill!

1040
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,150
I'd like to propose
to the health

1041
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,414
of Marshal Stalin.

1042
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:53,684
He will, I know,
be ranked amongst

1043
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,453
the most illustrious heroes
of Russian history.

1044
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:58,119
He has already earned the title

1045
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,595
of "Stalin the Great"!

1046
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,030
Stalin the Great!

1047
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:11,230
I also drink
to the Proletarian masses.

1048
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,038
The Proletarian masses!

1049
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,913
Marshall Stalin drinks
to the Conservative Party!

1050
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,779
The Conservative Party!

1051
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:24,184
To the people of France
and French champagne.

1052
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,788
Marshall Stalin drinks
to the health

1053
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,492
of Mr. Churchill's valet.

1054
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,974
He is a noble example
of the British working man.

1055
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:49,104
Churchill's valet.

1056
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,314
I drink to Marshal Stalin.

1057
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:01,122
How much nicer a man
than I thought he'd be.

1058
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:05,420
Marshall Stalin.

1059
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,241
Your invasion of northern France

1060
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:23,905
should not be delayed.

1061
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:27,347
The Red Army is
suffering heavy losses.

1062
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,908
We need the support
of a second front in Europe.

1063
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:33,513
Marshal Stalin is anxious
that Operation Overlord

1064
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:35,524
should not be delayed.

1065
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:38,152
Marshal Stalin must realize

1066
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,991
that our forces will not be ready

1067
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,589
until the summer of 1944.

1068
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,601
That's six months away.

1069
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,432
The situation might change.

1070
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,747
Marshal Stalin is not prepared
to discuss any delay.

1071
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,579
There's no question of a delay.

1072
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:08,218
The governing factor is
the timing put forth by you.

1073
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:12,091
Overlord will be launched
at the prescribed time.

1074
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,628
This is good.

1075
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,168
It would be unwise, I think,

1076
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:25,436
to agree now to such
a rigid timetable.

1077
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:45,650
Marshal Stalin says
the British are afraid of fighting.

1078
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:49,631
You should not think
the Germans are supermen.

1079
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:52,793
You cannot win a war
without fighting.

1080
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:56,202
We are fighting...
and fighting fiercely...

1081
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,175
on land, on the sea
and in the air.

1082
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:03,804
The invasion of France is
our topmost priority.

1083
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,783
It will be our stern duty

1084
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,012
to hurl every sinew
of our strength

1085
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,020
against the Germans.

1086
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,022
Bloody man.

1087
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,718
I beg your pardon?

1088
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,488
Nothing.

1089
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,494
Thompson.

1090
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:38,673
What is it, sir?
What do you want?

1091
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,739
I can't find them anywhere.

1092
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:44,048
- Can't find what, sir?
- The little red sleeping pills.

1093
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,748
Shall I ask Mr. Sawyers, sir?
Perhaps he knows where they are.

1094
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,383
No no, he'll be asleep.

1095
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,033
Bloody music.

1096
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,319
Stay with me, Thompson.

1097
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,585
Certainly, sir. Of course.

1098
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,557
I'm tired out.

1099
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,600
Tired in body,

1100
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,568
soul and spirit.

1101
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,367
Well, you've had
a very strenuous time, sir.

1102
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:39,772
All these conferences,
all the travelling,

1103
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,800
it's an exhausting business.

1104
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,870
It is. Do you know how far

1105
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:46,939
I've travelled
since the war began?

1106
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:50,248
110,000 miles.

1107
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,618
Somebody worked it out.

1108
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,851
A total of 33 days at sea

1109
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,384
and 14 days in the air.

1110
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,925
Time you took it easy, sir.

1111
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:11,399
Sometimes I think man
will destroy man,

1112
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,238
wipe out civilization.

1113
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,712
Europe will be desolate

1114
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:22,207
and I shall
be held responsible.

1115
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,825
- Thank you.
- If there's anything more, madam...

1116
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,594
No.

1117
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,642
Sometimes when he's asleep

1118
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,507
you can see what
he must've looked like

1119
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,205
when he was a little boy.

1120
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:58,747
His parents ignored him.
Did you know that?

1121
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:02,683
He loved them deeply.
They ignored him.

1122
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,888
People say
he's a figure from the past,

1123
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,953
that the Labour party
represents the future.

1124
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:10,966
It seems timeless to me,

1125
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,468
his love of England.

1126
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,297
It's an ideal, it's a vision...

1127
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,707
something he's determined
to protect at all costs.

1128
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,439
His Camelot.

1129
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,276
Yes, if you like.

1130
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,215
Perhaps that England
never really existed.

1131
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,114
But if he hadn't believed in it,

1132
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:35,613
he never would have found
the strength to win the war.

1133
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:53,798
- Ah.
- Afternoon, Harris.

1134
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,640
That's a fine-looking car
you've got.

1135
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,044
Four and a quarter liter,
Vanden Plas body...

1136
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,672
drives like a dream.

1137
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:02,047
I was on my way home
the other evening.

1138
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,075
I got stopped for speeding.

1139
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,486
"You might've killed someone,"
said the copper.

1140
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,217
"My dear young man," I said,

1141
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:10,691
"I kill thousands
of people every night."

1142
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,922
Evening, Pug.

1143
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,056
Evening.
Have a good journey?

1144
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:19,499
On D-Day minus eight
the entire coastal area here

1145
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,060
will be sealed and all troops
confined to their camps.

1146
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,731
Foreign embassies
will not be allowed

1147
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,604
to communicate
with the outside world.

1148
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:28,201
Everything is being done to prevent
any sort of security breach,

1149
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:32,374
which would, of course,
be catastrophic.

1150
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:36,146
I need to speak to Admiral Cunningham
about my accommodation

1151
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,915
- on HMS Belfast.
- Accommodation?

1152
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:41,718
I've decided to go
with the troops on D-Day.

1153
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:45,284
- What?
- Morale, you see. That's the thing.

1154
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,386
Morale up, victory assured.

1155
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,830
I'm good at morale.
Everybody says so.

1156
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,662
- Sir, if I may say so...
- Mind made up.

1157
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,668
Change the subject.

1158
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,533
The prime minister
seems determined

1159
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,699
to go to France with the troops.

1160
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:02,905
- On D-Day?
- Yes.

1161
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:06,413
Well, I might've guessed.

1162
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,178
Put him anywhere near
a dangerous situation

1163
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:09,809
and you can be absolutely sure

1164
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,513
he'll go straight towards it.

1165
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,820
Thank you
for telling me, Jock.

1166
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,757
I'll see what I can do.

1167
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,956
Prime Minister,
would you like to come this way?

1168
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,466
Thank you for coming to see me

1169
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,128
at such short notice.

1170
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:30,297
I've made
an important decision

1171
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:32,603
and I want you
to arrange things for me.

1172
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,939
Of course, sir.
What can I do?

1173
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:38,310
I think it's only right
that I, as King,

1174
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:41,214
should go to France
with our invading force...

1175
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,617
- You mean...
...on D-Day

1176
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,213
with the first wave of troops.

1177
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:50,692
I shall travel on one
of our landing craft with the men.

1178
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,220
I'm sorry, sir,
but that's impossible.

1179
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:59,166
- Why?
- You'd almost certainly be killed.

1180
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,968
And I have
a replacement, Winston.

1181
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:07,066
You do not.

1182
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,477
So let's hear
no more about it. Hmm?

1183
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:01,460
That's it, sir.
That's all there is.

1184
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,331
Got the buggers
on the run now, sir.

1185
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,667
Our boys'll soon be in Berlin.

1186
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,035
Tell me, Bunny,

1187
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:17,102
do you believe
in life after death?

1188
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,478
Life after death, sir?

1189
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,641
Well, I suppose I do.

1190
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,657
I envy you that.

1191
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,236
Ah. There he is.

1192
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,407
Franklin, my good man,

1193
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:50,173
we must have a private talk
about the future of Poland.

1194
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:53,648
We can't do that with
Joe Stalin breathing down our necks.

1195
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:56,845
- How about lunch?
- My dance card's quite full.

1196
01:10:56,885 --> 01:11:00,912
And, frankly, I have a distant view
of the Polish problem.

1197
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:04,619
I don't think
a conversation with Uncle Joe

1198
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:08,096
would be advantageous
to the long-range prospect for peace.

1199
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,155
Gentlemen, please be seated.

1200
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:14,135
Forgive me, Winston. I have to
get myself ready for this damn picture.

1201
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,228
Harry.

1202
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:25,674
We ought to do something.

1203
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:28,114
It's a matter of honor.

1204
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,448
What is?

1205
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,455
- The Polish problem.
- Here we go, sir.

1206
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:37,550
People are saying we declared war
on Germany because they invaded Poland.

1207
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:40,892
We can't just stand by
and watch Russia do the same.

1208
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:44,990
For God's sake, what do people expect
us to do, start another bloody war?

1209
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,040
Over here, gentlemen.

1210
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,599
The latest briefing, sir.

1211
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:28,771
I can't understand
Franklin's behavior.

1212
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:32,338
Roosevelt and Joe Stalin...
they have the power.

1213
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:39,615
No lover ever studied
the whims of his mistress

1214
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:42,123
more assiduously

1215
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:45,752
than I did those of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

1216
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:56,563
It was an air assault
without parallel in history.

1217
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:01,074
The target was Dresden.

1218
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,476
Terror rained down
from the skies.

1219
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,379
Dresden is now
a heap of ruins.

1220
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,145
It has been
smashed to atoms.

1221
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,421
Neutral sources report that
more than 58,000 people

1222
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:19,325
lost their lives
and 180,000 lost their jobs.

1223
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:21,955
That's nearly a quarter of a million
German war workers

1224
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,828
less than a week ago.

1225
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:27,063
A brilliant tribute
to the Allied knights of the air.

1226
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,209
War...

1227
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:43,712
which used to be cruel
and magnificent,

1228
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,721
has now become
cruel and squalid.

1229
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,489
Once there was a small number

1230
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:52,517
of well-trained professionals

1231
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,552
who championed
their country's cause.

1232
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,723
These men,

1233
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,203
brave men, were sustained
at every moment

1234
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,070
by the applause of their nation.

1235
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,939
Now

1236
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,604
we have entire communities...

1237
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,308
woman and children included...

1238
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,650
pitted against one another

1239
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:19,051
in brutish
mutual extermination,

1240
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:22,386
with only a set
of bleary-eyed clerks

1241
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:25,882
left to add up
the butchers' bills.

1242
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,807
I'm sorry, Attlee,
you were saying something?

1243
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:44,278
I was going to suggest
a little discussion...

1244
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,305
an item on
our peacetime agenda:

1245
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:51,046
"The Uthwatt Report
on Town and Country Planning."

1246
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,213
The what report on what?

1247
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:55,519
- Uthwatt, sir.
- Never heard of it.

1248
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:59,618
I sent you a memorandum concerning
back-bench reaction last week...

1249
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,994
Last week?
What happened last week?

1250
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:05,261
I can't remember last week.
Isn't it appalling?

1251
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,292
Can't even remember
what I had for breakfast.

1252
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,202
Got a match?

1253
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,332
Thank you.

1254
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:15,343
When I was a boy,

1255
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:18,210
when I was at school
I had a phenomenal memory.

1256
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,976
Phenomenal.

1257
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:25,285
I got a prize for reciting
"The Lays of Ancient Rome,"

1258
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,288
Macaulay.

1259
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:29,256
Mmm, the whole of it.

1260
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:32,089
I knew the whole damn thing,
word perfect, start to finish.

1261
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,220
Got a prize for it.

1262
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:37,255
"Then out spake brave Horatius,

1263
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,460
The Captain of the Gate:

1264
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,833
'To every man upon this earth

1265
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,498
Death cometh soon or late.

1266
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,475
And how can man die better

1267
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:50,205
Than facing fearful odds,

1268
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:52,873
For the ashes of his fathers,

1269
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,645
And the temples of his gods?"'

1270
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,487
Well, right.

1271
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,824
Let's move on.

1272
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,456
You were saying, Attlee?

1273
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,784
Sorry to waken you, sir!

1274
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:38,452
Captain bloody Pim!
What the hell do you want?

1275
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:41,360
Message from General Eisenhower's
headquarters, sir.

1276
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,864
The instrument of
unconditional surrender

1277
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,993
was signed
at 2:41 AM this morning.

1278
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:49,731
- The war in Europe is over.
- Let me see.

1279
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,044
For five years
you've brought me

1280
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,547
nothing but bad news.

1281
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:02,573
With one stroke, you have
redeemed yourself.

1282
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,246
Sir.

1283
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,746
Come along, Winston.

1284
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,879
This is unexpected,

1285
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,048
and I have to say,
unwelcome news.

1286
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,955
If I could just explain...

1287
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:20,450
Nothing to explain. You want
to disband the national government

1288
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,463
before we have defeated Japan.

1289
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:25,022
I wouldn't say I want it personally.
My party wants it.

1290
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,058
Left-wing buggers.

1291
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:30,037
Well, if they want an election,
let 'em have it. Fuck 'em.

1292
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:33,769
Not just left-wingers, Winston,
as well you know.

1293
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,209
The British people want
a different sort of future.

1294
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:39,543
They want full employment;
they want a proper welfare state.

1295
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:41,378
And if they want
to vote for these things,

1296
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,407
then I think an election
should be called.

1297
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,186
Very well.
Do as you please.

1298
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,163
Well?

1299
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,639
Have you read my speech?

1300
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:07,767
I have, yes.

1301
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,209
And what do you think?

1302
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:15,774
- Not one of your best.
- What's wrong with it?

1303
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:17,648
Rather dull, I thought.

1304
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:22,518
- Dull?
- There's one bit I don't like at all.

1305
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:29,327
When you talk about
the Socialists

1306
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,264
not allowing free speech

1307
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,735
or "violently-worded expressions
of public discontent."

1308
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,931
- What's wrong with that?
- "They would have to fall back

1309
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,496
on some form of Gestapo."

1310
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,974
I think it is a huge mistake
to use that particular word.

1311
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,273
It is the right word
in this context.

1312
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:45,939
This is going to be
broadcast, Winston.

1313
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:48,279
Thousands of Labour party
supporters will hear it,

1314
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:50,546
men and women who have
been fighting the Nazis

1315
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,382
and the Gestapo for five years!

1316
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,183
This will make them
very angry.

1317
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:57,487
Clemmie, I know what
this country needs.

1318
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,960
For a start we're bankrupt...

1319
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,828
in debt to the tune
of 3,000 million

1320
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:05,298
On top of that, there is
the threat of Communism...

1321
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:08,097
as big a threat
as Hitler was in 1940,

1322
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:09,899
if not worse!

1323
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,998
The people trusted me then,
they'll trust me now.

1324
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:16,442
Things are different now.
The war has changed everything.

1325
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,708
Certain things may change,

1326
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,874
I do not.

1327
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,381
That's what people want:

1328
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:28,753
the strength and security
of experienced government.

1329
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:32,152
Thank you for
your advice, Clemmie.

1330
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,389
In this instance
I shall not heed it.

1331
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,980
"My friends I must tell you

1332
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,786
that a socialist policy is abhorrent

1333
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:06,191
to the British ideas of freedom.

1334
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:09,561
No Socialist government could afford

1335
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:14,535
to allow free, sharp
or violently-worded expressions

1336
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:17,333
of public discontent.

1337
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,567
They would have
to fall back on some

1338
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:22,736
form of Gestapo...

1339
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:25,371
no doubt very
humanely directed..."

1340
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:28,780
- That's bollocks! Bollocks.
- "...in the first instance.

1341
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:31,547
And this would nip
opinion in the bud.

1342
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:35,716
Leave these Socialist dreamers
to their utopias...

1343
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:37,247
or their nightmares.

1344
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:40,557
Let us make sure
that the cottage home

1345
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:43,962
to which the warrior
will return is blessed

1346
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:47,366
with modest
but solid prosperity,

1347
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:50,735
well fenced and guarded
against misfortune,

1348
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:54,799
and that Britons remain
free to plan their lives

1349
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:57,004
for themselves

1350
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,479
and for those they love."

1351
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,487
"When I listened to the prime
minister's speech last night,

1352
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,656
in which he gave
such a travesty

1353
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,462
of the policy
of the Labour party,

1354
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:22,902
I realized at once
what was his object.

1355
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:27,341
He feared lest those who had
accepted his leadership at war

1356
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,572
might be tempted
out of gratitude

1357
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,172
to follow him further.

1358
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,977
I thank him

1359
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:36,950
for having
disillusioned them

1360
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:39,283
so thoroughly."

1361
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,827
Ah, good. There he is.

1362
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,058
Where's Mama?

1363
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,736
She must have
forgotten something.

1364
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,865
I'll go and have a look. Clemmie!

1365
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:01,967
Clemmie!

1366
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,811
Clemmie!

1367
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:15,851
What are you doing?

1368
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,858
I'm just saying goodbye
to the view.

1369
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:19,917
- It looks lovely this morning.
- Ah.

1370
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,487
Yes.

1371
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:29,165
Everything's packed.

1372
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:30,933
Everyone's ready and waiting.

1373
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,198
Right.

1374
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,608
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1375
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:43,282
- What is it?
- Nothing.

1376
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,246
Tell me, please.

1377
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,921
I dread going back.

1378
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:56,226
I dread it.

1379
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:04,434
We'll come again.

1380
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,133
I promise.

1381
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,404
We'll come back
next autumn.

1382
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,502
We can go to the Riviera

1383
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,605
or Monte Carlo,
borrow somebody's villa.

1384
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:17,311
- Winston.
- Or we can come back here.

1385
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:18,910
You like it here, don't you?

1386
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:20,944
It doesn't matter where we go.

1387
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:24,618
Yes. You're right, it doesn't.

1388
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:28,060
We could stay
at Chartwell... even better.

1389
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:32,430
You really don't
understand, do you?

1390
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,903
Another five years
in Downing Street could kill you...

1391
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:39,771
Nonsense.
I've never felt better.

1392
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,771
...and me.

1393
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:46,810
Why?

1394
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:48,975
Are you saying you want me
to lose the election?

1395
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,815
No no,
of course not.

1396
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:54,219
- I don't believe it.
- I don't.

1397
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,093
I look into the future

1398
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,118
and it frightens me.

1399
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:22,075
Hammersmith South...
Labour gain.

1400
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:25,643
Wigan...
Labour gain.

1401
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:30,687
Leeds South...
Labour, no change.

1402
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:36,591
Barrow-in-Furness...
Labour gain.

1403
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:42,627
Newcastle-under-Lyne...
Labour gain.

1404
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:48,641
Fulham East... Labour gain.

1405
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,940
I'm dreadfully sorry, sir.

1406
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:57,913
They're perfectly entitled
to vote as they please.

1407
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:02,581
This is democracy, after all.

1408
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:07,025
That's what
we've been fighting for.

1409
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:20,174
It is my duty, sir,

1410
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,405
formally to tender
my resignation as your minister,

1411
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,902
and to advise you
to invite Mr. Attlee

1412
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:29,178
to form a new government.

1413
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,242
Thank you,
Prime Minister.

1414
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:34,016
- Please.
- Thank you, sir.

1415
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,463
Winston, I would
like you to accept

1416
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:50,903
the Order of the Garter.

1417
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:53,635
It is, as you know,

1418
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:57,133
the highest order of chivalry
a monarch can bestow.

1419
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:02,040
Your Majesty,

1420
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:05,119
I am deeply honored

1421
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:07,781
and very moved,

1422
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:10,619
but I must refuse.

1423
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,222
How can I accept
the most noble

1424
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,958
Order of the Garter
when the British people

1425
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,795
have given me
the order of the boot?

1426
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:22,093
Well, I shall...

1427
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:25,128
I shall miss our...

1428
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:28,870
our meetings, our talks.

1429
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,878
I feel we have...

1430
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:39,152
I feel we've become friends.

1431
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,417
Thank you, sir.

1432
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,947
I feel that too.

1433
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:50,522
Look who's here, sir.

1434
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:53,227
Sir!

1435
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:59,572
- Hello, sir.
- Ah! Jock!

1436
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,666
What a treat!
Wonderful to see you.

1437
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:05,236
I hope I'm not interrupting.

1438
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,182
No no. I've been bidding farewell
to the chiefs of staff.

1439
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:14,151
Never again shall
I look out of this window.

1440
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:16,315
I shall miss it.

1441
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:17,881
Scotch, Sawyers.

1442
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:20,257
Dear old Jock!
How are you?

1443
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,887
How's the new prime minister?

1444
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:24,693
Greatly surprised that
he won the election.

1445
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,757
Yes.

1446
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,826
So was Uncle Joe Stalin.

1447
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:32,806
He couldn't understand
why we hadn't fixed the results.

1448
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:36,942
Scotch, Sawyers, please.

1449
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,969
The car's coming
in a minute, sir.

1450
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:41,277
All right, all right.

1451
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,576
- Where are you going?
- Where am I going?

1452
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:48,714
To the theater.
He knows, really.

1453
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:50,314
He's just being awkward.

1454
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:53,418
Mrs. Churchill's taking him
to the Noel Coward play.

1455
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:55,895
- It's a real treat.
- Tell her I'm not going.

1456
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:58,228
- Of course you're going.
- I don't feel like it.

1457
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:02,563
You'll enjoy it
when you get there.

1458
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:09,065
I hope you don't think
I'm being disloyal, sir.

1459
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:11,101
"Disloyal"?

1460
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:14,512
- Working for Mr. Attlee.
- Of course you're working for him.

1461
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:17,177
Private secretary
to the prime minister... that's your job.

1462
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:19,448
Huh.

1463
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:21,978
Actually, he was
very decent about it... Attlee.

1464
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,491
Said we could stay here
until Chartwell was ready.

1465
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:28,756
I refused...
I hope graciously.

1466
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:36,536
I think the army was against me.

1467
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:39,062
Their votes were
cast against me.

1468
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:41,666
Well, I don't think
you can say...

1469
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,939
Sure of it. Sure of it.

1470
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:47,311
I thought I served them well.

1471
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:51,043
I had a letter
from Jack Seely,

1472
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:53,417
Secretary of State
for War, 1914...

1473
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:55,684
retired now, of course.

1474
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:57,748
It was such a darling letter.

1475
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:00,317
Mmm.

1476
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:02,295
Very upset
about the election.

1477
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:04,389
He said it was
the end of the world...

1478
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:06,457
our world.

1479
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:08,492
He may be right.

1480
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:11,836
All the things I cherish most

1481
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:13,864
seem to be slipping away...

1482
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,876
the Empire,

1483
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,174
respect for the old order.

1484
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:21,579
We were at school together,
Jack and I.

1485
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:23,948
A genuinely good man.

1486
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:27,944
I remember seeing him
in South Africa

1487
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,184
during the Boer War.

1488
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:34,393
I was a correspondent
of "The Morning Post."

1489
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:38,396
Dawn...
a beautiful sunrise.

1490
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:42,597
I was riding across
the veldt on my pony

1491
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:45,572
and I saw a column
of British cavalry approaching.

1492
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,632
And there, alone,

1493
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:51,076
20 yards ahead of his men

1494
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:53,637
riding a black horse

1495
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:55,478
was Jack Seely...

1496
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:58,110
Colonel Seely as he was then.

1497
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,553
He seemed to embody
all that was magnificent

1498
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:04,751
in British Imperial power.

1499
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:11,857
I feel very lonely without a war.

1500
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:16,599
I could live it all over again.

1501
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:19,672
The whole war?

1502
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:22,870
1940.

1503
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,969
Just 1940.

1504
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:34,116
I'm not in the mood
for some idiotic play.

1505
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,147
Why on earth
did you suggest it?

1506
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:40,857
Bloody nightmare.

1507
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:52,900
- I'm not going.
- What?

1508
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,601
Tell the driver
to take me home.

1509
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:56,200
Please, Clemmie.

1510
01:31:57,545 --> 01:31:59,740
It was your idea to come
to the damn theater.

1511
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,213
Tell the driver
to take me home.

1512
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:03,740
- You go.
- Please don't.

1513
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:06,920
Good evening, Mrs. Churchill.

1514
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:13,617
I can't go on like this.

1515
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:15,561
I can't

1516
01:32:15,596 --> 01:32:17,723
and I won't.

1517
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:32,405
Hope you have
a pleasant evening, sir.

1518
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,716
What have you
been doing lately,

1519
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:41,950
- during these last years?
- Travelling about a bit.

1520
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:43,980
I went round the world,
you know, after you...

1521
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:45,890
Yes. Yes, I know.

1522
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,827
China must be very interesting.

1523
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:49,887
Very big, China.

1524
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:51,922
And Japan?

1525
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:53,866
Very small.

1526
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:02,435
# Someday I'll find you #

1527
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:06,378
# Moonlight behind you #

1528
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:09,281
# True to the dream #

1529
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:12,946
# I am dreaming #

1530
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:16,479
# As I draw near you #

1531
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:20,119
# You'll smile a little smile #

1532
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:23,722
# For a little while... #

1533
01:34:06,374 --> 01:34:09,639
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are very privileged.

1534
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:12,043
With us in the theater tonight

1535
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:15,742
we have the savior
of our nation...

1536
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:17,683
Winston Churchill.

1537
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:30,726
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1538
01:34:36,037 --> 01:34:37,937
Bravo!

1539
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:49,446
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1540
01:34:59,447 --> 01:35:00,447
