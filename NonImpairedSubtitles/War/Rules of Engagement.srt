Because ofyour man's
hotheaded miscalculation,

309
00:33:00,642 --> 00:33:04,908
we are in danger of losing embassies
in Saudi,Jordan and Egypt.

310
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,676
We're in danger
of losing our presence...

311
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,583
with every moderate
in the region.

312
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,950
Now they're gonna scream
"cover up."

313
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:16,252
The screaming will get so loud we'll
be sending Marines back over there,

314
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:19,726
and the body count ofAmerican
dead is gonna be higher than three.

315
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:25,226
I see where you're going
with this, Mr. Sokal.

316
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,564
Will you be needing me
anymore today?

317

No.

No, that's fil ne, General.

Good day to you, sir.

[ Sighs ] Where do you think
you're going with that?

321
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:57,221
- You don't want to look at it.
- Nobody's lookin' at it.

322
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,733
Why should the United States
be held responsible...

323
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:03,670
for the actions ofone man?

324

had weapons?

they did fil re fil rst?

326
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:11,905
He could have fil red over
their heads, this moron!

327
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,608
Didn't he know where he was?
The Middle East!

328
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:16,378
He could have isolated
on the snipers.

329
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:17,942
He could have
avoided confrontation.

330
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,352
He could have done
50 fuckin' things!

331
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:22,720
Instead, he destroyed a fragile
trust, put his own men in danger--

332
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:26,283
Fuck this guy!
Forget this tape.

333
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:30,297
I don't want to watch it.
I don't want to testify about it.

334
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,636
I don't want it to exist.

- Yes, sir.

342
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:19,222
Colonel, it's my duty to inform
you that you've been charged with--

343
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:25,094
[ Sighs ]
You know the drill.

344
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,577
This is the Article 32
investigation.

345
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:32,704
You're facing
a general court-martial...

346
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,578
and charged with violation
ofat least three articles--

347
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,210
everything from "breach of peace"
to "conduct unbecoming."

348
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:44,156
But the bottom line-- 83 counts,
violation ofArticle 1 1 8, murder.

349
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,159
You issued an illegal order
to have your marines...

350
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,458
fil re into a group
of innocent civilians.

351
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,930
Murder, sir?

352
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:59,566
I'm the convening authority, so I've
gotta get this B.S. out ofthe way.

353
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,974
Sign here, initial here.

354
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:13,445
You're not a flight risk, so there
won't be any pretrial confil nement.

355
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:19,959
This court-martial convenes
in eight days...

356
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:25,021
by direct order of
the national command authority.

Terry, goddamn it,
we've been friends for20years:

You want to tell me exactly
what the hell happened out there?

361
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:51,788
I lost marines. The crowd
was hostile. They fil red on us.

362
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:55,317
They fil red fil rst, sir.

363
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:58,331
I want you to know
I did everything in the world...

364
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,196
to keep this from happening.

365
00:37:00,267 --> 00:37:02,997

of my hands now.

No, you don't understand
what I'm asking.

I want you
to be my lawyer.

[ Sighs ]

374

I'm a good enough lawyer to know
you need a better lawyer than me.

'Sides that, I'm short.

You need one ofthose
Washington cats.

378

I don't want some Starbucks
drinker who's never seen combat.

379
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:01,223
-I need somebody who's been shot at.
-Yeah, I've been shot at.

380
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:04,458
That's what I am--
a shot-up marine.

381
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,161
As a matter offact,
that's all the hell I am.

382
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:10,897
No, wait a minute.
I'm also a weak lawyer.

383
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:15,066
I'm a very weak lawyer--

00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:19,806
and the government is gonna come
at you with everything they've got.

Major, Bill Sokal. It's a pleasure
to meet you. Come on in.

386
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,160
Let me introduce you.

387
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,162
Gentlemen, this
is Major Mark Biggs.

388
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,357
He'll be prosecuting
the Childers court-martial.

389
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:40,866
The marines put the major
through Stanford Law,

390
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:44,371
and he owes them a couple ofyears
before he takes over the world.

391
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,372
You know GeneraILowry:

00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,533
I'dlikeyou to meet thegeneral
oftheJoint Chiefs ofStaff,

393
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:51,476
General West, and the secretary
of Defense, Mr. Wyatt.

394
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:53,479
Have a seat.
Make yourselfcomfortable.

395
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:57,347
What I gather from our esteemed NSC
advisor and secretary ofstate...

396
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,613
is that we've got a trial
in two weeks.

397
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:02,986
-Seems awfully damned fast.
-Everyone in this room will agree...

398
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:05,787
it's in the national interest that
this trial be moved along quickly.

399
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,660
The Article 32 investigation
was complete and comprehensive.

400
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,459
It all seems to point
in one direction.

401
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:12,897
Has he got a lawyeryet?

402
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,902
He's requested a military
attorney, Colonel Hayes Hodges.

403
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,700
Second Marine Division, Lejeune.

404
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,467
Any relation to
General H. Lawrence Hodges?

405
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,667
His son.

406
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:24,404
Larry Hodges was one ofthis country's
most distinguished offilcers.

407
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:26,639
What do we know about
Colonel Hayes Hodges?

408
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:29,148
He's a guy who got
blown apart in Vietnam,

409
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:31,912
then went to Georgetown Law
and became a cynic.

410
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:33,920
Is that about right, Major?

411
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:36,081
He was 67th in his class
at Georgetown, sir.

412
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:39,023
He doesn't take too many cases,
doesn't win too many.

413
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:41,857
He apparently went through an ugly
divorce, had a drinking problem,

414
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:46,491
- retiring in two weeks:
- Can we guarantee we get this guy?

415
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:49,092
Sir, if I may
say something?

416
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:52,330
I am not a hired gun.

417
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:53,839
I accepted this assignment...

418
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:56,274
'cause I believe in the merits
ofthe government's case.

419
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:58,538
I am not gonna stack the deck
against this guy.

420
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:01,445
I will try this case
on good evidence only.

421
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,847

He's not on trial for the
good service he gave the country,

543
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:14,680
but for what he did
on the wallin Yemen, period:

544
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,648
Major, nobody wants to say it,

545
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:19,709
but it occurs to me we're trying
to set an example here.

So let's set it and show
the world we mean business.

547

penalty, and I say we go for it.

No more death.

command and I'll put him in jail,

We gotta show

We gotta prove he went out
with intent to kill,

554

with murder or hailed as a hero...

that ifthere were tapes,

01:44:48,064 --> 01:44:50,259
[ Both Sighing ]

1380
01:44:52,269 --> 01:44:54,703
- [ Sighs ]
- I'm sorry.

1381
01:44:56,006 --> 01:44:58,702
[ Exhales ]

1382
01:44:58,775 --> 01:45:02,267
- I really screwed up in there, huh?
- Yeah, you really did.

1383
01:45:02,345 --> 01:45:04,779
[ Chuckles ]
Whew!

1384
01:45:04,848 --> 01:45:07,942
- So what happens now?
- Shit, I don't know.

1385
01:45:08,018 --> 01:45:12,148
[ Sighs ]
I don't know.

1386
01:45:14,191 --> 01:45:15,988
Your Honor, the government
calls Colonel Bin Le Cao...

1387
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:18,152
- as a rebuttal witness.
- Objection, Your Honor.

1388
01:45:18,228 --> 01:45:20,321
What are the grounds for
this rebuttal witness to be allowed?

1389
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:22,957
Will counsel please
approach the bench.

1390
01:45:28,872 --> 01:45:32,171
- Who is Colonel Bin Le Cao?
- A North Vietnamese Colonel...

1391
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,301
who fought against Colonel Childers
at the battle of Ca Lu.

1392
01:45:34,377 --> 01:45:37,574
What he has to say directly refutes
statements made by Colonel Childers.

1393
01:45:37,647 --> 01:45:40,081
- When was the battle of Ca Lu?
- 1 968.

1394
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:43,847
This is uncharged misconduct. It is
not allowable under military law.

1395
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,320
How do you know this witness
is going to charge misconduct?

1396
01:45:46,389 --> 01:45:47,356
I'm assuming--

1397
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:49,324
He knows because he was
at the battle of Ca Lu.

1398
01:45:49,392 --> 01:45:51,326
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

1399
01:45:51,394 --> 01:45:54,261
On what grounds are you
calling your witness?

1400
01:45:54,331 --> 01:45:56,526
Colonel Hodges made Colonel
Childers' combat experience...

1401
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,033
part of his defense.

1402
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:00,035
Furthermore,
Colonel Childers testifiled...

1403
01:46:00,103 --> 01:46:02,037
that he never shoots unarmed people.

1404
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:06,166
My witness hasan important
perspective on thatstatement:

1405
01:46:08,912 --> 01:46:11,506
I'm gonna allow
the witness.

1406
01:46:24,961 --> 01:46:26,326
[Biggs]
Doyouswearoraffirm:::

1407
01:46:26,396 --> 01:46:27,886
that the evidenceyoushallgive
in this case:::

1408
01:46:27,964 --> 01:46:29,488
shallbe the truth,
the whole truth:::

1409
01:46:29,566 --> 01:46:31,466
andnothing but the truth,
so helpyou God?

1410
01:46:31,535 --> 01:46:34,129
[Cao]
Yes, ldo:

1411
01:46:34,204 --> 01:46:35,671
Will you please state
your name for the court?

1412
01:46:35,739 --> 01:46:40,438
- My name is Bin Le Cao.
- In 1 968, you were a colonel...

1413
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:43,502
with the North Vietnamese army,
B3 regiment, involved in a fil ght...

1414
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:47,277
with American marines at Ca Lu
in the Quang Tri province?

1415
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:48,840
Yes, I was.

1416
01:46:48,919 --> 01:46:50,978
Will you tell the court
about that battle?

1417
01:46:51,054 --> 01:46:54,148
We were aware that
small units ofAmericans...

1418
01:46:54,224 --> 01:46:57,318
ryere ryeryr
my company of men.

1419
01:46:57,394 --> 01:47:00,761
We found ourselves
behind your forces.

1420
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:04,493
This was lucky for us
because we were outnumbered.

1421
01:47:08,872 --> 01:47:10,806
Do you recognize
this man?

1422
01:47:12,409 --> 01:47:14,343
Yes.

1423
01:47:14,411 --> 01:47:16,811
Didhe captureyou andyour
radio operatorthat day?

1424
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,972
Yes.

1425
01:47:18,048 --> 01:47:21,814
Did he remove your weapons
and place you under armed guard?

1426
01:47:21,885 --> 01:47:22,817
Yes.

1427
01:47:22,886 --> 01:47:24,751
Didyou consideryourself
aprisonerofwar?

1428
01:47:24,821 --> 01:47:27,483
Yes.

1429
01:47:27,557 --> 01:47:29,684
Did he execute
your radio operator?

1430
01:47:31,928 --> 01:47:33,862
Yes.

1431
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:36,763
You personally saw him shoot
a fellow prisoner ofwar?

1432
01:47:36,833 --> 01:47:39,131
Yes.

1433
01:47:39,202 --> 01:47:41,636
[Biggs]
Where didheshoot him?

1434
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:43,764
[Cao]
ln the head:

1435
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,104
Thankyou:
No furtherquestions:

1436
01:47:50,513 --> 01:47:54,609
[ Sighs ] Were your men annihilating
that platoon of marines?

1437
01:47:54,684 --> 01:47:56,618
Yes.

1438
01:47:56,686 --> 01:47:59,678
Did Colonel Childers force you
to call your men off?

1439
01:47:59,756 --> 01:48:01,781
Yes.

1440
01:48:01,858 --> 01:48:03,792
Do you believe his actions
were calculated to save...

1441
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:07,887
- the lives ofAmerican marines?
- Yes.

1442
01:48:07,964 --> 01:48:10,364
Would you have done the same
thing Colonel Childers did...

1443
01:48:10,433 --> 01:48:12,367
ifthe situation
had been reversed?

1444
01:48:19,876 --> 01:48:21,810
Colonel Cao, would you have shot...

1445
01:48:21,878 --> 01:48:24,312
a captive American radio operator
in the head ifyou thought...

1446
01:48:24,381 --> 01:48:29,080
it would persuade Colonel Childers
to spare the lives ofyour own men?

1447
01:48:32,822 --> 01:48:35,313
Yes.

1448
01:48:38,128 --> 01:48:41,063
No more questions.

1449
01:48:41,131 --> 01:48:43,565
[Judge] This court is in recess
until tomorrowat 0900:

1450
01:48:43,633 --> 01:48:45,567
- We willhearclosing arguments:
- [GaveIPounds]

1451
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:57,906
- General, goodto seeyou:
- Perry, good to see you too.

1452
01:48:57,981 --> 01:49:00,677
I want you to meet
my grandson.

1453
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:03,048
Hi. Nice to meet
you, sir.

1454
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:05,144
Thanks.

1455
01:49:08,758 --> 01:49:11,625
[Biggs] Colonel Terry Childers
is a decorated warhero,

1456
01:49:11,695 --> 01:49:14,425
a trusted leader
ofAmerican marines,

1457
01:49:14,497 --> 01:49:17,864
and I wish that was
all there was to it.

1458
01:49:17,934 --> 01:49:21,267
Unfortunately, there are
83 dead Yemeni citizens,

1459
01:49:21,337 --> 01:49:24,500
many ofthem
women and children.

1460
01:49:24,574 --> 01:49:28,567
Colonel Hodges would have you
believe that this crowd was armed.

1461
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:30,977
He would also have you believe
that there is a videotape...

1462
01:49:31,047 --> 01:49:33,379
proving this to be true.

1463
01:49:36,419 --> 01:49:40,287
There is no tape
exonerating Colonel Childers.

1464
01:49:40,356 --> 01:49:44,053
There is no evidence
exonerating Colonel Childers!

1465
01:49:51,367 --> 01:49:55,963
Is Colonel Childers a man capable of
killing defenseless, unarmed people?

1466
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,302
Is he capable ofordering
the execution...

1467
01:50:00,376 --> 01:50:03,743
of innocent
men and women?

1468
01:50:03,813 --> 01:50:08,910
Is he capable ofexecuting
P.O.W.s with his own hand?

1469
01:50:08,985 --> 01:50:11,818
Unfortunately,
we have shown that he is.

1470
01:50:11,888 --> 01:50:14,379
You have heard the sad testimony
of Colonel Cao...

1471
01:50:14,457 --> 01:50:17,722
who witnessed Colonel Childers'
barbarism fil rsthand.

1472
01:50:19,829 --> 01:50:22,730
You've even heard
Colonel Childers' own admission...

1473
01:50:22,799 --> 01:50:27,168
that his desire was to "waste"
them, regardless ofwho they were.

1474
01:50:30,807 --> 01:50:34,903
Now, we are faced
with the diffilcult prospect...

1475
01:50:34,978 --> 01:50:37,344
ofconvicting
one ofour own.

1476
01:50:37,413 --> 01:50:40,382
None of us wants to do this,
but you've heard the facts,

1477
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:42,680
and it is unavoidable.

1478
01:50:42,752 --> 01:50:46,688
Colonel Terry Childers ordered
the senseless slaughter...

1479
01:50:46,756 --> 01:50:49,623
ofa peaceful crowd!

1480
01:50:49,692 --> 01:50:53,788
Now, asmarines,

1481
01:50:53,863 --> 01:50:57,890
we do notget the luxury
ofcovering up ourmistakes:

1482
01:50:57,967 --> 01:51:00,731
We must air them,

1483
01:51:00,804 --> 01:51:04,365
thereby ensuring
that they never happen again.

1484
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,204
Thankyou.

1485
01:51:14,384 --> 01:51:16,318
That's sovereign
United States territory...

1486
01:51:16,386 --> 01:51:19,321
as much as if it were
in Ohio or Maryland.

1487
01:51:19,389 --> 01:51:21,880
Colonel Childers didn't
volunteer to go over there.

1488
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:24,984
He was ordered to go there because
he was the best man for thejob.

1489
01:51:25,061 --> 01:51:27,052
We armed him.
We trained him.

1490
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:29,724
We sent him over there to risk
his life to save other Americans.

1491
01:51:29,799 --> 01:51:33,235
And then ask him
not to return fil re?

1492
01:51:33,303 --> 01:51:37,000
There are over 300 bullet holes
in this building.

1493
01:51:37,073 --> 01:51:41,772
Colonel Childers didn't open fil re.
He returned fil re.

1494
01:51:41,845 --> 01:51:45,781
And he waited until after three
of his marines were dead...

1495
01:51:45,849 --> 01:51:48,113
and another lay
mortally wounded.

1496
01:51:48,184 --> 01:51:50,709
He waited until he was
personally under heavy fil re.

1497
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:54,814
He waited until he saw
that crowd holding weapons.

1498
01:51:54,891 --> 01:51:58,452
Only then did he order
his men to return fil re.

1499
01:51:58,528 --> 01:52:00,393
Under the rules ofengagement,
a civilian pointing a weapon...

1500
01:52:00,463 --> 01:52:02,363
is no longer a civilian,

1501
01:52:02,432 --> 01:52:05,060
and the use ofdeadly force
is authorized...

1502
01:52:05,134 --> 01:52:08,626
in order to save lives.

1503
01:52:08,705 --> 01:52:11,196
It's not murder.

1504
01:52:12,342 --> 01:52:14,276
It's combat.

1505
01:52:15,578 --> 01:52:17,739
ColoneIChilders is
the only man alive:::

1506
01:52:17,814 --> 01:52:20,146
who was in a position
to see that crowd.

1507
01:52:20,216 --> 01:52:22,810
But the camera on the embassy
roof had the same point ofview.

1508
01:52:22,886 --> 01:52:24,683
The government
would have you believe...

1509
01:52:24,754 --> 01:52:26,813
there's no tape
from that camera.

1510
01:52:26,890 --> 01:52:30,326
I have shown you that that tape was
delivered to the State Department.

1511
01:52:30,393 --> 01:52:32,884
Do you believe that tape
got up and walked out...

1512
01:52:32,962 --> 01:52:35,328
ofthe State Department
on its own?

1513
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,698
By not producing that tape,
the national security advisor,

1514
01:52:39,769 --> 01:52:43,762
Mr. Sokal, has brought dishonor
into this court.

1515
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,469
Without that tape, lcannotshow
you that the crowdfiredfirst:::

1516
01:52:47,543 --> 01:52:49,704
and that Colonel Childers
is innocent.

1517
01:52:49,779 --> 01:52:52,680
But without that tape,
they cannot prove...

1518
01:52:52,749 --> 01:52:55,843
beyond a reasonable doubt
that he's guilty!

1519
01:52:55,919 --> 01:52:58,149
[Sighs]

1520
01:52:58,221 --> 01:53:00,553
Here's my case.

1521
01:53:00,623 --> 01:53:03,251
He's all I've got.
Thirty-two years ofservice,

1522
01:53:03,326 --> 01:53:05,692
thirty-two years of heroism
as a United States Marine.

1523
01:53:05,762 --> 01:53:08,629
Regardless of
whatyou decide here,

1524
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:10,962
ColoneIChilders'career
asa marine is over.

1525
01:53:11,034 --> 01:53:13,025
He willneveragain
commandmen in combat:

1526
01:53:13,102 --> 01:53:16,367
The ambassador and his family
are alive today because of him.

1527
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:18,532
And I know how
the ambassador feels,

1528
01:53:18,608 --> 01:53:20,872
because Colonel Childers
saved my life too.

1529
01:53:20,944 --> 01:53:22,878
