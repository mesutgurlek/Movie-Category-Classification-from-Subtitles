1
00:01:55,063 --> 00:02:00,377
<i>Here was Troy 3000 years ago,
a city of destiny...</i>

2
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:03,183
<i>...so situated that it dominated
the Hellespont...</i>

3
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:05,381
<i>... today known as the Dardanelles.</i>

4
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:08,981
<i>This was the only sea route
to and from the east.</i>

5
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,454
<i>As a result, Troy grew prosperous...</i>

6
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,460
<i>...a tempting prize of war
for the Greek nations.</i>

7
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:20,257
<i>The Trojans had long memories of the
time when the Greeks, led by Sparta...</i>

8
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:23,578
<i>...had pillaged and burned
the city of their fathers.</i>

9
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:28,503
<i>They had prepared strong defenses
against the possibility of future assault.</i>

10
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:31,626
<i>That is why new Troy,
their rebuilt city...</i>

11
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:35,338
<i>... was guarded by mighty walls,
an impregnable shelter...</i>

12
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:38,740
<i>...for a happy people in love with beauty.</i>

13
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:41,380
<i>In the palace square
and the busy streets...</i>

14
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,986
<i>... the industrious citizens were enjoying
the works of peace...</i>

15
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,985
<i>...as though this carefree era
would last forever.</i>

16
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:52,989
<i>There was Lord Aeneas,
nephew of King Priam...</i>

17
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:54,949
<i>...on his way to the palace...</i>

18
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:59,743
<i>... where the future of Troy
was being weighed by the royal council.</i>

19
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,866
And so we've locked out
the understanding of nations. . .

20
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:06,470
. . .and we've locked in the poison.
Trojans jumping at every rumor. . .

21
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:10,229
. . .pointing fingers at each other.
I tell you there's only one solution.

22
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:13,865
Have your way. Go to Sparta.
Go wherever you will. . .

23
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:17,074
. . .but don't try to drag
the destiny of Troy with you.

24
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:19,544
What destiny, to live like a crab
in a shell?

25
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:20,705
We live well.

26
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:23,430
We tax traders at the sea gate.
That's our blood.

27
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:27,431
Stupidity! We'll choke on our own fat
unless we sail our ships of trade.

28
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:29,986
But how can we,
when every harbor is an enemy's?

29
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:33,069
-Oh, I'm sick of your crazy dreams.
-Careful, brother.

30
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:35,866
Paris has always been able
to crack your neck.

31
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:38,035
And you can thrash us both.

32
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:40,838
-Tell him he's a fool, Hector!
-My sons. . .

33
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,396
. . .the fool is the man who makes
a quarrel of a debate.

34
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,757
Paris, I bless your plan to sail to Sparta.

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,309
I know I can trust you not to beg
for peace.

36
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,916
I'll try to convince the Greeks
our power makes a treaty advisable.

37
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,395
I'd convince them.

38
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:58,871
I'd take 100 ships of war
and burn the soil of Sparta black!

39
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm sure you would, Polydorus,
and create endless war.

40
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:06,351
And you, Hector,
do you aspire to anything. . .

41
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:09,196
-. . .but to excel at swordplay and boxing?
-Yes, sire.

42
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:11,797
The javelin and the discus.

43
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,955
Hector's a good son, Priam.

44
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:17,674
And a good husband, my lord.
Is that not sufficient glory?

45
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,120
By your leave, Paris' ship
is ready to sail.

46
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:22,355
Do the gods approve the day
and the hour?

47
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:26,484
The omens are good and also
the prophecies, with but one exception.

48
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:28,762
One troubled priestess of the temple.

49
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:32,004
-My daughter.
-Don't be angry, Priam.

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,477
-Cassandra is ill.
-Sick in the mind.

51
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,959
Arise, Paris. . .

52
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,765
. . .and go.

53
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:45,926
The virgin Cassandra does make one
point that causes me much concern.

54
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:49,878
Prince Paris, it appears, gives all
his worship to one goddess alone.

55
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:53,883
-Aphrodite.
-I'm not sure I worship anything.

56
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,608
No.

57
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,365
Admiration is the better word.

58
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,045
Admiration for the beauty
of a marble image.

59
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:06,045
It was not the goddess of beauty who
taught us to arm against our enemies. . .

60
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,851
. . .but Athena, the goddess of wisdom. . .

61
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:11,685
. . .and the patroness
of the horses of war.

62
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:14,088
Athena does not rejoice in this. . . .

63
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:16,562
This solitary adoration of yours.

64
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:20,129
Neither is she delighted
that you undertake a mission of peace.

65
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:23,764
And I suppose that evil horse of hers
will spring out and trample me.

66
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:26,402
Very well. Let it come, my lord. . .

67
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:29,248
. . .if that's the price
of living in a world of fables.

68
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:31,087
Do not say that, Paris.

69
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,451
Do not seek peace elsewhere,
dear brother. . .

70
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:36,572
. . .until first you have pacified Athena.

71
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,808
My little Cassandra, there can be
no postponement.

72
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:42,046
Give me your blessing
for a happy voyage.

73
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,287
I cannot bless what I see
in your future.

74
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:45,651
Cassandra!

75
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:48,935
-Cassandra, stop this.
-But, Father, it's true.

76
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:51,771
What I see and feel is true.

77
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:55,410
Go, Paris.

78
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,937
Come, Cassandra.

79
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:04,297
-Come and rest a while.
-How can I, Mother?

80
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,617
Oh, I wish it hadn't been given me. . .

81
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,419
. . .this agony I live with.

82
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:20,210
Paris!

83
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:23,171
Paris, don't go. Please don't go.

84
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,062
-I must sail at once.
-lf you have any love for Troy. . .

85
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:28,657
. . .don't bring this dreadful thing
upon us.

86
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:32,373
-And I thought you loved me best of all.
-I do, but. . .

87
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:35,616
. . .the noise, the storm grows so great.

88
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:39,853
The screaming of horses,
the cries of dying men.

89
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:44,456
-Take care of her.
-My dear, my dear.

90
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:13,542
Perhaps it could not be otherwise.

91
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,103
What must be, no one can change.

92
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:07,509
Where are we today? Elysium?

93
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:10,112
Far from it. We're nearing Sparta. . .

94
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:14,477
. . .a harsh military land, where a man
will cut off his arm to prove he's brave.

95
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,949
-I wonder what the women look like.
-My profound Cousin Aeneas.

96
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,509
To think deeply, Paris,
one must think of women.

97
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,240
They bring all life into the world
and much death.

98
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,360
-They sway the destinies of men.
-Not my destiny.

99
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:31,279
What's the matter?

100
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,912
Oh, just a quickening of the breeze.

101
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:36,437
But I don't like the hot breath of it.

102
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:40,274
Oh, it's nothing.
Only one drifting cloud up there.

103
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,277
Up the mast with you!

104
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:18,567
-I command you! Climb the mast!
-Drop the sail!

105
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:22,927
My prince, the ropes are fouled,
and these men refuse to climb the mast.

106
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,887
-I'll flay them!
-No!

107
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,723
There's only one way
to cure these fantasies.

108
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,405
No, my prince, not you. No!

109
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,923
Paris!

110
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,922
Paris!

111
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,411
Paris!

112
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:00,846
Paris! Paris!

113
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:08,685
Paris!

114
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,176
Megas!

115
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:17,500
Aphrodite.

116
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,345
What?

117
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:24,024
Some ship had bad luck.

118
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:26,457
She does exist.

119
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,705
-Who?
-The fairest goddess.

120
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,745
This creature is crazy.

121
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,342
But with a nice sort of craziness.

122
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:39,507
What was your ship?

123
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:42,017
<i>The Dolphin...</i>

124
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:44,385
-. . .of Troy.
-A Trojan.

125
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,588
Cut him loose, Andros.

126
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,630
Maybe we can warm some life into him
before we turn him over to the soldiers.

127
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:58,422
Women! Why warm a man
to cut his throat?

128
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,183
Cover him up, quickly.

129
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,746
We're looking for our sovereign lady,
the Queen of Sparta.

130
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:17,908
She came to the shore
to visit a nurse of her childhood days.

131
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:23,465
-My lady.
-I left orders not to be disturbed here.

132
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:27,231
But there are certain developments
which make this beach unsafe today.

133
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:30,035
A strange ship was sighted
running out of the storm.

134
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:32,108
We couldn't go after her.
Heavy seas.

135
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:35,269
She might have been Trojan.
It's possible she left spies.

136
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:38,350
You see Trojan phantoms everywhere.

137
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,317
-This was no phantom ship.
-The emblem of the royal House of Troy.

138
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,111
The king would want me to insist
that his queen return at once.

139
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,910
Inform King Menelaus
that Cora is taking excellent care of me.

140
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:05,079
Go along now.

141
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:08,435
Very well, my lady.

142
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,440
Andraste!

143
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:30,875
-Andraste, help us carry this man.
-A man, my lady?

144
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,241
How interesting!

145
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,648
-I can't risk hiding a Trojan.
-Yes.

146
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,008
What if he's a warrior and only
pretending? You must be careful.

147
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:11,959
Women who are always careful
miss much in life, Andraste.

148
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,287
He doesn't seem to recover.

149
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,843
But his heart beats.

150
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,168
Give him some broth,
and we'll turn him over.

151
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:32,007
-Good.
-Oh, no! They'll kill him.

152
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:34,689
-I still say good.
-And I, too, would say so. . .

153
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:38,404
-. . .if he were as unattractive as you.
-Thank you.

154
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,885
To whom am I indebted
for this gallant defense?

155
00:14:41,056 --> 00:14:44,765
Nobody of importance.
I am only a slave.

156
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,056
Now tell us about yourself, Trojan.

157
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:53,209
Did I mention that?

158
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:55,888
My memory is clouded.

159
00:14:57,618 --> 00:15:00,497
But I do recall I thought you a vision.

160
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,217
A goddess.

161
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:07,737
Dear Aphrodite. . .

162
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,054
. . .allow me to present myself.

163
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,970
-Prince Paris of Troy.
-We'll dispense with impudence.

164
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:18,738
You're a bit impudent yourself
for whatever you are, a slave?

165
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,974
-Silence! You're addressing--
-A slave of the palace, Andros.

166
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:24,891
Of what importance is that?

167
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:30,097
I tell you truly, I am Prince Paris.

168
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,860
I come to offer a treaty of peace
to King Menelaus.

169
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:37,938
But of course, you don't believe me.

170
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,095
My articles of identity. . .

171
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:43,302
. . .all the gifts I was bringing
to the Court of Sparta. . . .

172
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:46,104
My crew won't come near
a Spartan harbor now.

173
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:49,303
They'll swear the gods
hurled lightning at me.

174
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:52,657
Perhaps I do believe you.

175
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,341
The sea has damaged your appearance,
but not your manner.

176
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,786
You must leave here at nightfall.

177
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:08,180
Follow the coast. You'll reach a cove
where Phoenician ships put in.

178
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:12,103
-No. I still have a mission.
-Do as I tell you!

179
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,742
Our soldiers have a habit
of plunging a dagger into strangers.

180
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,787
And why should that worry you?

181
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,306
Never mind. The feelings
of a slave are of no importance.

182
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,029
They are to me.

183
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,627
In any place but Sparta,
one so fair would be a queen.

184
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,510
In Troy, we'd make songs about you.

185
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,742
King Menelaus would not permit
that here.

186
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:33,221
Because you'd make
his queen look plain.

187
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,349
She would be pained to hear you
say that.

188
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:36,628
Do you know her?

189
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:40,229
She owns me. I'm her shadow.

190
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:44,503
And I always thought I knew her.

191
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:48,625
No, I don't believe anyone knows
Queen Helen very well. . .

192
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,233
-. . .including Helen.
-Not even the king?

193
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:55,034
Great power doesn't need knowledge.

194
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:57,996
Wait. I only ask these questions. . .

195
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:00,829
-. . .because I must go to the palace.
-Don't chance it.

196
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:04,069
I intend to be discreet, so prepare me.

197
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,751
If Menelaus won't help me,
I'll ask the queen.

198
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:09,233
That you must never do! l--

199
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:13,152
Oh, if you were old and ugly,
maybe then she could help you.

200
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:16,996
But you're not old, nor ugly.

201
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,192
It's late, Andros.
We must get the fish to market.

202
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,148
Gladly. If the soldiers find him here,
I don't want to be involved.

203
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,514
I wouldn't mind.

204
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,277
We must get back to the palace,
Andraste. I've stayed here too long.

205
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,640
Promise me. . .

206
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,240
. . .we'll meet again.

207
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:18,764
You can go back now.

208
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:31,166
Supplies, for your voyage home.

209
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,245
So you still hope
I won't go to the palace?

210
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,559
More than ever.

211
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,485
The kings of Greece are gathering there
to consider a war against Troy.

212
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,119
Then my mission was well-timed.

213
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:44,966
-When will they be in council?
-Tomorrow, perhaps.

214
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:46,724
But tonight. . .

215
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,247
. . .there are only you and I.

216
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:52,369
Under the magic of the moonlight.

217
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:55,411
Here. See what I brought you?

218
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:57,963
My dear little slave girl. . .

219
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:01,365
. . .I don't want what you steal
from the palace.

220
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,363
I only want what I steal
from the palace.

221
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:06,332
No, my prince.

222
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,687
Very well, then, I'll borrow you.

223
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,766
But we'll be quite honest about it.

224
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:14,770
-I'll offer to buy you from the queen.
-Oh, no! That would mean death!

225
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,164
Nonsense.

226
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:19,135
I'll explain to her that
you're no slave to me. . .

227
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:21,765
. . .but my future Princess of Troy.

228
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:24,087
Let me go, Paris.

229
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,737
Don't you believe I could love a slave?

230
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:29,895
Yes, I believe.

231
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:32,573
My heart believes and loves you.

232
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:37,210
My heart is yours, Paris,
but I can never be.

233
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,172
You must not seek out the queen,
nor anyone at the palace.

234
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:51,694
And this moment must be our last.

235
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:54,254
Don't ask me why.

236
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:57,095
Call it magic, call it a dream.

237
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,255
And never speak of it to anyone.

238
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,862
Hear our Spartan host, King Menelaus.

239
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:23,382
-Are you sure Ulysses is coming?
-His ship was not far behind mine.

240
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:26,459
This great lthacan refused to leave
his wife and farm.

241
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:29,187
He's so sick of war,
he wouldn't let go of the plow.

242
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:33,057
Till his child was cast in front of it,
to convince him Greece's glory. . .

243
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:34,627
. . .comes before contentment.

244
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:37,666
You can have the glory.
I'll take Troy's gold.

245
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,740
Not my share, brother.

246
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:41,865
Ulysses, King of lthaca!

247
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:48,227
Greetings, friend.
You're acquainted with everyone.

248
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,019
Ajax, Prince of Salamis.
Nestor, King of Pylos.

249
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,988
Diomedes, ruler of Aetolia.

250
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:57,382
And I think you know my brother,
King Agamemnon of Mycenae.

251
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:00,305
Greetings, fellow pirates.

252
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:05,307
It is a righteous war we plan, Ulysses. . .

253
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,270
. . .a war of defensive aggression.

254
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:09,432
A neat sort of righteousness.

255
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:12,346
You think the Trojans built a citadel
for peace-lovers?

256
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:14,072
Have you heard of Priam's sons?

257
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:16,907
Polydorus begs for war!
Hector wants only a challenge.

258
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:19,827
Paris is anyone's equal with a cestus,
bow and javelin.

259
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,394
You believe they want peace?

260
00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:24,388
All the more reason why we
cannot plan without Achilles.

261
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:26,147
But he hates my brother and me--

262
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:28,750
He hates you almost as much
as he loves war.

263
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,465
In order to lock himself from
all temptation of joining with us. . .

264
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:36,232
. . .he hid himself securely,
in a house of women.

265
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:41,267
That's where I found him,
hiding from all persuasion. . .

266
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:42,632
. . .dressed as a woman!

267
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,157
Did you persuade him?

268
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:49,550
Yes. He's here at the stables,
seeing to the care of his horses.

269
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,070
Achilles, a blushing girl.

270
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:55,516
I shall commend him for the beauty
of his face and figure.

271
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,476
The man who blows his own horn.

272
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:30,522
Commend him, Menelaus.

273
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:34,597
I commend you, Achilles.

274
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:36,996
And I despise you.

275
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:39,282
And you, Agamemnon.

276
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:42,037
But it seems we must unite. . .

277
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,277
. . .so I am here to lead you.

278
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:49,166
-Lead us, Achilles?
-Of course.

279
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,364
I and my good friend Patroclus.

280
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:54,440
Since we were boys,
we could stand alone and defy an army.

281
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:56,201
-I question that.
-Who?

282
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:59,122
I, Ajax.

283
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,048
My imitator.

284
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,644
You disgusting glory-hunter.

285
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,643
To imitate him, I'd need to wear
three layers of armor.

286
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,723
That's where he gets his reputation
for being invulnerable.

287
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:11,802
Silence this fool, Menelaus.

288
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:15,003
I would prefer not to be angered by him.

289
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:19,925
The truth of the matter is,
his skin's as tender as his vanity.

290
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:22,322
And especially his heel.

291
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:26,008
-He can't even stand leather against it.
-I do not fight with my feet.

292
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,846
Take your ease, my prince.
I'll handle this buffoon.

293
00:23:29,013 --> 00:23:32,086
Enough of this.
We must remain united.

294
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:33,528
Impossible.

295
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:36,209
We've never been united,
and we never will be.

296
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,366
Keep my horses ready.

297
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:40,054
Patroclus, we shall leave.

298
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:42,854
I see no ethical purpose
for a raid on Troy.

299
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:46,452
-Nor I.
-Now, wait. Wait.

300
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:51,008
Here. You talk of ethics.

301
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:54,330
Here's the sign of a Trojan ship
prowling our shores.

302
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:57,808
No peaceful trader,
but a royal ship of the House of Priam.

303
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,128
It was my ship, sire.

304
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:03,054
I am Paris of Troy.

305
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:04,777
-You are King Menelaus?
-Yes.

306
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:08,694
Sorry to present myself like this,
I was swept overboard in the storm.

307
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:12,252
Fortunately, this gathering
of the most royal of Greece. . .

308
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,490
. . .makes my mission easier.

309
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,540
-How'd you know we were here?
-I beg my lord's indulgence, I know.

310
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:21,010
So I'm saved from
journeying to each king. . .

311
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:24,219
. . .if you decide against offers of peace
I bring from Troy.

312
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:27,099
-What?
-Troy does not plan war?

313
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,333
You are wrong, Menelaus.

314
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,695
Stop this or lose your Trojan plunder.

315
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:35,661
-Where'd you find this impostor?
-He came to the palace.

316
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:38,543
-I thought you'd question him.
-You interrupt council!

317
00:24:38,704 --> 00:24:40,660
-Hear him.
-This is our business.

318
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:44,261
He's only some wandering vagabond.
See the rags he wears.

319
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:46,980
These roving jesters
come often to my palace.

320
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:49,705
And they never fail
to have some nimble talent.

321
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,175
What do you do besides
this royal imposture?

322
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:55,422
It seems I try to do the impossible.

323
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:57,459
The cesti.

324
00:24:57,626 --> 00:25:00,505
If he's Paris, he should have
some skill with the cesti.

325
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:04,057
-Brilliant, brother, brilliant.
-You heard, Ajax, Achilles?

326
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:05,741
Achilles is weary from travel.

327
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:09,537
Achilles did not make his reputation
fighting children.

328
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,786
This Sparta, my son, is a viper's nest.

329
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,623
-I'll see you aren't--
-lf we offend the pretender. . .

330
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,180
-. . .I give him leave to go.
-No.

331
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:29,263
After all, part of my task
was to spread civilization.

332
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:31,149
But I must exact an agreement.

333
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:35,630
If I come fairly out of this fight,
will you believe that I am Paris. . .

334
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,544
. . .and hear the Trojan peace terms?

335
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:40,386
If your head's still
on your shoulders, yes.

336
00:26:56,964 --> 00:26:58,682
Paris!

337
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:16,606
My good Trojan, you have used
a Spartan persuasion on me: courage.

338
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:20,246
My courage almost failed me
at the thought of meeting Ajax.

339
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,896
You shall rest.

340
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,775
And tomorrow we shall talk.

341
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,968
About your adventures,
your voyage. . .

342
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,096
. . .and the secret charm
that makes me call you "friend. "

343
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:31,055
And Troy shall call Sparta "friend. "

344
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:34,888
Alpheus, find quarters for our guest.

345
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,692
And, Alpheus. . .

346
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,771
. . .they say the Trojans have
great eyes for beauty.

347
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:43,933
Find him a slave
and see that she is beautiful.

348
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,259
There is one slave in your palace for
whom I'd gladly become a slave myself.

349
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,173
Menelaus!

350
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:58,694
You expressed a wish yesterday
to present your guests to me.

351
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,693
A proud wish.

352
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:05,295
Helen, Queen of Sparta,
wife to Menelaus. . .

353
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:08,261
. . .I present Paris,
Prince Royal of Troy.

354
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:12,542
Why are you here, Trojan?

355
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:14,422
To study our arts and culture?

356
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:18,135
Yes, my lady.
The art of self-preservation.

357
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:20,375
Trojan impudence!

358
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:21,819
By your leave, my lord. . .

359
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:25,581
. . .I shall receive the Greeks
at some happier moment.

360
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:50,178
I heard my lady was truly Spartan
this afternoon.

361
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,466
My heart behaved like a fool.

362
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,508
I'm sure Menelaus could hear it beating.

363
00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:20,428
Tell your servants to go.

364
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,826
You may go.

365
00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:35,794
-Get out!
-When will you learn?

366
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:38,710
The man can neither speak nor hear.

367
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,077
What did you think of the Trojan?

368
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:57,037
-You saw what I thought.
-Yes, I saw what you thought.

369
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:59,191
Of this Trojan anyway.

370
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,751
What is this game you're playing?

371
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,958
Helen, you reveal yourself.
So does he.

372
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:08,238
Speak plainly. If I've given you
some offense, punish me. . .

373
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:12,361
. . .but don't welcome a stranger with
one hand and strike him with the other!

374
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,916
So now we're fond of Trojans?

375
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,156
I might do many things with him.
I might send him home. . .

376
00:31:21,323 --> 00:31:23,154
. . .with his appearance altered.

377
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:26,396
I might hold him hostage
to bleed tribute out of Priam.

378
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:28,634
I imagined once I had married a king.

379
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,557
-You married a king.
-I married a robber.

380
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,478
Why did you marry him?
Why did you marry him?

381
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:40,316
When a king takes spoils,
he robs no one.

382
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:43,523
When he kills, he commits no murder.
He fulfills justice.

383
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:45,119
The way of a Spartan.

384
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:48,120
I understand these things.
You do not.

385
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:49,481
I understand enough.

386
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:52,401
Then understand your place
in the palace, nowhere else!

387
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:55,366
You've seen this man before.
Admit it.

388
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,444
Your silence condemns you.

389
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:05,567
You've been out of the palace secretly.
Admit it. You know this man.

390
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:10,246
Silent as ever. No words for me,
your husband. I am your husband!

391
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,131
-Don't.
-Say "husband" to me.

392
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,485
Say "husband" to me.

393
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:29,048
I can think of many ways of dealing
with your Trojan, Helen.

394
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:44,173
Andraste.

395
00:32:54,217 --> 00:32:56,811
I am the slave sent
to the Prince of Troy.

396
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,569
The queen's handmaiden, eh?

397
00:32:58,737 --> 00:33:00,968
The king commands me
to entertain his guests.

398
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:04,767
A fine Greek custom, but guest?
He's in a prison, if he only knew it.

399
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:07,737
Oh, I'm instructed that
he shall not know it.

400
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:10,652
Must King Menelaus command
you himself to admit me?

401
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:12,696
The royal temper's already running
a fever.

402
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,420
Shall I tell the king you said that?

403
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,418
Get to your business,
you little troublemaker.

404
00:33:28,142 --> 00:33:30,019
You should be in bed.

405
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:31,661
Yes, I should but--

406
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:34,576
But your mistress sent you
to play another trick on me.

407
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,462
No. She sent me to help you escape.

408
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,575
Escape?

409
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,016
Those two soldiers
on watch down there. . .

410
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,658
. . .are they going to help me too?

411
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,893
You're a captive.
The king plans tortures for you.

412
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:59,019
You must leave quickly.
Return to the fisherman's hut.

413
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,491
I'll go a distance with you
to point the way.

414
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:04,256
My good friend Menelaus.

415
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:07,971
-The door is also watched.
-Then what chance have I?

416
00:35:14,552 --> 00:35:16,862
Helen thought to make you
look like a merchant.

417
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,263
Any fool could see you're a prince.

418
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,230
-Soldiers.
-Fisherman!

419
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:22,587
-Yes?
-Fisherman!

420
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,107
Yes?

421
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:28,112
-What do you want?
-A cup of wine.

422
00:35:28,274 --> 00:35:32,234
-Our throats are salted by the breeze.
-Oh. Cora, the wineskin.

423
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,588
The captain's an idiot.
Does he think the man will swim?

424
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:37,792
He'd be deep in the forest by now.

425
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:40,550
Here. Take it with you.

426
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,267
Go, and remember,
there will be soldiers above. . .

427
00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:54,793
. . .so you'd best try the rocks
under the cliff.

428
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:58,588
Get to a cove beyond the tower.
There, a boat will send you to the ship.

429
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:01,193
Wings of Mercury speed you.

430
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,798
Why do you wait?

431
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,349
It was just a foolish hope.

432
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,280
-I half-imagined she'd come.
-Here?

433
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,635
She sent you garments. . .

434
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,396
. . .arranged for a Phoenician ship
to take you home. What more, Trojan?

435
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:16,552
I didn't really expect her to come.

436
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,077
-I only hoped.
-Don't even breathe it.

437
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,995
If she should show her face here
and be recognized. . . .

438
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:23,641
I know.

439
00:36:24,003 --> 00:36:26,801
And I wish I could repay you
for your kindness.

440
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,793
And for the queen. . .

441
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:33,637
. . .tell her she'll walk in all my dreams.

442
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:42,293
Wait!

443
00:37:42,454 --> 00:37:44,251
The ship is not yet in the cove.

444
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:46,174
Helen.

445
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:49,332
Andraste, you are free.

446
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:53,647
-Go as far away as you can from Sparta.
-My lady.

447
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:55,927
You made clear to Adelphus what I said?

448
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,328
-He is far off by this time.
-Then be on your way.

449
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:01,692
Freedom is made of quicksilver
sometimes.

450
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:09,130
Go. Hurry.

451
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:19,138
Helen.

452
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,052
Helen is the queen.

453
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,656
The girl you thought you knew
was quite nameless and without reality.

454
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,495
I can't believe that.

455
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:28,731
-It was she who helped me to escape.
-No.

456
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:31,734
That was the queen who hates cruelty.

457
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:34,657
She would have done the same
for any slave.

458
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:36,540
I see.

459
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:41,540
She is the queen who
comes here to say this.

460
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:44,376
She will always remember
the gentle Paris.

461
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:47,854
And she will do her small part
to turn this nation from war.

462
00:38:48,504 --> 00:38:50,893
-You're not a Spartan.
-I am.

463
00:38:51,304 --> 00:38:54,024
Daughter of a king who chose
a Spartan husband for me.

464
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,334
A man you despised.

465
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:58,861
I despise oppression,
as do many others here.

466
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,174
We need to be Spartan to endure it.

467
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:04,860
And we need to be understood.

468
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:06,061
You are.

469
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:09,216
You, not Menelaus, will be Sparta to me.

470
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:13,380
I'll tell my father there's still hope.
I'll tell Troy what I've seen and heard.

471
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:16,108
The rulers divided,
unable to find cause for war. . .

472
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:18,498
. . .even the Spartan people.

473
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:27,460
Stop worrying.
The kings have been carousing all night.

474
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:59,109
And so she is real, that one I loved.

475
00:39:59,914 --> 00:40:01,473
Yes.

476
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:06,305
The gods sometimes change
the bravest of intentions.

477
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:09,912
They are kind.
I'll never doubt them again.

478
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:15,949
Oh, Helen.

479
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:19,947
Helen, you are a slave as long
as Menelaus possesses you.

480
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:23,196
Come away to freedom.
Come to Troy with me.

481
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,033
And destroy the hope of peace
you were taking home with you?

482
00:40:28,118 --> 00:40:29,472
No.

483
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,789
If even one Trojan dies on the walls,
I'm a failure.

484
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,152
Forgive me, Helen.

485
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,756
You are two women,
both wise and good.

486
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,833
I am two men.

487
00:40:43,281 --> 00:40:45,636
One fairly good, I try to believe.

488
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:47,154
The other, very bad indeed.

489
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:49,478
One is a man.

490
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:52,281
The other just a boy, I think.

491
00:40:53,482 --> 00:40:58,477
Paris, let him be so always.
Never let him grow old.

492
00:41:09,685 --> 00:41:11,118
Helen.

493
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:19,604
The ship.

494
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,163
And now I must go back.

495
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:28,123
It is a way the gods have. . .

496
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:31,485
. . .to give with one hand
and take with two.

497
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,879
Oh, no. This is not goodbye.

498
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:38,449
You shall still be with me
across the sea.

499
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:40,247
And you with me.

500
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:43,048
And always young, Paris, remember?

501
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,043
What is remembered is forever young.

502
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,000
Halt!

503
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:52,565
Stand still, Trojan.

504
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:55,928
-My lady, I ask you remove yourself--
-Send your archers away.

505
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,243
I beg the queen to stand
out of danger.

506
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:00,130
You wouldn't dare. You'll die.

507
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:04,081
I can no more than lose my own life,
and it's lost if I let him go.

508
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:01,500
Silence!

509
00:43:08,942 --> 00:43:10,375
Helen!

510
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:15,458
Helen! Helen!

511
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:17,261
-You lie. She's in there.
-No.

512
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:20,257
-She's in there. Break the locks!
-Break them.

513
00:43:21,024 --> 00:43:22,423
Break.

514
00:43:49,508 --> 00:43:51,100
It's true.

515
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:53,659
The Trojan's taken Helen.

516
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:55,660
He's carried her away.

517
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:58,901
By force, against her will.

518
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:03,143
To think of her struggles,
her fruitless cries for help.

519
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,064
We had our differences,
but she was my wife.

520
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,387
It goes deeper than that.

521
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:10,781
This is the assault of all women
in Greece.

522
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:13,102
Shame. Shame on every Greek nation.

523
00:44:13,272 --> 00:44:15,342
Then man your ships.
Follow them.

524
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:18,072
Ulysses, why do you sit?
She must be restored to me.

525
00:44:18,232 --> 00:44:20,952
-Not now, Menelaus. Later.
-Yes. Now, now, now!

526
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:22,751
Will you not stand with me?

527
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:26,668
Menelaus, we will reclaim her,
and with her, all the loot of Troy.

528
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,108
But only if you wait.

529
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:30,708
We'll send out a call
to every city in Greece.

530
00:44:30,874 --> 00:44:33,264
All Greeks united in a war of honor.

531
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:35,585
Yes. That's what the future will call it.

532
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:36,949
I call it that now.

533
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:40,153
This Prince of Troy has asked for war,
not peace.

534
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:42,228
Ulysses.

535
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:46,669
I'm sure you'll agree with me that it is
my duty to become our leader.

536
00:44:46,957 --> 00:44:48,515
Leader?

537
00:44:50,277 --> 00:44:52,268
I'll see no one but Achilles as leader.

538
00:44:52,437 --> 00:44:56,113
It is my consecrated duty to become
our leader to avenge my dear brother.

539
00:44:56,278 --> 00:45:00,032
Quite, quite, Agamemnon.
And I will follow you.

540
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,549
And tell you what to do, as usual.

541
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:05,472
And I will persuade
the sensitive Achilles. . .

542
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,790
. . .with certain fascinating facts. . .

543
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,509
. . .about the great store of gold
to be found in Troy.

544
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,435
I seek no treasure.
I will kill.

545
00:45:16,401 --> 00:45:18,551
So shall we all, brother.

546
00:45:20,081 --> 00:45:22,277
To defend your honor.

547
00:45:34,444 --> 00:45:35,843
Who are they?

548
00:45:36,004 --> 00:45:39,553
I don't know, but I know
the color of their gold.

549
00:45:44,365 --> 00:45:46,879
Sparta is the past, Helen.

550
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,202
Troy is this way.

551
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:53,716
What will they call us there?

552
00:45:53,886 --> 00:45:56,560
A woman who left her husband.

553
00:45:56,727 --> 00:45:59,116
A prince turned thief.

554
00:45:59,447 --> 00:46:01,324
What else can we ever be?

555
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:02,887
Two people in love.

556
00:46:03,048 --> 00:46:05,642
Against the world, if need be.

557
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,329
If I could make a bargain
with the gods. . .

558
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:14,878
. . .we would escape the world. . .

559
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,927
. . .never landing on any shore.

560
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:20,969
A lovely dream,
but somewhere we must land.

561
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:25,607
Paris, there's an island called Pelagos.

562
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:27,489
The sea can feed us.

563
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,371
And there are little houses
near the village well.

564
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:32,011
Let's go there.

565
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:34,891
I cannot. I was born to an obligation.

566
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:38,932
Paris, son of Priam, heir to responsibility.

567
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:44,643
I could leave the kingdoms of the world
and never miss them.

568
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:49,369
-But you--
-Helen. . .

569
00:46:49,535 --> 00:46:52,003
. . .our life together will fade
if I run from this.

570
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:55,292
It will become a slight thing
that any storm can tear apart.

571
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:56,605
No, Paris.

572
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:00,648
Forgive me.

573
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:05,365
I forget you are a woman,
not a goddess.

574
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:08,495
Captain.

575
00:47:11,178 --> 00:47:13,931
-You know the island of Pelagos?
-It's far southward. . .

576
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:17,853
-. . .through the Cytherean straits.
-Sail southward.

577
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:23,569
-Captain.
-Yes?

578
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,571
We have decided otherwise.

579
00:47:31,461 --> 00:47:34,294
Sail north to Troy.

580
00:48:06,786 --> 00:48:10,222
-What is it?
-You'll have to see, Lord Aeneas.

581
00:48:29,629 --> 00:48:31,029
Wait.

582
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,226
Aeneas, call the queen.

583
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,900
Paris!

584
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:49,471
Paris.

585
00:48:49,632 --> 00:48:52,022
Come and meet my brothers.

586
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:54,912
Hector, Polydorus.
I told you about them.

587
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:57,951
Lucky Paris. You could fall
in the black pit of Hades. . .

588
00:48:58,114 --> 00:49:00,184
. . .and come out with arms
full of sunshine.

589
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,504
He's always had a fine flair
for surprises.

590
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:05,269
I'm happy to see that you
diverted your mission. . .

591
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:08,393
. . .to an enterprise more to your talents.

592
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:10,750
Come.

593
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:16,268
-Aeneas.
-Paris.

594
00:49:17,436 --> 00:49:20,747
-Paris.
-I should have had faith.

595
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,987
The great god Zeus would never
let him die. . .

596
00:49:23,157 --> 00:49:26,036
-. . .and with him our hopes of peace.
-It's a miracle.

597
00:49:26,598 --> 00:49:29,158
Tell us what happened, Paris.

598
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:30,592
Here is your miracle.

599
00:49:30,758 --> 00:49:34,149
I would never have seen
Troy again but for her.

600
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,072
It would have taken
a sea sprite to save you.

601
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:39,879
How could one so tender
have managed it?

602
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,110
Postpone your questions.

603
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,320
She suffered an ordeal that I
shan't relate in her presence.

604
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:50,918
It's enough that our son has been
given back to us by you, my dear.

605
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:52,834
You are welcome, my child.

606
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:56,358
Paris, call the high steward.
See that she is made comfortable.

607
00:49:56,522 --> 00:49:58,752
Later, you shall tell me
of your adventures.

608
00:49:58,922 --> 00:50:00,914
At your command, Father.

609
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:05,317
My brother seems to have
forgotten his courtliness.

610
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:08,920
By what name, my lady,
shall we know you?

611
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:16,604
-My name is--
-Her name is death.

612
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:19,279
-Cassandra!
-Forgive her. She suffers an illness.

613
00:50:19,445 --> 00:50:20,561
Wait.

614
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,075
You were going to say?

615
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:29,284
I am Helen, Queen of Sparta.

616
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,802
The wife of King Menelaus?

617
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:35,517
-His wife no more.
-The goddess of beauty, Aphrodite. . .

618
00:50:35,688 --> 00:50:37,724
. . .come down to Earth in mortal form.

619
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:40,961
She will bring the disaster
I have prophesied.

620
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:45,759
Her name will be written
in letters of fire. Helen.

621
00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:49,004
Helen of Troy.

622
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,123
And she saved my life again. . .

623
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:57,805
. . .but at such risk to herself
that I couldn't leave her. . .

624
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,882
. . .to the mercy of the Spartans.

625
00:51:01,212 --> 00:51:04,045
I can see I've troubled you, sire.

626
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:08,210
But in your affection for me
and mine for you. . .

627
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:10,841
. . .I hope you will judge me fairly.

628
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:15,686
I would never have believed
that this could happen. . .

629
00:51:16,414 --> 00:51:18,769
. . .not through this son of mine.

630
00:51:19,414 --> 00:51:22,646
This son who shared my hope
of everlasting peace.

631
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:25,966
Who promised he would bring it.
And what have you brought?

632
00:51:26,135 --> 00:51:27,728
Dishonor.

633
00:51:27,896 --> 00:51:29,807
You have united the Greeks.

634
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:34,368
You have kindled a flame that will
weld them together against us.

635
00:51:34,537 --> 00:51:37,005
This will bring them
to our very shores.

636
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,371
That should delight you.

637
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:41,496
You may have to answer
for the death of many a good Trojan.

638
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:45,375
You have presumed too much
upon our affection.

639
00:51:45,538 --> 00:51:47,130
Paris. . .

640
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:52,009
. . .send her back to Sparta
and make your peace with Menelaus.

641
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:53,851
I'll never send her back.

642
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:58,088
-You reject every word of wisdom?
-My love has no logic.

643
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,899
It could only choose
between Troy and Pelagos.

644
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,055
Helen wanted to go to Pelagos. . .

645
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,496
. . .but I had to bring you the warning.

646
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:09,176
And she had the courage
to come with me.

647
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:11,412
But she was right.

648
00:52:11,822 --> 00:52:14,461
There is no heart in Troy.
We'll seek it elsewhere.

649
00:52:14,622 --> 00:52:17,262
The coward's way to avoid the fight?

650
00:52:17,943 --> 00:52:22,142
-You exceed the rights of a brother.
-And you. . . .

651
00:52:22,304 --> 00:52:24,613
You scorn every Trojan duty.

652
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,575
The damage is done.

653
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,054
Go or stay. It matters not.

654
00:52:30,225 --> 00:52:33,854
-I shall not see you again.
-Priam.

655
00:52:38,106 --> 00:52:41,815
Bring to the council chamber the armory
masters and the granary stewards.

656
00:52:41,986 --> 00:52:46,378
Tell them I want an estimate
of Troy's ability to withstand a siege.

657
00:52:57,229 --> 00:53:02,428
There were times when I almost forgot
that I had other children, Paris. . .

658
00:53:02,589 --> 00:53:06,822
. . .others to die, perhaps.

659
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:11,859
Destiny, Paris. Destiny.

660
00:53:13,031 --> 00:53:17,184
Every Trojan woman with son
or husband will curse you.

661
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:28,952
Well, don't worry, brother,
a war may clear the atmosphere.

662
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:32,789
War, the only thing
that could make you happy.

663
00:53:32,954 --> 00:53:36,583
Keep out of my way,
or you'll never live to enjoy it.

664
00:53:47,276 --> 00:53:50,792
-Lord Aeneas.
-You may go.

665
00:53:56,117 --> 00:53:59,588
The ship that brought you to Troy
is still in the harbor.

666
00:53:59,758 --> 00:54:02,795
My charioteer will take you there.

667
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,717
I see.

668
00:54:05,879 --> 00:54:09,155
Or if my lady prefers,
I'll arrange for a royal escort.

669
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:12,392
No, I won't delay.

670
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:21,197
Wait for us.

671
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:23,955
My chariot will be in the courtyard.

672
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:32,077
Athena wields much power, it seems.

673
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:36,912
-lf I return to Menelaus--
-No.

674
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:39,120
Pelagos?

675
00:54:39,284 --> 00:54:41,479
Yes, I'll take you to Pelagos.

676
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:48,642
You said our lives would fade
if you ran away.

677
00:54:48,805 --> 00:54:52,082
I also said that you'd be happy in Troy.

678
00:54:55,766 --> 00:54:57,518
Paris, the word has spread.

679
00:54:57,686 --> 00:55:00,645
-They are not armed with flowers.
-Quick, before they overrun the courtyard.

680
00:55:00,807 --> 00:55:04,038
They won't as long as they enjoy
their carnival.

681
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:07,006
-Take Helen to the harbor.
-Don't show yourself to them.

682
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:09,966
-See her aboard the ship.
-Paris!

683
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:12,768
Dog!

684
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:20,208
You expect us to fight a war
for your amusement?

685
00:55:32,932 --> 00:55:35,526
My brave Trojans. . .

686
00:55:35,692 --> 00:55:38,252
. . .will you show as much spirit against
the Spartan army. . .

687
00:55:38,412 --> 00:55:40,608
. . .as against one Spartan woman?

688
00:55:40,773 --> 00:55:44,527
Can you stand alone, each, in battle. . .

689
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:47,811
. . .or do you need the cowardice
of numbers to make you bold?

690
00:55:49,374 --> 00:55:53,368
Go home and search your hearts,
Trojans. . .

691
00:55:53,535 --> 00:55:56,652
. . .for all this must be answered soon.

692
00:56:09,897 --> 00:56:12,730
-You can leave safely now.
-Without you?

693
00:56:13,658 --> 00:56:18,652
I've gained a victory of a sort tonight.
I mustn't lose it, Helen.

694
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:23,855
There's no Pelagos if I'm there alone.

695
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:33,490
But there's always one island
where the storm can't touch us.

696
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:37,370
It's anyplace, Paris,
where we're together.

697
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:40,101
-Here?
-Oh, yes, even here.

698
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:50,896
<i>News reached Troy
that the Greeks were about to sail...</i>

699
00:56:51,063 --> 00:56:56,502
<i>... with the mightiest armada ever known
to man. The Trojans prepared for war.</i>

700
00:58:12,275 --> 00:58:14,743
Our signals have never warned
of so many ships.

701
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:17,225
-That's all right. We're ready.
-Hundreds.

702
00:58:17,396 --> 00:58:22,187
-Many more than we can count.
-Five, 600. More.

703
00:58:22,357 --> 00:58:25,986
-No less than 1000 ships.
-We'll make them pay a heavy price.

704
00:58:26,157 --> 00:58:31,790
What shall we pay?
Aeneas, bring them here. Let them see.

705
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:34,829
Yes, sire.

706
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:56,117
Faster. Faster.

707
00:59:21,685 --> 00:59:25,042
-See what you have brought upon us?
-Father.

708
00:59:28,806 --> 00:59:33,517
The face that launched 1000 ships.

709
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:24,528
Now remember, these Trojan walls
are our strength and our substance. . .

710
01:00:24,695 --> 01:00:28,244
. . .so let no eager fool
attempt to charge this plain. . .

711
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:32,170
. . .until these ramparts
have served their purpose.

712
01:00:33,616 --> 01:00:36,733
Well, to your posts.

713
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:45,495
Hector, where is my place?

714
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:48,411
Beside your Spartan woman.

715
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:55,177
Come with me, brother.
I'll share Spartan blood with you.

716
01:00:55,459 --> 01:00:57,973
You can have my share.

717
01:01:19,983 --> 01:01:21,496
No Trojans to greet us?

718
01:01:22,023 --> 01:01:25,858
I had hoped they'd be foolish enough
to scatter their forces.

719
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:29,903
-Where do we make camp, Agamemnon?
-Camp? No, onwards.

720
01:01:30,064 --> 01:01:32,180
Every moment of delay,
my Helen suffers.

721
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:35,735
Our camp is the Trojan palace.
We must attack at once.

722
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:41,503
Against Troy's walls, Achilles? No.
We must equip to take this fortress.

723
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:45,784
Ulysses is right. We must prepare.

724
01:01:49,427 --> 01:01:52,066
<i>The canny counsel of Ulysses prevailed.</i>

725
01:01:52,227 --> 01:01:55,823
<i>The Greeks consolidated their beachhead
and built machines for attack...</i>

726
01:01:55,988 --> 01:01:59,823
<i>...on a scale big enough
to match the Trojan walls.</i>

727
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:45,372
Follow Achilles!

728
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:42,507
Hector.

729
01:06:54,192 --> 01:06:59,267
-To the ramps. Back!
-We're outflanked! Fall back!

730
01:07:14,035 --> 01:07:16,026
Return to your towers.

731
01:07:20,196 --> 01:07:23,029
To the ramps. Back!

732
01:07:24,116 --> 01:07:25,914
Back!

733
01:09:13,492 --> 01:09:15,563
Polydorus.

734
01:09:22,774 --> 01:09:25,083
It's a good war, Paris.

735
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:28,770
Hector, the man of peace. . .

736
01:09:28,935 --> 01:09:32,086
. . .now our greatest warrior.

737
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:35,885
Thank Helen for your destiny.

738
01:09:36,056 --> 01:09:40,447
-Thank Paris.
-I thank him for my life.

739
01:09:46,297 --> 01:09:49,449
Oh, great Zeus, king of all. . .

740
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,928
. . .we give to you Polydorus,
Prince of Troy.

741
01:09:53,098 --> 01:09:57,968
I pray you, judge him
with compassion and understanding.

742
01:09:58,139 --> 01:10:02,099
Let not Athena's hatred feed
on my defenseless son. . .

743
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:05,775
. . .but on our sorrow here.

744
01:10:13,821 --> 01:10:17,781
We, the living dead of Troy,
shall pay his debt. . .

745
01:10:17,942 --> 01:10:20,900
. . .in the years of siege to come.

746
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:27,659
<i>And the Greeks did prepare
for years of siege.</i>

747
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,622
<i>They unloaded provisions
from their ships...</i>

748
01:10:30,784 --> 01:10:33,139
<i>...and as time went on
they looted and raped...</i>

749
01:10:33,304 --> 01:10:36,138
<i>... the small surrounding villages.</i>

750
01:10:48,306 --> 01:10:49,899
Take your hands off her!

751
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:52,740
-A warrior commanding his commander?
-She's mine.

752
01:10:52,907 --> 01:10:57,663
Great as you are, I'm still your chieftain,
protector of all the spoils of war.

753
01:10:57,828 --> 01:11:00,865
-Take her to my quarters.
-No.

754
01:11:01,028 --> 01:11:04,339
Agamemnon, if you take this girl,
I shall sail home.

755
01:11:04,509 --> 01:11:06,704
-Then fly, mighty warrior. Fly.
-Agamemnon!

756
01:11:06,869 --> 01:11:10,624
-He didn't mean that, Achilles. Come on.
-Sail home, great warrior.

757
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,382
No, Achilles.

758
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:15,144
Out! Out! Out!

759
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:19,350
Achilles, Agamemnon does not
speak for all our people.

760
01:11:19,511 --> 01:11:22,742
Dogs! Jackals!

761
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:27,592
I'll never fight his battles again.

762
01:11:27,752 --> 01:11:30,586
But for Greece, you'll fight.

763
01:11:32,073 --> 01:11:34,109
No more.

764
01:11:34,953 --> 01:11:37,263
<i>During these years of stalemate,
the Trojans...</i>

765
01:11:37,434 --> 01:11:41,109
<i>...from the safety of their walls,
constantly harassed the invaders...</i>

766
01:11:41,274 --> 01:11:44,631
<i>... with night raids on their camps.</i>

767
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,876
-Helen, how perfect.
-The girl you fell in love with?

768
01:12:28,521 --> 01:12:31,240
Always keep that image with you, Paris.

769
01:12:31,442 --> 01:12:35,913
I shan't need to.
I have the source of its magic.

770
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:42,439
Right here, I hold its living warmth. . .

771
01:12:42,723 --> 01:12:46,353
. . .and its spirit is always
with me on the ramparts.

772
01:12:46,524 --> 01:12:49,197
Then it can't be lost, can it?

773
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:52,038
What has been lived
and shared is never lost.

774
01:12:52,205 --> 01:12:55,641
-Never, Helen.
-But if you should lose me. . .

775
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:57,921
. . .could you resign yourself to that?

776
01:12:58,085 --> 01:13:01,874
Don't worry, nothing will happen to you.

777
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:06,683
Nothing endures on Earth, Paris,
neither sorrow nor happiness. . .

778
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:08,519
. . .or people in love.

779
01:13:08,687 --> 01:13:13,398
Dear Helen, she looks for shadows
in the one bright place in Troy.

780
01:13:13,568 --> 01:13:15,479
People in love should not be blind.

781
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:19,838
They should look to the future
and prepare for separation.

782
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:23,797
But not so gloomily, my love.
I'll meet you in Elysium. . .

783
01:13:23,969 --> 01:13:27,599
. . .where an age of years
is just a wink of time.

784
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,168
You charter a ship.
I'll take the flying horse, Pegasus.

785
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:33,401
To our island, Paris?

786
01:13:33,571 --> 01:13:38,042
Oh, goddess come to Earth,
make me immortal with your kiss. . .

787
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:41,568
. . .and we'll live on nectar and ambrosia.

788
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:49,481
-But I'm not sure I like being so ethereal.
-Nor I.

789
01:13:53,574 --> 01:13:56,372
How many years, fellow Trojans,
shall we suffer?

790
01:13:56,534 --> 01:14:01,051
Our only respite,
a truce to burn our dead.

791
01:14:01,215 --> 01:14:07,086
The holiday of a Troy
that once knew happy times.

792
01:14:07,816 --> 01:14:11,889
Must the Trojans always set
their funeral pyre so near this house?

793
01:14:12,056 --> 01:14:17,256
-How long will they accuse me?
-They lost many loved ones, my lady.

794
01:14:17,497 --> 01:14:21,127
Lulled by the promises
of peace forever.

795
01:14:21,298 --> 01:14:24,131
I, for one, believe we might
have had that peace. . . .

796
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:27,655
I thought I could escape from it,
but there is no place--

797
01:14:27,819 --> 01:14:30,811
-And no victory for anybody.
-Go. Leave me.

798
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:33,778
Paris commanded me
to stay with you while he's on duty.

799
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:36,534
Leave me, I tell you.

800
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,653
No, friends!

801
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,411
Hear me, Trojans.

802
01:14:41,581 --> 01:14:44,334
Cast her to the Spartans.

803
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:47,380
Cast Paris out of Troy.

804
01:14:48,302 --> 01:14:54,538
-lf you haven't the fiber for this. . . .
-Helen, don't go out.

805
01:14:55,663 --> 01:14:59,178
Their mood is dangerous.
I've sent soldiers to disperse them.

806
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:05,022
-You've come to ask me to leave Troy.
-No, Helen.

807
01:15:05,304 --> 01:15:06,942
No.

808
01:15:07,104 --> 01:15:12,338
But for Paris, I would have lost Hector.
I must love my sons equally. . .

809
01:15:12,505 --> 01:15:14,940
. . .and whomsoever they love.

810
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:18,862
You are good.

811
01:15:19,026 --> 01:15:22,064
The high priest says that even the gods
fight each other.

812
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:26,140
Some for Athena and Greece,
some for Troy and Aphrodite.

813
01:15:26,307 --> 01:15:30,017
How, then, could I blame you
for this war?

814
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:32,258
-I could stop it.
-No one could.

815
01:15:32,428 --> 01:15:34,863
I could. . .

816
01:15:35,029 --> 01:15:37,827
. . .if I return to the Greeks, to Menelaus.

817
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:41,064
Go back to someone you so despise?

818
01:15:41,509 --> 01:15:45,708
If it brings an end to war and restores
Paris to the love of the Trojans. . . .

819
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:50,467
-He'd never let you go.
-And could I ever leave him?

820
01:15:51,391 --> 01:15:55,020
-You must help me to decide.
-Would you defy the Fates?

821
01:15:55,192 --> 01:15:59,982
No mortal should attempt so much,
Helen. And yet I wonder. . .

822
01:16:00,152 --> 01:16:02,508
. . .is one so lovely quite mortal?

823
01:16:02,673 --> 01:16:07,747
Lovely? No. I am everything
I was determined not to be.

824
01:16:07,913 --> 01:16:10,872
I have only been selfish.

825
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:16,106
All the despair, the pain
and the tears I've brought.

826
01:16:16,795 --> 01:16:20,265
How different from that island dream.

827
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:24,509
Return to your King of Troy. . .

828
01:16:24,676 --> 01:16:27,748
. . .and tell him we will receive
Helen at the appointed place.

829
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,636
But warn him there must be no
treachery or deceit.

830
01:16:30,797 --> 01:16:33,106
I assure you, my lord,
no deceit exists.

831
01:16:33,277 --> 01:16:35,347
It is her wish
to return to King Menelaus.

832
01:16:35,517 --> 01:16:38,794
-It's her wish. You hear that, brother?
-I've heard it often.

833
01:16:39,558 --> 01:16:41,549
Wait, herald.

834
01:16:44,799 --> 01:16:47,188
Tell your master from Menelaus
that we demand--

835
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:49,156
No, no, no. Nothing else.

836
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:53,632
Nothing else, only the return of Helen.
The Trojans wish to make peace.

837
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,271
As men of peace,
we accept their offer.

838
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:03,238
Have we suffered to return
empty-handed?

839
01:17:03,402 --> 01:17:04,881
Empty-handed, Menelaus?

840
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:07,920
With Helen returned, integrity satisfied?

841
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,278
You are too outspoken, brother.

842
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:13,435
When the Trojans have handed
over Helen, we'll teach them. . .

843
01:17:13,603 --> 01:17:15,559
. . .that we're not easily bought off.

844
01:17:15,723 --> 01:17:19,160
But I'd like Achilles with us,
in case they prove troublesome.

845
01:17:19,324 --> 01:17:22,521
He still refuses to fight
so long as you're in command. . .

846
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:26,041
. . .and your lovesick jackass of a brother
brays upon this beach.

847
01:17:26,205 --> 01:17:29,515
Then he'll get not one obol
of Trojan tribute.

848
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,006
Helen?

849
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:54,407
Helen.

850
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:02,329
-Where is she?
-She's not here, Paris.

851
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:04,880
Not here? Where?

852
01:18:05,051 --> 01:18:08,123
She's gone to the camp of the Greeks.

853
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:12,332
To Menelaus?

854
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:15,602
She was determined to end
the destruction. . .

855
01:18:15,772 --> 01:18:17,843
. . .and restore you to the hearts
of the Trojans.

856
01:18:18,013 --> 01:18:21,289
-And you conspired with her--
-She was not a captive here, Paris. . .

857
01:18:21,453 --> 01:18:25,208
. . .but a woman of self-determination,
a queen with more courage. . .

858
01:18:25,374 --> 01:18:29,162
. . .than I would have had
to sail against the tides of heaven.

859
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:32,532
-He shan't take her.
-The hour has passed, Paris.

860
01:18:32,695 --> 01:18:34,572
You can't prevent it.

861
01:20:59,476 --> 01:21:01,274
Wait, Trojans.

862
01:21:02,597 --> 01:21:06,112
You've returned the wife of Menelaus,
but that isn't all your debt.

863
01:21:06,277 --> 01:21:07,757
Debt?

864
01:21:08,478 --> 01:21:11,709
-We recognize no claim of debt.
-No?

865
01:21:12,038 --> 01:21:14,758
Then who pays for the Greek blood
shed on this plain?

866
01:21:14,919 --> 01:21:16,875
Trojan blood has paid in full.

867
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,428
Trojan blood is not valid currency
in Sparta. . .

868
01:21:19,599 --> 01:21:21,636
. . .nor does it pay for launching
1000 ships.

869
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,677
The terms of this truce were clear.

870
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,274
The return of Helen,
in exchange for which. . .

871
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,432
. . .you agreed to sail
from these shores.

872
01:21:28,601 --> 01:21:32,071
-You trusting fools.
-Two things only will suffice:

873
01:21:32,241 --> 01:21:34,835
Half the treasury of Troy
before we depart. . .

874
01:21:35,002 --> 01:21:38,119
. . .and after that,
1000 talents every year.

875
01:21:38,282 --> 01:21:40,193
Take these nobles as security!

876
01:21:45,643 --> 01:21:48,396
-Here's payment, Menelaus!
-To the gates with her!

877
01:21:48,564 --> 01:21:50,361
Bring her back to Troy!

878
01:21:54,244 --> 01:21:56,076
Follow them!

879
01:21:59,765 --> 01:22:02,121
After them! After them!

880
01:22:48,572 --> 01:22:50,450
Back! Turn back!

881
01:22:56,534 --> 01:22:58,570
Don't go too close
to the Trojan walls.

882
01:22:58,734 --> 01:23:00,565
Not against Hector.

883
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:06,455
Patroclus! Patroclus!

884
01:23:48,781 --> 01:23:51,250
-Bring me my armor.
-Yes, master.

885
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:58,297
Thank you, Trojan, for bringing us
the body of Patroclus.

886
01:23:59,503 --> 01:24:01,494
Thank you very much.

887
01:24:14,585 --> 01:24:19,706
My son, Greek treachery has proved
that theirs is not a war of honor.

888
01:24:19,866 --> 01:24:24,542
Helen, through you, we have learned
that they seek plunder, not justice.

889
01:24:24,706 --> 01:24:27,096
I ask forgiveness of you both.

890
01:24:31,548 --> 01:24:33,027
Cassandra. . .

891
01:24:33,188 --> 01:24:35,782
. . .we have found there
is great wisdom in you.

892
01:24:35,948 --> 01:24:40,067
-What more can you tell us?
-New storms shall ride the sky. . .

893
01:24:41,069 --> 01:24:44,539
. . .but the guilt will be Athena's,
not Helen's.

894
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:48,385
-Thank you, Cassandra.
-Such courage must not go unrewarded.

895
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,826
Helen, you will be
a princess of Troy.

896
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:55,382
Where is Hector
and Andromache?

897
01:24:55,551 --> 01:24:57,462
They are to bestow the laurels.

898
01:25:00,992 --> 01:25:02,311
Where is Hector?

899
01:25:03,392 --> 01:25:04,871
By the Scaean gates, sire.

900
01:25:05,032 --> 01:25:08,548
He anticipates a call to single combat
for the death of Patroclus.

901
01:25:08,713 --> 01:25:11,273
I killed him. Any Greek challenge
would come to me.

902
01:25:11,433 --> 01:25:14,232
But Hector didn't want you
to be challenged by Achilles.

903
01:25:14,394 --> 01:25:17,670
-He was devoted to Patroclus.
-Hector sent him his friend's corpse. . .

904
01:25:17,834 --> 01:25:19,427
. . .with personal compliments.

905
01:25:19,595 --> 01:25:22,826
No one can match Achilles,
not even Hector.

906
01:25:22,995 --> 01:25:24,713
This must not happen.

907
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:31,670
He cried like an animal in grief, my lord,
and then called for his armor.

908
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:33,555
Ah, so he comes.

909
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:35,236
Hector!

910
01:25:35,637 --> 01:25:36,911
Hector!

911
01:25:41,358 --> 01:25:44,395
-It is done, Andromache.
-Achilles?

912
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:49,031
By his hand, my father
and my brothers fell.

913
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:54,957
-While you live, I still have them in you.
-I intend to live, Andromache, for you. . .

914
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,072
. . .and for our son.

915
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:03,316
This helmet always frightens him.

916
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:07,640
Let's pray that he may never need one. . .

917
01:26:07,802 --> 01:26:09,679
. . .that he finds peace.

918
01:26:11,962 --> 01:26:13,999
Arms to bear.

919
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:08,204
If Achilles wins, we move.

920
01:27:08,371 --> 01:27:10,601
We strike at once!
To the palace!

921
01:27:11,371 --> 01:27:16,287
And if Achilles dies, we retire
to consider a certain plan of mine.

922
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:44,267
-There's an immortal shield around him.
-Mighty Zeus, help me find a weakness.

923
01:30:02,316 --> 01:30:04,272
Achilles is dead!

924
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:12,829
So dies Greek courage,
but not Greek cunning.

925
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:31,756
Defeated by men,
deserted by the gods.

926
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:36,598
I used to number the months by a battle,
a pestilence, a famine.

927
01:30:36,761 --> 01:30:40,311
Now it's all one long nightmare.

928
01:30:40,642 --> 01:30:45,512
I fought wars since most of you
were sucklings, but never one like this.

929
01:30:45,683 --> 01:30:49,392
Let's take our ships
and sail back home.

930
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,235
That we shall do.

931
01:30:53,964 --> 01:30:58,116
I have a plan that first required
a Trojan victory.

932
01:30:59,045 --> 01:31:02,162
-That much, at least, is accomplished.
-You speak treason.

933
01:31:02,325 --> 01:31:04,759
As you will,
but let's be realistic.

934
01:31:05,005 --> 01:31:07,645
The greatest army on Earth
has lost its war.

935
01:31:07,806 --> 01:31:09,922
What are you dreaming, Ulysses?

936
01:31:10,526 --> 01:31:14,076
I'm dreaming of my wife,
the good, constant Penelope.

937
01:31:14,847 --> 01:31:20,002
And in my dreams, I see myself returning
to her with all the treasures of Troy.

938
01:31:20,928 --> 01:31:23,681
-But how?
-Has this anything to do with the work. . .

939
01:31:23,848 --> 01:31:27,080
. . .that Apagos and his men
have been doing in the woodlands?

940
01:31:27,249 --> 01:31:31,322
They're building a monument
to the triumph of Paris and Helen.

941
01:31:31,489 --> 01:31:33,367
A gift from the goddess Athena.

942
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:38,043
A sacred horse,
so big and so beautiful. . .

943
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:41,248
. . .that Troy cannot help
taking it to her heart.

944
01:31:43,851 --> 01:31:46,810
Remember, blow the retreat
loud enough for Troy to hear.

945
01:31:46,972 --> 01:31:50,681
Let the ships sail but keep
sufficient force in the woodlands.

946
01:31:50,852 --> 01:31:52,444
The ships will return at dawn.

947
01:31:52,612 --> 01:31:55,969
Are you sure the Trojans will take
this monstrosity into the city?

948
01:31:56,133 --> 01:32:00,605
I promise. Their gratitude to Athena
for her victory will be tremendous.

949
01:32:00,774 --> 01:32:03,811
And they'll give a loving welcome
to her wondrous horse.

950
01:32:03,974 --> 01:32:06,613
And to Bacchus, the god of grapes.

951
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:09,964
Make ready, men of Greece!

952
01:32:47,661 --> 01:32:52,940
First they sounded retreat,
and now the call to man the oars.

953
01:32:53,101 --> 01:32:55,138
Their torches are moving
back to the sea.

954
01:32:55,302 --> 01:32:57,258
-Aboard the ships?
-We'll soon know.

955
01:32:57,422 --> 01:33:00,016
Lord Aeneas has gone
to the shore with scouts.

956
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:16,861
Sire, they've sailed.
The last of their ships has gone to sea.

957
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:21,861
Sound the cry! Light the victory torch.
Carry it through the streets.

958
01:33:22,026 --> 01:33:23,425
Good, Priam. Good.

959
01:33:23,586 --> 01:33:28,741
-Our heroes would wish us to rejoice.
-Light the victory torch!

960
01:33:29,547 --> 01:33:31,697
You'll see a Troy
you've never known before.

961
01:33:31,867 --> 01:33:34,062
I see it in your faces.

962
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:53,419
Open it! Open it!

963
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:56,105
Let us look at the world again!

964
01:34:06,872 --> 01:34:08,624
The night smiles on us.

965
01:34:10,313 --> 01:34:11,666
Look, Priam.

966
01:34:13,073 --> 01:34:14,950
I was trying to tell you of it, sire.

967
01:34:15,113 --> 01:34:18,629
Some strange monument that
the Greeks have left at our doorstep.

968
01:34:48,838 --> 01:34:51,512
Beware the Greeks bearing gifts.

969
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:57,115
My sister speaks truly. It is a thing of
evil that should be burnt upon the plain.

970
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,474
I agree.

971
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,551
The enemy doesn't give
joyful presents.

972
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,188
My children, this is no gift
from the Greeks. . .

973
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,716
. . .but a symbol of worship
they had to abandon.

974
01:35:05,881 --> 01:35:09,874
Sire, the people beg permission to bring
this amazing prize into the square.

975
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:12,715
They have fought long and bravely.
I cannot deny them.

976
01:35:12,882 --> 01:35:14,031
Father, please hear me.

977
01:35:14,202 --> 01:35:16,477
It is not the end of ruin,
but the beginning.

978
01:35:16,642 --> 01:35:18,042
We must not be ungrateful. . .

979
01:35:18,203 --> 01:35:22,116
. . .to a goddess who has proved herself
our goddess. Bring in her sacred horse.

980
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:24,400
It shall be a monument
to Trojan valor.

981
01:35:24,564 --> 01:35:26,282
Yes, sire.

982
01:35:27,124 --> 01:35:29,843
It is a great and perfect thing.

983
01:35:30,084 --> 01:35:32,155
How childish I was
to have misgivings.

984
01:35:32,325 --> 01:35:34,885
And I to be afraid
of a wooden giant.

985
01:35:35,045 --> 01:35:36,364
What was that for?

986
01:35:36,525 --> 01:35:39,279
Athena. So forgiving of a rival goddess.

987
01:35:39,446 --> 01:35:41,835
Are you jealous, Aphrodite?

988
01:35:42,886 --> 01:35:44,798
I'm only Helen. . .

989
01:35:44,967 --> 01:35:48,323
. . .who wonders if she'll
ever be a Trojan, really.

990
01:35:49,607 --> 01:35:52,441
When the Trojan people
look upon that plain. . .

991
01:35:52,608 --> 01:35:55,759
. . .won't they always think
of Helen of Sparta?

992
01:35:56,688 --> 01:35:58,566
There is peace everywhere now.

993
01:35:58,729 --> 01:36:00,401
We're not bound to remain here.

994
01:36:01,009 --> 01:36:03,318
Wherever you wish to go, Helen,
I'll take you.

995
01:36:03,489 --> 01:36:06,243
Hail to Prince Paris and his Helen!

996
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:07,843
Hail to Helen!

997
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:11,640
-All hail to Paris!
-Hail to Helen!

998
01:36:14,531 --> 01:36:17,921
Destiny, Paris. Destiny.

999
01:36:18,091 --> 01:36:19,684
There is no escape, it seems.

1000
01:36:19,852 --> 01:36:21,729
Not even from happiness.

1001
01:36:21,892 --> 01:36:25,772
No, and I am happy. Very happy.

1002
01:42:21,545 --> 01:42:22,773
Men of Sparta!

1003
01:42:22,945 --> 01:42:25,506
Men of Sparta, to the palace!

1004
01:43:11,432 --> 01:43:13,025
Forward!

1005
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:07,756
Troy is lost, but you must not die.

1006
01:44:07,921 --> 01:44:10,560
While the Greeks plunder,
make for the north gate.

1007
01:44:10,721 --> 01:44:12,951
-Do you think I would leave you now?
-Or I?

1008
01:44:13,121 --> 01:44:14,475
Obey your king.

1009
01:44:15,362 --> 01:44:18,672
Aeneas, take care of Andromache
and my grandson.

1010
01:44:24,683 --> 01:44:26,514
Paris, Helen. . .

1011
01:44:26,683 --> 01:44:29,278
. . .I command you, go.

1012
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,398
Magnificent leadership, Agamemnon.

1013
01:44:58,568 --> 01:45:02,164
Athena will reward you with
all the glory.

1014
01:45:20,491 --> 01:45:22,483
All of you, break in!

1015
01:45:27,172 --> 01:45:28,366
Helen!

1016
01:45:28,533 --> 01:45:32,321
Take them! The rest of you, search!
Find her!

1017
01:46:05,858 --> 01:46:08,577
-Don't let me get lost, Paris.
-Never.

1018
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:21,858
Paris!

1019
01:46:24,861 --> 01:46:28,251
Paris! Paris!

1020
01:46:33,862 --> 01:46:35,011
Paris!

1021
01:46:45,544 --> 01:46:48,581
Oh, Paris! Paris!

1022
01:46:49,384 --> 01:46:51,535
Paris! I thought I was lost!

1023
01:46:51,705 --> 01:46:54,378
The gods are with us. Come.

1024
01:48:20,078 --> 01:48:21,750
Paris!

1025
01:48:31,879 --> 01:48:33,950
For a moment, I thought. . .

1026
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:37,239
-. . .that you were that little slave girl.
-Oh, I am.

1027
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:40,598
Whatever your love wishes me to be,
whatever is in your heart.

1028
01:48:40,761 --> 01:48:42,592
You are my heart.

1029
01:48:51,082 --> 01:48:53,551
Paris. No.

1030
01:49:09,885 --> 01:49:13,162
My ship has returned for you.
Go there.

1031
01:49:14,046 --> 01:49:16,002
Wash his blood from you.

1032
01:49:16,966 --> 01:49:20,482
That can never be.
It's my blood.

1033
01:49:59,732 --> 01:50:01,769
<i>It can 't be lost, Paris, can it?</i>

1034
01:50:01,933 --> 01:50:04,493
<i>What has been lived
and shared is never lost.</i>

1035
01:50:04,653 --> 01:50:06,052
<i>Never, Helen.</i>

1036
01:50:06,213 --> 01:50:08,205
<i>Then this is not goodbye.</i>

1037
01:50:08,374 --> 01:50:10,251
<i>You shall always be with me.</i>

1038
01:50:10,414 --> 01:50:12,405
<i>And you with me.</i>
