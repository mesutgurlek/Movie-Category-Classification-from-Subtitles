1
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,190
(Gunshot)

2
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,310
(Gunshots)

3
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,350
You are not yet a nun. You're too young to die.
Follow the setting sun to the woods.

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,030
Pray to your silver cross.

5
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,590
I will, Father.

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,190
You hear confessions.

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,910
You know who El Mirador is. Tell me.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,950
(Nuns scream)

9
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,820
PRIEST: No. No.

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,630
Aargh.

11
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,310
(Screams continue)

12
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,670
(Horse whinnies)

13
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,830
- You see what I see. Harper?
- Indeed I do.

14
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,440
A colonel of the imperial Guard.

15
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,550
One of Napoleon's best.

16
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,790
Where's the nearest French fort, sir?

17
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,350
Villafranca, 50 miles north.

18
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,070
Fort and town.
Frogs hold the fort, we hold the town.

19
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,110
I wonder what he wants there.

20
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,070
Have a go, Dan?

21
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,230
Sorry, sir.

22
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,190
When you can't see the face,
you can't take the heart.

23
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,630
(Horse's hooves)

24
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,990
Up and at 'em, boys. Up and at 'em.

25
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,910
Silly bugger!

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,780
Brave silly bugger, though.
Let's give him a hand before he gets killed.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,830
Formez ligne!

28
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,070
Good shooting, Sharpe.

29
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,030
Tally-ho, Sharpe. Flush 'em out!

30
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,390
Aux abris!

31
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,660
Aargh!

32
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,790
- Seen that colonel, Pat?
- There's nobody left back there.

33
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,550
Hey!

34
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,670
Ne tirez pas!

35
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,710
Ne tirez pas.

36
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,830
Vous parlez français?

37
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,870
Parole.

38
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,350
Vous comprenez?

39
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,390
Parole.

40
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,070
Klingenthal.

41
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,430
Best sword ever made

42
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,990
Too good for a damn dragoon officer.

43
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,670
Où est votre colonel?

44
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,710
La bas!

45
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,070
Search him.

46
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,670
I found this on him, sir.
A piece of paper with numbers on it.

47
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,110
Bill of sale, eh? I don't believe you.

48
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,270
I... no speak anglais.

49
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,310
I don't believe that, either.

50
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,430
Why don't you kill him?

51
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,430
Then you can keep the sword.

52
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,870
Please, parole. Please.

53
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,750
Oui, Captain.

54
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,190
Colonel Berkeley, South Essex.
We accept your parole.

55
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,790
Er... nous accept...

56
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,230
- Robert, get him to write it out and sign it.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,230
Monsieur le Capitaine, nous voudrions
que vous écrivez votre promesse.

58
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,990
See if you understand this.

59
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,310
I'm going to kick you in the crotch.

60
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,750
Steady on. Sharpe.

61
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,630
Poor devil's trying to surrender.

62
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,950
This man is a spy, sir. I'm certain of it.

63
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,420
Where's your tunic, eh? Where were you going?

64
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,950
Dash it all, Sharpe. He doesn't have to tell us.

65
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,190
Bad form. Old boy.

66
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,420
Répondez, vite!

67
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,550
Mon colonel était mourant.

68
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,310
J'ai pris ma tunique et je lui ai mis sous la tête.

69
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,990
On partait pour la France.
On s'est perdu, c'est tout.

70
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,350
Tunic's under his colonel's head. They got lost.

71
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,790
- I did my best, old boy.
- Major Sharpe.

72
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,270
This is Captain the Lord Spears,
one of Major Munro's exploring officers.

73
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,550
- Your servant, Captain... I mean, my lord.
- Oh, Jack'll do.

74
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,550
It's a fine honor to shake the hand
of the man who saved Wellington's life.

75
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,350
Seems a man doesn't lose his arm
scratching his arse, Jack.

76
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,150
That's the style!

77
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,590
I knew you two fellows

78
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,150
would hit it off.

79
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
Major Munro will want to talk to this fellow.

80
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,110
So, as he's given us his parole,
I'll take him back to camp.

81
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,100
You didn't tell him about the piece of paper, sir.
Could be a code.

82
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,830
Copy it down when you get back, Harris.

83
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,670
Go through that so-called colonel's pockets.

84
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,030
When you've finished, take the tunic
he's wearing and the one under his head,

85
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,910
and bring them back to camp.

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,950
Sir.

87
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,230
You know,

88
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,630
I think you have your eye on that sword.

89
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,830
(Wings fluttering)

90
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,980
(Squawking)

91
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,030
Dan!

92
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,750
(Birds squawking)

93
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,470
Easy.

94
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,510
Hey.

95
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,590
Easy, lass. Easy.

96
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,190
Bird in the hand, sir?

97
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,670
Richard.

98
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,750
Major Munro wants to see you at six

99
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,150
Shall we have a word?

100
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,710
Look, I have to go, lass.

101
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,990
I promise I'll come back.

102
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,390
Look, I swear I'll come back.

103
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,750
She's to stay with us till we reach Villafranca.

104
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,980
Colonel's orders.

105
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,630
She understands English.

106
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,110
It seems like she's about to speak, and she just...

107
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,150
(Sighs)

108
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,310
I've seen that before.

109
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,150
Probably saw something dreadful
and was too frightened to scream.

110
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,460
She'll speak again,

111
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,110
as soon as she feels safe.

112
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,710
Rifleman Harris said to give you this.

113
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,550
And these.

114
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,590
These are also for you.

115
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,670
SHARPE: Oh. Yeah.

116
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,710
We found this on the French captain.

117
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,790
Could it be a code?

118
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,680
Well, it looks like a list of bills to me.

119
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,910
But I suppose I ought to
have a word with the Frog about it.

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,910
Um, I'll see you there at six.

121
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,990
And don't be late. Munro hates lateness.

122
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,110
(Stumbles over notes)

123
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,950
Never had a lesson in my life.

124
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,190
Can you believe that. Laddie?

125
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,230
Sit down, laddie.

126
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,430
(Bagpipes squeal)

127
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,830
Which would you prefer me to do, Sharpe?

128
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,350
Play Bealach na Broga -

129
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,390
that's the Munro March -

130
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,590
or send you on a dangerous mission?

131
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,430
Er, dangerous mission, sir.

132
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,390
Who's winning the war, Sharpe?

133
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,910
- Wellington, sir.
- Why's he winning it, Sharpe?

134
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,950
Steady troops, sir.

135
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,110
Superior intelligence, Sharpe.
Supplied by whom, laddie?

136
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,870
Men like you, sir.

137
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,230
Och, don't lick me, laddie!

138
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,950
Wellington is winning it
with the help of a man called El Mirador.

139
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,990
Not his real name, of course.

140
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,460
El Mirador made this map.

141
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,910
Tell me what you think of it.

142
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,980
Good God!

143
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,030
Every French fort.

144
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,640
Full figures for infantry, cavalry, artillery.

145
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,190
I do believe he's even counted
the bloody bayonets, sir!

146
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,820
Look long at it, laddie.
You may not see its like again.

147
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,430
Why not, sir?

148
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,150
El Mirador is in mortal danger.

149
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,630
Our agents in Paris tell us

150
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,630
that Bonaparte personally picked out a man
to capture El Mirador -

151
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,990
a Colonel Philippe Leroux of the Imperial Guard.

152
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,070
Paris says he set out six weeks ago
across the frontier

153
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,700
to rendezvous near the French fort at Villafranca.

154
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,110
And Villafranca is where El Mirador
conducts his operations.

155
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,510
We killed a full colonel
of the Imperial Guard this morning, sir.

156
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,150
Aye.

157
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,550
Jack told me. A Colonel Junot,
according to the captain we captured.

158
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,910
Maybe he was Leroux, maybe not

159
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,710
I don't trust that captain, Jack... I mean, my lord.

160
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,950
What about the numbers we found on him?

161
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,150
Captain Delmas says he buys horses.
The numbers are prices. Who can say?

162
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,070
But it could be a code.

163
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,470
Absolutely. But if it is a code,
it'll be a book code.

164
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,030
Why not just move El Mirador
to a safe place, sir?

165
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,830
El Mirador is more than a spy, Sharpe.

166
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,150
He's a chief of spies.

167
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,910
He has hundreds of couriers
and confidential agents to consider.

168
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,150
That's why he chose Villafranca
for his headquarters.

169
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,270
The constant coming and going
conceals his couriers,

170
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,070
so he has to stay there.

171
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,110
Does El Mirador know
the colonel is coming to kill him?

172
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,870
Not kill, capture.

173
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,110
Capture him for torture.

174
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,470
Colonel Leroux will want everything
in El Mirador's mind.

175
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,750
But El Mirador is not the kind of man
who will leave his post.

176
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,750
Could I have your second suggestion?

177
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,910
Yes, sir.

178
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,910
Find the colonel and kill him.

179
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,110
Oddly enough, but these are your orders.

180
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,070
No nonsense about parole.
Wellington wants him dead.

181
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,190
Any more questions. Ask them now.

182
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,550
I'm off to Burgos in the morning.

183
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,630
Just one, sir.

184
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,590
Do the French know
El Mirador's real identity, sir?

185
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,790
They may do now.

186
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,500
A week ago,
a priest and a party of nuns went missing

187
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,590
50 miles south on their way
to a remote mountain shrine.

188
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,830
We found blood, but no bodies.

189
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,870
Oh, yes.

190
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,700
We found this.

191
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,990
The priest was Eh Mirador's confessor.

192
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,030
One last question, sir.

193
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,620
Couldn't I protect El Mirador better
if I knew his real identity, sir?

194
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,670
El Mirador's identity is a state secret,
known only by Wellington and myself.

195
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,460
Even Captain Spears doesn't know who he is.

196
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,470
And what you don't know

197
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,350
don't hurt you, Sharpe.

198
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,430
Beg your pardon, sir, but in my experience
what you don't know usually gets you killed.

199
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,670
Suppose he captured you, tortured you?

200
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,750
Are you suggesting I'd talk, sir?

201
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,430
Don't be a damned fool, Sharpe.

202
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,470
Everyone talks on the third day.

203
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,150
Now. Shall ye stay

204
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,190
for Haste Ye To The Wedding?

205
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,230
Er... no, sir.

206
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,390
(Bagpipes)

207
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,830
How do you stand it, Pipe Major?

208
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,830
I said, how do you stand it?

209
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,230
Smells good, Ramona.

210
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,060
She is sleeping. Don't wake her.

211
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,830
Course not.

212
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,750
Do me a favor, Ramona.

213
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,950
I need these tunics washed and dried by dawn.

214
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,180
No, no.

215
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,310
I finish favors for men.

216
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,590
I do favors for Harper
and look how he treat me.

217
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,110
SHARPE: How he treat you?

218
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,150
I mean, how does he treat you?

219
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,270
He treats me like a whore.

220
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,350
Can I have a word with you, Harper?

221
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,670
- What's this between you and Ramona?
- She's not talking to me.

222
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,190
- Well, what have you done to her?
- Nothing.

223
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,740
Well, whatever it is you're not doing, go and do it.

224
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,750
- That's not your business.
- Whatever business this is, get it sorted out.

225
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,070
If that means
I'm going to wash and clean your tunics,

226
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,630
well, I'm not.

227
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,630
Well, I'm not.

228
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,470
Well, I'm not!

229
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,230
(Whimpering)

230
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,990
(Whispers) Harper!

231
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,430
Harper!

232
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,830
(Sobbing)

233
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,830
Take her back to Ramona's tent.

234
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,950
I've taken her back three times already.

235
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,830
- Take her again.
- Ht's no use.

236
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,870
She just keeps running back here.

237
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,910
Easy, lass.

238
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,910
Easy.

239
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,830
Look, you can stay here,
but you must sleep under your own blanket.

240
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,950
Harper... you sleep at the bottom of my bed,

241
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,550
just to make sure nothing happens
that's not in army regulations.

242
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,780
What?

243
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,870
(Bagpipes)

244
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,350
Good God, lass. Go and put some clothes on.

245
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,390
She hasn't got any clothes.

246
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,860
Well, tell Ramona to get her some, damn you.

247
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,350
I asked her.

248
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,390
She told me to shag off.

249
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,270
This loaded, Harper?

250
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,790
Ah, no. Army regulations state never leave
loaded weapons lying around the camp.

251
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,830
You must have missed that one.

252
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,030
Listen, it's not very often I raise my fist to a man.

253
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,110
But when I do, I leave evidence of it.

254
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,150
I believe that.

255
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,190
So what's between you and Ramona?

256
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,910
Ramona wants me to marry her
and take her to Ireland.

257
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,830
Since you've got a young son,
I don't see much wrong with that.

258
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,190
- I don't.
- So?

259
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,790
I love Ramona.

260
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,990
I love her a lot.

261
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,150
I love her enough
not to take her back to my bloody country.

262
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
And she's Spanish.

263
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,990
And she's got a son bon out of wedlock -
my son.

264
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,940
For Christ's sake, no man or woman in Ireland
would look at the side of the road she walked on.

265
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,190
Then, of course, there's my mother.

266
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,950
Your mother?

267
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,150
When I was seventeen,

268
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,310
my mother made a match for me
with a girl called Annie Brady from Dunmoyle.

269
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,870
My mother adored her.

270
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,590
And do you know,

271
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,510
she was the most beautiful girl
you've ever seen since the first day.

272
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,870
- You're not telling me you're married, are you?
- No, I'm not!

273
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,830
Annie Brady died on me.

274
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,910
And, you know,
I don't think my mother ever recovered.

275
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,750
And I'll tell you,

276
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,670
if I was to arrive home in Ireland
with a Spanish wife and a child,

277
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,270
well, she'd never forgive me.

278
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,870
Harper,

279
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,390
look around you.

280
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,510
What do you see?

281
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,270
I see soldiers.

282
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,310
No, you don't.

283
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,270
You see truth-tellers.

284
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,870
Liars, mongrels, bastards.

285
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,470
Men who have tumbled into this war,

286
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,990
the madness that is this war.

287
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,030
That's what you see, isn't it?

288
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,430
That's what I see.

289
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,100
- And they all have one thing in common.
- What's that?

290
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,630
They live by the sword,
and they're prepared to die by the sword.

291
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,670
They have little else, but they have honor.

292
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,630
You're going to have to show
the mother of your child that same honor.

293
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,070
So start praying, Pat.

294
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,830
Bonjour.

295
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,520
Ah... good morning. Oui?

296
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,270
You really are too hard on him, Richard.

297
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,990
Poor fellow's only trying to be pleasant.

298
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,030
I don't trust the bugger.

299
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,350
Too bloody good to be true.

300
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,270
He's just trying to please, Richard.
He's frightened, far from home.

301
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,710
Prisoners are always anxious to please.

302
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,750
That's why they smile all the time.

303
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,670
Oh, aye? And why's that, then, Jack?

304
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,710
I've been that soldier.

305
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,670
I spent six months as a prisoner of the French.

306
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,350
I was captured after I was wounded.

307
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,390
French surgeon hacked this off.

308
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,430
Took his bloody time about it, too.

309
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,190
Something about him...

310
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,030
He's as strong as a bull,
but he walks like a woman.

311
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,630
His eyes are everywhere.

312
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,950
But you can never see what he's looking at.

313
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,420
He's like a gun laid up.

314
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,900
All greased but ready to go off.

315
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,950
Could you persuade Berkeley
to convene a court of honor tonight

316
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,990
when we make camp?

317
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,500
I think I've proof he's not the man he says he is.

318
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,550
The only way Berkeley will do that...

319
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,270
...is if the Frenchy has someone to speak for him.

320
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,150
Sort of a devil's advocate.

321
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,270
Well, you could do that.

322
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,110
Very well. Word of warning though, Richard.

323
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,150
Berkeley will get into a fearful wax

324
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,190
- if you get it wrong.
- Don't worry.

325
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,190
I'll hang the bugger out to dry.

326
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,190
How do I look, Harris?

327
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,990
Sir?

328
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,510
Good book?

329
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,790
Very.

330
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,350
Voltaire, sir. I found it in the woods.

331
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,030
Pity there's only a few pages.

332
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,750
What? You found it in the woods?

333
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,790
Where?

334
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,830
Under the colonel, sir.

335
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,670
It could be a code book, couldn't it?

336
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,950
It could be, but I don't have the book.
It was all bloody. I could only save a few pages.

337
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,990
Well, where is it?

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,350
Oh, bugger!

339
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,510
I'll be back soon, lass.

340
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,700
And when I come back, I want you in my bed.

341
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,750
I mean, I'll sleep out here, like.

342
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,830
Right.

343
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,390
Hope you damn well know
what you're doing, Sharpe.

344
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,830
People back in London get very picky
about playing with parole.

345
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,870
Can we start, sir?

346
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,870
French colonel's tunic. Sir.

347
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,070
Put it on.

348
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,430
Mettez-la.

349
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,470
Perfect fit, sir.

350
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,070
Now.

351
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,110
Put this on.

352
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,780
This is supposed to be his own tunic, sir.

353
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,950
The one he put under
the so-called colonel's head.

354
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,230
See. Sir?

355
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,230
His own tunic doesn't fit,
but the colonel's fits him perfectly.

356
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,270
I believe this man is really Colonel Leroux
of the French Imperial Guard.

357
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,710
I believe he murdered his captain in the woods
and changed clothes with him.

358
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,310
I would like to plead with this court of honor

359
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,830
to revoke this man's parole

360
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,270
until Major Munro returns from Burgos, sir.

361
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,310
Well...

362
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,420
The prisoner would like to say something
in his defense through me.

363
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,470
Of course. Carry on, Jack.

364
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,070
Écoutez...

365
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,870
Je ne suis qu'un soldat qui fait son devoir
et qui aime son pays.

366
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,750
I am a soldier, I do my duty, I love my country.

367
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,350
Mon commandant m'a dit qu'il y avait
un colonel de Paris qui voulait aller en patrouille.

368
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,830
One day, my commanding officer tells me
that I must take a colonel from Paris

369
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,460
- on patrol.
- Juste pour se vanter devant ses amis

370
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,030
d'avoir vu la frontière.

371
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,390
So that he can...

372
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,260
boast to his friends
that he has seen the frontier.

373
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,030
J'y suis allé, je me suis retrouvé dans les bois,
vous êtes arrivés.

374
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,470
I go there. I am in the woods. You come.

375
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,510
Et vous avez tué mon colonel.

376
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,030
You killed my colonel.

377
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,750
Vous vous demandez pourquoi
mon uniforme ne me va pas.

378
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,870
You ask me why my uniform doesn't fit.

379
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,990
Je pourrais vous dire
que c'est parce qu'il a rétréci sous lavage.

380
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,310
I could say it is
because it has shrunk in the wash.

381
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,310
Mais ha vérité...

382
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,310
But the truth is...

383
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,350
...cette tunique ne m'a jamais été.

384
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,230
...the tunic does not fit now because it never fit.

385
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,110
- Je suis qu'un pauvre petit capitaine de Lyon.
- I am a poor captain from Lyons.

386
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,580
- J'ai que deux tuniques.
- I have two tunics.

387
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,630
La meilleure, elle est á la caserne.

388
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,280
My best tunic is back at the barracks.

389
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,830
- Et h'autre. Celle qui ne m'a jamais été...
- My other tunic. The one that never fit me...

390
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,870
...elle est lá, devant vous.

391
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,950
...is here before you.

392
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,830
C'est tout ce que j'ai á vous dire.

393
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,030
That's all I have to say.

394
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,550
Excusez-moi.

395
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,590
(Clears throat)

396
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,870
What a cock-and-bull story!
You're not going to believe that codswallop,

397
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,100
are you. Colonel?

398
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,500
Major Munro won't believe it. That's for sure.

399
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,710
Major Munro
is not in charge of this court, Sharpe.

400
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,360
You've had your say,
this poor devil has had his,

401
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,750
and he strikes us as a simple,
serving soldier who did his duty,

402
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,790
as you and I must do ours. Sharpe.

403
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,550
We will continue to accept his parole
until we get to Villafranca.

404
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,260
Major Munro can make up his own mind.
Agreed?

405
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,310
This court is no longer in session.

406
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,790
Congratulations. Jack.

407
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,470
Let's have a cognac.

408
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,950
Stay for a drink, Sharpe?

409
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,790
No, sir.

410
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,440
I've swallowed enough French crap
for one night.

411
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,710
Sorry, Richard.

412
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,750
Devil’s advocate, you know.

413
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,590
You did it damn well, Jack.

414
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,870
Thank you. Thank you.

415
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,590
Yes, yes. Now, be a good chap and bugger off.

416
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,230
C'est fini.

417
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,310
Daccorod

418
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,070
C'est bien. Oh... pardon.

419
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,190
Très bien.

420
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,510
Good sword, that. I'll have it when you're dead.

421
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,550
Thank you.

422
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,590
What were you going to do with it?

423
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,230
Kill Eh Mirador?

424
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,430
...that's my share

425
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,550
That's my house trap. You can play there

426
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,070
Louse trap, lookers-out

427
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,630
Snotter box, chinny-chop

428
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,150
Breastplate, apple string

429
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,860
Thigh-a-thacker, knee-a-knacker,
toe-a-tripper, love my dear

430
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,950
The more I love, my lover draws near...

431
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,790
- Harris.
- Sir.

432
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,350
That book you burnt, Harris,

433
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,350
have you read it before?

434
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,790
Candide, sir? Oh, yes.

435
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,910
Quite a well-known book by Voltaire.

436
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,180
Good book?

437
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,230
Oh, yes, sir.

438
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,260
A satire. At first reading,
it purports to be a picaresque romance.

439
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,990
But to the educated eye. It's more of a satire
on the morals and manners of society.

440
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,070
Tell me something funny from it.

441
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,430
Well, you see, sir,

442
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,460
the hero keeps on saying, "Everything's
for the best in the best of all possible worlds,"

443
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,510
at the most inappropriate of times.

444
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,660
Yeah.

445
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,950
Take my advice, Harris.

446
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,830
When you get back home, write
a bloody good book with loads of shooting in it...

447
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,030
...and you'll die a rich man.

448
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,510
That Candide, you said it's a common book?

449
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,820
Very common, sir.

450
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,070
So, if you had another like it,
you could figure out the code?

451
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,310
Very likely. If I had another like it.

452
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,070
There'll be a library in Villafranca.

453
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,830
Nothing I should like better, sir.

454
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,110
We'll get the bastard yet.

455
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,030
(Girl sobbing)

456
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,470
Lay off, lass.

457
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,220
Look...

458
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,740
Is this yours?

459
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,870
Column, halt!

460
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,990
Column, halt!

461
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,350
Jack.

462
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,270
Sir.

463
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,190
Nasty little brute.

464
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,900
Villafranca not much better.

465
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,270
There's a party coming from Villafranca, sir.

466
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,790
- That looks like Sir Henry Simmerson.
- That's a nasty little brute, too.

467
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,830
What? Who did you say, Jack?

468
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,750
Sir Henry Simmerson.
He's the political officer here.

469
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,910
Can't be. He lost the King's Colors.
He went home in disgrace.

470
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,420
How can he be here?

471
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,660
He's back home.

472
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,310
Sharpe saw Simmerson lose the Colors,
so naturally Simmerson hates him.

473
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,910
May I be excused, sir?

474
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,310
No. You may not. Sharpe.
Best behavior. Gentlemen.

475
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,630
Try to pretend that the pretentious little puke
didn't lose the King's Colors.

476
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,430
Good to see you, Sir Henry.

477
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,710
What ho, Berkley.
Munro said you were on your way

478
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,180
Took your damned time.

479
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,230
Gentlemen.

480
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,420
I wish I could say I was glad to see you, Sharpe.

481
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,470
But I ain't,

482
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,510
so there.

483
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,150
BERKELEY: Sir Henry.
May I introduce Captain the Lord Spears?

484
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,070
One of Munro's men.

485
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,460
Delighted to meet you, my lord.

486
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,430
Ain't you the Simmerson
that lost the King's Colors?

487
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,940
There was a full inquiry, my lord.
I was completely exonerated.

488
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,990
Allow me to shake you by the hand,

489
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,030
my lord.

490
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,110
Ah, so you didn't lose 'em, you mislaid 'em.

491
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,740
As you seem to have
the most unfortunate habit of losing things,

492
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,190
I think I'll hold on to my one good hand.

493
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,310
A joke, Sir Henry.

494
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,470
It's a joke. My silly old sense of humor!

495
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,910
I trust I have a sense of humor, my lord.

496
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,590
A man who loses the King's Colors
is in need of a sense of humor, Sir Henry.

497
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,870
Now, what do you know about this Frog fort?

498
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,710
Speaking as the political commissioner, my lord,

499
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,310
I must stress that it is of the utmost importance
to the Anglo-Spanish authorities

500
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,270
that normal trade and commerce
be not interrupted.

501
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,230
We have established a modus vivendi
with the fort.

502
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,590
They don't trouble us. We don't trouble them.

503
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,590
And I trust you gentlemen will do nothing
to disturb this most sensitive situation?

504
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,950
Not to worry, Sir Henry.
We just plan to blow that fort to bits, that's all.

505
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,190
What have they got. Sir Henry?

506
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,430
Have they got cannon?

507
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,270
I have been in that fort many times
under a flag of truce,

508
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,820
and I categorically state
that they have no cannon.

509
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,550
(Cannon fire)

510
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,230
Confound that cannon!
It'll be no fun getting into that fort, Sharpe.

511
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,270
- A night attack, sir?
- Good idea.

512
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,060
Best be getting back to our billets.
Where's young Robert with my horse?

513
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,110
(Gunfire)

514
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,910
Come back, boy.

515
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,060
Move aside, McDonald. Move aside, son.

516
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,790
Oh, no!

517
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,630
It's all my fault.

518
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,870
By God, he'll pay for this.

519
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,580
SPEARS: I should have listened to you. Richard.
He must be Leroux.

520
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,110
BERKELEY: Breaks his parole
and kills an 18-year-ohd boy.

521
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,750
Don't worry, sir.

522
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,990
We'll go in and get him tomorrow.

523
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,220
Tomorrow?

524
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,470
I'm going in tonight, Sharpe.

525
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,150
I want that bastard dead by dawn.

526
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,110
It's more of a hospital than a house.

527
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,670
SHARPE: Who are they?

528
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,820
SPEARS: They call them the survivors -
those that have been captured. Tortured.

529
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,910
And somehow survived.

530
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,950
If only in body.

531
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,700
This is Don Felipe,

532
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,270
the owner of the house.

533
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,500
The French raped

534
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,430
then murdered his wife,

535
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,860
and forced him to watch.

536
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,710
This house is her memorial.

537
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,430
I am Don Felipe. My house is yours.

538
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,790
Is this the girl in need of care?

539
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,030
Follow me.

540
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,150
Bound to be here somewhere, Harris.

541
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,910
Somewhere, sir.

542
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,950
I shall have to search every book.

543
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,390
Er, naturally, I shall be excused parades?

544
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,830
Set yourself up with a skivvy, Sharpe?

545
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,630
Don't be selfish. Share and share alike, hm?

546
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,430
This is the Mirador.
Mirador means watching place.

547
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,390
Usually I paint here, but from now on, my child,
you may look on it as your own private garden.

548
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,190
Looks like you'll be well looked after, lass.
We'll leave you now and move to our billets.

549
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,350
If you're lonely, let me know, my dear.

550
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,990
We'll leave you now, lass.

551
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,590
All right, you can come with us,
but you must promise to come back here.

552
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,550
Sir Henry, show us to our billets.

553
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,590
With pleasure.

554
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,270
I've put you in the Irish Mission,
with Father Curtis.

555
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,190
Bloody hell, it's a hospital!

556
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,230
Civil tongue now, Richard. Here's Father Curtis.

557
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,670
Not exactly fond of us.
Fought against us with the Spanish at Trafalgar.

558
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,110
Spanish think he's a saint. So does Wellington,
cos he looks after our wounded.

559
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,110
I'll leave this sorry lot to you, Curtis.
Good day, my lord.

560
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,470
I'm Curtis, Rector of the Irish College.

561
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,070
The faithful call me Father.
You may call me Doctor.

562
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,110
Your servant, Doctor.

563
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,550
I'm Major Sharpe of the South Essex.

564
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,390
This is Sergeant Harper and the Chosen Men.
Hope you can find them clean quarters.

565
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,110
Not chosen by the Lord, by the looks of them.

566
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,150
I run this mission

567
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,470
as you run a regiment.

568
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,510
There are rules.

569
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,710
No strong drink, no strong language,

570
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,510
and, above all,
no weak women inside the wards.

571
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,270
I'm with you there, Father.

572
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,390
Irish?

573
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,870
Indeed I am.

574
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,630
Right, then you'll serve Mass on Sunday.

575
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,270
(Laughter)

576
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,060
This is little Patrick Harper, Father.

577
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,950
This little Catholic boy
does you great credit, Mrs. Harper.

578
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,390
You have a girl with you, one of ours.

579
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,870
One of ours, too, Father.

580
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,990
What do you know of her?

581
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,030
Enough.

582
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,310
There is a convent
that misses you much, my child.

583
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,750
She's turned her back on God... for now.

584
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,190
But I've seen many a good soldier run away
and live to fight another day.

585
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,230
So have I.

586
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,990
You know where to find me.

587
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,470
Make yourself at home, Major Sharpe.

588
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,110
Now, that's what I call a priest.

589
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,350
Good, because you're going to need him soon.

590
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,230
I feel like one

591
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,150
Who treads alone

592
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:13,340
Some banquet hall deserted

593
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,550
Whose lights are fled

594
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,420
Whose garlands dead

595
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:31,550
And all but he departed

596
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:39,320
Thus, in the stilly night

597
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,020
'Ere slumber's chain

598
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:49,630
Hath bound me

599
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,750
Sad memory

600
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,670
Brings the light

601
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:05,230
Of other days

602
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:16,310
Around me

603
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,590
Damn song.

604
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,980
Sneaks up on you.

605
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,190
Sunt lacrimae rerum.

606
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,870
These are the tears we weep for the past,
the present, and the future.

607
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,830
I was thinking of my wife.

608
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,830
It is our duty to remember the dead.

609
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,470
How did you know she was dead?

610
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,510
Would you weep if she were not?

611
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,910
So you want me to speak to Sergeant Harper?

612
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,470
I will do so, but in return,
you must do something for me.

613
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,470
Whatever you say, Father.

614
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,470
Let me put it like this.

615
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,630
I will see to it that Harper goes first to the church,
then to Ramona's bed.

616
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,310
And you will see to it
that the girl goes from your bed to the church.

617
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,190
May God bring you back safe from battle.

618
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,390
BERKELEY: Get the gunners!

619
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,310
Plus bas! Plus bas!

620
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,790
SHARPE: Colonel!

621
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,710
Colonel?

622
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,300
South Essex!

623
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,830
What the hell's happening, Jack?

624
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,550
It's hopeless.

625
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,830
We're being driven back.

626
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,670
I think we should get out of here.

627
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,030
Get the lads back home, quick as you can.
Me and the Chosen Men

628
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,430
will make a rearguard.

629
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,550
Soon as you're home, write to Burgos.

630
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,270
Tell Munro to find me cannon. Go!

631
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,550
SPEARS: South Essex. Fall back.

632
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,870
No, not like that.

633
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,310
Facing the enemy.

634
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,940
One pace back at a time.

635
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,100
Slow march!

636
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,990
The bastards knew we were coming.
Jesus, come on!

637
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,590
Steady.

638
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,470
Oh. God.

639
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,620
Sergeant Harper?

640
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,910
I'm looking for Major Sharpe, sir.

641
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,550
Well, try the Irish Missin.

642
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,070
Come on! Come on!

643
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,710
If you find him, tell him I've gone for his cannon.

644
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,390
You've already looked?

645
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,900
- Jesus, where in the hell is he, then?
CURTIS: Hell?

646
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,750
Hell is not within these holy walls,
Sergeant Harper,

647
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,790
but we have something close to it.

648
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,590
We call it a dying room.

649
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,030
It's across the cloisters,
through the black door, down the steps.

650
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,990
Ask for Sergeant Connelly.

651
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,030
(Sings drunkenly)

652
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,790
Die easy, boy.

653
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,830
Don't delay.

654
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,830
Do it now.

655
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,430
There's a Frog in the bed beside you.

656
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,430
Don't let your country down. Die easy, now.

657
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,190
Die without a word.

658
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,630
Would you do that. Sonny?

659
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,270
Let go, now, then.

660
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,110
Let go.

661
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,950
Did you see that. Lads?

662
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,420
He marched away.

663
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,470
Now, march after him.

664
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,430
Who goes there?

665
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,350
Pat Harper, from Donegal.

666
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,590
Pat Connelly.

667
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,350
Shigo.

668
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,110
Bás in Eireann.

669
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,990
Death in Ireland.

670
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,990
Do you have a flogged soldier?

671
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,470
Many.

672
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,150
Patrick!

673
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,550
Good God!

674
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,470
Good God!

675
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,830
Die easy, boys.

676
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,310
(Sings)

677
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,470
Has the surgeon gone
to get something for Major Sharpe?

678
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,940
Yes, Harper. He's gone to get a coffin.

679
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,550
Please don't, Father.

680
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,430
Major Sharpe has a slash to the left shoulder
that's gone to the bone.

681
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,190
But what's going to kill him is the bullet
in his belly. Ht's going green with all the pus.

682
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,230
If he were a dog, I'd shoot him.

683
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,510
But God, in his mercy, is sending him a fever.

684
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,230
Soon he'll feel nothing. He'll be dead by dawn.

685
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,590
There must be something you can do for him.

686
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,910
I'm a priest. I'll pray for him.

687
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,790
That's the best you can do for him?

688
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,110
I'm an old soldier, too,
so I'll give you a bit of good advice.

689
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,350
- Let her look after him.
- Why can't I look after him?

690
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,150
He's my major.

691
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,750
And he's my friend.

692
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,710
Look at her.

693
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,950
If you were God and you hooked down tonight.

694
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,870
And you saw that poor lonely child.

695
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,470
Mightn't you take pity, Pat?

696
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,270
Hm?

697
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,350
(Knock at door)

698
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,670
I was just wondering...

699
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,270
What were you wondering?

700
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,870
I was wondering...

701
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,540
Would you have any holy oil
or holy water for Major Sharpe, Father?

702
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,550
As far as I can tell,
Major Sharpe's a heathen, Harper.

703
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,620
Ah, no, you see,

704
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,710
I thought if I sprinkled some holy water
on Major Sharpe when he was unconscious,

705
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,750
I might be able to save his soul,

706
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,230
despite himself.

707
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,950
You can't have it, Harper.

708
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,710
Have what, Father?

709
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,750
That's a Toledo blade.

710
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,190
Who told you about it?

711
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,510
People say you were a great swordsman
in your day, Father.

712
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,070
And that you have the finest collection of blades
in all of Spain.

713
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,630
Major Sharpe broke his sword fighting at the fort.

714
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,910
But I thought that if you gave me a fine blade.

715
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,950
I could make a great sword out of it.

716
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,670
And when Major Sharpe would see it,

717
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,390
it might make him better.

718
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,470
Tell me why I should give this to your major.

719
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,150
It's very important to me
that Major Sharpe gets well, Father.

720
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,780
And Ramona?

721
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,270
You give me that blade,

722
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,510
and Ramona can call herself Mrs. Harper.

723
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,950
Swear on the Bible.

724
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,470
Ah, Jesus, I hate swearing, Father.

725
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,790
He'll only need half the guard.

726
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,110
And hone the blade. Harper.

727
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,950
There's a week's work in it.

728
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,270
Donne-moi ça.
Donne-moi ça, espèce d'abruti!

729
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,590
Je le fais moi-même.

730
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,230
(Hissing)

731
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,190
(Cries out)

732
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,270
Hey, my favorite English spy.

733
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,790
Thanks for your help.

734
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,670
(Cock crows)

735
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,550
(Grinding of metal)

736
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,230
What the devil are you doing here?

737
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,830
I was looking for a book, Sir Henry.

738
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,140
A book?

739
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,390
What does a common soldier want with a book?

740
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,670
Why, my lord,
I was going to wipe my bum with it.

741
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,710
Were you, by Jove?

742
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,510
Well, don't waste a good British one.

743
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,870
Here. Here's one of those damned Frog books.

744
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,340
Candidy, it's called. Wipe your bum on that.

745
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,310
I'm so grateful, my lord.

746
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,990
So very grateful.

747
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,390
Happy now, are we?

748
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,150
"All is for the best

749
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,190
in the best of all possible worlds."

750
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,350
(Sighs heavily)

751
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,750
Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi
custodiat animam tuam in vitam aeternam.

752
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:21,870
Amen.

753
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,190
Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi
custodiat animam tuam in vitam aeternam.

754
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,230
Amen.

755
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,980
Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi
custodiat animam...

756
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,990
...tuam in vitam aeternam.

757
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,900
Come here, my child.

758
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,030
Shy. Eh?

759
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,950
Let's not beat about the bush.

760
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,190
Sharpe's dying.

761
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,990
Soon he'll be dead.

762
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,470
And then you'll be all alone in the world.
And what are you going to do then. Hm?

763
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,230
Who wants a skivvy who can't speak?

764
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,110
If you're lucky. They'll hock you up in a convent.

765
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,150
If you're not lucky.

766
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,070
You'll be locked up by the first gang
of drunken soldiers that see you

767
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,110
and be shagged till you're silly.

768
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,310
You come up to my house a maidservant.

769
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,150
And I’ll do the same for you in the shagging line.

770
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,430
You'll have a roof over your head,
regular meals,

771
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,470
and a few pennies in your purse.

772
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,270
At least as long as your looks last.

773
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,390
Well, what do you say, eh?

774
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,830
(Grunts)

775
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,070
How about a silver shilling?

776
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,430
Do you mind doing most of it, dearie?

777
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,630
I'm feeling a bit fagged today.

778
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,590
Mm.

779
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,110
I say, you're a hot little whore, aren't you?

780
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,430
(Swallows)

781
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,580
Numbers... code.

782
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,630
Numbers... code.

783
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,910
Numbers... code.

784
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,430
God guided your hand, my child,
but the fever has not yet broken.

785
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,710
And that's bad.

786
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,870
Another day burning,
and his heart will stop beating.

787
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,060
Kill or cure.

788
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,460
Kill or cure? What do you mean?

789
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,350
Cold water.

790
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,630
The final weapon against fever.
As old as war and warriors.

791
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:51,390
The Celtic manuscripts say the burning body
should be laid out in an icy stream,

792
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,310
then wrapped tight in wool to break the fever.

793
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,990
It's very hard on the heart.

794
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,580
Kill or cure.

795
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,750
Morning, lass.

796
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,510
How can I thank you, lass?

797
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,950
Hold it, Harris.

798
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,990
Harper, I have it. The French code.

799
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,660
- You know how the first number is the page?
- Yeah.

800
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,470
- Well, the second number is the line in.
- Yeah.

801
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,150
The third is the line down,
and the fourth is the letter in the word.

802
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,830
The clever bugger
kept changing the combination.

803
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,790
- Mr. Sharpe will want to see this.
- Take it easy, Harris.

804
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,030
Harper, have you seen the name
at the end of this message?

805
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,110
Richard.

806
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,230
What is it, lass?

807
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,710
You spoke!

808
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,630
You said my name.

809
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,470
Is there something else, lass?

810
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,630
I love you.

811
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,550
I wish I could say the same, lass.

812
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,790
HARPER: Major Sharpe. Sir.

813
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,030
Button your tunic, Harper.

814
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,670
What's that you've got there?

815
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,470
Oh, this?

816
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,220
It's just another sword, sir.

817
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,870
I found it...

818
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,950
lying around.

819
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,630
Someone host it. I found it.

820
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,270
Why don't you have it?

821
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,950
You found it?

822
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,750
Lying around.

823
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,150
You're a lying bastard, Harper!

824
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,350
Maybe only sometimes, sir.

825
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,790
Any luck with the code book, Harris?

826
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,950
Luck, sir? I've got the lot.

827
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,420
Permission to speak, sir?

828
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,630
Best brown paper and paraffin oil.

829
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,030
For your wound.

830
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,950
Thank you, Hagman.

831
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,710
I've come with your cannon, Sharpe.

832
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,990
Good to see you up and about, Richard.

833
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,550
Good to see you, Jack.

834
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,790
I'll be in the library if you want to talk to me.

835
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,830
I'll join you presently.

836
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,500
I'm sorry, my son.

837
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,750
Men are seldom as they seem.

838
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,910
That's not true of you...

839
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,910
...El Mirador.

840
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,230
It was in the code.

841
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,230
But why? You fought against us.

842
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,230
Why do you now spy for Wellington?

843
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,950
I think the theological reasoning
would bore you, Sharpe.

844
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,070
This the book you're looking for?

845
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,790
Candide.

846
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,110
Catch.

847
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,990
Very fond of Voltaire.

848
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,030
I am.

849
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,950
You know what he said?

850
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,430
"God is not on the side of the big battalions,

851
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,070
but on the side of the best shots."

852
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,310
How are you feeling, Richard?

853
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,350
Just so, Jack.

854
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,510
Just so.

855
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,150
Candide was the code book.

856
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,070
So... you know who I am.

857
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,510
Harris handed me the name of the traitor
just half an hour ago.

858
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,870
I suppose they'll shoot me?

859
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,870
I should say so.

860
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,990
I didn't do it for the money, Richard.

861
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,830
Though it would have been damned useful.

862
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,830
In my father's house there are many mansions.

863
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,990
All of them mortgaged up to the hilt.

864
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,630
So why did you do it, Jack?

865
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,670
Courage.

866
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,430
It's like the king's shilling, Richard.

867
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,750
Some soldiers save it.

868
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,830
Some soldiers spend it all in one day.

869
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,740
I told you my life was saved by a French doctor.

870
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,390
Well, that doctor was Colonel Leroux.

871
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:57,270
And he saved my life simply by virtue of the fact
that he stopped torturing me before I died.

872
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,110
I... I just couldn't stand it any more.

873
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,790
You see, I had spent the whole coin of courage.

874
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,350
And then he made me sign some papers...

875
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,550
...betraying my honor.

876
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,110
And the honor...

877
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,790
...of a lady I once loved.

878
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,830
And I could not let him use that, so...

879
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,430
...so I became his spy,

880
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,670
ridiculous as that may seem to you, Richard.

881
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,750
Why didn't you kill Father Curtis?

882
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,510
You knew he was El Mirador.

883
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,870
Leroux ordered me to.

884
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,870
But I told him I would not do that.

885
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,270
He would have to do that himself.

886
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,870
And he would have done so,

887
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,230
if you hadn't wounded him at the fort.

888
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,910
The fort.

889
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,390
See, that's what I can't stomach, Jack.

890
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,590
I can see how you lost your way with Leroux.

891
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,710
And I can see you might not anticipate
him killing McDonald,

892
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,510
but what about Berkeley?

893
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,470
How could you betray Colonel Berkeley?

894
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,390
No, no.

895
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,310
Believe me, I didn't. Somebody else did that.

896
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,070
If I'd betrayed the fort.

897
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,110
I would have had to betray you.

898
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,470
I may be able to betray my country, but...

899
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,270
...I could never betray my friend.

900
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,150
So what am I supposed to do now, Jack?

901
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,790
Me not being an officer and a gentleman.

902
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,390
I mean, I know what an officer would do.

903
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,950
He'd put you under close arrest,
court-martial you, shoot you,

904
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,500
and let your family die of shame.

905
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,750
Oh, and I know what a gentleman would do.

906
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,510
He'd put a pistol on that table,
walk outside that door, and wait for you

907
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,550
to blow your brains out.

908
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,550
But me?

909
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,190
What the hell do I do with you, Jack?

910
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,830
You tell me, Richard.

911
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,580
I'm sending in the South Essex before sunset.

912
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,270
They're like me, Jack.

913
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,110
Shaky, very shaky.

914
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:14,060
They've got 500 yards of open ground to cross,
and they might not keep going under fire.

915
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,390
The French have cannon.

916
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,870
There's a rampart
with bloody sharp stakes at the bottom.

917
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,710
I need to send them off in such a way

918
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,270
that they won't stop
till they're standing in that fort.

919
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,630
Can you suggest something
that might put that kind of steel into them, Jack?

920
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:42,790
Yes, Richard.

921
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,670
I do believe I can.

922
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,150
Sergeant,

923
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,190
form the line.

924
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,070
Sir.

925
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,110
South Essex, form line!

926
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,510
Back to town, boys.
We'll see enough blood later.

927
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,910
Steady!

928
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,590
Keep back. Boys.

929
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,630
Another three on the gates, boys.

930
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,830
Then we're going in.

931
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,270
(Explosion)

932
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,830
(Explosion)

933
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,460
Steady!

934
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,620
Steady!

935
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,630
By God, lads,
aren't you going to give him a cheer?

936
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,950
(Cheering)

937
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,710
(Cheering)

938
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,620
Come on! Come on!

939
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,110
Go on, Jack.

940
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,630
Oh, good, yes!

941
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,670
Bally good!

942
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,750
Traître.

943
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,700
I want that flag.

944
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:11,830
Who's with me?

945
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,350
(Cheering)

946
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,710
Give us a tune,

947
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,750
Pipe Major.

948
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,460
(Pipes play)

949
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,390
Charge bayonets!

950
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,540
Out!

951
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,230
Forward march!

952
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,110
Feu!

953
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,830
Steady, boys!

954
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:25,870
Steady!

955
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,030
Come on! Hold that line!

956
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,590
Dan.

957
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,070
Aye.

958
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:17,150
Never had a skivvy say no to me before.

959
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,270
Made me hot.

960
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,790
So I waited till Sharpe was busy

961
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,830
with the Frogs.

962
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,070
And I came to hear you say yes.

963
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,910
Came to hear you beg...

964
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:34,910
...actually.

965
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,950
Now. Don't move.

966
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,030
On your knees.

967
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,790
CURTIS: She's one of us.

968
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,550
She goes on her knees
only before God, Sir Henry.

969
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,870
Was it you who betrayed
Colonel Berkeley's night attack?

970
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,310
How much did they pay you?

971
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,710
Suppose I did it for nothing?

972
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,750
Who's to say what really happened?

973
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,260
Not you, anyway.

974
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:14,110
And no-one in London would take your word
against the word of Sir Henry Simmerson.

975
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,870
Well, what's it to you, priest?
You hate the British.

976
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,180
I'm Irish.

977
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,900
John Bull's a bad neighbor,
but Bonaparte's a bully, and so are you.

978
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,550
God forgive me, but I wish it had lasted longer.

979
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,350
Halt!

980
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,230
(Explosion)

981
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,460
Make ready

982
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,510
Fire!

983
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,590
Charge!

984
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:16,910
Coop, cover!

985
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:22,630
Go!

986
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,630
Parole, monsieur?

987
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:05,990
Oui.

988
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,150
Harris, tear down that French rag.

989
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,150
Put up some proper Colors.

990
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,350
(Cheering)

991
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,350
Parole. Monsieur?

992
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,870
No parole.

993
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,060
Not this time.

994
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,430
You fight me now. Sword on sword.

995
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,630
Kill me, you go free.

996
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:52,910
My word on it.

997
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,110
- You hear that, Munro?
- Aye, but he doesn't understand. Allow me...

998
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,190
He bloody understands! Don't you, Leroux?

999
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,350
Of course.

1000
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:09,590
Well... (Coughs)

1001
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,950
It will be a pleasure to kill you, Mr. Sharpe.

1002
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,150
Really.

1003
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:20,750
Please.

1004
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,350
No.

1005
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:26,390
Not here amongst your French dead.

1006
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,470
But here, amongst mine.

1007
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,080
Here, where you killed McDonald,

1008
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,830
where you killed Berkeley.
Where you killed Jack Spears.

1009
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,510
Here, on my ground, Leroux.

1010
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,910
English ground.

1011
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,590
Come and kill me.

1012
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,950
Outside.

1013
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:50,990
No

1014
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,750
- Come on. Sir.
- Good luck. Sir.

1015
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,910
Come on, then.

1016
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,190
En garde.

1017
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,630
Sir, sir, sir.

1018
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:11,310
Sergeant Harper, sir. He's...

1019
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,110
Come. Come on.

1020
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:21,630
CURTIS: Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis
in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

1021
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,590
Am I going to die this time, Father?

1022
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:26,350
Yes, my son.

1023
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,990
Have you any last wishes?

1024
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,310
I wish I'd married Ramona, Father.

1025
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,430
I can grant you that before you go.

1026
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,510
Quickly, now.

1027
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,990
Do you, Patrick Harper, take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1028
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,060
Say "I do".

1029
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:42,110
I do.

1030
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,310
Do you, Ramona Gonzalez, take this man
to be your husband? Say "I do".

1031
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,310
- I do.
- I now pronounce you

1032
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,790
man and wife.

1033
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,510
Now, get up and kiss the bride.

1034
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,790
I thought you said I was going to die, Father.

1035
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,750
We're all going to die, Patrick.

1036
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,390
(Laughter)

1037
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,230
(Cheering)

1038
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,430
So you're staying, Emma?

1039
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,830
There's work to be done.

1040
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,830
# Let kings and tyrants come and go

1041
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,710
# I'll stand adjudged by what I know

1042
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,830
# A soldier's life I'll ne'er gainsay

1043
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:42,510
# Over the hills and far away

1044
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,940
# O'er the hills and o'er the main

1045
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,670
# Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain

1046
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,670
# King George commands and we obey

1047
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,670
# Over the hills and far away
