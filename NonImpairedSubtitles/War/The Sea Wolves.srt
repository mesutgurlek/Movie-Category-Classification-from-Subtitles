1
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:10,531
Vorsicht!

2
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:35,325
Rohr eins und zwei. Klar machen.

3
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,025
Rohr eins.

4
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,829
Klar machen.

5
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,100
- Rohr eins.
- Los.

6
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:44,733
- Los.
- Los.

7
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,635
Right on time.

8
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:18,607
Yes, a bit out of the way.
I hope we don't miss the news.

9
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,404
No, you won't miss the news.

10
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:21,341
Right.

11
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:27,074
For God's sake, slow down, Bill!
You're a maniac!

12
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:28,682
We're late.

13
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:29,810
To hell with that!

14
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:33,516
I'm only having a drink.
I'd like to be alive to enjoy it.

15
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:03,615
Hello, Bill.

16
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:07,885
Gentlemen, I want you to know that our
commanding officer just tried to kill me.

17
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:13,856
- Man's a maniac!
- Shut up!

18
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:15,896
Here's the news with Alvar Liddell.

19
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:18,325
An official announcement
from Washington...

20
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:20,233
You'd think we could afford a new radio!

21
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:22,829
...shows the Americans landed
in Algiers and Oran...

22
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:25,238
...on the Mediterranean coast
of French North Africa.

23
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,504
Hitler said he'd be in Cairo by Christmas.

24
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:29,375
That'll take the pressure off back home.

25
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:31,414
They've promised a second front
long enough.

26
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,813
American landings were carried out
in the night...

27
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:36,079
...made with British naval and air support.

28
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,956
Many divisions of the British Army
are on their way to reinforce them.

29
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:44,289
The Supreme Commander
is General Eisenhower.

30
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:47,023
Ike'll soon sort that lot out.

31
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:02,635
Your drink, sir.

32
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,524
Lewis, I didn't see you there.

33
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:21,894
Haven't seen you for weeks.
Where've you been?

34
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:24,399
Here and there.
Another hush-hush scheme...

35
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:27,862
...attempting to produce petrol
from cow manure.

36
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,267
Sound promising?

37
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,466
We get our best results from sacred cows.

38
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,770
How are things at SOE?

39
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:37,210
Splendid. Nearly every night
an electrifying bridge game.

40
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:39,845
Good old top-secret Colonel Pugh.

41
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,674
You're lucky you're in uniform.

42
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:45,449
I'm just a bloody tea planter.
What's tea got to do with the war?

43
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,789
I'm told it's good for morale.

44
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:52,352
SOE: Special Operations Executive.
What the devil do you chaps do?

45
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:54,323
Odd jobs.

46
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:55,656
Come on.

47
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:58,130
All right. Unusual operations.

48
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:01,630
You sound like a ruddy abortionist.

49
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,204
Not a bad description.

50
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:08,003
I see you're having lunch, so I'll trot along.
God bless. See you soon.

51
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:09,342
I hope so.

52
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:13,713
Thanks for the drink, Bill.
Don't offer me another lift, ever.

53
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:17,312
- Red, don't you owe me a drink?
- What was that about?

54
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:20,151
Well, I scared the hell out of him
by driving too fast.

55
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,623
My own frustration, I suppose.
I'm just as envious of you as he is.

56
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:27,121
Being the managing director
of a chemical plant is not my idea...

57
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:29,392
...of a glorious contribution to the war.

58
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,031
What do you want me to say?

59
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,035
You're classified essential where you are.

60
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:36,732
If you want to consider me lucky
to be doing what I'm doing, go ahead.

61
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:39,899
What happened to your wife
and daughter in Coventry--

62
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,102
Come off it, Bill.

63
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:44,278
I'm sorry, Lewis. I didn't mean
to open up old wounds...

64
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:47,349
...but you do have some opportunity
for revenge.

65
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:51,877
Oh, good God. If I have to kill
some poor devils, it's not revenge.

66
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:57,955
It doesn't really diminish my anger
or my grief. Not one bit.

67
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,025
Now, what do you say we try
to have a pleasant lunch?

68
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,091
I'm sorry, Lewis.

69
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:07,193
- How's Doris?
- She's fine. She's fine.

70
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,568
Lewis, if you should ever hear of a job
that's so odd...

71
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:14,576
...that nobody else would want
to get involved in it...

72
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,374
...do think of the Calcutta Light Horse.

73
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:20,281
It's not very likely.

74
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:24,045
No, I know. We're all civilians these days
and a little thin on top...

75
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:26,453
...and thick in the middle, but I guarantee...

76
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:29,048
...each of those fellows would pull
his own weight.

77
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:31,519
That's not an intentional joke.

78
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:34,029
You will remember it, won't you?
Just in case.

79
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:37,891
I shan't forget.

80
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:03,089
- Morning, Corporal.
- Morning, sir.

81
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:23,011
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

82
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,104
Colonel Pugh and Captain Stewart
are here.

83
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:26,513
Thank you.

84
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:30,919
- Lewis, how did things go in Calcutta?
- All set, sir.

85
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:34,889
By tomorrow night Force 136 should be
behind Japanese lines in Burma...

86
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:36,888
...blowing up various little items.

87
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,123
Good. All right, let's get down
to the new business.

88
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:44,098
I see you've been studying
the Admiralty's urgent request.

89
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:47,330
Astonishing. Forty-six freighters sunk
by German submarines...

90
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,668
...in the lndian Ocean in the past month.

91
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,107
The U-boats know exactly where
and when to strike.

92
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:56,744
Incredibly accurate information,
etcetera, etcetera.

93
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:01,384
Radio Monitoring finally managed
to home in on a powerful transmitter...

94
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,783
...400 miles south of Bombay
just last night.

95
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:06,449
What do you suppose
took them so long, sir?

96
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:08,285
Ours not to reason why.

97
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,188
Well, here we go Gavin.
Off to blow up a transmitter.

98
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:14,995
Not exactly. The bloody thing's not
in India proper.

99
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:18,699
It's in Goa, dammit.
Somewhere in the Mormugoa Harbour.

100
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:21,327
Neutral territory. Portuguese colony.

101
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,438
- That's a bit tricky.
- Naturally.

102
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,210
Also, our people aren't able
to break the code.

103
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:32,977
If Radio Monitoring are right,
and the transmitter is actually...

104
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,107
...in the harbor, it must be on a ship.

105
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:39,849
You don't suppose it's on one of the three
German freighters interned there?

106
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:42,585
The Portuguese authorities dismantled
the ships' radios...

107
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,684
...when they gave them permission to stay.

108
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:49,061
How do we know one of them doesn't have
another transmitter hidden somewhere?

109
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:51,828
We don't. Here we are
with the strictest orders...

110
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:54,166
...never to violate PortugaI's neutrality.

111
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:56,228
What do you suggest we do about it, sir?

112
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:58,433
We can sit here and froth at the mouth...

113
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:02,444
...or find out where the information
to those U-boats originates.

114
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:06,040
I suggest that Gavin and I
spend a day or two in Goa...

115
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,880
...poking about to see what we can dig up.

116
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,477
Dig up, or pick up?

117
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:14,090
- Oh, he speaks for himself, sir.
- I speak for myself.

118
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,523
Yes, well I was speaking for you.

119
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:23,589
Yes, all right, I suppose this is top priority.
Go ahead and dig.

120
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:52,657
Der Kapitan.

121
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,503
Well, that's the three of them.

122
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,039
Yes, but which has the transmitter?

123
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:46,881
There's our old friend.

124
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:52,120
Gentlemen, a great pleasure
to see you again.

125
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,152
Manuel.

126
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:55,982
Please.

127
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:00,930
How's the heart, Manuel?

128
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:02,859
My heart... I never...

129
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,965
- You joke with me.
- Not exactly.

130
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:07,435
Sit down, Manuel.

131
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:09,568
You look like your feet hurt.

132
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,900
The Germans outside,
which ship are they from?

133
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:16,012
The Ehrenfels.

134
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,673
- Captain Rofer.
- A very charming gentleman, actually.

135
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:22,212
No doubt. Well, what's been happening?

136
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,349
- Nothing, just the usual.
- The usual what?

137
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:27,718
People coming and going,
eating and drinking.

138
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,322
Everything normal.

139
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:32,122
How's the...gambling, Manuel?

140
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:36,596
A little slow. Naturally, the police
keep asking for more and more.

141
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,699
That's too bad. Let's get to the point.

142
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:43,261
My friend here has a nice fat packet
of escudos to lose...

143
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:44,498
...on your wheel.

144
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:47,338
- Personally, I would wish for him to win.
- Manuel!

145
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,446
How much are we talking about?

146
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:58,784
All of it. And then I commit suicide
right on your doorstep.

147
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:04,225
By the same token, I could give it
to you here, right now.

148
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:05,624
No. No, Senhor, no.

149
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,492
Maybe it'd be more fun to lose it bit by bit.
What do you think?

150
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:11,932
- Yes, Senhor.
- Meanwhile, you and I will have...

151
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:15,565
...a pleasant little chat
in your private office.

152
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,630
Please.

153
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,617
I'll be one minute.

154
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:40,628
Rien ne va plus.
No more bets, ladies and gentlemen.

155
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:08,388
Thank you.

156
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:13,426
Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.

157
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:17,627
- Rien ne va plus. No more bets.
- Good luck.

158
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,567
- It's bad luck to say that.
- Oh, instantly retracted.

159
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,665
Trente-quatre. Rouge. Pair et passe.

160
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:26,402
Thirty-four. Red and even.

161
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,973
It must have been the instant retraction.

162
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:31,672
Or maybe it was the good luck
to begin with.

163
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:33,678
Or how about plain destiny?

164
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:37,409
- Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.
- I'll think I'll try that again.

165
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:39,212
Good luck.

166
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,487
No more bets.

167
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:42,582
I hope so.

168
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:47,492
How about celebrating my impending loss
with a bottle of champagne?

169
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:49,827
Thank you, I don't drink when I gamble.

170
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,960
Smoke?

171
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:54,897
- Tap dance?
- Not recently.

172
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,662
How about tea in the lounge?

173
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:59,207
You do hear those little clicking sounds?

174
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:02,539
Trente et un. Noir et impasse.

175
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:04,942
Thirty-one. Black and odd.

176
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:08,007
By the way, my name is Gavin Stewart.

177
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:11,211
I take it that is a wedding ring?

178
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:12,754
That's what it is.

179
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:15,188
- And you are Mrs...?
- Cromwell.

180
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:18,358
Let me hazard a guess, Mrs. Cromwell.

181
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:21,292
You are here in Goa on holiday...

182
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:24,265
...and your husband is a large gentleman
probably sitting...

183
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:25,699
...at the baccarat table.

184
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:28,396
No, I live here and my husband is dead.

185
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,870
- Oh, I'm sorry. I tend to be--
- Over charming?

186
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,271
I really am sorry.

187
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:37,473
There's no need to be.

188
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,575
Let's watch our money disappear.

189
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,583
Rien ne va plus. No more bets.

190
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:45,418
Manuel, you're not thinking hard enough.

191
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:47,983
- I'm doing my best.
- Well, let's try again.

192
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:51,584
We're talking about lndians
who visit your outdoor café frequently.

193
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:54,828
Yes, quite a few. I said so.
It's a very popular place.

194
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:59,095
And we're talking about someone else.
Probably a German who might...

195
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:02,403
...just pass by at the same time every day.

196
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:07,103
- It's not something I--
- Or who might drop in for a few minutes.

197
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:11,078
Or who might be followed down the street
by one of the lndians.

198
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:14,908
Look, I'd really like to help you,
but I don't notice these things.

199
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,009
I'm too busy in the place.

200
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:18,249
Manuel...

201
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:21,016
...listen.

202
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:24,184
Whatever you pay the police to let you
keep the gambling going...

203
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,252
...I can double it to have them
shut you down.

204
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,621
So, take a bit of friendly advice.

205
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,727
I want you to notice these things.

206
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:37,061
Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

207
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,235
- Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
- You have faith.

208
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:45,041
"Hope" would be a better word.

209
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:48,182
Would you mind if I ask
what you're doing in Goa?

210
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:51,220
Losing. But with incredible grace.

211
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:54,152
Actually I'm here on business
just for the day.

212
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,453
I have to be back in Bombay
tomorrow night.

213
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:59,487
I may sound quaint, but I sell tea.

214
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:06,133
Vingt-deux. Noir. Pair et passe.
Twenty-two. Black and even.

215
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:07,735
Well, that does it.

216
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:09,901
You've lost quite a lot. I'm sorry.

217
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:12,065
The way I look at it, I won.

218
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,967
I met you...

219
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:16,102
...and I'd like to meet you again.

220
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:17,441
Perhaps you will...

221
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:19,208
...on your next trip.

222
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,107
I'll be here.

223
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:36,662
Faites vosjeux.
Place your bets ladies and gentlemen.

224
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,728
Senhor, I'm very frightened.

225
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:44,063
Manuel, I promised you that no one
will ever know you've said anything at all.

226
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,739
You don't even know their names.

227
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:49,676
All you know is that an lndian with a mole
on his cheek and a tall European...

228
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,440
...may be communicating with each other.

229
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:56,383
- Or they may not.
- Exactly. Lewis, we've a long drive.

230
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,113
Senhor. The gambling...?

231
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:01,780
Strictly between you and the police.

232
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:10,125
Mrs. Cromwell. May I be
of some assistance?

233
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:14,235
Manuel, I've been really lucky.
I'm taking home a lot of your money.

234
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:16,695
I'm so happy for you. Congratulations.

235
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:21,972
Well, you probably know I'll come back and
lose it all, but just now I feel marvelous.

236
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:24,774
Manuel, I'd like to give you
a little something.

237
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:27,782
- No, I couldn't accept.
- Why not?

238
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,283
Of course you could.

239
00:18:29,352 --> 00:18:31,547
But I never tip you when you lose.

240
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:32,910
Manuel.

241
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,879
I insist!

242
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:38,860
Look, dammit! We've got to get rid
of that transmitter!

243
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,395
Do you know how many lives depend
on supplies lying...

244
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:42,988
...at the bottom of the lndian Ocean?

245
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:46,899
I think we do, sir. But we still don't know
exactly where it is.

246
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:50,369
I think our first priority is to find
whoever heads the spy ring.

247
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,570
How will you handle that?
Your lead in Goa...

248
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:54,973
...is rather fragile.

249
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:59,344
I'm not so sure. We know that the man
who gave it to us was murdered.

250
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:01,079
It's worth following up.

251
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,347
And just suppose you discover
who the head spy is. Then what?

252
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:07,717
Gavin and I kidnap him
and interrogate him rather thoroughly.

253
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:10,217
- In Goa?
- Right, if that's where he is.

254
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:13,729
Granted, there's a risk of being caught
in neutral territory.

255
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:15,696
We can always plead insanity, sir.

256
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:17,697
He speaks for himself.

257
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:22,066
Then do it, but it dislikes me.
If you two are caught...

258
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:24,766
...God knows what trouble we'll be in.

259
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:29,307
- Yes, all right. Go ahead and make plans.
- Thank you, sir.

260
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:36,308
- Watch it, Gavin.
- Why not?

261
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:45,684
Helen, get me 641 in Goa.

262
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:11,478
Compliments of the management.

263
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:14,122
That's what I call Portuguese hospitality.

264
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:15,986
Thank you very much.

265
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,518
Thank you. Welcome to Goa.

266
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:20,559
Thank you.

267
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:27,366
That was fast.

268
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:31,935
The truth is, Mackenzie has a telephone
built into his wooden leg.

269
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:33,066
What does it say?

270
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:36,942
''Possible your man is Ram das Gupta.
Indian. About 32.

271
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:42,878
''Large mole on right cheek.
Clerk for lnter-Europe Shipping, Bombay.

272
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:46,544
''Currently living at 197 Cabral Street, Goa.

273
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:51,187
''Known political activist
for lndian independence.''

274
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,951
I think we should meet this fellow.

275
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,030
That means right now.

276
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:04,006
Hurry up, children, you'll be late for school.

277
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:11,870
Bom dia.

278
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:00,827
- May I use your telephone?
- Sim, Senhor.

279
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:02,227
Thank you.

280
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:10,329
Ishla.

281
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:12,874
- Three, two, nine.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,270
He'll be calling me back.

283
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,652
Yes?

284
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:26,718
Who?

285
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:28,717
Oh, damn.

286
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,352
Is there someone here named
Ram das Gupta?

287
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:35,624
This call is for a Mr. Ram das Gupta.
Perhaps he's outside.

288
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:43,597
- Senhor Ram das Gupta?
- Yes?

289
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,237
Telephone.

290
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:01,651
I'm sure you'd like to go to the toilet.

291
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:11,693
Now, listen very carefully.
Your name is Ram das Gupta.

292
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:15,860
You live at 197 Cabral Street.
You work at lnter-Europe Shipping.

293
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:19,207
Unless you fully cooperate,
we'll be delighted to kill you.

294
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,435
Is that understood?

295
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:24,374
Listen to this: ''The Ennismore Trader.
6,212 tons.

296
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,745
''Cargo varied including tank

and 21.00 hours.''

299
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:38,650
That's one we've saved.

300
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:41,663
You are a naughty boy.
Now we'd like you to go back...

301
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:44,698
...to your table and continue
with your usual routine.

302
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:48,464
We'll be watching. The tiniest false move
and you're dead.

303
00:24:38,254 --> 00:24:39,721
Orangejuice.

304
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:54,960
The Fatherland's No. 1 agent
in Southern Asia.

305
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:56,326
Are you sure?

306
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:57,767
I'm sure.

307
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:39,037
Stay here, I'll be back.

308
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:48,085
Senhor.

309
00:26:12,982 --> 00:26:15,815
Did that strong coffee upset your stomach?

310
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:17,714
- No.
- Pity.

311
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,654
If you don't keep your mouth shut,
our next meeting may not be this friendly.

312
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:31,456
Mrs. Cromwell!

313
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:36,062
Hello...or words to that effect.

314
00:26:36,372 --> 00:26:37,532
Hello.

315
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:42,335
What a coincidence. I've been sitting
over there waiting for you.

316
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:44,369
No, you haven't.

317
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,883
I cannot tell a lie. To tell you the truth,
I'm waiting for a business associate...

318
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:51,943
...who's never been on time in his life.

319
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,917
- By the way, it's Gavin.
- I remember.

320
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:28,854
Do I still call you Mrs. Cromwell?

321
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:32,086
No, wait! Don't answer that.
What's your dog's name?

322
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,452
- You won't laugh?
- Guaranteed.

323
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,058
Hamlet.

324
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,762
But he's not a Great Dane.

325
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:44,397
He doesn't know that.
And you may not believe this...

326
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:47,100
...but they named me Agnes.

327
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:52,209
I'm still not laughing, Agnes.

328
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:55,273
There I was, a helpless infant...
Coffee, please.

329
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:57,785
- A human arm for the dog, please.
- Pardon, Senhor?

330
00:27:57,853 --> 00:28:01,687
Just the coffee. You were saying?
A helpless infant...

331
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:05,994
May I say how spectacularly
you have matured?

332
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:11,226
But first, is it all right if I continue
to call you Mrs. Cromwell?

333
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,530
That's the best idea I've heard all day.

334
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:18,469
lt's still early, Mrs. Cromwell.

335
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,308
I really must leave.
The beast needs exercise.

336
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:57,570
Don't forget, we still have that date.

337
00:29:00,983 --> 00:29:02,848
Thanks for the coffee.

338
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,552
Have a lovely walk, Mrs. Cromwell.

339
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:13,820
- Fast work.
- Well, man does not live by bread alone.

340
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:17,327
A man who loves dogs can't be all bad.

341
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,961
Come along, I have some news for you.

342
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,708
There, those two men.

343
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:31,609
We pay the bill and then wait
outside Trompeta's house.

344
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,840
Right.

345
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:35,773
We could wait there all day and night, too.

346
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:38,217
Won't the car look a trifle conspicuous?

347
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:42,690
I suppose it might, but we can't
just break into his house and take him.

348
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:47,284
We could, except we don't know
who else might be there.

349
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:51,489
I don't like the idea
of Gupta running about loose.

350
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:54,058
I mean, he knows we're not in tea.

351
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:01,440
All right...

352
00:30:02,277 --> 00:30:04,507
...we'll pick up Mr. Trompeta
in the morning.

353
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:11,750
Well, in that event, Lewis,
I have a small favor to ask.

354
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:16,917
There's no need to look at me like that.

355
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,959
You know my country comes first.

356
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:22,053
You'd like me to take a long,
invigorating walk tonight.

357
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:24,122
You could sit in the bar.

358
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,694
The walk will do me more good.

359
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,590
Excuse me, Senhor,
do you have a light for my cigarette?

360
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:46,900
Put your hands on your head.

361
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,313
You're a bloody fool.

362
00:32:52,481 --> 00:32:54,676
You shoot me,
your life's not worth a rupee.

363
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,748
Nevertheless, I will also shoot the lady.

364
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:17,929
You killed him.

365
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,174
Yes, he was about to kill me and you.

366
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:25,836
That sort of thing tends
to make me impulsive.

367
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,708
Did you know him?

368
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:30,742
No.

369
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:36,081
It was a nice throw. Thank you.

370
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:09,687
Good God! Who's that?

371
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,892
Well, it's a little complicated.

372
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:17,492
Where did you get the pistol?

373
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:19,495
From him.

374
00:34:20,736 --> 00:34:22,704
That is just perfect.

375
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:26,468
We have an appointment tomorrow
with the lmperial Tea Company...

376
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:28,871
...not with the bloody police.

377
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:31,907
What was I supposed to do, Lewis?
Let him kill us?

378
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:36,309
As you've probably gathered,
this is my boss.

379
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:37,875
How do you do?

380
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:42,817
A little civility wouldn't be out of place,
would it? I mean, it wasn't her fault.

381
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:45,953
I want to go now.

382
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:47,425
- I'll take you.
- No, thanks.

383
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:50,829
I didn't mean to sound rude.
You must be very upset.

384
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,260
Upset?

385
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:58,266
Why would I be upset?
I mean, it was just a simple murder.

386
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:02,237
I promise you, you won't be involved
with the police.

387
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:04,943
That is, unless you wish
to involve yourself.

388
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:09,909
In Goa? That's all I need.
No, this is strictly your problem.

389
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:13,581
lf it comes to it, I'll deny I was here.

390
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,054
As you wish.

391
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:19,317
Goodnight.

392
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:27,897
Did you really have to kill him?

393
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:32,099
We could have worked on him and perhaps
learned something about Trompeta.

394
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:35,507
Honestly, Lewis, I really had no choice.
What happened to you?

395
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,077
Two very pleasant chaps tried to kill me
at the dock.

396
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:43,248
Did they? Maybe we should have
both sat in the bar.

397
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:44,751
Where are they now?

398
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:46,779
They're resting.

399
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:50,223
What do we do with him?

400
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:53,693
As Mackenzie said,
''When in trouble, call room service.''

401
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,133
Bis heute nachmittag.

402
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:02,465
Sehr gut. lch bereite alles vor
wie versprochen.

403
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,969
Could I trouble you for a match?

404
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:11,408
I don't smoke.

405
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,948
Would you please look
at the white car over there?

406
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,176
I think you might find it interesting.

407
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:20,817
If he has to kill you here and now, he will.

408
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:23,948
Let's you and I get into the car
very quietly.

409
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:51,513
Just relax, sit back. That's a good boy.

410
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:03,493
Help! They're kidnapping me...

411
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:04,793
...help!

412
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,164
Dammit!

413
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:45,998
There's no longer much point...

414
00:37:46,074 --> 00:37:48,269
...in delivering him to lntelligence.

415
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:50,038
- Let's dump him here.
- No.

416
00:37:50,612 --> 00:37:54,139
Wait till we've crossed the border.
We can't have him found in Goa.

417
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:46,327
A vossa identificaçao, se faz favor?

418
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,466
Your papers, gentlemen?

419
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,467
Yes, of course.

420
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,039
Turned out nice again, hasn't it?

421
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:55,669
Thank you.

422
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,316
And that gentleman?

423
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:09,647
Here it is. I'm sure you'll find
everything in order.

424
00:39:12,694 --> 00:39:15,424
Perfectly, sir. Have a good trip, gentlemen.

425
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:32,580
You got away with killing Trompeta
and a fat lot of good it did us.

426
00:39:32,914 --> 00:39:35,610
We did find out the transmitter's
on the Ehrenfels.

427
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:36,912
I understand your feelings.

428
00:39:37,052 --> 00:39:40,453
No you don't. You took one hell of a risk
for next to nothing.

429
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:43,520
Whoever Trompeta's No. 2 man is
took over immediately.

430
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:45,957
We still haven't been able
to break the code.

431
00:39:46,027 --> 00:39:48,393
While you were on the train back to Delhi...

432
00:39:48,463 --> 00:39:52,297
...three more ships have been sunk.
Did you hear what I said?

433
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:56,465
Three more ships have been sunk.
I'd like to go into that harbor...

434
00:39:56,538 --> 00:39:58,529
...with commandoes and blow the place up.

435
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:01,439
But we can't, which is rather frustrating.

436
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:06,909
I've got no suggestions, which may
account for my unpleasant disposition.

437
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,683
If the professionals can't do it,
we might have to turn to amateurs.

438
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:18,381
And what does that mean?

439
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,191
What if a group of British civilians
managed to board the Ehrenfels?

440
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:26,094
If they were caught, it might be taken
as a drunken escapade.

441
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:30,297
You know, businessmen on holiday in Goa
without their wives...

442
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:35,238
...having a smashing good time. A little
chancy with the Portuguese government.

443
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:38,744
That's a masterpiece of understatement.
London would have our heads.

444
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,273
It might just succeed, sir.

445
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:46,286
And which civilians did you have in mind?

446
00:40:46,454 --> 00:40:48,684
The Calcutta Light Horse, sir.

447
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:52,918
- The what?
- It's a part-time territorial unit.

448
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:55,724
They haven't seen action for 40 years.

449
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:59,528
Lewis, you're talking about a mixed bag
of boozing, middle-aged...

450
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:01,432
...pot-bellied businessmen.

451
00:41:01,536 --> 00:41:05,131
No argument, but when the war started
every man Jack of them...

452
00:41:05,306 --> 00:41:07,206
...volunteered for active service.

453
00:41:07,275 --> 00:41:10,403
Those not accepted for whatever reasons
are all ex-soldiers.

454
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:15,378
They know weapons, they know tactics.
They'd give their right arms to help.

455
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:18,811
It's insane, Lewis, and you know it.

456
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:38,205
Put together a plan and let's see it.

457
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:41,566
Thank you, sir.

458
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,322
Well done!

459
00:42:01,996 --> 00:42:04,089
- Have you seen Bill?
- No.

460
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:05,765
Probably in the bar.

461
00:42:11,806 --> 00:42:15,207
Obviously everything we've told you,
the operation, the destination...

462
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:17,608
...all of it is for your ears only.

463
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:19,642
Do you expect my men to volunteer...

464
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:21,978
...without any idea of what for?

465
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,347
- Right.
- I thought so.

466
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:27,744
All that the men must know
is that it couldn't be more important.

467
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:31,183
It'll be quite risky and it's top-secret.

468
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:36,189
Unfortunately, there'll be no pay in it,
no pensions if anyone's killed...

469
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:38,526
...or wounded, and no credit.

470
00:42:39,968 --> 00:42:42,266
It all sounds unbelievably attractive to me.

471
00:42:42,337 --> 00:42:44,635
I take it, no medals if all goes well?

472
00:42:44,706 --> 00:42:47,368
No medals. No recognition at all.

473
00:42:49,377 --> 00:42:50,605
I love it...

474
00:42:50,678 --> 00:42:52,236
...and so will they.

475
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,947
- Melborne again.
- Bit early for casualties, isn't it?

476
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,917
He'll be all right.

477
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:05,924
- You okay, Dicky?
- Damn fool!

478
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:07,821
Are you all right?

479
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:11,454
Yes, I think so. Just knocked
all the wind out of me.

480
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,466
Well, there's enough of it in there,
Dicky lad.

481
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:17,766
- That's tremendously amusing.
- Must be a relief to your pony.

482
00:43:18,273 --> 00:43:19,467
Robin, old chap...

483
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:23,134
...once I've adjusted my truss,
I'll be happy to thump you on the head.

484
00:43:23,211 --> 00:43:26,738
Come on, Dicky, just a bit of fun
in a cold, cruel world.

485
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:19,062
I've told you everything about
this operation that I'm allowed to.

486
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:24,130
The Light Horse has not been in action
as a unit since the Boer War in 1900.

487
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,741
But I hope and believe
that we soon will be.

488
00:44:31,646 --> 00:44:34,638
I'm calling for between
15 and 20 volunteers.

489
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,183
One here, sir.

490
00:44:38,953 --> 00:44:41,979
I was afraid of that. Thank you, gentlemen.
I appreciate it.

491
00:44:42,357 --> 00:44:45,849
Now, those of you who are selected
will leave in about seven days.

492
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:48,189
You'll be gone for two weeks.

493
00:44:48,296 --> 00:44:50,992
It's best to tell your wives
you're ordered to Ranchi...

494
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:55,201
...for a two-week training period
of local defence, that sort of thing.

495
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:58,830
So, now will you all please give
your names and telephone numbers to...

496
00:44:58,906 --> 00:45:00,635
...Sandy Lumsdaine.

497
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:12,742
Here we go.

498
00:45:28,903 --> 00:45:30,268
Sorry, Jack.

499
00:45:30,505 --> 00:45:33,099
- Bill, I'm going on--
- We'll talk about it later.

500
00:45:36,044 --> 00:45:37,944
God bless us, everyone.

501
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,010
Or help us. Take your choice.

502
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,347
Move that game further down the beach
if you don't mind.

503
00:46:17,285 --> 00:46:20,584
It starts off like a Hungarian omelet.
First steal one egg.

504
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:22,885
We're actually stealing an entire ship.

505
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,482
We can't rent one and naturally
the Navy has nothing available.

506
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:29,687
Then I have to sail the bloody thing
the whole way round lndia...

507
00:46:29,764 --> 00:46:31,857
...from Calcutta to Cochin.

508
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:36,234
Yes, you're the only one of us
with any experience at sea.

509
00:46:36,304 --> 00:46:40,536
And all I get is five Light Horse for crew,
plus three hired lascars.

510
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:43,366
We are not stealing the Queen Mary.

511
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:46,811
We're not exactly looking
for a rowboat either.

512
00:46:49,817 --> 00:46:52,786
Charlie Wilton knows engines
and I can navigate.

513
00:46:54,322 --> 00:46:55,880
Well, suppose we make it.

514
00:46:55,957 --> 00:46:58,892
Then you bring the others
across by train to Cochin...

515
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:00,994
...I pick you up and we sail...

516
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:04,498
...right in to Mormugoa Harbour
and blow up everything in sight.

517
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:05,463
Just like that.

518
00:47:05,633 --> 00:47:08,227
Right. Nothing to it.
For a grand finale, we escape.

519
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,936
Twenty of us against maybe 120 of them.

520
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:14,907
There won't be 120 of them.
Gavin will see to that.

521
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:18,103
He'll be in Goa arranging
all sorts of brilliant diversions.

522
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:22,509
Come in. I think it's Jack.
He wants to see me.

523
00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:28,621
- Come in, Jack, take a seat.
- No thanks, sir, I'll stand.

524
00:47:28,923 --> 00:47:30,254
Forget the ''sir.''

525
00:47:30,324 --> 00:47:34,351
I can't make a speech, but this is
the only chance I'll have...

526
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:37,456
...to settle accounts for my boy.

527
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:39,294
Your boy?

528
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:40,766
He was killed in Burma.

529
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:43,267
I didn't know. Sorry.

530
00:47:45,973 --> 00:47:48,601
Well, that's really what I came about.

531
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:52,974
God knows, I know how you feel,
but you must realize--

532
00:47:53,047 --> 00:47:54,514
I don't think you do at all.

533
00:47:54,615 --> 00:47:58,517
But you don't understand the operation.
I don't know how to say this, but...

534
00:47:59,387 --> 00:48:01,947
We just can't risk your old ticker.

535
00:48:02,023 --> 00:48:04,548
There's nothing wrong with it.
I have my pills.

536
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:06,115
I'll take him.

537
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:08,793
No liability at all.

538
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:13,427
I do have some strange deals to make
and I'm sure he'll handle some of them...

539
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:15,365
...better than I can.

540
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,335
Well, Bill?

541
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:23,141
All right, Jack. lt's all yours.

542
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,631
God, I'm dying.

543
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:49,067
Hell, I'm dead.

544
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:50,728
I've been dead nearly 20 minutes.

545
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:53,035
I thought I smelled something strange.

546
00:49:05,853 --> 00:49:07,912
Good God, what are you doing?

547
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:09,183
Just toning up.

548
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:10,918
What on earth for?

549
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:12,250
My health.

550
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:15,420
Well, mind your hernia, dear.

551
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:25,234
Why the hell don't you whistle
or something before you come out here?

552
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:32,274
Mr. Melborne!

553
00:49:32,446 --> 00:49:33,572
Are you all right?

554
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:37,175
No. I'm just having a private heart attack.

555
00:49:37,818 --> 00:49:39,217
Get out, Miss Wentworth!

556
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:42,717
Come in.

557
00:49:46,127 --> 00:49:48,357
Lewis! Delightful to see you.

558
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:51,559
Is that Gavin? By george, it is Gavin.

559
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:55,395
If you mean the one with blood
rushing to his feet, you're right.

560
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,730
- Glad to see you back in one piece.
- It was a lovely mission.

561
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,441
There are some parts of Burma
that won't be the same again.

562
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:05,409
Anything new coming up for Force 136, sir?

563
00:50:05,513 --> 00:50:07,140
No, just for you.

564
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:10,439
Marvelous. What can I do for you?

565
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:14,448
How would you like to blow up two
or three enemy ships in a neutral harbour?

566
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:17,157
Delighted. Give me a couple days' notice...

567
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:18,452
...to get my gear ready.

568
00:50:18,693 --> 00:50:22,220
It'll be in and out fast. There'll be
no second chance at these targets.

569
00:50:22,296 --> 00:50:24,161
I haven't needed one yet, have l?

570
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:27,731
The one thing I can't abide
is a lack of confidence.

571
00:50:27,935 --> 00:50:30,995
- We'll be in touch, then.
- Fine. Onward and upward.

572
00:50:31,172 --> 00:50:33,572
Anything new in the papers, Yogi?

573
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:36,103
Yes, the world's upside down.

574
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:48,715
That wouldn't sail across the Serpentine,
let alone around lndia.

575
00:50:49,056 --> 00:50:50,546
It's a bloody riverboat.

576
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:55,628
It's the right size, and there won't be
any great uproar when it's found missing.

577
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:04,370
There's something very peculiar
going on, Bill.

578
00:51:04,605 --> 00:51:06,800
- What is it?
- What's what?

579
00:51:06,874 --> 00:51:08,865
You never shave at night.

580
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:12,273
Rather a novelty, I thought, for once.
Not to shave in the morning...

581
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,904
...when I'm still asleep.

582
00:51:14,215 --> 00:51:16,410
- That's not it.
- Not what?

583
00:51:17,852 --> 00:51:21,015
Bill, you can really be
the most exasperating...

584
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:24,457
Well, I'm probably being
even more exasperating.

585
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:27,050
A good wife does not pry.

586
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:30,629
You can pry as much as you like.
No, the reason I'm shaving now...

587
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:34,189
...is because I have to get up
tomorrow morning at 4:00...

588
00:51:34,268 --> 00:51:38,102
...and go charging up to Ranchi
in a bloody truck to do two weeks...

589
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:39,969
...of incredibly boring training.

590
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,032
Whatever it is,
it's far too important to you.

591
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:44,942
Oh, really.

592
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,475
It's another woman, isn't it?

593
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:52,313
Isn't it?

594
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:54,878
Another woman? Me?

595
00:51:56,323 --> 00:52:00,157
I have never loved, nor will I ever love,
anyone but you.

596
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,833
Now you've gone
and got me all lathered up.

597
00:53:38,893 --> 00:53:41,521
- Hold it!
- What the hell is this?

598
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:44,363
No questions, just answers.

599
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:47,798
Now, if you create any problems,
we shall have to kill you.

600
00:54:04,118 --> 00:54:06,245
Have you taken a look at the engine?

601
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,620
No, but I have a general idea.

602
00:54:08,689 --> 00:54:10,247
It belongs in a museum.

603
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:12,825
So do some of us. Well, cheer up.

604
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,024
Let's take a stroll on the promenade deck.

605
00:54:16,163 --> 00:54:17,494
Oh, my God.

606
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:21,895
I've got this end, you take care
of the other.

607
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:28,635
I've been saving this for a long time.
Now I know why. To us.

608
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,340
To us.

609
00:54:39,353 --> 00:54:40,513
To us.

610
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:47,259
To the operation.

611
00:54:47,328 --> 00:54:48,420
Amen.

612
00:54:58,706 --> 00:55:03,075
I haven't got the faintest idea what makes
this thing work. Do you?

613
00:55:06,046 --> 00:55:07,707
See you in Cochin.

614
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:34,664
''The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.''

615
00:56:36,236 --> 00:56:37,464
Get up and...

616
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,475
Not into the wind, Robin.
Oh, God, he's done it again.

617
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:46,237
For God's sake, don't describe it.
I'm going down below to hit myself...

618
00:56:46,313 --> 00:56:50,272
...over the head with a hammer.
Remember I've still got to cook.

619
00:57:12,206 --> 00:57:14,197
What an industrious chap.

620
00:57:17,444 --> 00:57:21,676
- You wouldn't, you sadistic--
- What wouldn't I?

621
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:25,310
You know, Yogi, when we get
to wherever it is we're going...

622
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:26,678
...I'll kill you.

623
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:29,655
Mind over matter, Robin.
Think digestively.

624
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:37,986
I must have been a damn fool
to have taken on this job.

625
00:57:38,398 --> 00:57:39,888
Grab one.

626
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:58,340
Well, Jack old chum, if anyone has
to swim for it, this is where you'll be.

627
00:57:58,886 --> 00:58:02,947
Jack Cartwright, the entire on-shore rescue
and first-aid team.

628
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:06,092
You'd better put a lorry up there.

629
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,596
Should you pick anyone up,
they're to be taken straight out of Goa.

630
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,060
If you must drive through
the border barricades...

631
00:58:12,132 --> 00:58:14,362
...and take over that river ferry, do it.

632
00:58:20,507 --> 00:58:24,534
Oh, sorry. Thank God, you're not my wife.

633
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:29,105
Any kind of physical contact brings on
the most outrageous sexual demands.

634
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:31,447
The woman's insatiable.

635
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:33,210
You're a lucky fellow.

636
00:58:33,287 --> 00:58:35,721
She bites, it's bloody undignified.

637
00:58:35,923 --> 00:58:38,448
At my age, I prefer a bit
of grateful whimpering...

638
00:58:39,026 --> 00:58:41,324
...even if it's only from me.

639
00:58:42,863 --> 00:58:45,593
I may never survive the train ride.

640
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:48,292
Talking of survival, Lewis...

641
00:58:48,368 --> 00:58:50,529
...I swore to myself I'd never ask this...

642
00:58:50,604 --> 00:58:53,630
...which is why I'm asking,
but all those explosives...

643
00:58:53,707 --> 00:58:56,039
...we loaded onto that ridiculous Phoebe...

644
00:58:56,109 --> 00:58:57,770
...what on earth are they for?

645
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:23,202
It's my opinion we're going to storm
a mountaintop convent...

646
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,401
...with bowler hats and varicose veins.

647
00:59:25,505 --> 00:59:26,802
And umbrellas.

648
00:59:26,907 --> 00:59:28,875
And the nuns'll shoot our tails off.

649
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:31,103
- Or someone will.
- Let's play bridge.

650
00:59:32,346 --> 00:59:35,838
Old Lovecroft must have melons
for adenoids.

651
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:43,445
The next round's on me.

652
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:46,391
Cromwell. C-R-O-M-W-E-L-L.

653
00:59:49,062 --> 00:59:50,825
Hold on. Who is it?

654
00:59:51,331 --> 00:59:52,423
Jack.

655
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,794
It's open. Hello?

656
00:59:57,771 --> 00:59:59,671
Yes, you have it?

657
00:59:59,973 --> 01:00:01,964
What do you mean,
you can't give it to me?

658
01:00:02,075 --> 01:00:06,034
It's unlisted? Well, where are you?
I'll come down and pay you.

659
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:11,017
We all have to learn to live
with the odd insult, don't we?

660
01:00:11,084 --> 01:00:12,676
Try and beat that combination.

661
01:00:12,853 --> 01:00:15,651
An incorruptible telephone operator
and a woman with...

662
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:17,847
...an unlisted telephone number.

663
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:21,492
A raving beauty, dammit.
Come on, you have to put that...

664
01:00:21,595 --> 01:00:25,190
...in a safe-deposit box
at the Portuguese National Bank.

665
01:00:29,736 --> 01:00:31,829
My God, they'll chuck me overboard.

666
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:07,806
There's a periscope out there!

667
01:01:08,275 --> 01:01:09,606
Periscope!

668
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:16,007
It's off the starboard bow.

669
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:17,948
I don't see a thing.

670
01:01:18,118 --> 01:01:19,278
Where is it?

671
01:01:19,486 --> 01:01:20,953
Look...there!

672
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:23,355
That's the port bow, idiot!

673
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:25,990
Well, whatever it is,
God help us, we're dead.

674
01:01:28,261 --> 01:01:30,354
I'll take the wheel.

675
01:01:32,232 --> 01:01:33,995
Give me those glasses. Where is it?

676
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:36,968
On the... On the port bow.

677
01:01:38,805 --> 01:01:42,502
If we're blown up, everybody get a bit
of wreckage and cling to it.

678
01:01:42,576 --> 01:01:44,203
That's hilarious.

679
01:01:49,216 --> 01:01:50,706
Wait a minute.

680
01:01:51,385 --> 01:01:52,784
I've got it.

681
01:01:54,121 --> 01:01:57,955
What an incredible piece of camouflage.
It looks exactly like a shark fin.

682
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:01,292
They're clever devils, I'll give them that.

683
01:02:02,496 --> 01:02:04,430
It's a shark, Mr. Manners.

684
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:09,062
Is that all you can say? ''Oh?''

685
01:02:09,436 --> 01:02:12,701
Sorry. You know l... Sorry.

686
01:02:13,774 --> 01:02:15,264
I prefer ''Oh.''

687
01:02:17,577 --> 01:02:18,908
Damn fool.

688
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,110
Six days each week
of government bureaucracy...

689
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:24,941
...taxes the mind and body
to the limits of endurance.

690
01:02:25,018 --> 01:02:27,009
It's good of you to see me,
Senhor Montero.

691
01:02:27,087 --> 01:02:27,849
Not at all.

692
01:02:27,921 --> 01:02:30,685
You want to enjoy your day off
and my time is limited...

693
01:02:30,757 --> 01:02:33,021
...so may we drop the formalities?

694
01:02:33,927 --> 01:02:34,655
As you wish.

695
01:02:34,728 --> 01:02:38,721
I want you to use your influence to
persuade the governor to have a reception.

696
01:02:39,332 --> 01:02:43,063
Among the invited guests will be
every port official from Mormugoa...

697
01:02:43,637 --> 01:02:46,538
...and the officers from every ship
at anchor in the harbour.

698
01:02:46,606 --> 01:02:50,542
You will, on the same night, arrange
a carnival which will attract the crews...

699
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:52,904
...of all the ships. Well?

700
01:02:56,016 --> 01:02:57,881
You mentioned my sons.

701
01:02:58,552 --> 01:03:03,319
Yes, I can arrange that your sons continue
to enjoy their schooling in lndia...

702
01:03:05,325 --> 01:03:09,659
...and that their fees are paid directly
into a bank there. Yes or no?

703
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:14,925
A wise decision.

704
01:03:16,203 --> 01:03:19,798
The invitations have already been printed.
The date is March 8.

705
01:03:20,373 --> 01:03:22,807
The time: 2100.

706
01:03:22,943 --> 01:03:24,706
Your reason for this, Senhor?

707
01:03:24,778 --> 01:03:27,645
That is a question you do not ask.
It is simply a display...

708
01:03:27,747 --> 01:03:30,341
...of your country's hospitality
and neutrality.

709
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,880
Now, these are for your immediate use.
I'm sure your list of expenses...

710
01:03:35,956 --> 01:03:39,357
...will be very imaginative.
And one more thing:

711
01:03:39,426 --> 01:03:42,486
I'd hate like hell to see anything go wrong.

712
01:03:42,596 --> 01:03:44,928
For your sake, and the children.

713
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:14,852
Mrs. Cromwell.

714
01:04:16,062 --> 01:04:17,529
I don't know what comes first...

715
01:04:17,597 --> 01:04:19,963
...the hello, the apology,
or the explanation.

716
01:04:20,033 --> 01:04:21,398
None of them. Excuse me.

717
01:04:21,468 --> 01:04:24,369
- Well, I owe you at least two out of three.
- Please.

718
01:04:24,871 --> 01:04:26,168
- How's Hamlet?
- Dammit!

719
01:04:28,642 --> 01:04:30,576
I prefer not to make a scene here.

720
01:04:30,677 --> 01:04:32,542
Why don't we sit down?

721
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,546
How is Hamlet?

722
01:04:41,621 --> 01:04:43,748
Look, I don't appreciate it.

723
01:04:44,925 --> 01:04:46,324
Some wine...

724
01:04:46,526 --> 01:04:48,721
...champagne, a lovely cigar?

725
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:51,690
Later.

726
01:04:54,935 --> 01:04:59,235
Hello, Mrs. Cromwell, and I can't tell you
how sorry I am. That's two.

727
01:05:00,507 --> 01:05:02,907
I find all that charm unbearable.

728
01:05:03,577 --> 01:05:05,374
Quite truthfully, so do I.

729
01:05:05,445 --> 01:05:07,709
The best I can do is apologize.

730
01:05:07,781 --> 01:05:10,477
If you would accept that, we could talk.

731
01:05:12,552 --> 01:05:14,816
lt was an ugly...incident.

732
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:18,822
You killed a man as though
it were nothing.

733
01:05:19,893 --> 01:05:22,088
He was about to kill us both.

734
01:05:22,696 --> 01:05:24,721
You've done it before, haven't you?

735
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:32,461
Yes. I was an officer in the Army
for a while and then the Bengali police...

736
01:05:32,572 --> 01:05:34,301
...made me a better offer.

737
01:05:34,374 --> 01:05:36,171
And now you're a tea merchant.

738
01:05:36,243 --> 01:05:39,474
Yes. I didn't like being a police officer...

739
01:05:41,715 --> 01:05:44,183
...and I don't wander around killing people.

740
01:05:48,021 --> 01:05:53,015
Next you're going to accuse me of killing
the poor, unfortunate owner of this place.

741
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,160
It had crossed my mind.

742
01:05:56,129 --> 01:06:00,896
Mrs. Cromwell, I really would much rather
talk about you, and possibly even me.

743
01:06:01,101 --> 01:06:05,435
You know it wouldn't take a great deal
for me to fall in love with you.

744
01:06:06,206 --> 01:06:08,697
No comment? All right, I have one.

745
01:06:11,444 --> 01:06:14,242
Why don't we pick up where we left off...

746
01:06:14,614 --> 01:06:18,380
...be exceptionally wary of each other
and see what develops?

747
01:06:19,753 --> 01:06:22,153
No comment. Yet.

748
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:30,792
Wine, Mrs. Cromwell?

749
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:34,158
Wine.

750
01:06:36,102 --> 01:06:38,127
- Whose deal is it?
- Yours.

751
01:06:39,472 --> 01:06:41,906
- Did you order us a beer?
- Yes.

752
01:06:43,643 --> 01:06:46,544
I wonder why they asked us
if we could swim.

753
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,574
One thing's certain:

754
01:06:48,648 --> 01:06:52,277
This is better than thumping round
the coast in that dirty old bucket.

755
01:06:52,352 --> 01:06:55,810
I pity Breene. Awful bloody sailor,
you know. Suffers hell.

756
01:06:55,955 --> 01:06:57,820
- So did Nelson.
- Nelson?

757
01:06:57,891 --> 01:06:59,119
Admiral Nelson, you fool.

758
01:06:59,192 --> 01:07:01,217
You know, ''England expects...''

759
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:03,722
Over here, chaps.

760
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:18,268
If they've been lucky, the Phoebe should be
outside Cochin Harbour tomorrow night...

761
01:07:18,945 --> 01:07:22,540
...and we'll be off
on a lovely sun-drenched cruise.

762
01:07:23,883 --> 01:07:27,148
You'll each receive a boarding schedule
and detailed instructions.

763
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:30,417
Please memorize them and destroy them.

764
01:07:30,523 --> 01:07:34,619
No one is to carry any letters
or documents that might associate him...

765
01:07:34,794 --> 01:07:36,261
...with the Light Horse.

766
01:07:36,463 --> 01:07:37,452
Tomorrow...

767
01:07:37,597 --> 01:07:41,693
...you will each go separately to the bazaar
and buy two bottles of whisky...

768
01:07:42,569 --> 01:07:45,663
...which you will keep in your luggage
unopened.

769
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:49,472
You're to be packed and ready
by 1700 hours.

770
01:07:50,944 --> 01:07:55,711
I can't give you any details on the
operation itself until we're safely at sea.

771
01:07:58,952 --> 01:08:00,442
Any questions?

772
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:02,185
No, sir.

773
01:08:02,255 --> 01:08:09,093
Good. lf any of you might be thinking
of getting sozzled tonight...splendid.

774
01:08:09,195 --> 01:08:10,594
I expect to.

775
01:08:11,398 --> 01:08:12,797
End of briefing.

776
01:09:27,307 --> 01:09:30,504
Desapareça daqui sujo...porco canalha.

777
01:09:35,915 --> 01:09:39,009
Senhor, ha-de perdoar esse zaragateiro.

778
01:09:40,353 --> 01:09:42,253
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

779
01:09:42,422 --> 01:09:43,753
No, Senhor.

780
01:09:43,857 --> 01:09:44,846
English...Ja.

781
01:09:44,924 --> 01:09:47,984
Yes, Senhor.
You perhaps wish something?

782
01:09:48,962 --> 01:09:51,328
We can give you anything
you should desire.

783
01:09:51,431 --> 01:09:52,591
Anything.

784
01:09:52,665 --> 01:09:53,893
This is your house?

785
01:09:53,967 --> 01:09:55,229
Yes, Senhor.

786
01:09:55,368 --> 01:09:56,892
All clean girls...

787
01:09:57,237 --> 01:09:59,034
...and all beautiful.

788
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:01,464
I have an unusual request.

789
01:10:02,942 --> 01:10:05,172
Nothing is strange here, Senhor.

790
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,872
Many years ago I was a sailor.
Now I am a rich man.

791
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:13,248
But always a sailor in your heart.
I understand.

792
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:15,148
You wish something special, yes?

793
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:18,349
I would like to give every sailor
in the port...

794
01:10:19,325 --> 01:10:22,317
...a gift to celebrate
my good fortune in life.

795
01:10:23,263 --> 01:10:27,222
Now, you will tell every nationality
of sailor in the harbour...

796
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:32,327
...that for three days, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, they can come to this street...

797
01:10:32,839 --> 01:10:34,807
...and do with girls at no cost.

798
01:10:35,341 --> 01:10:37,969
What a beautiful thing you do, sir.

799
01:10:38,478 --> 01:10:41,743
I'm glad you think so.
Now, can we agree to the price?

800
01:10:43,016 --> 01:10:45,109
Please come, Senhor.

801
01:10:46,886 --> 01:10:51,016
You know this is exceedingly odd.
I hardly know anything about you.

802
01:10:52,492 --> 01:10:55,620
I don't know where you live.
I don't even know your phone number.

803
01:10:55,862 --> 01:10:59,298
You don't have to.
All we've done is enjoy each other.

804
01:11:01,801 --> 01:11:04,861
I am falling in love with you,
Mrs. Cromwell.

805
01:11:07,674 --> 01:11:09,266
I'll go better than that.

806
01:11:11,644 --> 01:11:12,906
I have.

807
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:18,014
Gavin, I don't want to go home now,
but I'm going to.

808
01:11:18,885 --> 01:11:20,978
- All right, I'll take you.
- No.

809
01:11:23,389 --> 01:11:25,755
I still can't know where you live?

810
01:11:25,825 --> 01:11:28,350
Not until I understand how I feel.

811
01:11:39,372 --> 01:11:41,670
I'd like to get dressed now.

812
01:11:51,818 --> 01:11:53,342
You do love me?

813
01:11:54,053 --> 01:11:57,022
Give me time to think.
I promise to call you.

814
01:12:26,285 --> 01:12:28,446
They're the last two. Come along.

815
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:30,153
Come along.

816
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:36,988
Sorry, Sandy, we got held up.

817
01:12:49,676 --> 01:12:52,577
- Adeus, Senhor.
- Adeus.

818
01:12:53,413 --> 01:12:54,573
Gavin!

819
01:12:55,214 --> 01:12:59,048
Hello, Jack. How was your second visit
with your friendly whorehouse keeper?

820
01:12:59,118 --> 01:13:02,315
Absolute cert.
Every sailor knows all about it.

821
01:13:02,555 --> 01:13:06,719
As he was taking the rest of the money
he called me a true benefactor...

822
01:13:06,926 --> 01:13:09,053
...of all whores and seamen.

823
01:13:09,929 --> 01:13:12,397
Rather appropriate play on words,
don't you think?

824
01:13:12,465 --> 01:13:16,458
I'm also his life-long friend
for whom he'd shed blood and brandy.

825
01:13:16,536 --> 01:13:18,731
- He shed the brandy, didn't he?
- He did.

826
01:13:18,805 --> 01:13:20,966
Why don't you go to your room
and lie down?

827
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,668
There's nothing else to be done
until tonight.

828
01:13:23,743 --> 01:13:27,201
I was going to. I may even pray a bit.
Where are you going?

829
01:13:28,014 --> 01:13:31,541
Talking of praying, to church.
The phone call I waited for two days for...

830
01:13:31,617 --> 01:13:32,811
...finally came.

831
01:13:32,885 --> 01:13:35,080
- I'm glad to hear it.
- So was l.

832
01:13:35,154 --> 01:13:37,247
- Did you say church?
- Yes.

833
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:53,465
Warte hier.

834
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:38,570
Gavin?

835
01:15:44,517 --> 01:15:45,916
Who are you?

836
01:15:56,062 --> 01:15:59,930
I'll need a table. Will you bring that
up here for me, please?

837
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:04,199
That's fine, thank you.

838
01:16:05,037 --> 01:16:08,473
Now then, we're on the last lap
of our little trip...

839
01:16:10,743 --> 01:16:13,041
...so I can now give you our destination...

840
01:16:13,112 --> 01:16:16,104
...and tell you what we're going to do
when we get there.

841
01:16:16,249 --> 01:16:19,150
We're headed for the neutral port
of Mormugoa.

842
01:16:19,485 --> 01:16:20,975
I told you so.

843
01:16:21,153 --> 01:16:22,916
ln that port, at anchor...

844
01:16:22,989 --> 01:16:25,480
...is a German ship, the Ehrenfels.

845
01:16:26,292 --> 01:16:28,954
Our job is to seize that ship.

846
01:16:30,529 --> 01:16:31,496
Good Lord.

847
01:16:31,564 --> 01:16:33,532
And hold a dance aboard?

848
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:35,657
Or sink her where she is.

849
01:16:35,935 --> 01:16:38,369
Also in that port are two other
German ships...

850
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:42,635
...so if we can knock them off
at the same time, so much the better.

851
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:47,709
But first, the Ehrenfels.
Here is her deck plan.

852
01:16:48,481 --> 01:16:51,609
Study it very carefully and then I'll deal
with any questions.

853
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:53,042
- Bill?
- Yes?

854
01:16:53,552 --> 01:16:55,452
- We've got problems.
- What's wrong?

855
01:16:55,521 --> 01:16:59,184
- The main bearing is overheating.
- Can you do anything about it?

856
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:03,322
Only if I stop the engine.
It's a question of dismantling...

857
01:17:03,396 --> 01:17:05,921
...the bearing and fitting a new shell.

858
01:17:06,098 --> 01:17:07,360
If I can.

859
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:11,900
How long would it take?

860
01:17:11,971 --> 01:17:14,963
Two to three hours.
And, sir, I said, ''lf I can.''

861
01:17:15,441 --> 01:17:19,207
Yes, I heard you, Charlie.
Can we keep going as it is?

862
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:20,945
Not for long.

863
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,781
All right. Stop your engine.
See what you can do.

864
01:17:33,225 --> 01:17:35,318
We desperately needed that.

865
01:17:36,562 --> 01:17:38,962
We have a little leeway. Not much.

866
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,095
Carry on.

867
01:17:43,602 --> 01:17:44,762
Now...

868
01:17:46,605 --> 01:17:48,539
...on the foredeck, here...

869
01:18:11,364 --> 01:18:15,027
I didn't want to push my luck
on the telephone, but why a church?

870
01:18:15,101 --> 01:18:17,296
I didn't want to meet you in a café again.

871
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,099
Or in a hotel room.

872
01:18:19,805 --> 01:18:21,136
No comment.

873
01:18:21,207 --> 01:18:22,970
I'm glad you called.

874
01:18:23,509 --> 01:18:25,409
I don't know whether I am or not...

875
01:18:25,511 --> 01:18:28,776
...I just know I'm afraid to trust
my own feelings.

876
01:18:29,448 --> 01:18:30,779
Which are?

877
01:18:31,183 --> 01:18:32,844
Terribly confused.

878
01:18:34,787 --> 01:18:36,482
I'm afraid I don't understand.

879
01:18:37,223 --> 01:18:38,247
Try.

880
01:18:40,559 --> 01:18:43,858
We can start tonight
at the governor-generaI's party.

881
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:47,124
You mean the governor-general of Goa?

882
01:18:49,035 --> 01:18:50,935
Why would he invite me to a party?

883
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:54,537
I don't even know the governor-general
and I'm sure it's mutual.

884
01:18:54,607 --> 01:18:56,006
I'm invited.

885
01:18:56,742 --> 01:18:58,642
Would you take me?

886
01:19:00,913 --> 01:19:02,642
All right, I'll take you.

887
01:19:02,715 --> 01:19:05,513
9:00. 21 da Gama Street.

888
01:19:07,353 --> 01:19:09,617
Now you have my address.

889
01:19:11,624 --> 01:19:13,751
The progress is astonishing.

890
01:19:15,494 --> 01:19:16,927
Are we leaving?

891
01:19:17,063 --> 01:19:19,054
You are. Alone. Please.

892
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,731
Well, I am available the rest of the day.
Conversation only.

893
01:19:25,905 --> 01:19:27,702
Tea planter's honour.

894
01:19:28,207 --> 01:19:29,674
9:00.

895
01:20:36,275 --> 01:20:39,142
That may do it, and it may not.

896
01:20:39,979 --> 01:20:42,641
Two and a half hours.
All right, let's find out.

897
01:20:43,549 --> 01:20:45,039
Ready to move, Bill.

898
01:20:46,652 --> 01:20:47,812
Right.

899
01:21:05,604 --> 01:21:08,038
What can you get out of her at full speed?

900
01:21:08,507 --> 01:21:10,407
Six knots, maybe seven.

901
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:12,304
Try ten.

902
01:21:50,849 --> 01:21:52,783
That's it. Your turn, Sandy.

903
01:22:00,726 --> 01:22:02,216
Good. Underhill...

904
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:06,025
Limpet mines attach magnetically
to the hull of the ship...

905
01:22:08,834 --> 01:22:12,463
...below the waterline.
They work on a pre-set timer.

906
01:22:12,771 --> 01:22:15,069
You mean this, this knob here?

907
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:18,700
Yes, that's right. Now, Finley,
you'll take the Drachenfels.

908
01:22:18,777 --> 01:22:20,574
Sloane, you take the Braunfels.

909
01:22:20,713 --> 01:22:21,680
Right.

910
01:22:29,888 --> 01:22:30,980
Jack!

911
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,437
- Senhor Stewart?
- Yes.

912
01:23:53,639 --> 01:23:55,971
- Good evening, sir. Please.
- Thank you.

913
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:12,317
Please, sit down.

914
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:15,020
Mrs. Cromwell shall be...

915
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,149
Ready soon?

916
01:24:16,261 --> 01:24:19,321
Yes. Not good English. Excuse, Senhor.

917
01:25:23,395 --> 01:25:24,362
Where is she?

918
01:25:30,402 --> 01:25:35,465
Thanks to Charlie Wilton, we should be
alongside the Ehrenfels on schedule...

919
01:25:35,607 --> 01:25:38,872
...by 0100 hours.
I don't have to tell you how...

920
01:25:39,077 --> 01:25:43,241
...crucial this operation is
or how many allied lives it might save.

921
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:48,408
Our cover story once again.
We are businessmen on holiday.

922
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,980
We rented this old tub in Bombay,
sailed down to Goa for the fun of it...

923
01:25:53,759 --> 01:25:56,853
...and on a drunken dare,
boarded the Ehrenfels.

924
01:25:57,229 --> 01:26:01,996
Of course, authentic drunken businessmen
seldom run about with machine guns.

925
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:06,863
Should any of you find yourselves in
a tight spot, if it's the last thing you do...

926
01:26:07,606 --> 01:26:09,574
...throw your guns over the side.

927
01:26:09,641 --> 01:26:11,836
If any of you have to swim for it...

928
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:15,079
...you know the location
of Cartwright's beach.

929
01:26:15,247 --> 01:26:17,875
Jack will be there waiting for you.

930
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:21,784
Charlie, you will remain aboard
to nurse the engine.

931
01:26:21,854 --> 01:26:23,845
- Sir--
- That's an order, Charlie.

932
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:27,915
Yes, sir. Shit, sir!

933
01:26:30,095 --> 01:26:32,563
Charlie, you really do have
a way with words.

934
01:26:33,232 --> 01:26:34,199
John...

935
01:26:35,033 --> 01:26:37,467
...you'll stay at the wheel. No arguments.

936
01:26:37,536 --> 01:26:39,436
Can I say, ''shit'' as well, sir?

937
01:26:39,538 --> 01:26:40,937
If you like.

938
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:43,132
All right, let's open up the whisky.

939
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:44,175
About time.

940
01:26:44,243 --> 01:26:47,542
One big swig now,
and no more until further orders.

941
01:26:50,682 --> 01:26:51,706
Cheers.

942
01:26:51,783 --> 01:26:53,307
Down the hatch.

943
01:28:29,848 --> 01:28:33,477
Your Excellency, Gavin Stewart.
Hadley's of Bombay Limited.

944
01:28:33,552 --> 01:28:37,818
Mr. Stewart, how nice to see you.
Darling, may I present Mr. Stewart.

945
01:28:38,557 --> 01:28:39,922
A pleasure.

946
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:41,721
And my daughter, Teresa.

947
01:28:41,793 --> 01:28:42,760
Senhorita.

948
01:28:42,828 --> 01:28:44,295
And Mrs. Cromwell.

949
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:47,190
Mrs. Cromwell and l
already know each other.

950
01:28:47,566 --> 01:28:51,002
In fact, with your permission,
I'm going to steal her away from you.

951
01:28:51,069 --> 01:28:53,264
Please do. Enjoy yourselves.

952
01:28:53,472 --> 01:28:55,838
Thank you, sir. Shall we?

953
01:29:00,112 --> 01:29:02,080
You look absolutely beautiful.

954
01:29:03,148 --> 01:29:05,048
I don't blame you for being angry.

955
01:29:05,317 --> 01:29:09,310
I wouldn't have waited for me either.
I can't begin to apologize.

956
01:29:09,588 --> 01:29:11,215
Don't be silly, it's accepted.

957
01:29:13,091 --> 01:29:14,558
Where were you?

958
01:29:14,993 --> 01:29:19,157
Well, you won't believe me.
It's really a sort of tragedy of errors.

959
01:29:20,599 --> 01:29:24,262
First, a puncture in the middle of nowhere,
then I nearly ripped...

960
01:29:24,336 --> 01:29:27,032
...the sleeve off my jacket
trying to change the wheel.

961
01:29:27,105 --> 01:29:29,835
A mad dash for a replacement jacket,
which doesn't fit...

962
01:29:29,908 --> 01:29:30,966
So I see.

963
01:29:31,043 --> 01:29:34,740
And naturally, they're still not giving out
your phone number, and finally...

964
01:29:34,813 --> 01:29:37,839
...when I got to 31 da Gama Street,
there was no one at home.

965
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:41,110
Gavin...it's 21.

966
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,017
Not 31?

967
01:29:44,356 --> 01:29:45,789
There you are, I am an idiot.

968
01:29:45,857 --> 01:29:47,051
Agreed.

969
01:29:47,259 --> 01:29:50,319
But a rather nice one.
I'd left by then anyway.

970
01:29:51,563 --> 01:29:55,192
I called your hotel.
They said you'd gone out quite early.

971
01:29:56,702 --> 01:30:00,468
How did you get in here without
an invitation? And I'm glad.

972
01:30:01,473 --> 01:30:03,998
Well, I crossed the majordomo's palm.

973
01:30:06,445 --> 01:30:07,707
Shocking.

974
01:30:07,846 --> 01:30:10,508
Now, to show you the stuff
I'm really made of...

975
01:30:12,417 --> 01:30:14,851
...I'd like to apologize properly.

976
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:18,014
First, I'd like to kiss you, Mrs. Cromwell.

977
01:30:21,326 --> 01:30:22,816
I'd like that.

978
01:31:20,152 --> 01:31:22,382
Lipstick doesn't become you.

979
01:31:23,088 --> 01:31:24,419
Let me.

980
01:32:19,978 --> 01:32:21,969
Would you care to join her?

981
01:32:22,147 --> 01:32:24,377
Then, I assume you've seen nothing.

982
01:32:24,449 --> 01:32:25,882
Am I correct?

983
01:32:27,352 --> 01:32:28,683
Then start laughing.

984
01:32:29,254 --> 01:32:30,084
Laugh.

985
01:32:54,679 --> 01:32:57,671
You'll remember your children, Senhor.

986
01:33:27,245 --> 01:33:29,440
All right, take your weapons.

987
01:33:50,068 --> 01:33:52,059
- Any problems?
- No, sir.

988
01:33:53,405 --> 01:33:54,531
Mr. Cartwright?

989
01:33:54,606 --> 01:33:56,267
Buried there, sir.

990
01:34:12,223 --> 01:34:14,453
Take my car and park it near the hotel.

991
01:34:14,526 --> 01:34:16,994
Yes, sir. Are you all right, sir?

992
01:34:18,063 --> 01:34:19,553
Yes, fine thanks.

993
01:34:31,643 --> 01:34:32,837
There we are.

994
01:34:33,411 --> 01:34:36,278
The first of Gavin's brilliant diversions.

995
01:34:37,682 --> 01:34:39,980
I never had a moment's doubt, old bean.

996
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:43,077
I did. If we'd relied on this compass,
we might've wound up...

997
01:34:43,154 --> 01:34:45,054
...in the Grand Canyon.

998
01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:49,086
What a lovely sight.

999
01:34:49,427 --> 01:34:52,863
Reminds me of Brighton
when I was about 10 years old.

1000
01:34:53,164 --> 01:34:56,065
Dickie, I find it hard to believe
you were ever 10 years old.

1001
01:34:56,134 --> 01:34:57,226
Chuckle, chuckle.

1002
01:34:57,302 --> 01:34:58,326
Gentlemen...

1003
01:34:59,904 --> 01:35:02,134
Mr. Finley, Mr. Sloane, time to get ready.

1004
01:35:02,207 --> 01:35:03,572
Right, sir.

1005
01:35:04,342 --> 01:35:08,574
If any of you have any final questions,
now would be a splendid time.

1006
01:35:09,547 --> 01:35:11,515
When do we get another drink, sir?

1007
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,743
Right now, as a matter of fact.

1008
01:35:13,885 --> 01:35:17,150
I want each of you to take
another big swallow, just one.

1009
01:35:17,389 --> 01:35:20,790
Next, rinse your mouths thoroughly
with whiskey and spit it out...

1010
01:35:20,992 --> 01:35:24,291
...then take what's left
and pour it over your clothing.

1011
01:35:24,362 --> 01:35:26,330
- All of it, sir?
- All of it.

1012
01:35:26,664 --> 01:35:29,827
I want every man here
to smell like a distillery.

1013
01:35:30,168 --> 01:35:32,500
All right. Get on with it!

1014
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:39,606
Anybody got any soda?

1015
01:35:51,823 --> 01:35:54,417
I didn't mean to do that, I swear it.

1016
01:35:57,295 --> 01:35:59,889
This is the noblest sacrifice of all.

1017
01:36:00,098 --> 01:36:02,157
The fumes alone are getting me tiddly.

1018
01:36:02,267 --> 01:36:07,170
You may save your second bottle
for our celebration on the way to Bombay.

1019
01:36:38,303 --> 01:36:39,861
When we board...

1020
01:36:40,171 --> 01:36:43,607
...I want no firing
unless it's absolutely necessary.

1021
01:36:46,344 --> 01:36:48,335
Should anything unpleasant happen...

1022
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,109
...and we sustain dead or wounded,
they are not to be left...

1023
01:36:52,183 --> 01:36:54,743
...aboard the Ehrenfels, nor any equipment.

1024
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:58,053
Nothing which could identify us as British.

1025
01:36:59,624 --> 01:37:04,027
When I blow this whistle three times,
everybody off immediately.

1026
01:37:09,601 --> 01:37:11,068
You'll do.

1027
01:37:13,071 --> 01:37:14,436
Take your stations.

1028
01:37:14,606 --> 01:37:17,268
All weapons loaded. Safety catches on.

1029
01:37:22,113 --> 01:37:23,910
Check our watches.

1030
01:37:24,582 --> 01:37:28,018
When you set your mines, remember,
give us 30 minutes.

1031
01:37:28,887 --> 01:37:30,855
That's still not much time.

1032
01:37:30,922 --> 01:37:33,652
You surprise me. We'll have all the time
in the world.

1033
01:37:33,725 --> 01:37:35,158
Now, do get on with it.

1034
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:38,559
You're the boss, Lewis.
My God, you breath is awful.

1035
01:39:12,924 --> 01:39:16,655
Well, might as well.
Won't help me see in the dark, will it?

1036
01:40:09,747 --> 01:40:11,271
Yogi, the mine.

1037
01:41:45,376 --> 01:41:47,207
- Klasse.
- Wundervoll.

1038
01:41:47,512 --> 01:41:50,106
- Fantastisch.
- Herrlich.

1039
01:41:58,089 --> 01:41:59,852
Come on, move.

1040
01:42:10,334 --> 01:42:12,063
Was ist?

1041
01:42:53,544 --> 01:42:55,273
Hands up. Silence!

1042
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:15,465
- Sandy, come with me. You two stay here.
- Right.

1043
01:43:42,293 --> 01:43:43,555
This way.

1044
01:43:46,564 --> 01:43:48,031
Come with me.

1045
01:43:55,172 --> 01:43:57,504
Stay where you are. Not a sound.

1046
01:44:31,876 --> 01:44:34,310
I'm glad we're not staying on board.

1047
01:44:34,745 --> 01:44:36,542
Come on, let's go.

1048
01:44:57,635 --> 01:44:58,693
You!

1049
01:45:17,989 --> 01:45:19,889
Hold on. Blow this one!

1050
01:46:15,146 --> 01:46:16,238
Are you okay?

1051
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:18,678
I think I'm still standing!

1052
01:46:20,918 --> 01:46:23,978
We've found it, Bill.
Get everyone organized to leave.

1053
01:46:24,121 --> 01:46:25,679
Sandy, look after Yogi.

1054
01:46:25,756 --> 01:46:28,281
- Come on, let's go.
- Barker, in here with me.

1055
01:46:35,433 --> 01:46:38,425
The code books. Get them on board
the Phoebe. Hurry.

1056
01:46:38,636 --> 01:46:39,796
Right.

1057
01:46:54,051 --> 01:46:55,882
Let's get it done and leave.

1058
01:47:31,188 --> 01:47:32,246
God!

1059
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:34,287
My fault, Bill.

1060
01:47:34,391 --> 01:47:36,951
Never mind that.
Get ours to the Phoebe quick...

1061
01:47:37,361 --> 01:47:40,353
...and the Germans to the afterdeck
with the others.

1062
01:47:57,948 --> 01:48:00,610
Back on the Phoebe, everybody.
Back on the Phoebe.

1063
01:48:36,654 --> 01:48:39,487
Damn fools.
I mean, why don't they hurry up?

1064
01:48:47,398 --> 01:48:48,660
Good God.

1065
01:48:52,536 --> 01:48:54,834
Get them on the Phoebe, Bill.

1066
01:48:55,906 --> 01:48:56,895
Williamson!

1067
01:48:56,974 --> 01:48:58,032
Sir.

1068
01:49:02,613 --> 01:49:05,946
Look after Dennison.
Red, put those with the others.

1069
01:49:06,417 --> 01:49:08,248
Come on my bonnie lads, move it!

1070
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:16,423
Turn around. I'll be watching you
from the top deck.

1071
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:19,993
Make no mistake, I'll shoot
the first man who moves.

1072
01:49:24,802 --> 01:49:26,292
Where is Lovecroft?

1073
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:28,270
Second deck. Wardroom.

1074
01:49:37,281 --> 01:49:38,748
In the Phoebe, Robin.

1075
01:50:10,114 --> 01:50:12,082
Red, take these weapons.

1076
01:50:44,315 --> 01:50:46,078
Okay, I'll take him.

1077
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:57,022
Everybody, over the side.
This ship is going to blow up.

1078
01:50:57,861 --> 01:51:01,228
Spring uber Bord.
Das Schiff ist in der Luft.

1079
01:51:10,407 --> 01:51:11,396
Start engines!

1080
01:51:11,709 --> 01:51:13,199
Start engines.

1081
01:51:52,683 --> 01:51:53,945
Push off!

1082
01:51:55,953 --> 01:51:57,215
Push off!

1083
01:51:58,722 --> 01:52:01,122
Spanner, now let's see...

1084
01:52:04,528 --> 01:52:05,517
That's okay.

1085
01:52:12,736 --> 01:52:15,967
Bill, don't stand about! Get us underway!

1086
01:52:22,913 --> 01:52:24,403
Right, right.

1087
01:52:31,188 --> 01:52:32,712
Get them below.

1088
01:52:36,393 --> 01:52:37,758
Help me up.

1089
01:52:46,703 --> 01:52:49,763
I'm all right. Get out of here.

1090
01:52:50,307 --> 01:52:51,365
Lie down somewhere.

1091
01:52:51,442 --> 01:52:54,502
There's nothing to lie down on.
The timers aren't that accurate.

1092
01:52:54,578 --> 01:52:57,138
- Charlie, give me an answer!
- I'm working.

1093
01:52:58,982 --> 01:53:01,314
You'd better have this.

1094
01:53:04,588 --> 01:53:06,681
This'll put pain to my polo for a bit.

1095
01:53:07,157 --> 01:53:10,854
You'll be playing polo with St. Peter
if this ship goes up.

1096
01:53:13,697 --> 01:53:15,426
Ram, help Mr. Pugh.

1097
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:37,218
- Somebody, what the helI's gone wrong?
- I'm working very hard, Billy.

1098
01:53:40,124 --> 01:53:43,287
- How long have we got on those mines?
- A couple of minutes, maybe.

1099
01:53:58,242 --> 01:53:59,004
Well...

1100
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:00,568
Hold your breath.

1101
01:54:37,781 --> 01:54:40,409
Ease her up to full speed, Bill.

1102
01:54:56,033 --> 01:54:57,557
She's going up!

1103
01:55:15,619 --> 01:55:16,881
Good God!

1104
01:56:05,402 --> 01:56:06,801
Poor devils.

1105
01:56:15,012 --> 01:56:20,814
Bill, I wouldn't know how to begin
to thank you and the Light Horse.

1106
01:56:21,218 --> 01:56:24,654
I have a feeling they'll be thanking you.
I know I am.
