1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Reason and motivation for this film were the
experiences of the student from Passau

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,920
Anja Rosmus, and her family.

3
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:22,403
The story my film tells is
at once fiction and truth.

4
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:24,800
I am not interested in the history
of a specific town in Germany,

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,280
but rather in the truth of
all towns in our country.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,390
My film is set in Bavaria
because I live here.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,675
Characters and actions are fictional.
Michael Verhoeven

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We have been told in
ancient tales many marvels

9
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:58,432
of famous heroes, of mighty toil,
joys, and high festivities,

10
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:01,938
of weeping and wailing,

11
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:07,563
and the fights of bold warriors - of such
things you can now hear wonders unending!

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,300
OK. So... It all started with
the President.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,600
- The President Dr. Karl Carstens
namely... - I'm sorry.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,500
- Too much to the right.
- What?

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Namely invited...

16
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm sorry.
Too high.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The President Dr. Karl Carstens
namely invited

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,800
all the students in the Federal Republic
to an essay competition.

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,000
But... Actually it all
started much earlier.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
WHERE WERE YOU BETWEEN 39-45.
WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

21
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,000
THE NASTY GIRL

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,300
A Film by
Michael Verhoeven

23
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,000
So... I am Sonja Wegmus,
née Rosenberger.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,100
Behind me is the Cathedral.

25
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,200
Around me is my dear
hometown, Pfilzing.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,030
Pfilzing is a lovely old Episcopal city
and lies on the Pfilz.

27
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,700
I was born there.

28
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,300
And my mother and my grandma
and all before that.

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,600
My father is a displaced person.

30
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:23,530
He came here from Silesia
only after the war.

31
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,600
My father is a teacher at Pfilzing
secondary school, St. George.

32
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,900
My mother is also a teacher.
At the same school as my father.

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,235
My mother teaches religion.

34
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:37,487
...as everyone saw, that in temple,
the church,

35
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:39,442
they were doing business.

36
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:43,243
He overturned the tables
with money and said:

37
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:47,308
Make not my Father's house
a house of merchandise.

38
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:54,228
That is my mother.

39
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,152
I was not born yet.

40
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:59,318
Here she already had the
first problems with me.

41
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:01,253
Good bye, children.

42
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:03,318
Goodbye, Miss.

43
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:12,400
Do you really want to further teach
religion in your condition.

44
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:14,791
But madam,
I still feel OK.

45
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:18,238
But it is quite obvious
that you're pregnant.

46
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:20,152
But I am married.

47
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:22,401
It's not about you.
It's about children.

48
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,501
They are asking questions.

49
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:27,515
- Good day.
- Paul, wait a minute.

50
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,785
Come here, please.

51
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:32,053
But it was of no avail.
My mother had to go.

52
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:34,443
The Catholic Church had an opinion,

53
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:39,833
that the children had to be protected
from the site of my pregnant mother.

54
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,900
When I arrived,
my uncle took us in.

55
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,320
This is my uncle Franz.

56
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,254
My mother's brother.

57
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:56,002
He is a cathedral vicar in Pfilzing
and lived in a monastery at the time.

58
00:04:56,102 --> 00:05:00,000
You see, my father didn't get an apartment,
because he was a displaced person.

59
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,700
So we stayed with uncle
Franz in monastery.

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,300
Actually that was a seminary for boys
who wanted to become priests.

61
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,700
By that time my brother was born.

62
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,530
- Robert.
- Sonja, what were you thinking?

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,700
- Sonja.
- For God's sake.

64
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,235
This is Robert.

65
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:39,480
But then another sister
was born.

66
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,800
Lina.

67
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,445
Nothing to see there.
So, please.

68
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:52,195
As my father became a rector,
we moved to a small house in Petersbach.

69
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,145
The right one there,
that's us.

70
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:59,035
Directly opposite is the school,
where my father had class.

71
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,700
This so-called border...

72
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:08,035
- is called...
- The Oder-Neisse line.

73
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,300
Paul.

74
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Be on time for lunch.
I won't reheat everything again.

75
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,188
I have a boy today
who must stay after class.

76
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:21,179
Not today, Paul.

77
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,346
What is it then?

78
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:25,306
What should have happened
on Friday already.

79
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:30,188
We're still living in the house today.

80
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:33,447
I had a wonderful and
secure childhood here.

81
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:35,757
And nature meant everything to me.

82
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:42,135
My mother taught us early,
that God's creatures are sacred.

83
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,100
Sonja, what are you doing?

84
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,700
Nothing.

85
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:48,206
A fish prefers to swim.

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,741
The child should be in kindergarten.

87
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,901
No way.
Now sit there.

88
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:56,100
Sure! So that she can get
all sorts of diseases there.

89
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,244
And meet God knows what
kind of children there.

90
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:03,709
Drop-outs and socialists. No thanks.

91
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,000
We were an ideal family.

92
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,635
My father was always allowed
to lead the prayers at mass.

93
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:19,110
An when he was standing in front
and all the people were listening to him

94
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,700
I was always proud and happy.

95
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:28,535
When I was about 12 years old,
there was always nice music on the radio

96
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:30,600
and I really liked to dance.

97
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Sonja, come here.

98
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,731
Sonja, you're going home right away.

99
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,739
OK. OK.

100
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,404
I don't want to hear OK.

101
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,735
I liked being in school.

102
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:48,980
I went to convent school St. Ana.

103
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,663
Opposite was a classical gymnasium
for boys St. Eberhard.

104
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:55,955
Fuck the German shitty television.

105
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,329
At 30, 60 and 95 degrees...

106
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:02,719
Of course we had quite different education
system then at St. Ana.

107
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,400
<i>- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, sister Leontina.</i>

108
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,600
<i>Yesterday we have learned,
that the English pronunciation...</i>

109
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,200
<i>Oh, my goodness.
Where are the curtains?</i>

110
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
Rabenbauer.

111
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,400
<i>I don't know.</i>

112
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,450
Rosenberger.

113
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,735
They were brought to
the laundry yesterday.

114
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:46,300
<i>Say it in English.</i>

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,800
<i>- The curtains were brought to the...
- Laundry. - ... laundry</i>

116
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,250
Take your things.
Go down to the gym.

117
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,800
<i>Please, hurry up.
We'll move to the gym room.</i>

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hurry up.

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,550
The next day the glasser came.

120
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,800
And he put in milk glass windows.

121
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,365
Then we didn't have to go to the gym
anymore when the curtains were being washed.

122
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,800
My teacher was Miss Juckenack.

123
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,400
I liked her the most.

124
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:33,686
Although she always checked the
donation book first, before grading.

125
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:35,265
Haven't you prepared?

126
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:38,915
The Abtretter Gabi's father
always spent the most.

127
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,800
The correct answer would be:
Land is more expensive.

128
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,500
Spengler.

129
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,305
Listen carefully.

130
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,000
Please translate.
Army costs a lot, too.

131
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,000
The Spengler Hilde's father also
spent a lot.

132
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,535
But this year...

133
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,400
I expected more from you.

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,300
Rosenberger.

135
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
She liked me very much.

136
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,835
She never looked in the book for me.

137
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,700
<i>That is Ablativus pretii.</i>

138
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Very commendable.

139
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:43,897
Very commendable.
Ablativus pretii.

140
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:48,341
One day Miss Juckenack
came very excited.

141
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:49,538
Good day, Miss Juckenack.

142
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,503
- Is Sonja here?
- Yes.

143
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:58,500
Oh, I'm sorry to bother
you during dinner time.

144
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,500
Good day, Miss Juckenack.

145
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,200
- Let me take your coat.
- Thank you.

146
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
An essay contest, Sonja.

147
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,465
From the President. An essay contest.
In the whole of Europe.

148
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:16,428
She said I had to participate,
because it's such a commendable topic.

149
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,442
Freedom in Europe.

150
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,007
Freedom in Europe.

151
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,800
And no one has so much
freedom as us.

152
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,729
Sometimes even too much freedom.

153
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:30,056
- Don't you think so?
- Yes. - Yes, yes.

154
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,006
In the East. That's a different story.

155
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,400
She will write the right thing, Sonja.

156
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,830
Then I went to the town hall archives
and borrowed some books.

157
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,420
The head of the archives, Mr. Schulz,
helped me.

158
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,525
- Is it going well, Miss Rosenberger?-
- Yes.

159
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,200
I am not so sure about Greece anymore.

160
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,680
Should I count it towards
free democratic countries?

161
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,600
You are right.
That is difficult.

162
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,850
Because of the military junta.

163
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,100
- But it is in NATO.
- Yes, but a dictatorship nevertheless.

164
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,000
But through NATO it is a free
dictatorship, right?

165
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,517
In a sense.

166
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:17,183
Why don't you write, Greece is the
birthplace of democracy. That should suffice.

167
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:19,253
Yes, I'll write that.

168
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:23,643
I was very happy. I loved going
to school almost more than before.

169
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,900
Then something extraordinary happened.

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,400
Another thing.

171
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,950
Soon a young student teacher from Munich,

172
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,700
Mr. Wegmus, will take over
Math and Physics classes.

173
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,100
Rabenbauer, what is going on?

174
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Please behave towards the new
teacher as it befits future ladies.

175
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
What is going on there?

176
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,200
We could totally make him uncomfortable.

177
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:02,535
We will always look him
directly in the eye.

178
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:04,400
Until he has to look away.

179
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,970
We could also look at his other parts.

180
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,570
And don't say a word.
No matter what he asks.

181
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,230
I don't understand that.

182
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,190
When we are asked something,
we must answer.

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
No, we don't, dummy.
That's the catch.

184
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,900
So, my name is Wegmus.

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,300
<i>Must go.
(Muss weg.)</i>

186
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,550
I hope we will get along well.

187
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,875
What topic did you study last time?

188
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
Rosenberger.

189
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,500
Contact electricity.

190
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,400
Contact electricity is
found in every day's life.

191
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,100
For instance when taking
off certain clothes,

192
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,600
it sparks.

193
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,300
Rabenbauer.

194
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,200
What happens when two bodies
rub against each other.

195
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,400
When two bodies rub against each other,

196
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,425
they must first get
over certain inhibitions.

197
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,600
- This were the gallows they say.
- Creepy.

198
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
What are you doing?

199
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,500
Come here.

200
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,000
You are supposed to pay for the candles.

201
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,200
Dear god, make him fall
in love with me. Amen.

202
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,590
You should pray better,
if you want it to work.

203
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,800
I made something for you again.

204
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,600
- For you, my dear child.
- Thank you.

205
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,750
I received most of the exams
we were supposed to take

206
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,710
a few days in advance.

207
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:27,104
Of course the teachers didn't
do favors for everybody.

208
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:30,635
But they did for those, whose
parents had spent generously.

209
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:34,700
Like Abtretter Gabi and Lettl Ramona.

210
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,300
I had to thank my uncle Franz

211
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,900
for the privileges I'd had.

212
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,600
My teachers adored
uncle Franz very much.

213
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,900
No, this isn't right.

214
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,100
Come, dad, help me.

215
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,614
I think it's disgraceful, that
children get exams in advance.

216
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,947
Come on, help me.

217
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:59,401
I'm surprised that you
participate in something like this.

218
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,451
I will complain to the school.

219
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I should send this to newspaper.

220
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Don't sin.

221
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,100
Hey. Hey.

222
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,535
You don't need to
accompany me to school, mom.

223
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm old enough.

224
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,400
I’m nervous otherwise.

225
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,358
- May I drive you?
- Good day, Mr. Wegmus.

226
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,628
Is it on your way?

227
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:32,793
- Yes, I live nearby.
- Thank you. Come.

228
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,485
I could drive you more often.

229
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,220
My mother wouldn't allow it.

230
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
I have something for you.

231
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,500
It is the math homework for tomorrow.

232
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
It's the homework text.
Maybe you...

233
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
This is not necessary, Mr. Wegmus.

234
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,000
Thank you.

235
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,600
One day our postman
came with a big surprise.

236
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,455
- Good day, Mr. Kolodzieczik.
- Good morning, Miss Rosenberger.

237
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:34,053
A brief from the President.

238
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:35,583
For me?
You're joking.

239
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:40,248
No, no. It says here President's Office.

240
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:43,535
This belonged to the Poles.

241
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:48,596
Across the Oder-Neisse line
begins the...

242
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:51,339
...so-called GDR.

243
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,539
Mom!

244
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,100
Mom!
Dad!

245
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
I won the first prize.

246
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:00,531
In all Germany.

247
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:04,539
The first prize, Mom.
A trip to France.

248
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,104
You see?

249
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,800
Maria! There's no way the
child can go to France alone.

250
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,100
Sit!

251
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,100
Dear tree,

252
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,100
you helped me so often.

253
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,790
Two years ago when I lost my purse
in the bathhouse and now again.

254
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,570
Thank you so much.

255
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,200
But now I want to ask
you for another thing.

256
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,500
Please protect Mr. Wegmus.

257
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,070
You know he has to leave Pfilzing now.

258
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,700
Make him return some day.

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,500
So that...

260
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
Rabenbauer Iris can marry him.

261
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,775
I saw you from afar and I just
wanted to say goodbye once more.

262
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,822
So, have a nice trip to Paris.

263
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,903
You too, to Munich.

264
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,103
Thank you.

265
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,500
After I take my final exam,
I will return to you, Sonja.

266
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,225
I mean, Miss Rosenberger.

267
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,500
I'd like to call you by your first name.

268
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,700
Me too.

269
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,100
I am Martin.

270
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,900
I know.

271
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,800
Sonja!

272
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,600
You are engaged now.
But don't tell anyone.

273
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,800
So I traveled to Paris
during summer break.

274
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Of course I had to
call home every evening.

275
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,500
No, everything is OK.
Excuse me.

276
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,395
Yes, I've checked where
the fire escape is.

277
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
Certainly, I...

278
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,600
I've locked up already.

279
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,135
<i>And here you discover the Eiffel tower.</i>

280
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,075
Everybody had to describe
which country he'd come from.

281
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,706
And then I noticed,
that with me it's not that easy.

282
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,695
<i>Est-ce que Pfilzing et dans DDR?</i>

283
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,506
<i>No. Pfilzing not DDR.</i>

284
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:04,006
<i>No. Not in the so-called DDR.</i>

285
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,500
<i>- Not German Democratic Republic.
- Not democratic?</i>

286
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,940
<i>- Bavaria.
- Pas Democratic Bavaria?</i>

287
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:15,535
<i>No. Oh, yes, yes. Democratic, yes.</i>

288
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:17,000
<i>Democratic Bavaria.</i>

289
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,195
<i>But... Christian Socialistic Union.</i>

290
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,045
<i>- Socialistic?
- No. No, no.</i>

291
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:25,401
<i>So, where do you live exactly?</i>

292
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:31,286
<i>- Te l'a dit. Elle vit en la Republic Federal
Allemand. - She said socialistic. - No, no.</i>

293
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,600
My standards have changed in Paris.

294
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,300
When I came back to Pfilzing,
they honored me.

295
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,235
I received the silver
taler from the mayor.

296
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:08,900
Only very important people get it.

297
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Follow Sonja's example.

298
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,255
- Congratulations, general.
- What did you say?

299
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,760
- Congratulations, Dr. Kogler.
- State of law is a higher cause...

300
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,810
- Congratulations, Miss Sonja.
- Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

301
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,300
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

302
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,600
Now, Sonja.

303
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:53,884
- This is all thanks to you.
- Come now.

304
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:56,548
You know my brother?
Prof. Juckenack.

305
00:24:56,648 --> 00:24:58,402
- Good day.
- Good day.

306
00:24:58,502 --> 00:25:00,597
When I saw Prof. Juckenack,

307
00:25:00,697 --> 00:25:04,939
I remembered a story
that he allegedly...

308
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,200
...in the 60s he adressed
highest authority

309
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,000
to campaign against the
printing of 50-Mark bill.

310
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:18,435
- ...highest authority...
- Not sure how it goes...

311
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:21,590
But I think people just
attributed the story to him.

312
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,211
Anyway in a certain position,

313
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:29,511
this banknote becomes something
very obscene looking in the mirror.

314
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,200
In the mirror?

315
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Give it here.

316
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:42,800
Now look. Have you ever
seen anything so wonderful?

317
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,793
The money must be prohibited.
It spoils our youth.

318
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:48,607
Dear Dr. Juckenack,
I can't ban all 50 DM bills!

319
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:49,807
Come here.

320
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,800
Check this.

321
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,500
Would you like to prohibit
coffee drinking, too?

322
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Anyway the 50-Mark
bill was not prohibited.

323
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,400
- Cheer up father. Play for us,
you play so nice! - Nicely wrong!

324
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,800
- How is that thing?
- With the bypass road?

325
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,800
Well, can I have that assignment?

326
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,370
Would you like to make the best offer?

327
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:20,800
I would have to know how
high are the other offers.

328
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,915
- That may be arranged.
- Good.

329
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,900
If I had known what a
celebrity you would become,

330
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,730
I would preserve your
appendix in alcohol.

331
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,100
Sonja got our worm-pills
from my late husband.

332
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
She was this little then.

333
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,100
Such a family is the best
breeding ground, isn't it?

334
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,200
Mrs. diocese councilor, Mrs.
pharmacist, Mr. principal.

335
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,700
Your Excellency.

336
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,600
I still see vividly, how this little girl

337
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,600
ran around our seminary garden.

338
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,000
After two years Martin,
I mean Mr. Wegmus returned.

339
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,725
He was an assessor!

340
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,600
Martin!

341
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,400
Martin.

342
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,600
Sonja.

343
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
You are still my Sonja, right?

344
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,400
Of course.

345
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,000
Such a kiss.

346
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,360
Because I'm fond of you.

347
00:27:56,535 --> 00:28:00,535
One day Miss Juckenack came
to our house very excited.

348
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,495
- Is Sonja here?
- Good day, Miss Juckenack.

349
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:08,600
I'm sorry to bother you at dinner time.

350
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,134
- Good day.
- Good day.

351
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:13,377
- You know Mr. Wegmus, assessor.
- Yes, of course.

352
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,807
- Good day, Miss Juckenack.
- Good day.

353
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,140
- Would you like to eat with us?
- No, that's not necessary.

354
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,666
Bring a chair, please.

355
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,666
Please, sit here.

356
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,690
She explained that the President
announced another essay contest.

357
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,483
Topic: European idea.

358
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:31,057
Is there another topic?

359
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:32,152
Yes...

360
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,352
But...

361
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,200
My hometown in the Third Reich.

362
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
That's a nice topic.

363
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,400
I'll take it.

364
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,700
My hometown in the Third Reich?

365
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,055
What would you write about?

366
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,035
How the town fought
against National Socialism.

367
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:56,565
Especially the Church.

368
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:58,665
There's plenty to write about.

369
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,600
Very commendable.

370
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,885
...world without end. Amen.

371
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
- Good night.
- Good night.

372
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,800
- Follow Sonja's example.
- Yes, OK.

373
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,100
- Write only about positive things.
- Yes, of course.

374
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,600
Sleep well.

375
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,300
I already pictured winning
another first prize.

376
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:24,518
Maybe this time a trip to America.

377
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:28,629
The next day I started right away
asking acquaintances and relatives,

378
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:32,541
who experienced the era.
I first interviewed uncle Franz.

379
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:36,606
We, in the boarding school, didn't
notice much of the nazis.

380
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,300
And then suddenly there was a rumor,

381
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,600
that they arrested pastor Schulte.

382
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:44,435
Then they released him again.

383
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:48,800
But in his sermons he kept on arguing
against the racial laws.

384
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,100
And then they executed him.

385
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,400
Who?

386
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,200
- Mom, pastor Schulte.
- Yes, pastor Schulte.

387
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,620
He was a saint.

388
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:03,795
- Grandma, I can't eat anymore.
- Come now. Just a little piece.

389
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:08,009
Uncle Franz told me to go to Prof. Juckenack

390
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:10,317
if I wanted to know more
about pastor Schulte.

391
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,482
He is the one with 50-Mark bill.

392
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:15,709
He is the head of Episcopal archives.

393
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,909
But he has many other duties.

394
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,800
So I went to the church archives,
in Archiepiscopal ordinariate.

395
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:28,902
But strangely Prof. Juckenack didn't want
to know anything about pastor Schulte.

396
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:32,635
He talked only about Zumtobel,
who was a mayor in that time.

397
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:37,700
The only fully convinced Nazi was,
in my opinion, the mayor.

398
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,500
- Zumtobel?
- Yes.

399
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,100
He must have been very evil.

400
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,000
He got his deserved punishment.

401
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:51,905
He couldn't say anything
about pastor Schulte, he said.

402
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:56,400
The documents must be in Berlin, since
he was sentenced by People's Court.

403
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,100
And in the archives? Is there
nothing written about the times?

404
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,500
I'm sorry. We are just a
church library, theology.

405
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,070
Why are you writing about this anyway?

406
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:13,300
I would like to show, how the Church
remained honest in the Nazi era.

407
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:17,774
Well, I am sorry. Say hello to your
parents. And to your uncle, too.

408
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:19,219
I was disappointed.

409
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,220
But other people that I asked,

410
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:24,060
also always started talking
about Zumtobel right away.

411
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:25,464
And that he was evil.

412
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:26,806
Never mind, I thought to myself.

413
00:31:26,906 --> 00:31:31,391
I'll go to the town hall archives
and find everything about Zumtobel.

414
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,100
- Is it going well?
- No.

415
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,200
I can't find anything that makes sense.

416
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,100
What are you trying to find?

417
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Well. For instance about mayor Zumtobel.

418
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,600
That is filed as confidential.
It cannot be shown.

419
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,200
But I need it.
For my school essay.

420
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,400
You must get a permit
from Zumtobel's widow.

421
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,400
This is Zumtobel chocolate factory.

422
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
In all these boilers
a chocolate is stirred.

423
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,800
Maybe this smells nice.

424
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,340
This all belongs to Zumtobel family.

425
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,725
And Mrs. Zumtobel made an appointment
with me here in April 1979.

426
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:20,200
I thought maybe she still had
the documents from the trial,

427
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,600
that the Americans held for
her husband after the war.

428
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,750
That is you?

429
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:27,303
You want my permission,

430
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:32,602
to bring out all the dirt and all
the lies about my husband again.

431
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,892
I don't want to write about the lies.
I want only the facts.

432
00:32:34,992 --> 00:32:39,206
My husband spent six years
in labor camp. Six years.

433
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:42,303
And he died of sadness.
These are the facts.

434
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:46,300
And others had a good time.
These are the facts.

435
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,500
And now get out of here!
Now!

436
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,000
Zumtobel.

437
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,225
wasn't a bad type at all.

438
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,200
If it wasn't for him I would have
been arrested.

439
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,225
Because of the crucifixes.

440
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,200
- Which crucifixes?
- The school crucifixes.

441
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,300
They wanted to remove them
from the classrooms.

442
00:33:11,327 --> 00:33:15,427
But I said no! No!

443
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,700
And then I gathered the women.

444
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,600
And then we went up to
the school building.

445
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,500
We were the first protesters.

446
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
- Really? You, grandma?
- Yes.

447
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,400
But then the police came
and arrested me.

448
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,600
But the district leader said,
send her home, she has 10 children.

449
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:41,700
Whose cat is that?

450
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,500
She's been straying around
for a while now.

451
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,225
I've asked everybody
about her already.

452
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,700
There's a hungry cat...

453
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,800
I remembered another person, who could
tell you something about pastor Schulte.

454
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,125
Dr. Kogler.

455
00:33:57,224 --> 00:34:01,001
The one who received the silver
taler the same time as you.

456
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:03,616
He's a retired judiciary president.

457
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,247
I think he worked at the
People's Court.

458
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,770
He could tell you about Zumtobel, too.

459
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,800
I don't know. Mr. Kogler
shouldn't be taken too seriously.

460
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,980
Was he imprisoned after the war?

461
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,500
Why? He's a socialist.

462
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,600
I don't know anything.
I was in Berlin.

463
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,500
I have no idea what was
happening in Pfilzing.

464
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,400
In the difficult years.

465
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,800
Where in Berlin?

466
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,400
What is it to you?

467
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,500
I'm sorry.

468
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,310
- I thought maybe you were at
the People's Court. -So?

469
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,900
Do you think I could chose where
I wanted to work in those times?

470
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,600
I don't know.

471
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,500
And People's Court
only delivered justice.

472
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,420
And so did the other courts.

473
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,500
- Or do you think we were happy
convicting people? - No.

474
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,900
So, there was war.

475
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Were you ever in the same situation?

476
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,200
And now go home.

477
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
And don't come back.

478
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,800
He can definitely help you.
You'll see.

479
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,380
Here is a cheesecake from
Sunday that must be eaten.

480
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,020
Yes, here is Dr. Friedfoll.
I'd like to speak to cathedral preacher.

481
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,700
Thank you.

482
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,600
- What do you want from a socialist?
- A socialist? God forbid!

483
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,800
Good day, Sir.

484
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,500
I have a request.

485
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,100
Cathedral preacher has just
returned from a fire drill.

486
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
- Good day.
- Sorry you had to wait.

487
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,400
Good day.

488
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,060
I have to wash my hands.

489
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:51,535
I keep myself fit this way.

490
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:53,600
Sit here, please.

491
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,300
- Reverend, may I.
- Thank you.

492
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
Reverend, cheers.

493
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,210
There is still somebody who knows.

494
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,595
What is the name of the woman
who lives near the school? Mrs...

495
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,100
Guggenwieser.

496
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,735
Yes, that's why the
Americans put her in jail.

497
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:15,240
Because she denounced pastor Schulte.

498
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,400
Pastor Schulte?

499
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,400
But she surely won't tell anything.

500
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,400
Why don't you just visit her? She lives
in an old people's home, St. Ansgar.

501
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,000
The Americans put me
in jail for 14 months.

502
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,600
That was something.

503
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,600
I didn't want pastor
Schulte to be convicted.

504
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,700
I only wanted him to shut up.

505
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:46,100
But they executed him right away.

506
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,300
The judge who sentenced
pastor Schulte to death.

507
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Nothing had happened to him. The
Americans should put him in jail to.

508
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,060
Nothing happened to him.

509
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,200
And to the others also.

510
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,500
The brown Heinrich for instance.

511
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,400
I am tired now.

512
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,525
She'll recover.

513
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
In a couple of weeks.

514
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,500
These old people are tough.

515
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,900
The brown Heinrich?
No, never heard of him.

516
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,000
Wait, that must be Zumtobel,
his name is Karl-Heinrich.

517
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,425
Do you want to keep it?

518
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,095
I was impressed by him.

519
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,900
But maybe he was just quite stubborn.

520
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,500
Or just very proud.

521
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Or vain about his decency.

522
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
I went to see Mrs. Guggewieser again,

523
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,040
to ask her about the brown Heinrich.

524
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,900
I didn't know anymore how to go on.

525
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,483
And I was also afraid at the time,
that Martin doesn't like me anymore.

526
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:22,118
Because I'd had so little time for him.

527
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:25,018
Rabenbauer Iris was
just waiting for that.

528
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Anyway the deadline
for the essay expired,

529
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,800
and I closed the chapter.

530
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,265
I am just glad that the deadline
for your assignment expired.

531
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,700
I am not glad.

532
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,000
But I am.

533
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,600
You cared only about your essay.

534
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,300
- I thought you didn't like
me anymore. - Nonsense.

535
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:12,700
Pull yourself together, Eberhard.

536
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,600
Don't make such a spectacle.

537
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,300
- Somebody should bomb the place..
- Eberhard!

538
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,700
- Can I dance with your fiancée?
- Well, ask him.

539
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,300
Please come, Mr. Assessor.

540
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,700
<i>Now the girls have their diplomas.
That's life. That's nature.</i>

541
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,900
Sonja, come here.
What are you going to do now?

542
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,820
I'm sorry.
Miss Rosenberger.

543
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:44,400
- I'm going to study history.
- Very commendable.

544
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,900
She's interested in something particular,
namely Pfilzing in the Third Reich.

545
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,700
- May I have this dance?
- Sure.

546
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,600
Does this mean she will keep on prying.

547
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,200
She is just interested.

548
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,900
You voted against the bypass road?

549
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yes, because it is unchristian to
build this close to the miracle tree.

550
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,700
Didn't you plan to build a huge
furniture store there?

551
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That has been rejected, then.

552
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,800
Everything is negotiable.

553
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,000
- This is Charly Zumtobel.
- Hello.

554
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,600
Sonja.

555
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,000
Take this ring

556
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,300
SILESIA IS OURS

557
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,900
and wear it as a sign
of my love and fidelity.

558
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
Follow Sonja's example.

559
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Oh, my god.
Sonja.

560
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,600
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.

561
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,900
Sonja.

562
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:02,750
It so happens that right next door a small
apartment on the first floor became available.

563
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,300
Sit on the couch.

564
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,900
Sonja, you shouldn't carry
such heavy things. Come.

565
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,500
Then Sarah was born.

566
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
Very nice. Hold it.

567
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,600
Damn, I forgot to wind it.
Hold it. Sonja...

568
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,500
You should lift Sonja higher.

569
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,100
She is not Sonja.
She is Sarah.

570
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yes, little Sarah.

571
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,000
And then came Rebecca.

572
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,600
- You should lift Sonja higher.
- The child's name is Rebecca.

573
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,145
- Quite right. - Don't cry, Sarah.
- I just misspoke.

574
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,200
I was happily married.

575
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,500
And Sarah and Rebecca
brought much joy.

576
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,800
But sometimes I had a
feeling that I had failed.

577
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That I wasn't there anymore.

578
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:03,200
Anyway the people of Pfilzing believed,

579
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,000
now she's over that
craziness. Thank god.

580
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,300
Now she remembers her
duties as wife and mother.

581
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,200
But I said to myself: No.

582
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:13,308
I'll just start all over again.

583
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:17,687
And I said to my husband, Martin,
I'm going to study at the university.

584
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:19,614
I started my studies.

585
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,320
Theology, German and history.

586
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:26,104
My parents were glad, because
they thought I would be a teacher.

587
00:43:26,198 --> 00:43:28,714
But I just wanted to return to my topic.

588
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,993
I thought to myself, if
they didn't want my essay

589
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:33,893
I'll write a book.

590
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,900
I registered for classes
with Prof. Juckenack outright.

591
00:43:37,997 --> 00:43:40,158
And then I visited him in
the editorial department.

592
00:43:40,257 --> 00:43:44,499
Because he was also the chief
editor of Pfilzing Morgen newspaper.

593
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,457
A junior editor took me there.

594
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:48,708
You want to write a book about Pfilzing?

595
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:49,936
I've already started.

596
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:51,594
But you don't know anything.

597
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:53,015
I will study.

598
00:43:53,115 --> 00:43:55,515
I want to learn from you.

599
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,100
Why do you want to write a book?

600
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,900
Do you want to be famous?

601
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,100
No.

602
00:44:02,196 --> 00:44:04,934
I thought to myself that
something is hidden here.

603
00:44:05,034 --> 00:44:08,670
- And now I want to know what.
- I have nothing to hide.

604
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:09,870
Zöpfel.

605
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,140
The young lady has all access
to the newspaper archives.

606
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,600
Look. I've found something strange.

607
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:31,200
Pfilzing Morgen. Wednesday.
November 2, 1936.

608
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,200
Typical Jewish gimmickry

609
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,600
A Jewish laundry salesman

610
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,600
conned two Pfilzing priests
out of 100 underpants.

611
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:44,179
The Hebrew profiteer
offered the priests,

612
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:47,761
to pay for the underpants
only at the end of the year.

613
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:52,789
Until then the merchandize was practically
given away because of the inflation.

614
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:55,210
The priests did their duty

615
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,001
and denounced the Jew,

616
00:44:58,097 --> 00:45:01,504
who belittled the
government with this act.

617
00:45:01,592 --> 00:45:03,312
He was sent to concentration
camp Hackeldorf.

618
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,977
- You are always studying hard.
- Good day, Mr. Zöpfel.

619
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:07,523
- Underpants?
- Yes.

620
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:09,403
The priests stated,

621
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:14,803
that the member of the Jewish race
put them in a state of trance

622
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,800
with physical contact.

623
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,600
Is there a name?

624
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,500
No, it only says,
member of the Jewish race.

625
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,300
- I mean of the priests.
- No.

626
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,300
So, there you have it.

627
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,700
I'm sorry.

628
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,000
Hackeldorf. Is that our
Hackeldorf, there by the Pfilz?

629
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,600
I cannot remember anything.

630
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,300
Mom.

631
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,600
Look what I found!

632
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,425
I am busy.

633
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,700
1940.
Dr. Juckenack.

634
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,600
We, German people, fight
today for our racial integrity.

635
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:59,774
Purity of the Aryan race
and its living space.

636
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:02,833
God is with us.
God is with our beloved führer.

637
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:04,494
This is strange, isn't it?

638
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:07,114
It is impossible that
Juckenack wrote this.

639
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:10,100
He was a member of the resistance.
Prof. Juckenack.

640
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,865
That could be anyone
in Pfilzing. Really.

641
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,100
But there was a concentration camp.
Hackeldorf, right.

642
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,900
We had no concentration camp.

643
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,000
Nonsense.
Concentration camp?

644
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,200
Just the opposite. There were people who
came to this base from concentration camps.

645
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,408
They were glad to be there.

646
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:34,006
They didn't have to go to
concentration camp from this base.

647
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:35,235
They worked a little.

648
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:37,104
But Prof. Steiert said in his lecture...

649
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:40,104
They were treated very decently.

650
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
There was a tall fence.

651
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,700
With barbed wire.

652
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,500
They were like animals in zoo.
And they begged.

653
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,400
Then I threw them some bread.

654
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,330
The guard told me it was prohibited.
And I would be put in jail if I did it again.

655
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,600
But I did it again and again.

656
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,800
I had three men in the battlefield.

657
00:47:05,975 --> 00:47:07,600
So I thought...

658
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,900
...maybe someone will give
them something to eat.

659
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,000
One of the Nazi authors

660
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,300
started the so-called
host desecrations again

661
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,600
and spread the hate against the Jews.

662
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,300
In the 15. century

663
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:42,900
the Pfilzing Christians tortured and
cruelly killed the Jewish fellow citizens,

664
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,700
because a Jew allegedly stole the host
and pierced it with a knife.

665
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,600
Out of one host even blood ran.

666
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,300
Naturally...

667
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,500
Naturally such a legend had
a great effect in the Third Reich.

668
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,400
I cannot let you in.

669
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,500
I'm sorry. Please don't ask me why.

670
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,101
Suddenly I wasn't allowed to use
the Pfilzing Morgen archives anymore.

671
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:18,300
Allegedly because the newspapers
were being recorded to microfilm.

672
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:20,707
But then everything changed.

673
00:48:20,794 --> 00:48:22,413
Namely, my former schoolmate

674
00:48:22,512 --> 00:48:26,774
Lettl Ramona got engaged to the
grandson of district leader Zumtobel.

675
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:29,928
To Charly, who inherited
the chocolate factory.

676
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:35,163
And he had no objections against me
inspecting documents about his grandfather.

677
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,600
This is made from my
grandpa's old recipe.

678
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,000
Charly didn't care about the past.

679
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,385
He said, main thing is
that the business is good.

680
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,700
Charly said, the Americans
even offered his grandfather

681
00:48:57,795 --> 00:49:00,805
to open a chocolate factory in USA.

682
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:04,400
That's why he didn't believe that
the old Zumtobel was a Nazi criminal,

683
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,014
like people said.

684
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:08,685
He was actually glad, that the
documents would come to light.

685
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:11,317
That's why he gave me his consent.

686
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:12,517
Here.

687
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,300
I signed it myself.

688
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,700
You see how grandmother is.

689
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,900
You made a big step forward.

690
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,200
Only...

691
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,700
This doesn't concern only Zumtobel.

692
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,900
After all, in these documents

693
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,600
there are intimate things about many
citizens and families of our city.

694
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,900
I cannot give you the documents.

695
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,200
I'm sorry.

696
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,030
Protection of privacy.

697
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,700
Do you know what I decided?

698
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,900
I will sue them.

699
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,000
I will sue the city of Pfilzing.

700
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,600
You're mad.

701
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,700
I will sue the city to
surrender the documents.

702
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,800
Come on, no normal person would do this.

703
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,300
What?

704
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,300
Sonja will do what?

705
00:50:09,392 --> 00:50:11,508
She will sue the city.

706
00:50:11,607 --> 00:50:13,801
- I think that's OK.
- Hold your tongue.

707
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:16,201
Hey, don't terrorize me.

708
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,700
I also think that's OK.

709
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,500
Yes, I...
think so too.

710
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,300
- We're going now.
- But don't come too late.

711
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:42,433
I've known Rosenbergers for years.

712
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:46,271
But I refused to represent
Sonja in court against the city,

713
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,589
because I don't think
this lawsuit is proper.

714
00:50:48,689 --> 00:50:53,110
I told Sonja, when someone sues you,
I will always be there,

715
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,102
but in this case, no.

716
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:57,102
Good morning, Sarah.

717
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,700
Listen, I've been thinking.

718
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,800
Without a lawyer, this
doesn't make any sense.

719
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,210
- You don't stand a chance.
Not even this much. - Yes.

720
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,500
Just let me. I don't need a
lawyer. I prefer it this way.

721
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:28,500
But you cannot stand up
against the city alone.

722
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,300
But I have you.

723
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,000
Yes, right, but...

724
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,000
Say, hasn't the newspaper arrived yet?

725
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,500
Here is playback.

726
00:51:53,594 --> 00:51:56,006
No, here...
- No, turn it to the right.

727
00:51:56,104 --> 00:51:58,579
- No, to the left.
- Just turn it to the right.

728
00:51:58,669 --> 00:52:00,349
To the right, that's it.

729
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,493
- Left is volume.
- Be quiet now.

730
00:52:02,593 --> 00:52:06,600
...if you keep poking your filthy
noses in other people's business,

731
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,300
something bad will happen
to you and your children.

732
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:17,500
People who name their children Sarah
and Rebecca are not true Germans.

733
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,600
Jewish whore.
Colonists' cunt.

734
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,400
We made short work with
the likes of you before.

735
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,900
I am 18 years old and I
am German and proud of it

736
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,300
and you should finally stop...

737
00:52:34,145 --> 00:52:35,900
Mrs. Rosenberger, listen...

738
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,050
But this is...

739
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,750
...your daughter is a spy for the East.

740
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,500
- We have evidence...
- But this is...

741
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,500
We will off you, Sonja Wegmus.
And your children too.

742
00:52:46,757 --> 00:52:48,691
You won't have a minute of peace.

743
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,400
And one thing you should know...

744
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,400
This is the Rosenberger and
Wegmus answering machine.

745
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,000
Please speak after the tone.

746
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,200
This is a well-meaning friend.

747
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,700
Leave the city, pack
your things and disappear.

748
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,400
All of you.

749
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,700
Very commendable.

750
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,000
What did you say?

751
00:53:23,605 --> 00:53:27,245
In the name of the law,
the following verdict is issued:

752
00:53:27,345 --> 00:53:30,595
The defendant city of
Pfilzing is not to interfere

753
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:34,140
with the plaintiff's further research,

754
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,658
and will grant her access to all the
documents in the city archives.

755
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:41,258
Especially the Zumtobel documents.

756
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,200
- Follow Sonja's example.
- Oh, Mom.

757
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,110
Do you have a message for the public?

758
00:53:49,198 --> 00:53:50,912
Are your motives of religious nature?

759
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:53,109
Does any party or
organization stand behind you?

760
00:53:53,207 --> 00:53:55,979
- Do you fork for GDR?
- Are you inspired by Simon Wiesenthal?

761
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,718
Who? No, my grandma is my inspiration.

762
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:00,031
That is rubbish.

763
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,701
But you have to know where you come from,
or you don't know where you're going.

764
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:05,881
I'll give you the authorization.

765
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,500
With this you have unrestricted
access to the archives.

766
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,500
Thank you.

767
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,500
Personally, I had nothing against you.
You know that, right?

768
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,400
State agency for street naming?

769
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,100
Mangold cultivation from 1939 on?

770
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,300
Canine unit?

771
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,700
Evolution of hand grenade
in German armed forces.

772
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,000
I definitely haven't ordered this.

773
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,500
Where are the Zumtobel documents?

774
00:54:40,975 --> 00:54:42,600
Don't ask me.

775
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,500
The Zumtobel documents.
They are checked out.

776
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,500
- Until when?
- Six to eight weeks.

777
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:55,200
You want the Zumtobel documents.
Yes, wait a second.

778
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,200
They are still checked out.
But you are next in line.

779
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,400
I specifically noted.

780
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,360
Put on hold in poison
cabinet for Mrs. Wegmus.

781
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,600
We call it poison cabinet.

782
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,000
But... It's on loan again.

783
00:55:16,096 --> 00:55:19,604
Who to? I want names
and addresses this time.

784
00:55:19,704 --> 00:55:23,000
Surely you wouldn't want me to
shout your name from the rooftops.

785
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,600
Yes. The documents are here now.

786
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,900
But here's the thing.

787
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,600
The documents are so old.

788
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,400
Too brittle.

789
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,800
They mustn't be touched anymore.

790
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,200
The problem is the documents
are too new. Personal rights.

791
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,000
You understand, right.

792
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,800
At least 50 years must pass after death.

793
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,600
The statute says 30 years.
Thirty.

794
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,300
Yes, but in the meantime
the city changed the statute.

795
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,000
Now it's 50 years.

796
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,000
Sarah, be still.

797
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
- Rebecca wants a bottle.
- Then make her one.

798
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,200
I must prepare for my physics classes.

799
00:56:14,423 --> 00:56:16,923
And I must prepare a new complaint.

800
00:56:17,023 --> 00:56:20,078
If I knew this, I would
never have married you.

801
00:56:20,178 --> 00:56:22,078
We can change that anytime.

802
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,600
I was often at the end of my tether.

803
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,100
In my opinion Sonja overdid things.

804
00:56:40,198 --> 00:56:45,602
And I also believe that
from a certain point...

805
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:48,981
From a certain points she
let herself get exploited.

806
00:56:49,081 --> 00:56:52,711
I have asked her many times:
What do you have from this?

807
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:56,208
But no. She had to get the
documents no matter what.

808
00:56:56,305 --> 00:57:00,404
I think Sonja has a
distinct sense of justice.

809
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:04,069
And people have always been asking me:
Why does Sonja do this?

810
00:57:04,169 --> 00:57:07,432
And I have told them:
Why don't others do it too?

811
00:57:07,532 --> 00:57:11,232
Lobo. Come here.

812
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,900
I sued the city again.

813
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:18,404
Because they lengthened the
obligation of secrecy to 50 years.

814
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,566
Because they didn't want
me to get the documents.

815
00:57:20,665 --> 00:57:22,138
And I won the process.

816
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:27,338
The city had to change the statute again.
To 30 years like before.

817
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,500
But that didn't do me any good.

818
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,500
Because suddenly I was told, that
the documents cannot be found.

819
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,000
What does that mean?
Cannot be found?

820
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,155
They were lost going
through official channels.

821
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,000
But suddenly a coincidence helped me.

822
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,866
I would like to speak to
the head of the archives.

823
00:57:51,966 --> 00:57:56,436
Mr. Schulz is not here. Someone
from Munich is substituting for him.

824
00:57:56,536 --> 00:58:00,636
- A substitute. Go to the first floor.
- Thank you.

825
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:06,300
My name is König, a substitute.
What is this about?

826
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,200
I have an authorization.

827
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,900
Yes, please.

828
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:18,600
- Everything is in the poison cabinet.
- Poison cabinet? I see.

829
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,200
But it's already too late.
Oh, well.

830
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:23,814
Mr. König. Someone to see you.

831
00:58:23,908 --> 00:58:26,706
I have to go to the archives.
I'll be back soon.

832
00:58:26,805 --> 00:58:28,601
I can go if you want to?
Should I get you anything?

833
00:58:28,701 --> 00:58:30,400
No, no.
I'll go.

834
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,335
But you have to show me your
pass. Do you have it with you?

835
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,000
You seem familiar.

836
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,000
Oh, well.

837
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,200
- What did you need again?
- Zumtobel.

838
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,500
And these tribunal documents.

839
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,000
- First name.
- Karl Heinrich.

840
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,500
Sign here.

841
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
- Name and address.
- Yes.

842
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,800
So, now...

843
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,000
I knew it. Now it's a matter of seconds.

844
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:24,910
I must copy as much as I can.
Indiscriminately, whatever I get my hand on.

845
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,800
First that, which is
the most prohibited.

846
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,900
- We are already closed.
- What?

847
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,500
Wait a moment.

848
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,565
What are you doing? This is not
to be copied. Can't you read?

849
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,615
- It says here, copying forbidden.
- Ok. Excuse me.

850
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,800
Excuse me.

851
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,000
Would you please let me go ahead?

852
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,700
I have something urgent.

853
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,700
Excuse me.

854
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,500
Would you please let me go ahead?
I'm in a hurry.

855
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,400
Me, too. You see, Miss.
This is about my pension.

856
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:35,505
Do you need to copy anything?
Come with me.

857
01:00:35,604 --> 01:00:36,901
Good day, Mr. Mayor.

858
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:40,186
I have something that I
wanted to send you. Come.

859
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,070
- Mrs. Brandl, Mrs. Wegmus-Rosenberger
will make some photocopies. - Good day.

860
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,100
Here you are.

861
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,900
By the way, Mrs. Brandl,

862
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,510
is the new archive's statute
prepared for Mrs. Wegmus.

863
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,700
This is now the new archives statute.

864
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,000
It is changed back like it was before.

865
01:01:11,097 --> 01:01:13,946
- 30 instead of 50 years.
- Yes, I know.

866
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:18,658
It's a shame that it doesn't help you,
because the documents were lost.

867
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:19,858
Yes, I know.

868
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,600
You will receive this in the mail.

869
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:27,120
- Mr. Shulz's secretary is on the line.
- I'll take it in my office.

870
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,115
- How much do I owe you?
- Nothing for old friends.

871
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,600
That's it for today.

872
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,925
Listen, Karl. The top one goes
with return receipt. Don't forget.

873
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,600
Thank you.
Goodbye.

874
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,260
Mrs. Wegmus-Rosenberger.

875
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,600
- Karl, where is the lady?
- What? Which lady?

876
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:29,000
- Where are the Zumtobel documents?
- Here.

877
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,340
- What did you copy in my office?
- Good day, Mr. Mayor.

878
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,300
Here.

879
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,900
Greetings, Mrs. Wegmus.

880
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:48,590
Good day, Mr. Kolodzieczik.

881
01:02:48,687 --> 01:02:53,015
There is a surcharge of 1.20
Marks from the Mayor's Office.

882
01:02:53,115 --> 01:02:56,300
They don't know how many stamps
they need. Should I send it back?

883
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,500
No, no.

884
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,070
This is very important.
Wait a moment.

885
01:03:11,065 --> 01:03:13,600
The same day I returned to the archives

886
01:03:13,694 --> 01:03:16,206
and demanded they give me the documents.

887
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,806
I brought some TV reporters
with me as witnesses.

888
01:03:18,906 --> 01:03:22,800
Tell Mr. Schulz that the documents
are in the poison cabinet.

889
01:03:22,894 --> 01:03:25,506
- If maybe he doesn't know.
- One moment.

890
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,463
Of course they knew very well,

891
01:03:27,563 --> 01:03:30,743
that I had something from
the Zumtobel documents.

892
01:03:30,843 --> 01:03:31,943
But what.

893
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:33,738
That they didn't know.

894
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:36,763
Thank god, the documents
have now reappeared.

895
01:03:36,863 --> 01:03:39,063
Here you are.
And I brought even more.

896
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,400
- Thank you.
- See here. Zumtobel.

897
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,300
See.

898
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,700
Hey, Mom, look here.

899
01:03:53,935 --> 01:03:56,935
Is he the one from the mall *BEEP BEEP*?

900
01:03:57,035 --> 01:03:59,000
So he was also a Jew once.

901
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,600
Let me see. Yes, it was called
"Kaufhaus Hirsch" once.

902
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,200
- Yes, that I do remember.
- Only they never saw any money for it.

903
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,200
They disappropriated it.

904
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,500
Listen.

905
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,400
The Jewish businessman
Nathan Krakauer

906
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,100
was sentenced to jail
because he hurt

907
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,400
the government's reputation.

908
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,700
Against the Pfilzing priests...

909
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,840
The names are crossed out.
You cannot read them anymore.

910
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,200
Show me.

911
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,600
Here.
Listen.

912
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:33,000
He uttered that food
rationing could be next.

913
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,220
Bread and meat stamps
are already being printed.

914
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
That is your case, right?

915
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,200
Yes, Nathan Krakauer.

916
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,100
Wait.

917
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,700
- Are there no names?
- Just wait.

918
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,685
Take her.
Let me take a look.

919
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,100
Give it here.

920
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,200
You hold Rebecca.

921
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,700
Name directory.
See here, Krakauer.

922
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,400
See also Dr. Juckenack
and father Brummel.

923
01:05:02,715 --> 01:05:05,900
- Is he the one with 100 underpants?
- Yes he is.

924
01:05:05,995 --> 01:05:07,763
For god's sake.
See what it says here.

925
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,443
Experiments on humans...

926
01:05:09,543 --> 01:05:11,443
10 years of hard labor.

927
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,500
- Dr. *BEEP*.
- Show me.

928
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:17,084
- Is that our Dr. *BEEP*?
- Pharmacist *BEEP*.

929
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:20,521
No, this must be his father.
I knew him as well.

930
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,231
He was always so friendly.

931
01:05:22,316 --> 01:05:23,810
Experiments on humans...

932
01:05:23,895 --> 01:05:25,500
But he wasn't put in jail.

933
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:28,301
I saw him wandering
around until his death.

934
01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:31,901
- For medical reasons. See.
- Oh, I see.

935
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:39,100
It's a bomb. Run!
Go!

936
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,800
So, we're going now.

937
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,880
- But don't come too late.
- Ok.

938
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,000
- Professor.
- Yes?

939
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,905
I would like to study about
the fate of Jews in Pfilzing.

940
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,700
There is nothing to study there.

941
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,493
Oh, well. I still have to do some
research on the camp Hackeldorf.

942
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:31,264
And I wanted to ask you

943
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,451
do you know what happened
to Mr. Nathan Krakauer.

944
01:07:34,547 --> 01:07:38,204
The one who that time bought 100
underpants from the two priests.

945
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:40,086
Unfortunately I can't tell
you anything about that.

946
01:07:40,101 --> 01:07:41,201
How come?

947
01:07:41,301 --> 01:07:43,641
But you were one of the two priests.

948
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,800
You put Mr. Krakauer
in concentration camp.

949
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:55,000
If you spread that,
I'll go all the way.

950
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,900
I will destroy you.

951
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,500
Mark my words.

952
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,500
I was actually frightened.

953
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,600
I had to think about my children, too.

954
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:57,500
And also...
I wanted to grow old someday.

955
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,000
Like my grandma.

956
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,300
And I wanted to have grandchildren.

957
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,400
Then I could explain to them,
how it was once.

958
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:16,915
I thought to myself:
No. It's not worth it.

959
01:09:17,015 --> 01:09:19,485
This way the family life is destroyed.

960
01:09:19,585 --> 01:09:21,685
So, the end.

961
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,600
Or not?

962
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,700
No, I will not give up.

963
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,700
Not a chance.

964
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,280
And then I went on with my work.

965
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,700
I had no time for my job.

966
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,000
First it was only the essay.

967
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,400
But then...

968
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,800
She said that this is
a social obligation.

969
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,400
What does a social obligation mean

970
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,000
if your own husband has to put
your children to bed.

971
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,900
- Good day.
- Good day.

972
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,900
Mrs. pharmacist, we need your wonderful
ear drops again for little Sarah.

973
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,600
For little Sarah?

974
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:10,000
These ear drops made by my late
husband are too good for you.

975
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:17,200
Then I went to Munich and gave
my manuscript to the publisher.

976
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,400
The book was printed in low volume.

977
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,900
Look. This is my book.

978
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
MY HOMETOWN IN THE THIRD REICH

979
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,300
It received a few very good critiques.

980
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,000
In Suddeutsche, in Zeit
and even in Welt newspapers.

981
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:36,000
But in Pfilzing Morgen
there was nothing.

982
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,300
Not a word.

983
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,200
Greetings, Mr. Wegmus.
A registered mail for your wife.

984
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,400
From Austria.

985
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,600
Sonja!

986
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,015
- Good day, Mr. Kolodzieczik.
- A registered mail from Austria for you.

987
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,800
There, please.

988
01:10:52,897 --> 01:10:56,603
I was awarded honorary degree
from the University of Vienna.

989
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:59,904
Because of my brave accounting
of the recent history.

990
01:11:00,004 --> 01:11:03,293
I had to go to Vienna to the conferment.
That was something.

991
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:07,483
And then the Swedish
royal Academy in Uppsala...

992
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:09,727
also conferred a doctorate on me.

993
01:11:09,827 --> 01:11:13,327
I was pleased of course.
Doctor doctor.

994
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,000
And then Sorbonne in Paris joined in.

995
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,200
The press was very interested.

996
01:11:27,428 --> 01:11:29,963
I was very much encouraged by all this.

997
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:32,338
And I searched further in the city.

998
01:11:32,438 --> 01:11:34,838
For certain traces.

999
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:40,100
Then even the Pfilzing University
invited me for a presentation.

1000
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,494
That was in winter 1983.

1001
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:47,206
End of January. On the 50th anniversary
of the Nazi "seizure of power".

1002
01:11:47,293 --> 01:11:48,914
What I wanted to say

1003
01:11:49,006 --> 01:11:51,208
is that Pfilzing was a
city like many others.

1004
01:11:51,303 --> 01:11:54,405
With people who suddenly had a
chance to find jobs and who said,

1005
01:11:54,505 --> 01:11:57,400
before there was unemployment
and now we have jobs

1006
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:01,100
and what happens to dissidents
and Jews is not our concern.

1007
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:04,000
So Pfilzing was very
particular Nazi town.

1008
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,800
But a town with resistance fighters.

1009
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:13,000
Any questions?

1010
01:12:26,695 --> 01:12:29,100
You said you were writing a new book.

1011
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:31,185
Could you tell us on which topic.

1012
01:12:31,276 --> 01:12:32,680
Jews in Pfilzing.

1013
01:12:32,778 --> 01:12:35,036
Thank you, Mrs. Wegmus-Rosenberger.

1014
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:37,021
Permit me one more question.

1015
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,092
In your book you mention the two
priests who denounced the Jewish merchant

1016
01:12:41,192 --> 01:12:45,308
for treachery, but you
didn't tell us their names.

1017
01:12:45,408 --> 01:12:48,498
But denunciation is
a serious accusation.

1018
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:52,303
What is your allegation based on?
Where did you get this?

1019
01:12:52,403 --> 01:12:55,703
From Pfilzing Morgen
of November 2, 1936.

1020
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,120
As far as I know, there
were no names mentioned.

1021
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,300
But maybe chief editor Prof.
Juckenack would like to add something.

1022
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,300
No. Thank you.

1023
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:09,000
Couldn't this whole story
be just Nazi fabrication

1024
01:13:09,099 --> 01:13:12,684
in order to defame Jews and the
catholic church at the same time.

1025
01:13:12,784 --> 01:13:14,217
Not in this case.

1026
01:13:14,317 --> 01:13:16,517
Please.
Tell us the names.

1027
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,200
No.

1028
01:13:22,295 --> 01:13:25,105
Will the names be
revealed in your new book?

1029
01:13:25,205 --> 01:13:27,900
No. I don't think so.
It deals with different topic.

1030
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,875
It will involve completely different names.
Some people are in for a shock.

1031
01:13:35,255 --> 01:13:37,400
Everything Mrs. Wegmus said here,

1032
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:41,044
is a disregard of such generous
people as pastor Schulte,

1033
01:13:41,142 --> 01:13:44,761
who gave his life for the cause.
And many brave members of the resistance.

1034
01:13:44,861 --> 01:13:46,641
Above all, Prof. Juckenack.

1035
01:13:46,741 --> 01:13:51,616
You shouldn't mention pastor Schulte
and Prof. Juckenack in the same breath.

1036
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,800
He was the one.

1037
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,600
Prof. Juckenack.

1038
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,000
The one with 100 underpants.

1039
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,900
This is unbelievable insolence.

1040
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:05,805
You know very well, that
the American authorities

1041
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:09,784
abstained from the lawsuit,
because it wasn't about groceries.

1042
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:11,816
And they handled those.

1043
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:16,201
But this man, Jew or not, was a crook.

1044
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:18,100
Ask father Brummel.

1045
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:22,035
That is the other priest that
you want to drag through mud.

1046
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:26,500
Just because of father Brummel
I didn't want to say the names.

1047
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:31,100
Father Brummel played at your christening.
You should be ashamed.

1048
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:44,500
Maybe father Brummel would
like to address the accusations.

1049
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,900
Please.

1050
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:54,000
I took a vow not to
speak about this matter

1051
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,800
until the day I die.

1052
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,100
- Permission to speak.
- Please.

1053
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,600
Prof. Juckenack who is depicted

1054
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:07,400
as member of the resistance was everything
but the member of the resistance.

1055
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:13,000
- This is a communist.
- They called him Brown Heinrich then though.

1056
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,300
Yes, I am a communist.

1057
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,300
My dear citizens!
Dear citizens!

1058
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,200
Prof. Juckenack made a claim
for damages against the student

1059
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,900
for defamation and slander.

1060
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,400
Chief editor of Pfilzing
Morgen defends himself.

1061
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,300
Slander suit against shameless student.

1062
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,325
- We're going now.
- But don't come too late.

1063
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,700
Come in, Miss.
Come in.

1064
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,400
It is warm inside.

1065
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,400
He always came to the camp on Sundays

1066
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:06,100
and held a mass for Catholics.

1067
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:11,700
And suddenly it was announced
that all the communists

1068
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,200
will be sorted...

1069
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,700
- Sorted out.
- Sorted out. Right.

1070
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,400
Of course then they put them
in different camps where...

1071
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,800
where people were being killed.

1072
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,600
I was lucky though, because
the Americans freed me.

1073
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:36,500
However they put me in
jail again after one year.

1074
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:40,500
The Americans?
Why did they put you in jail?

1075
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,300
Why? Because I was a communist.

1076
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,200
I still fight today for recognition
of the politically persecuted.

1077
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,500
I must take my heart drops now.
Excuse me.

1078
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,400
But Miss, please drink.

1079
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,400
I still need to find some
documents from that time.

1080
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,300
For my rent, you see.

1081
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,715
I can help you. I have
access to all documents now.

1082
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,400
Thank you.

1083
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,270
I can tell you, that we were
really afraid from Juckenack.

1084
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:27,300
The Brown and the Black
did us harm together.

1085
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,500
It is still the same today.

1086
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,700
Please, strike that.
I'm just angry.

1087
01:17:34,205 --> 01:17:37,000
Could you testify in
court about Juckenack.

1088
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,500
Yes, of course.

1089
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,745
- Because he is suing me.
- What?

1090
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,700
I have decided.

1091
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,025
I'm going back to Munich.

1092
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,100
You could come with me.

1093
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,300
No, Martin.

1094
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,260
You will have to go alone.
I will stay here.

1095
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,200
I had to give up our apartment.

1096
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,225
And moved next door
again with both children.

1097
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
- Now it's like in the old days.
- Yes, stuffed.

1098
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Munich is a big city.

1099
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,500
No one knows you there.

1100
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,500
Almighty God,

1101
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,100
bless our arms when the hour comes.

1102
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,800
Be just, as Thou hast always been just.

1103
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:55,500
- Lord, bless our struggle.
- Lord, bless our struggle.

1104
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,800
I had no other option.

1105
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:07,000
I had to sue her,
to regain my inner peace.

1106
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,600
But then Dr. Röder turned me down.

1107
01:20:10,623 --> 01:20:13,678
Naturally that was a big
disappointment for me.

1108
01:20:13,778 --> 01:20:15,578
In human terms.

1109
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,200
I cannot legally represent a man,

1110
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,500
who in the Third Reich hanged
an innocent Jewish citizen.

1111
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,000
And these articles that he wrote.

1112
01:20:27,096 --> 01:20:30,404
All that came out just
now thanks to Mrs. Wegmus.

1113
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,200
Suddenly Dr. Röder came over.

1114
01:20:32,378 --> 01:20:34,619
And said he wanted to defend me.

1115
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,606
Because I am against
all kinds of racism.

1116
01:20:37,706 --> 01:20:39,506
You have to decide, Sonja.

1117
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,900
No, I don't need you. No.

1118
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,925
- So we're going now.
- But don't come too...

1119
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:58,100
The day of trial was coming nearer
and nearer. And then it came.

1120
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,475
I will watch the children tomorrow.

1121
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,200
Thank you.

1122
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,300
Come here.

1123
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
This will bring you luck.

1124
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,700
Certainly.

1125
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,100
- Good day.
- Good day.

1126
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:49,600
Just in case I brought my heart drops

1127
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:55,200
and my nerve drops and constipation drops...

1128
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen!
May I have your attention.

1129
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,600
Silence.

1130
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,900
Today's trial Prof.
Juckenack vs. Mrs. Wegmus

1131
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,100
cannot take place.

1132
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,400
District court judge Dr. Taffel

1133
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,100
fell out of a tree while
picking pears yesterday.

1134
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,000
I said to Sonja then, this
is a very dangerous situation.

1135
01:23:56,955 --> 01:23:59,955
Why did they abandon the trial?

1136
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:01,658
Your opponents are beaten.

1137
01:24:01,749 --> 01:24:03,809
We don't know how they will react.

1138
01:24:03,893 --> 01:24:05,416
You have to be careful now.

1139
01:24:05,515 --> 01:24:08,495
- They held a church fest then.
- We are very concerned.

1140
01:24:08,595 --> 01:24:12,406
- Friendly countries.
- Public opinion.

1141
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:16,016
- Well, the redemption.
- Or rather published opinion.

1142
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:21,800
Good day, Mrs. Rosenberger.
Good day, Mr. Rosenberger.

1143
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,800
- Good day.
- Good day.

1144
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,100
Suddenly everything went back to normal.

1145
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,200
I was again dear Sonja.

1146
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
They dropped Dr. Juckenack
like a hot potato.

1147
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,200
I was very sorry about that.

1148
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,500
And suddenly everybody was on my side

1149
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,600
and said, how I was right,
to do what I did.

1150
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,700
And that they always said so.

1151
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,600
A real happy-end.

1152
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,900
I've molded Gloria before.
The princess.

1153
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,500
And... Steffi Graf.

1154
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,300
Or... even Mireille Mathieu.

1155
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,700
Oh, yes?

1156
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,200
We gathered here today,

1157
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:16,400
to reward a fearless
struggle for the truth.

1158
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:22,500
A woman who couldn't be bothered by
ever new difficulties and obstacles.

1159
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:26,500
Follow Sonja's example.

1160
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:30,500
And now I ask the new chief
editor of Pfilzing Morgen,

1161
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,200
Mr. Hanspeter Zöpfel to say a few words.

1162
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:38,700
Thank you. I won't make a long
speech, just like a journalist.

1163
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,100
I only want to say this:

1164
01:25:41,197 --> 01:25:44,441
I hope that the artist,
Mr. Archibaldo Knips,

1165
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:50,046
captured the essential, the typical in the
expression of this courageous young woman.

1166
01:25:50,146 --> 01:25:52,817
May I ask you,
Mrs. Wegmus-Rosenberger.

1167
01:25:52,917 --> 01:25:56,317
to reveal the bust now.

1168
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:29,100
I won't let you turn me into a
bust and stick me in the town hall.

1169
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,800
I am a living human being.

1170
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,900
- Child, what is it...
- Nothing.

1171
01:26:34,996 --> 01:26:37,629
But I'm not falling for this.

1172
01:26:37,719 --> 01:26:39,585
Just because you're scared shitless,

1173
01:26:39,677 --> 01:26:41,808
because you're afraid of
what I might still find out.

1174
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:43,041
Sonja, please be quiet now.

1175
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:46,291
I won't be quiet. That
is exactly what they want.

1176
01:26:46,385 --> 01:26:49,010
Don't you see.

1177
01:26:49,108 --> 01:26:50,302
What are you implying.

1178
01:26:50,402 --> 01:26:54,237
But I'm not falling for this.
I'm not doing you any favors.

1179
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:59,900
This is a rip-off. You don't want to
honor me. You just want to rip me off.

1180
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,291
- I should be silent. I should shut
my mouth. - Please, Sonja...

1181
01:27:03,391 --> 01:27:05,809
- Yes, and shut it now!
- You ungrateful person.

1182
01:27:05,909 --> 01:27:08,009
She doesn't like anything in this country.

1183
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:11,500
- So go to the GDR.
- Kiss my ass.

1184
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,500
This is my homeland!
My homeland!

1185
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,700
You assholes.

1186
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
- Sonja, you are right.
- Stay with me, Sarah.

1187
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,500
Dear tree, help me hide from them.

1188
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,800
THE NASTY GIRL
