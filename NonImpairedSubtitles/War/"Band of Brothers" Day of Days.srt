1
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,635
Standing in the door,
l could see. . .

2
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,937
. . .the lights on a drop zone.

3
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:41,113
And l had to assume that was
our drop zone, way ahead of us.

4
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,009
And. . . .

5
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,407
So we had the red light.

6
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,339
l had everybody standing up,
ready to jump.

7
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,506
So when the plane started
to get hit, and suddenly. . .

8
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,882
. . .the pilot gives me the green light,
l'm out the door.

9
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:05,057
Got such an opening blast
or opening shot from the prop blast. . .

10
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:11,193
. . .that it broke this chinstrap
that we had on the helmet liner.

11
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:15,602
That's when l lost this famous leg bag
everybody talks about.

12
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:21,418
Just from the shock of the opening.
lt just flew right off my foot.

13
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,295
We came from the sky.

14
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,655
We hit, and in any direction you went,
there would be enemy. You knew it.

15
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,476
And that was all part of what
you accepted.

16
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,393
How do you prepare yourself mentally?

17
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,631
Each man must do that himself.

18
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:45,765
Each man must prepare
himself mentally. . .

19
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,899
. . .to make that jump.

20
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:53,147
ln the back of your mind,
you wonder what's gonna happen.

21
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,476
You know you've been trained
and trained. . .

22
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:00,692
. . .and what your job is
and what you're supposed to do.

23
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:06,744
That's what you gotta think about.
We lost a lot of people that night.

24
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:12,875
But you try to put
it all out of your mind.

25
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,836
Smith!

26
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,741
Give me a light.

27
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,554
Lip! Did Evans make it?

28
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,601
Yes, sir.
He's in Lt. Meehan's stick, sir.

29
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,090
Lt. Meehan. Lt. Meehan.

30
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,282
Will could use some help.

31
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,386
Will!

32
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,776
Will, hey! Will!
l need your help here.

33
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,817
Get ready!

34
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,327
Stand up!

35
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,473
Hook up!

36
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,513
Equipment check!

37
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:09,979
-Sound off for equipment check!
-Ten okay!

38
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,238
-Nine okay!
-Eight okay!

39
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,085
-Seven okay!
-Six okay!

40
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,966
-Five okay!
-Four okay!

41
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,116
-Three okay!
-Two okay!

42
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,648
One okay!

43
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,602
Jesus Christ!
Let's go, let's go!

44
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,147
-Does that light look green to you?
-Let's go!

45
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,688
l'm hit!

46
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,139
Jesus! Tell Meehan
to get them out of there!

47
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,448
Two o'clock!

48
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,768
Oh, Jesus Christ!

49
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,783
-Go!
-He won't jump, sir!

50
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,738
-Don't listen!
-He's staying on the plane!

51
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,616
He's not jumping.

52
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,336
-He's okay! Go, sir! Go!
-All right!

53
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,963
Son of a bitch.

54
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,936
Where's the goddamn DZ?

55
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,979
-Maybe three minutes on this bearing!
-We get lower, we won't need. . .

56
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,254
. . .any frigging parachutes!

57
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:39,504
-Slow down!
-We gotta get some altitude!

58
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,640
They can't jump at this speed!

59
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,085
We there?

60
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,374
Oh, God!

61
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,244
Oh, no!

62
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,466
Let's go!

63
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,082
-Flash.
-Shit.

64
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,807
That's not the correct reply,
trooper.

65
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:54,283
-l say ''flash,'' you say ''thunder. ''
-Yes, sir. Thunder, sir.

66
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,156
Musette bag.

67
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:07,175
Coach? Sir, it's Hall, sir.
l was on the basketball team.

68
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,874
-Leg bag?
-Prop blast got it, sir.

69
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,742
-And my radio and batteries with it.
-Mine too.

70
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,435
Landed somewhere behind those trees.

71
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,303
Okay.

72
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,479
Follow me.

73
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,064
To hell with that!

74
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,623
Wait until they reload.

75
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,358
Go.

76
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:09,567
-Aren't you D Company?
-Able, sir.

77
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,130
Means one of us
is in the wrong zone.

78
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,536
Yeah, or both of us.

79
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:21,586
-Do you have a weapon, sir?
-Just my knife.

80
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,304
Do you have any idea
where we are, sir?

81
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,926
Some.

82
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,143
-So you're a radioman.
-Yes, sir.

83
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:42,392
l was until l lost my radio on the jump.
l'll get chewed out for that.

84
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:48,458
lf you were in my platoon, l'd say you
were a rifleman first, radioman second.

85
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:53,820
Maybe you could say that to my leader.
When we find him. lf we find him.

86
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,881
lt's a deal.

87
00:13:56,128 --> 00:14:01,566
First, l need your help. Locate some
landmarks to get our bearings.

88
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,801
Keep your eyes peeled
for buildings, farmhouses. . .

89
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:10,654
. . .bridges, roads, trees.

90
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,857
l wonder if the rest
are as lost as we are.

91
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,427
We're not lost, private.
We're in Normandy.

92
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:03,893
-Who's that?
-Lt. Winters? ls that you?

93
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,547
-Sit down. Any weapon?
-No, sir.

94
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,980
l hit the prop blast, no more leg bag.
l have a knife and TNT.

95
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,051
-The 82nd boys got M-1 s though.
-82nd?

96
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,532
-Where are we?
-Sir, l saw a sign back there.

97
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,717
lt said ''Sainte-Mere-Eglise. ''

98
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,134
Flashlight?

99
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:34,636
Raincoat?

100
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,889
-You got a raincoat?
-Yeah, yeah.

101
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,755
Seven kilometers from our objective.
Four hours from our deadline.

102
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,921
So, we got a lot of walking
ahead of us.

103
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:13,299
You'll stick with us
until we find your unit.

104
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,396
Let's go.

105
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:18,521
-Where are we going?
-Causeway 2, Utah Beach.

106
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,441
Germans in the fields.
We need to clear it for our boys.

107
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:27,565
Five of us won't secure a road.
That looey don't even have a weapon.

108
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:30,780
l don't recall railroads
near our objective.

109
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:34,306
This is the spur line,
parallel to the river.

110
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,453
-We'll see a road and bridge.
-How do you know?

111
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:41,024
Because l studied
the sand tables, all right?

112
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:47,823
Probably a frigging train or--

113
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,772
-Flash.
-Thunder.

114
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,673
Lieutenant, is that you?

115
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,603
-Malarkey.
-Sir. Sir.

116
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,124
-Glad to see you, sir.
-Hey, fellas.

117
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,828
-Everybody okay?
-Good to see you.

118
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,424
-Guarnere?
-Sir.

119
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:05,367
You and Hall up front.

120
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,881
Who the hell is Hall?

121
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:44,031
Lipton. Go. Guarnere.

122
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,053
Wait for my command.

123
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,344
Grenade!

124
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:52,425
That's enough, Guarnere!

125
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,566
-Everyone okay?
-Yes, sir.

126
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:03,740
Next time l say wait for my command,
you wait for my command, sergeant.

127
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,180
Yes, sir.

128
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:16,168
Here you go, lieutenant.
Kraut weapon.

129
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:22,254
Fine, Quaker.

130
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,420
-What's that guy's problem?
-Gonorrhea.

131
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:30,940
Really?

132
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,447
His name, dummy.
Guarnere, gonorrhea, get it?

133
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,795
So besides a shitty name,
what's his problem?

134
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,893
None of your fucking business, cowboy.

135
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,218
-All right, let's move out.
-Sir.

136
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,748
Quietly.

137
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,784
-You see him? He just sat there.
-He didn't have a weapon.

138
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:12,118
-What's he gonna do, shout?
-Shouts at me for killing Krauts.

139
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,261
He just wanted you to wait
for his command.

140
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,382
Joe, he don't even drink.

141
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,247
Lipton! Wynn!

142
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:21,567
Anybody need supplies or ammo,
now's the time to get it.

143
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,308
McDowell!
You okay?

144
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:31,015
-Yes, sergeant.
-Well, let's go.

145
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:45,041
l promised my brother l'd bring
him a Luger. l got first dibs.

146
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,584
Check that one.

147
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:54,379
-The Navy!
-Landings have started.

148
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,684
-Move it out.
-Right on time.

149
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:00,252
-Yeah? Tell that to him, cowboy.
-My name's Hall.

150
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,529
-That so?
-Let's move out.

151
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:07,373
-Learn to return his fire.
-lt ain't about you.

152
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:11,378
-He heard his brother--
-Malarkey, shut your yap.

153
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:16,326
His brother got it at Cassino.
Found out before we jumped.

154
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:30,911
Morning, sir.

155
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,055
-Battalion will be happy to see you.
-Where?

156
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:35,834
At the farm, sir.

157
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:39,694
Top of the morning to you, fellas.
Enjoying the war?

158
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,302
Where you from, son?

159
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,669
Eugene, Oregon.

160
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,623
Eugene?
You gotta be kidding me.

161
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:51,948
Popeye, did you hear this?

162
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:55,684
-You don't say.

163
00:22:56,001 --> 00:23:00,040
-Why are you in a Kraut uniform?
-Volksdeutsche.

164
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:03,976
-Come again?
-My family answered the call.

165
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,418
All true Aryans should return
to the Fatherland.

166
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,474
-Joined up in '41 .
-You're shitting me.

167
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:15,635
Hey, Malarkey! Stop fraternizing
with the enemy! Get over here!

168
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,138
-What got you to Eugene?
-l was born in Eugene.

169
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,840
Really?

170
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,530
Popeye.

171
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,146
Hey, Popeye!

172
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:41,771
-Hey, Harry!
-Carry on.

173
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,515
Easy Company.

174
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,333
-Hey, Popeye.
-Good to see you.

175
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:51,110
-This here's Hall, Able Company.
-Known as Cowboy.

176
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:53,309
-You from Texas?
-Manhattan.

177
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,436
Lt. Winters!

178
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:00,441
-What's the holdup?
-Not sure.

179
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:05,026
Five'll get you ten
it's got something to do with that.

180
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,875
lt's good to see you.

181
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,833
Yeah, you too, Buck.
What's the situation?

182
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:13,951
Not good. Ninety percent of
the men are unaccounted for.

183
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:18,076
-Lt. Meehan?
-No one's seen him.

184
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,850
lf he is missing. . .

185
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:24,397
. . .wouldn't that put you in line
to be the next commander of Easy?

186
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:30,020
Hey, Lt. Speirs.

187
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:34,358
How many men of Dog Company
got assembled?

188
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:37,918
-Maybe 20.
-You the only officer that made it?

189
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,184
So far.

190
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:44,478
Still waiting for orders.
You got some cigarettes?

191
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,888
Yeah.

192
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:49,729
Keep the pack.

193
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:52,509
Yeah, so l was in the plant in '39.

194
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:57,540
l was at Monarch tooling propeller
shafts. What are the chances?

195
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:01,749
You and me a hundred miles apart,
working at the same job.

196
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:05,635
-Hey, Malark! We're waiting on you.
-Yeah, l'm coming.

197
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:08,240
l gotta run.
l'll see you around.

198
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,468
Yeah, see you around.

199
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,733
Zigaretten?

200
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,362
Here you go.

201
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,356
Danke.

202
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,518
Danke.

203
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,799
Thank you.

204
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:52,531
Shit.

205
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,998
Easy Company?

206
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,141
Easy?

207
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,876
Hey, any of you guys know
where Easy Company is?

208
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,326
-You seen Lt. Meehan?
-No, not yet.

209
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:08,441
Well, Maj. Strayer wants
Easy Company's CO up front.

210
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,847
-That means you, Dick.
-Come on.

211
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,910
Son of a bitch.

212
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,882
Hey, Malark, where's the best chow?

213
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,479
ln Berlin.

214
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,555
-Let's round them up.
-Okay. Get them.

215
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,512
-And the MGs?
-l'd say around here, sir.

216
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,030
But l can't be sure.

217
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:39,229
There's Kraut 88s. Ahead
and to the right about 300 yards.

218
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,309
Through the gardens. They're
between us and Causeway 2.

219
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:45,955
Firing on the boys landing at Utah.

220
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:48,223
-Can Easy handle it?
-Yes, sir.

221
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:52,318
My guess is, they're doing
some terrible damage there.

222
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:56,503
Does the major know we
only have 1 2 Easy Company men?

223
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,622
No.

224
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:03,101
The 88s we've heard
have been spotted in a field. . .

225
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,687
. . .down the road a ways.

226
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,599
Major Strayer wants us
to take them out.

227
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:12,792
There are two guns that we know of,
firing on Utah Beach.

228
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,601
Plan on a third and a fourth. . .

229
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:19,401
. . .here and here.
The Germans are in the trenches. . .

230
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:24,353
. . .with access to the entire battery.
Machine gun covering the rear.

231
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:29,597
We establish a base of fire and move
under it with two squads of three.

232
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,664
How many Krauts
you think we're facing?

233
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:37,018
-No idea.
-No idea?

234
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:42,421
We'll take some TNT along with us.
Despite the guns.

235
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,782
-Your responsibility.
-Yes, sir.

236
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,794
Liebgott, take the first machine gun,
with Petty A-gunner.

237
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:52,882
Plesha, Hendrix, you take the other.
Who does that leave?

238
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,299
Compton, Malarkey,
Toye, Guarnere. Okay.

239
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:00,833
We'll be making the main assault.
Understood?

240
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,334
Yes, sir.

241
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,628
Let's pack it up, boys.

242
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:08,769
Shouldn't you be with
the Able Company guys?

243
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,498
See you around, Hall.

244
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:21,813
Lipton, when you see we've captured
the first gun, l want your TNT fast.

245
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,351
Yes, sir.

246
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,140
Okay. Just weapons and ammo,
drop everything else.

247
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:31,815
Got spare ammo in a pack
or a musette bag, bring it.

248
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:36,122
Lieutenant, sir? l was wondering,
you need an extra hand?

249
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:38,935
-Ain't you Sink's jeep driver?
-So?

250
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,288
Oh, shit.

251
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,548
What's your name, trooper?

252
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,559
-Lorraine, sir.
-You're with me, Lorraine.

253
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:48,001
-Compton, second squad.
-Yes, sir!

254
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,388
All right, you heard the word.
Let's move! Let's move!

255
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,158
Fire!

256
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,842
Go.

257
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:34,089
Three cannons.

258
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:43,428
Petty, we've got enfilading fire.

259
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,700
All right, let's go. Stay down.

260
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:04,078
MG42s. l'll draw fire to the right of
the truck. Take two men and hit them. . .

261
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,984
. . .from the left. Go.

262
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:07,861
Right.

263
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,781
Take Ranney, envelop right, give
covering fire. Lorraine, machine gun.

264
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:20,541
Don't give away your position early.

265
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:24,177
l want TNT as soon as we've
captured the first gun.

266
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,641
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

267
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,167
Go.

268
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:54,112
l can't see nothing.

269
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,092
Come on, Buck.

270
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,495

Fuck! My ass!

275
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,623
Sorry, sir.

276
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,756
Jesus Christ!

277
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:57,607
Fucking jeep jockey.

278
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:02,563
Shit! l'm sorry, sir.

One lucky bastard, Joe.

284

Guarnere! Malarkey! Lorraine!
Secure that gun!

285

290
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:06,100
-Can you make it back yourself?
-Yes.

291
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,132
Let's move out.

307
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,419
-There's the second gun.
-Grenades first.

308
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,530
-Then keep going. Go!
-Right.

309
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:26,035
Okay.

-Compton!
-All right. Cover for me.

316
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,668
They're so confused,
they're firing on the third gun!

317
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:06,466
Better blow this
before they realize it.

318
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,585
-l'm gonna find Lipton.
-All right. Toye! Cover the lieutenant!

319
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,439
-One of the dead Krauts has a Luger!
-So?

320
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,234
Keep your head low, Petty.
Move it!

321
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:25,190
-Have a little suppressing fire!
-Jesus Christ!

322
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,836
Malarkey!

323
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,476
-Now you stop firing?
-Stay low!

324
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:34,771
-Shit.
-Christ, they must think he's a medic.

325
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,106
He's gonna need a damn medic.

326
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,514
Okay, okay, okay.

327
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,739
Malarkey!

328
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:46,449
-Stay low!
-What the hell's he doing?

329
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:48,341
Come on!

330
00:36:53,464 --> 00:36:58,936
Forgot your frigging Luger? Want l
should go get it for you? Stupid mick!

331
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:05,218
-Where's Lipton with that TNT?
-Don't know, sir.

332
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,675
-You'll be all right.
-l'm sorry.

333
00:37:07,937 --> 00:37:09,256
-Don't be.
-Sarge?

334
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,869
-Yeah?
-Think this is a ticket home?

335
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:15,459
-Maybe.
-Shit, l just got here.

336
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:23,012
Hiya, Cowboy!

337
00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:26,441
Shut your fucking guinea trap,
Gonorrhea.

338
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:29,864
-He's all right.
-You got a whole Kraut platoon.

339
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,237
-More, captain.
-You need help?

340
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:36,098
l need ammo, sir!
Lots of it. And TNT!

341
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:41,099
-l got TNT, sir!
-Good job, private!

342
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:47,871
Jesus.

343
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:49,668
Hall! Ready?

344
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,568
l don't have any way
to set it off, sir.

345
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,416
Fire in the hole!

346
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:22,565
Plesha! Covering fire. Third gun here.
Lorraine, grab more potato mashers. . .

347
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:27,088
. . .and follow me!
Malarkey, Hall, you two. Go!

348
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:48,727
-Running low on ammo, sir!
-And you, Malarkey?

349
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,949
Okay.

350
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:55,438
-Got enough to take the third gun?
-We'll see! Malarkey, let's go!

351
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,910
Toye! Cover us!

352
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,321
Okay, Hall.

353
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:01,664
Keep your head down.

354
00:39:01,926 --> 00:39:05,885
Hall!
Leave your TNT!

355
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,128
Fire in the hole!

356
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:25,036
Malarkey, cover the front.
Go to the cannon. Go!

357
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:59,195
l'm looking
for Battalion Headquarters!

358
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,236
Are you kidding?
lt's back thataway!

359
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:04,564
You mean over--?

360
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,543
Fire in the hole!

361
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,302
TNT!

362
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,188
-TNT!
-Don't need it!

363
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:29,107
-What?
-Don't need it!

364
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:34,007
-Hall!
-Hall?!

365
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:37,726
Where'd he come from?

366
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:43,319
Winters!
Hester said you needed ammo!

367
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:48,287
Malarkey!
As much as you can for everyone.

368
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,694
Mind if D Company takes
a shot at the next gun?

369
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,792
-All yours!
-Let's go, Dog Company!

370
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,834
-Let's get them, D Company!
-Compton!

371
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:02,015
-Who is that, Speirs?
-Out! Get out!

372
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,943
What's he doing out of the trench?

373
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,132
-What the hell's he doing?
-Too late!

374
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,908
Oh, Jesus.

375
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:21,216
Sir!

376
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,149
Had a little trouble getting
through that first field.

377
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,167
-Oh, Christ.
-We need it at the next gun.

378
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:33,361
-Once it's blown, pull out. Go!
-Yes, sir.

379
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:40,236
Compton, police them both, then
pull out! Lorraine! Toye! Move out!

380
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:50,985
Move out! Move out! Move it out!

381
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:52,456
MGs first.

382
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:56,074
Fall back to your original positions.

383
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,104
Everyone else,
maintain your base of fire.

384
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:08,404
Okay! Back to battalion! Go! Go!

385
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:23,844
They were 1 05s. We disabled them
and pulled out. There's maybe. . .

386
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,567
. . .40 Krauts manning three
MG42s to the rear.

387
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,678
-Hey, Pop.
-Coming through!

388
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:32,803
-Forty?
-Yes, sir.

389
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,563
We killed maybe
around 20, so. . .

390
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:38,237
. . .probably there's 40 left.

391
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:43,193
l think we need artillery or maybe
mortars might do the job.

392
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,504
-Going my way?
-Sure.

393
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,077
Sir.

394
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:04,961
Careful, don't hurt yourself.

395
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:09,003
-Nice ride you got here, Nix.
-Straight from Utah Beach.

396
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,776
We should put them to work
before they're missed.

397
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:22,743
2nd Battalion had
secured Sainte-Marie-du-Mont.

398
00:43:23,062 --> 00:43:28,261
Elements of the 4th Division began
to move men and material inland.

399
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:35,943
The 1 01st Airborne, including Easy
Company, was scattered over Normandy.

400
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:41,683
Success of the invasion was uncertain.
We had an hour to rest and find food...

401
00:43:42,081 --> 00:43:46,677
...before we had to move south
and secure the town of Culoville.

402
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:54,253
-l don't wanna die in this truck.
-You're stepping on my legs!

403
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:58,711
-Jesus, let me out of here.
-Light. Light discipline.

404
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:00,967
Guarnere, close that flap.

405
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:04,137
Let the Krauts cook
their own goddamn food.

406
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:06,643
-How we doing, Malark?
-Good.

407
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:07,886
-Good?
-Yeah.

408
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:10,382
The lrish don't know how to cook.

409
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:15,520
lf you have a reservation someplace
else, l'd be happy to go with you.

410
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:18,818
-Thank you.
-Shit.

411
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:27,065
Jesus Christ, give me some air.

412
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,983
Oh, God.

413
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,751
-Evening.
-Hello, sir.

414
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:43,291
-Something die in here?
-Yeah, Malarkey's ass.

415
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:48,845
-Any word on Lieutenant Meehan, sir?
-No, not yet.

416
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:54,559
Don't that make you our
commanding officer, sir?

417
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:56,580
Yeah, it does.

418
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,443
-Sir.
-Joe, the lieutenant don't drink.

419
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,425
lt's been a day of firsts.

420
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:16,087
Don't you think, Guarnere?

421
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:21,654
Yes, sir.

422
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:24,710
Carry on.

423
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,572
-Night, sir.
-Good night.

424
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,722
-Oh, sergeant?
-Sir.

425
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:33,014
l'm not a Quaker.

426
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:39,259
-He's probably a Mennonite.
-What's a Mennonite?

427
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,849
Hey!

428
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,968
Dick!

429
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:53,156
You know that map you found?
lt had every Kraut gun in Normandy.

430
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,367
Here.

431
00:45:58,968 --> 00:46:01,562
Don't ever get a cat.

432
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:04,154
What's on your mind?

433
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:07,025
l lost a man today.

434
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:08,708
Hall.

435
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:12,485
Thanks.
A John Hall. New Yorker.

436
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:15,204
Got killed today at Brecourt.

437
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:18,635
-l never knew him.
-Yeah, you did.

438
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:23,019
Radio op. 506th basketball team,
Able Company.

439
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,696
He was a good man.

440
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:31,266
Man.
Not even old enough to buy a beer.

441
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:38,063
Not hungry.

442
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,658
Hey, Dick.

443
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:45,146
l sent that map up to Division.

444
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:48,343
l think it's gonna do some good.

445
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:34,753
That night I thanked God for
seeing me through that day of days.

446
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:38,856
And prayed I would make
it through D + 1.

447
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:43,686
And if somehow I managed
to get home again...

448
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:46,951
...I promised God and myself...

449
00:47:47,243 --> 00:47:50,872
... that I would find
a quiet piece of land someplace...

450
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:55,039
...and spend
the rest of my life in peace.
