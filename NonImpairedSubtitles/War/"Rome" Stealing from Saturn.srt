Rome

4
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,430
The day was hot,

5
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,190
But the night turns
chilly fast,it seems,

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,830
- For the time of year.
- Day after toow,
we shall be in capua

7
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,080
And you will sleep
in a good warm house.

8
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,750
Though goatskin
has its virtues.

9
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,660
Here we are,refugees
in our own land.

10
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,720
We are not refees.
We are maneuvering.

11
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,180
As you say,
here we are maneuvering,

12
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,140
While the tyrant sits
in rome.

13
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,510
Yes,in my tent,
i sleep sound and deep as a child.

14
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,210
- Though perhaps not tonight.
He'll   soon enough.

15
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,300
Quintus has a knack
for this kind of thing.

16
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,700
Well,i hope so.

17
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,690
Your son quintus,
i did not know he was with us.

18
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,130
Arrived this morning
from brindisi.

19
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Ah,that's better.

20
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,650
Screaming makes poor sauce,
i find.

21
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,940
Quintus has
his faults,

22
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,040
But he is a lawer

23
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,840
A father cannot ask more.

24
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,140
I've never heard
nor thought otherwise.

25
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,790
The dog confessed at last.

26
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,370
Blood on your face
wash yourself.

27
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,060
Where is durio?
Where is the gold?

28
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,560
He killed durio
as you suspected.

29
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,230
And they took the gold
north on the via flaminia,

30
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,910
Ran slap into
caesar's scouts.

31
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,300
Pair of romans,
20 head of ubian.

32
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,180
Too many for our boys.

33
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,240
They ran,the filth
that they are.

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,950
Left the gold
to the scouts.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,640
Can't be so.
I've heard from
this last hour.

36
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,300
Caesar has not
got the gold.

37
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,290
My man volpe always
gets the truth,father.

38
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,320
If caesar does not have it,
then his scouts must have
kept it for themselves.

39
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,320
- Go find these scouts.
- I will.

40
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,570
Now!

41
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,990
You see,
the tide turns already.

42
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,890
Without the gold,
caesar will find rome

43
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,570
Little harder
to subdue.

44
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,960
Without the gold,we're not
ve well placed,either.

45
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,330
Without gold,
he will have to use violence.

46
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,220
Once he starts
spilling blood,

47
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,220
The people will turn
on him with a vengeance.

48
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,630
Without the people,
he has nothing.

49
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,360
"Martial law
is in effect

50
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,190
For the safety
of all citizens.

51
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,520
Groups of more than
three men

52
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,150
Shall not congregate
in public spaces.

53
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,210
A curfew is in effect.

54
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,800
Any person found
on the street after dark

55
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,630
Will be subject
to summary judgment.

56
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,910
Long live
general gaius julius caesar,

57
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,980
Savior of our republic."

58
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,900
Order?? Halt!

59
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,160
Jupiter optimus maximus.

60
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,980
Jupiter optimus maximus.

61
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,500
Jupiter optimus maximus.

62
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,390
Jupiter optimus maximus.

63
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,410
Jupiter optimus maximus.

64
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,160
Jupiter optimus maximus.
Jupiter optimus maximus.

65
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,200
Name yourself,citizen.

66
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,450
Gaius of the julii,

67
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,810
- Called caesar.
- Speak then.

68
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,990
I humbly ask that
auguries be taken

69
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,340
That rome might know

70
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,060
That the gods favor
my actions.

71
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,810
You've entered the city
der unms.

72
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,650
I must warn you
that seldom augurs well.

73
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,020
The gods know
my intentions
are peaceful.

74
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,860
The people must
know it also.

75
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,480
So be it.

76
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,840
Auguries will be taken
on the first clean morning.

77
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,420
X

78
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,710
- How be,paisan?
- Miserable.

79
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,860
Slave of a rebel.

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,210
A successful rebel
at least.

81
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,150
The jury's still out.
And you,my child?

82
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,860
For true misery,try bondage
to a bloody-Minded woman.

83
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,110
This dinner tonight,
caesar asks no shellfish.

84
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,090
Here is a guest list.

85
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,100
I hope your lady is aware
of the honor done to her

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,960
She's very aware.

87
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,210
Caesar's hostess is first woman
of the city,in effect

88
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,780
Excepting caesar's wife.

89
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,200
Calpurnia.
Caesar requires that

90
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,300
She's still and handsome
and dignified and...no more.

91
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,400
She is a species
of statue.

92
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,540
A very fancy list
of people.

93
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,270
Every aristo and optimate
left in the city.

94
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,670
He'sot p ning
on killing them,is he?

95
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,460
I shouldn't think so.

96
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,620
My mistress doesn't
like surprises.

97
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,760
Servilia--
Why invite her?

98
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,710
Can there still be
something between them?

99
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,220
A rattled old sandal like her?
Surely not.

100
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,240
Some juice in her yet.

101
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,690
I'll not let that woman
get between me and caesar.

102
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:41,430
Why is servilia invited
to the party?

103
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,180
Servilia of the junii,
why is she invited?

104
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,570
On account of her son,
obviously.

105
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,680
For this,you wake me?

106
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,290
Of course.He needs to keep brutus
as his symbolic friend.

107
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,940
Th's all.

108
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,330
It would look ill with the
people if brutus were his enemy.

109
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,350
There's no love there.
It's just politics.

110
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,770
Dear gods,woman,
would you let me sleep?

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,560
The goat's testicles,
domina.

112
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,860
Not for me,fool,
for octavian.

113
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,440
Fetch deter.

114
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,450
Eat them while
they're warm,my dear.

115
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,040
- It puts oak
in your penis.
- I'd rather not.

116
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,970
Nonsense,you must.

117
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,260
You've been developing
a distinctly feminine anima,

118
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,940
And i do not like it.

119
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,050
I am only a boy.
It is enlytire natural--

120
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,840
When my mother's father was your age,
there was not a slave girl safe.

121
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,790
The men of the julii
are masculine men.

122
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,850
- Now do as i say and eat them.
- I will not.

123
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,790
You'll not leave
this room until you do.

124
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,970
Demeter,the banquet
this evening,no shellfish

125
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,860
And be sure the lampreys
are not overcooked.

126
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,750
Boil them long enough
to kill them,no more.

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,370
I'm waiting.

128
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,820
That's my brave boy.

129
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,610
- Brother.
- Hmm?

130
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,890
Did mother have
glabius killed?

131
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,730
Of course not.

132
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,120
You're sure?

133
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,830
Well,i cannot prove a negative
but i'm sure as can be.

134
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,250
You swear on
jupiter's stone?

135
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,100
I swear on
jupiter's stone.

136
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,980
If she did,

137
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,390
If she did kill him,

138
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,670
By the furies,i'll open
her throat with my teeth.

139
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,270
In narbo,i can buy
10 feasts for this.

140
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,930
Narbo isn't full of
corpses and soldie,rs

141
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,110
And decent people too scared
to come out of their houses.

142
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,270
No time to throw a do
if you don't mind me saying.

143
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,690
I cannot start a business
without a feast,can i?

144
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,710
Today is auspicious,
and it's perfectly safe.

145
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,690
I remember the last time
when sulla had soldiers in the city.

146
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,850
- Blood,you could paint houses with it.
- Caesar's not sulla.

147
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,150
He's declared martial law,
not to spill blood,but to keep the peace.

148
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,080
We'll see,won't we?

149
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,420
I invoke ceres and bacchus,
you'll not be dissatisfied.

150
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,920
You find me a pig,
and i'll make you
a feast,

151
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,560
In hades,if need be.

152
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,870
- And charge according.
- Musa,the oilman's wife,

153
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,070
Served whelks instead of
oysters at her womb funeral,

154
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,890
And nobody would
let her forget it.

155
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,440
Laughed at in the street.

156
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,690
Divine janus,we offer
this feast to you.

157
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,310
I humbly beg that you
will be gracious

158
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,610
And merciful
to me and my house,

159
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,520
D you will smile upon
this new business venture

160
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,780
I begin today.

161
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,240
Lucius vorenus,his honor mark
antony orders your presence.

162
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,890
- Now?
- Of course not.Next year.

163
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,280
Vorenus,my dear comrade.

164
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,640
Barely recognize you without
a bloody sword in your hand.

165
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,590
Off with you now,cato.

166
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,400
Amusing,eh?

167
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,900
To ca-.
- As you say.

168
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,270
Of course you don't all
find it amusing.

169
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,610
So...

170
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,910
How is civilian life
treating you,huh?

171
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,190
Well enough so far,
sir.

172
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,610
You know,of course,

173
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,590
I could have you nailed
to a cross for desertion.

174
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,970
I am no deserter.
My time was served.

175
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,640
I abided my sacrament.

176
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,280
It is you that...

177
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,680
It is i that what?

178
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,720
Once over the rubicon,romans are citizens,not soldiers.

179
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,550
- I could not legally do other than i did.
- Foolish.

180
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,330
- Like a priest blinded by a cowl.
- Since the founding of rome--

181
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,860
Oh,please,spare me
the founding,vorenus.

182
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,740
Things change.

183
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,180
Life is water,not stone.

184
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,260
Then i suppose
i will drown.

185
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,410
Do you not see that
your precious republic

186
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,910
Has long since died?

187
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,570
Do you not see that
caesar is trying to save
rome from ruin?

188
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,850
I do not see that.

189
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,800
Enough.

190
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,400
And at wretched trade

191
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,740
Is it you intend
to follow then?

192
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,430
Imported goods from gaul.
Slaves,truffles,wine.

193
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,660
- That sort of thing.
- A grocer?

194
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,670
An honest fighting man
like yourself

195
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,700
Counting cartons,

196
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,920
Scribbling accounts?

197
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,540
- You will swift go mad.
- That may be.

198
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,900
I need you,vorenus.

199
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,610
Caesar needs you.

200
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,130
There is no better man in the legion
none more respected by the men.

201
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,430
- We have hard fighting ahead.
- Hard fighting against romans.

202
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,900
Blood is blood.

203
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,290
Would you really have the 13th
fasten their crest without you?

204
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,550
You come back
to the legion,

205
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,070
You shall be inducted
into the evocati as a prefect.

206
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,810
Of the first grade,
with a signing bonus.

207
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,510
Say,uh...

208
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,660
10,000 sesterce.

209
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,020
I chose this path
i will follow where it leads.

210
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,640
You grieve me,vorenus.

211
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,620
You grieve me deeply.

212
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,970
Go on.
Off with you.

213
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,660
Good day,citizen.

214
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,290
Vorenus...

215
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,030
Next time i see you,
i may not be so kind.

216
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,700
What does it say?

217
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,210
It's not certain,

218
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,330
But i'd say your
secret's safe.

219
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,270
Not certain?

220
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,690
The signs are xed.

221
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,970
What good is that?

222
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,120
Tell me what it is you're hiding
and i can be more precise.

223
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,720
There's a child involved.

224
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,490
A male child?

225
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,810
The baby.

226
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,280
Never mind.
Best leave it.

227
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,550
As you please.

228
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,050
If it's any help,it does say

229
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,100
Your husband is
going to be rich.

230
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,520
Rich as croesus.

231
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,320
Well,that's something,
isn't it?

232
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,250
Thank you.

233
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,460
Good.  Done.

234
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,520
Water.

235
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,100
What did i look
like eight years ago?

236
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,520
Just the same.

237
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,850
- Eight years.
- Eight years...

238
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,210
Of leathery
gallic trollops.

239
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,710
When did he last see
a real lady,hmm?

240
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,330
And such
a beautiful one?

241
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,250
- Flowers.
- In bloom?

242
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,310
50,000 to each of
the magistrate's clerks.

243
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,340
So much?

244
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,830
I wish to buy their
allegiance outright,
not lease it.

245
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,110
Have them sign
for the money.

246
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,110
And how much for
the sub-Praetors?

247
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,670
Nil.

248
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,170
When they hear how much the
clerks got,they'll come begging.

249
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,340
And leave us penniless
without means to run
the city.

250
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,370
We must kill some
rich men and take
their money very soon,

251
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,290
Else the well
will run dry

252
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,470
Very soon.

253
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,010
An element of surprise
no doubt.

254
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,910
Later you may nag me.

255
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,440
I believe this is
appropriate.

256
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,180
Exactly right,my dear.

257
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,050
Regal,but not
excessively so.

258
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,660
Fine start to a business
this'll be if nobody comes.

259
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,360
Don't worry.
They will come.

260
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,350
Maybe i should have
waited as you said.

261
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,080
They will come.

262
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,590
And mind now,
when the cy doome,

263
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,310
Try to smile occasionally.

264
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,990
And don't bark at them.

265
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,370
S this?

266
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,580
Erastes fulmen.  Remember?
Our guest of honor.

267
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,670
Building trades,
fire insurance,olives.

268
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,940
Lucius vorenus.

269
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,000
Niobe.

270
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,310
Thank u for your coming,
honest neighbor.

271
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,390
I know it can't be easy
on such a day.

272
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,590
What's a few
soldiers,eh?

273
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,760
Wife,phyllis.

274
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,570
Please.

275
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,810
- Please sit down and take a cup of wine.
- I will.

276
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,990
Thirsty road,eh?

277
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,280
Sister.

278
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,790
All right?

279
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,400
All's right.
Don't worry.

280
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,870
- Thank you.
- This can't be little lyde surely not

281
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,180
- Long time,eh?
- Sa lucius.

282
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,710
- This is my husband,
evander pulchio.
- Evander,welcome.

283
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,120
- Honored,lucius vorenus.
- Thank you for the pig.

284
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,420
With all the shops
shut,we would have
whistled for meat.

285
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,610
Happy to be of service.

286
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,060
- Thank you so much for inviting me.
- My pleasure.

287
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,020
My pleasure,servilia.

288
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,780
I insisted you come.

289
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,440
Whatever misfortune
befalls you,

290
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,120
We're still friends,neh?

291
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,980
She has a good
cosmetics slave,
i'll grant you.

292
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,030
But a lover for caesar?
Absurd.

293
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,120
Make way for the pro-Consul
gaius julius caesar,

294
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,890
Son of venus,

295
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,690
Imperator of
the gallic legions.

296
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,900
Stand aside and open up.

297
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,790
Please,you mock me.
It's only your uncle gaius.
Lift your heads.

298
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,510
All of you,
lift your heads.

299
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,770
My dear niece.

300
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,750
Revered uncle,

301
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,770
Welcome,welcome home.

302
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,370
Servilia of the junii,
a pleasant honor it is.

303
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,290
Delightful.

304
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,750
Your pleasure is mine.

305
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,020
I am very sorry your son
is not here with you.

306
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,360
I'm sorry also.

307
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,080
I hope you will forgive
his absence.

308
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,960
He is ever your friend.

309
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,890
I understand completely.

310
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,730
Please send brutus
my best regards

311
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,630
And assure him he will
never have reason

312
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,320
To regret our friendship.

313
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,460
Regardless of where
your allegiances

314
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,370
May have lain
in the past.

315
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,740
-  Any weapons?
- None,sir.

316
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,470
- Where you coming from?
- Come from aternum,dominus.

317
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,900
- In what trade?
- Corpse collectors,
bone grinders.

318
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,290
Dead business in general.

319
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,360
You've come
to right place then.

320
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,200
What people are they?

321
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,000
Scythians,chief.
They don't speak
our language.

322
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,350
On your way then.

323
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,020
Please let me in!

324
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,010
You!

325
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,720
Tell your brutes to stay away
from decent women.

326
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,530
I'll do that.

327
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,110
Fine bit of plunder and rapine
you made off thebloo gauls

328
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,470
- I bet.
- I'll not complain.

329
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,570
Handy to have cash
in these uncertain times.

330
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,310
A man can't flee with
his house and fields

331
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,880
If he's chosen
the wrong side.

332
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,840
True.

333
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,590
Who do you reckon will
come out on top?

334
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,430
It's hard to say.

335
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,380
You'll be hoping it'll be
your man though,eh?

336
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,620
If you mean caesar,
he's not my man anymore.

337
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,600
So your spoils,

338
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,990
You'll be lending
the proceeds,i expect.

339
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,600
I won't.

340
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,400
I am buying back this
insula so i'll not
have spare cash.

341
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,820
I plan to take over
the trading space for
an import business.

342
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,760
- Slaves mostly.
- Slaves?

343
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,360
Well,listen,

344
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,630
I have friends,

345
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,240
Bona friends.

346
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,060
If you want any help,
you come to me,eh?

347
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,350
More wine here,sweetie.

348
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,260
There are even
those unwise men

349
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,840
Who say thathite a wird
in the southern quadrant

350
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,090
Is neither indicant
nor negation.

351
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,880
Such are the barbarous
innovations of our day.

352
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,620
Barbarous.

353
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,390
We might as well
be syrian.

354
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,960
- Point to pommel,i agree.
- Syrians,indeed.

355
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,450
Scythians even.

356
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,220
As chief augur,
i'm gratified to
hear you say so.

357
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,950
It was heard you are a man
of modish opinion.

358
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,710
Oh,that's pure scandal.

359
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,690
I believe that religion
is the province of our
worthy priests.

360
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,330
Mere soldiers like myself
best not interfere.

361
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,240
That's very gratifying.

362
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,530
Octavian,don't sit there
like a prole.

363
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,360
- Say something witty.
- I have nothing such to say.

364
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,830
U knyo cannot
talk small,mother.

365
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,610
You then.

366
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,140
Some poetry,neh?

367
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,070
She can rattle off pages
of the stuff.

368
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,230
"Easy it is to go
down into hell.

369
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,850
The gates of death
are ever open.

370
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,990
To climb back out again,
that's the difficulty."

371
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,080
It's a touch dark,
my love,but never mind.

372
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,230
She lost herband,
you know.

373
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,010
Best get your sister gone.

374
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,910
I told you it was
a mistake to let her come.

375
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,850
I had to let her come.
It would look odd if she wasn't here

376
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,580
Speak to evander,
will you?

377
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,450
Butcher man,time
to take your wife home.

378
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,720
She doesn't want to go.

379
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,320
Best make her
go then,eh?

380
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,050
- Time to go.
- Not yet.

381
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,700
- I like it here.
- Time to go.

382
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,820
- Let me go,my love.
- Lyde,please.

383
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,460
Let me go

384
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,180
Or i'll tell
our brave soldier
such a good tale.

385
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,380
Kill us all?
Is that what you want?

386
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,210
I love you.
Why don't u love me?

387
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,230
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

388
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,300
- Lyde,please.
- I'm your wife.

389
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,090
We had an agreement!
You vowed to persephone.

390
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,610
You vowed you would
hold your peace!

391
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,350
- Have i not held my peace?
- If my husband--

392
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:45,320
Your husband is
a blind fool!

393
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,100
Did you hear me?
He's a blind fool!

394
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,830
Get off me!
Get off me!

395
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,520
Get off me!

396
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,310
Wife?

397
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,130
Caecilia.

398
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,580
Tell me,

399
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,580
How is caecilia?

400
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,090
- She's healthy,
i thank you.
- Good.

401
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,930
I recall i forgot
her last birthday.

402
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,140
- Her birthday?
- Remiss of me,i know.

403
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,950
Perhaps she would forgive
my rudeness were i to
send  her a gift.

404
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,670
Really,
that's not necessary.

405
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,150
Hard to find the right
gift for a woman,neh?

406
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,080
What one loves,
another scorns.

407
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,600
Perhaps she would accept
some money.

408
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,690
There's an idea.

409
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,850
100,000 sesterce,say?

410
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,230
Oh,that's very kind
of you.

411
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,560
I'm afraid my wife is
a woman of expensive tastes.

412
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,130
The best women
often are.

413
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,660
150,000.

414
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,180
She would dress her slaves
in silk if i would let her.

415
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:18,810
She eats oysters
for breakfast daily.

416
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:25,400
On oysters.

417
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,720
200,000.

418
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,200
That is a very generous,
and i may say,

419
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,070
Appropriate gift.

420
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,440
She would be under great
obligation to you.

421
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,600
To think well of me would
be her only obligation.

422
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,750
She's always
thought well of you.

423
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:47,790
It is not unethical
she continue to do so.

424
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,160
We understand
each other.

425
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,990
Make a note of it.

426
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,470
200 to the chief augur.

427
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,650
Thinks he's midas,
the loon.

428
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,760
We'll go to the priests of
janus tomorrow first thing,

429
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,890
And have the day absolved.
It's costly,but--

430
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,040
An omen is an omen.
And this is as bad
as they come.

431
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,740
No point throwing
money at it.

432
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,970
Your sister and her
husband can never
come here again.

433
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,410
As you say.

434
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,930
Must not bend.

435
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,330
Salve, pleb.

436
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,020
Centurion lucius vorenus?

437
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,410
Who asks?

438
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,770
His honor quintus pompey.

439
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,890
You best have good reason
for this insult.

440
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,880
Tell me where the gold is,
and quick about it,dog.

441
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,450
What gold?
Speak sense.

442
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,360
- Sense enough?
- Not near.

443
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:02,240
- I ask again,what gold?
- Stubborn is he?

444
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,730
This trollop we can
assume is your wife.

445
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,780
Hold her.

446
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,400
I cannot speak
what i do not know.

447
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,820
I do not know of any gold.

448
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,970
You know very well
i seek the treasury gold

449
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,220
You took
from my father's men.

450
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,360
I took no gold
from any man.
You are misinformed.

451
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,570
Misinformed.

452
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,350
You are not chief
of scouts 13th legion?

453
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,660
I was.

454
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,950
And last week,did you
not stop a grain wagon

455
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,270
- On the via flaminia?
- We did.

456
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:46,590
And left the wagon.

457
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,930
You never thought
to linsiook ?

458
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,060
There was no time.
We had orders.

459
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,220
Your wags ston il there
for all i know.

460
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,970
Lies.  Cut her.

461
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,710
Come on,give it to me!

462
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,650
Boys,a clamor for my
beloved friend lucius.

463
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,570
Why so glum and gloomy?

464
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,320
Who's this then?

465
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,210
His noble honor quintus pompey,\commander of tyrrhenian fleet.

466
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,740
Neptune's scourge.

467
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,620
Oh,neptune's scourge.

468
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,810
Looking for a wagon
of treasury gold.

469
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,570
Treasury gold?

470
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,820
How exciting!

471
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,180
Do not test
my patience,peasant.

472
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,650
You be off now,
short ass.

473
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,120
Take these scum
with you.

474
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,870
The way i see it,

475
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,690
We put little quintus here
in the tiber right off,

476
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,580
Get us a wagon,sneak out
to where the gold's buried.

477
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,930
Dig it up,ride like
zephyrus for the coast,

478
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,100
- And get
he first tide for spain.
- I'm trying to think.

479
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,370
- What was wrong with that?
- What's wrong?

480
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,000
Even if it were not
a monstrous n

481
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,190
To steal sacred property
of rome...

482
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,750
- I wasn't to know,was i?
- ...you then ride through
the streets on a litter,

483
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,820
Shouting and singing
and broadcasting your theft

484
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,670
To all and sundry.

485
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,950
By sunrise,everyone in
rome will know what you
did and where you are.

486
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,350
Here,in my house.

487
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,770
So what's to be done then?

488
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,020
You will have to
give it back.

489
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,810
If you go direct
to caesar now,

490
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,510
Bring him pompey's son
as a sweetener,he might
show mercy.

491
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,820
Give it back?
I don't think so.

492
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,540
That's not advice.
That's an order.

493
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,940
Here's me come to share
a god-Sent g-Ift-

494
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,540
An order!

495
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,860
Damn you.
My homs invaded

496
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,620
And my wife near killed
on your account.

497
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,660
All right.

498
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,990
All right.

499
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,520
But you'll come
with me though,eh?

500
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,810
This is your mess.
You get yourself out of it.

501
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,560
Fine then.

502
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,630
I'll be off then.

503
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,350
Good luck to you,si

504
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,150
Forgive me.  I will try
to return swiftly.

505
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,750
Excuse me,my dear.

506
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,140
Pullo,you scoundrel.

507
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,020
What have you done now?

508
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,560
Your honor,uh...

509
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,790
- Lucius vorenus said i
should come to you and--
- Easy,soldier.

510
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,010
Who is this?

511
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,130
Quintus,son of pompey.

512
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,880
So it is!

513
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,170
Quintus,my old cock,

514
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,760
How good to see you so.

515
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,530
Explain.

516
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,830
Well,it's like this,
your honor.

517
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,740
He,this one
come to find the gold.

518
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,100
What gold?

519
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,170
The gold that pompey's boys
stole from the treasury,sir.

520
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
Pompey does not have it?

521
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,580
He doesn't,sir.

522
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,390
Now i meant no disrespect,

523
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,950
And had i known the gold
was from the treasury,

524
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,560
I'd not have touched it.
But there was this
girl here,sir--

525
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,770
Never mind the girl.
To teak sphe point.

526
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,510
Where is the gold?

527
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,780
It's all safe,sir.

528
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,720
I buried it
deep in the woods

529
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,910
A couple miles
from the flaminian gate.

530
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,450
Thank you.

531
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,360
You will pay for this!

532
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,160
- Surely you can do
better than that.
- Leave him be.

533
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,050
I'm sorry we meet
like this,quintus.

534
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,840
I have only deep
respect for your
father and his family.

535
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,230
Kiss my ass,
yoaitou trus dog.

536
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,290
Elegant little fellow,
isn't he?

537
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,440
You need not fear.
Your life is yours still.

538
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,230
I'm sending you back
to your father

539
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,490
- With an offer of truce.
- A truce?

540
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,670
Quiet.

541
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,620
Are you run mad?

542
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,550
Be quiet

543
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,510
An offer of equable truce
on good terms.

544
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,870
If violence continues,

545
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,530
It will not be my doing,
but that of your father
and his allies.

546
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,400
My father needs no truce.

547
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,720
Two full moons will see you
on a spike in the forum.

548
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,900
- You wretch!
- Put him on a horse.

549
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,500
You naughty woman.

550
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,010
Never told me caesar had
such a passion for you.

551
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,560
Not so.

552
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,720
I saw the way
he looked at you.

553
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,600
Like the bull that
tupped europa.

554
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,860
I can't blame him.

555
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,120
Such...

556
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,350
Beauty.

557
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,670
Such beauty.

558
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,030
Too kind.

559
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,470
Far too kind.

560
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,340
Caesar has no
inclination to me.

561
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,980
Nor i to him.

562
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,820
And such modesty.

563
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,020
Is she not beautiful,
calpurnia?

564
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,670
She has none
of the goatishness

565
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,830
One normally sees
in women her age.

566
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,590
She has some secret
potion perhaps.

567
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,620
You are attempting levity,
i believe.

568
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,260
Forgive me if i do not indulge
in such talk.

569
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,170
You're sure to regret
letting that one live.

570
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:44,290
He hthere's many left undead
spiri'll regret before i'm done.

571
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,570
Take pullo
and retrieve the gold.

572
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,030
Legionary pullo.

573
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,600
You are a thief.

574
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,440
A foolish,
incompetent thief.

575
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,750
But you have served
us well in the past.

576
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,860
So we will pretend your
foolishness ispecies
of honesty,

577
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,900
And let you go unpunished.

578
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,810
In fact,i think we
shall reward you.

579
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,110
I do not like to quarrel
with fortune,

580
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,850
And clearly she's
taken you for a pet.

581
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,460
When you find the trove,
give him 100 gold pieces.

582
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,450
Thank you,sir.

583
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,860
As you wish.

584
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,980
By the by,antony,
r question
my judgment

585
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,740
In the presence
of our enemies.

586
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,540
You have a good memory,
so you will remember that.

587
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,970
- I will remember.
- Dismissed.

588
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,360
Men,horses!

589
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,190
- Quick about it!
- Forward!

590
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,000
Why do you frown,
little owl?

591
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,940
Marc antony speaks sense.

592
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,780
Truce now does not seem
tactically correct.

593
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,910
Depends on terms.

594
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,070
You offer terms that
pompey cannot accept

595
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,410
But cicero
and the senate can.

596
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,220
Swift--

597
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,340
Hold up,dominus,
there's people watching.

598
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,700
Sir,take us somewhere
none can see us.

599
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,560
What's in him?
Is he poisoned?

600
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,400
He has the morbus
comitialis. It will
pass in a moment.

601
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,970
Please,dominus,
shut the door.

602
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,140
Should not.

603
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,400
At all costs,he cannot
have his affliction known.

604
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,840
No one will follow a man

605
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,750
Whom apollo hacursed
with the morbus.

606
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,380
Vow to orc,
us never speak ofs.

607
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,530
Are you quite well,
husband?

608
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,140
Nothing serious.

609
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,250
Come.

610
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,590
Atia,i'm growing tired.
I think we shall leave you.

611
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,080
Oh,well.

612
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:50,650
- As you wish,of course.
- Good night,my dear.

613
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,120
Did you have
a pleasant evening?

614
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:00,890
I did.

615
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,600
Your niece atia
is most polite,

616
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,600
And the chief augur
made many edifying
remarks on religion.

617
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,830
I regret i will
not be coming home
with you immediately.

618
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,950
Business at night?
It is not proper..

619
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,010
Not proper,but necessary.
I have to be ready
to leave the city

620
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,020
And pursue pompey as soon
as he refuses truce.

621
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,220
He will refuse?

622
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,990
I believe so.

623
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,630
What's wrong,mother?

624
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,540
I'm alone.

625
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,960
I'm all alone.

626
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,310
- What does he say?
- Ridiculous!

627
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,810
- What does he say?
- Nothing.

628
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,220
Nothing worth repeating.

629
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,590
But he offers a truce.

630
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,610
On what terms?

631
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,720
Truce with that scum?
Are you women?

632
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,560
I'll have them raped
by dogs!

633
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,610
Silence.
Get out!

634
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,650
Excuse him.
He's been ill-Used.

635
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:43,500
But caesar does not ask
for so much.

636
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,840
- Legal immunity.
Mutual disarmament.
- I must disarm?  I?

637
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,190
I am lawful consul of rome.
He is a criminal.

638
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,530
There is nothing mutual
in it.

639
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,130
He may be a criminal,
but he has the city.

640
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:58,250
-  We must deal with facts.
- Fact is,he is a traitor!

641
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,360
Let us be fair.

642
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,250
Consul,he has been
remarkably peaceable.

643
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,670
He has not killed
your allies or violated
your property.

644
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,650
We should look
on this offer seriously.

645
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:13,650
Do you not see
his stratagem?

646
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,600
He is trying to drive
a wedge between us.

647
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,680
- A truce would buy
us time at least.
- Quintus is right!

648
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,100
You are women!

649
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,530
Fools.

650
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,910
Tell me you love him.

651
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,810
Tell me that
and i will go away,

652
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,660
And i will never
come back.

653
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:51,350
I love him.

654
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:55,280
On the souls
of my children,
i love him.

655
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,330
Titus pullo,what joy!

656
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:05,170
- They let you go alive then?
- They did.

657
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,960
Where's vorenus?

658
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,120
He's gone to make amends
at the shrine of janus.

659
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:15,580
You know evander pulchio,
my brother-In-Law,
my sister's husband.

660
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,670
Evander,you say?

661
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,090
Good health,soldier.

662
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,100
And you.

663
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,530
Will you take water?

664
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,830
- I will.
- Sit you down.

665
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:50,330
T jupiter,graciously
give us clear signs

666
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,800
Within the bounds
i have traced.

667
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,980
The auguries are good.

668
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:35,890
