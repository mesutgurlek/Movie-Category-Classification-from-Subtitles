1
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,400
<b><i>Solomon, Prophet and the King, has
asked God to give him an ideal kingdom...</i></b>

2
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,600
<b><i>which has never been given to anybody
before! He is told to prepare himself and...</i></b>

3
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,800
<b><i>his subjects with evil and unearthly
creatures that haunt the men!</i></b>

4
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Oh Devils! Oh The powerful!
Oh The Mithraic ones!

5
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Oh Hidden Governers of the
World of Darkness!

6
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Conquer the weak body of foes, and...

7
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
swallow their souls, swallow them!

8
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Swallow them!

9
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Summoning the One who has not bowed down,...

10
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
and will never do!

11
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,400
His servants, I am summoning!

12
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I am summoning!

13
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
No!

14
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
Around 3000 years ago,
Almighty God had chosen...

15
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,200
a virtuous man to be His prophet...

16
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
and lead the children of Israel
in the way of truth and simplicity.

17
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,200
He selected Solomon, the Son, David.

18
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Welcome!

19
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Are the rest shyer than you?

20
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Sit by me!

21
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
- Hello!
- Hello!

22
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
Welcome my darlings

23
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Everybody says we should not
disturb you when you are alone!

24
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
No, you are not disturbing me

25
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Come and sit with me

26
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,200
When I was about your age,

27
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
I used to accompany my
Father David the Prophet

28
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,800
To sit on this rock

29
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He would sing psalms verses
with his pleasant voice,

30
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And the mountains and birds
would sing along with him

31
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Do the birds talk to you as well?

32
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Birds?

33
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Brother, all the people are ready.

34
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Is this our Majesty the King who is coming?

35
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Greetings to Solomon, the prophet!

36
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Greetings to the sons of David the prophet!

37
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Welcome your Excellency Solomon!

38
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Since you prayed for us last year,
the crops have been increased!

39
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
won't the messenger of God
pray to start the harvest?

40
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
God likes the day very much

41
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,400
The day that everybody
harvest what he has planted,

42
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
and each will gain what she/he has invested

43
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Oh Lord!

44
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Bestow your blessing on this land,

45
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
we worship you, the one and only God

46
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Now by name of GOD Almighty, let us begin!

47
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Bravo!

48
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,600
Greetings!

49
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Greetings to!

50
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
- My honorable Solomon!
- Very kind of you...

51
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
My beloved Miriam!
Why did you come all this way?

52
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
My heart longed for you!

53
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,800
These past years have been full
of favors and blessings

54
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
These are all our God's Grace

55
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
What is happening?

56
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Whatever it is, it's right here!

57
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Raise the sun up for me!

58
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Jerusalem

59
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,200
We tried to set up God's
intended kingom in this territory

60
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,400
To govern kindly as to satisfy him!

61
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then what are these visions
that he is showing me!/?

62
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
What does God direct me to do?

63
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,200
In comparison to your kingdom
at the end of the world,

64
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Mine is like a dead corpse,
without any soul!

65
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Oh God,

66
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
My kingdom is so inferior to
yours at the end of time!

67
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
Solomon!

68
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,900
We have granted you many times
kind graces and blessings

69
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,300
Remember the time when we extended

70
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,800
the wisdom of your father David and yours,

71
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and favored you over many
of the devoted worshippers

72
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
When we granted you the book,

73
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
the Devine judgment,
the prophet Hood

74
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,100
The time we sent you Revelations,
and elected you as our messenger

75
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,400
be aware that many people
have not accepted our guidance,

76
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
and they are following Satan!

77
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,700
Oh God, Most merciful,
then grant me that kingdom,

78
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,900
That promised paradise,

79
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,100
that won't be given to anyone

80
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,400
until the worlds
come to an end!

81
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Call all the heads of the tribes,
and all the leaders of the country

82
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,400
to come Jerusalem as soon as posible!

83
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
We are entering a most difficult adventure,

84
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,400
So terrifying!

85
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
His Highness Yazar!

86
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
We are honored to visit Jerusalem's
great wise man once again!

87
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Will his highness accompany us to the King?

88
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,700
Allmighty God, in a vision,
showed me the weakness of my kingdom

89
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,400
Therefore I asked him to transcend
my kingdom,

90
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
and his will is on doing so!

91
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
transcend your kingdom?

92
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,199
To create a heaven on earth,
like at the end of the world

93
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
which is full of blessings!

94
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
The Promised Land!

95
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
For which the children of Israel
came here for,

96
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,400
but never saw any sign of it!

97
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,600
As long as there is evil and
wickedness in this world,

98
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,000
that godly heaven will not appear!

99
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,200
We will have to cross over
terrible dangers to reach it

100
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
What dangers, master Solomon?

101
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,100
the danger of the Jinns and Satan!

102
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,700
We don't understand what you mean!

103
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,600
What is supposed to happen?

104
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,200
When Adam was descended to the earth,

105
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
worlds seperated from each other

106
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Soon some will join again!

107
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,300
The Jinns and Satans which are now
living in their world,

108
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,100
will become dense,

109
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
and will get close to us,
closer and closer!

110
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
And ultimately they will materialize
and enter our world!

111
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,800
That paradise will not appear unless,

112
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,200
the enemies of humanity are
destroyed in a bloody war?

113
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
What do you mean? Which kingdom?

114
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Which war? Are you mocking us?

115
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
I'm very serious.

116
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's why I have invited you from
different places of the country

117
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,599
And what do you want from us?

118
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Help me to control this coming disaster

119
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,400
Master Solomon,
how do you justify your statements?

120
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Which one of our religious
leaders has approved?

121
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,799
such interpretation of this Torah/law?

122
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I told you that I asked God,
and he...

123
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,300
and he accepted your request!

124
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,200
Is there anyone else beside yourself who

125
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,800
witnessed your conversation with God?

126
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,700
How do we know that this is not made up
by your imagination?

127
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
You all know about

128
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
the prophetic mission of our
father David the prophet and

129
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Our brother Solomon and you know very well

130
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
what favors god has bestowed on them!

131
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,300
We know nothing!

132
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,800
Those rumors about their miracles,

133
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
has never been proven to us
Jewish leader,

134
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
and we have never seen a firm reason
for their prophet hood!

135
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
But I am saying that all of
these talks are because...

136
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,600
You are trying to hide the
weakness of your government!

137
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
You call yourself a king?

138
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So all the responsibilities of whatever
might happen is up to you!

139
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Wouldn't it be better to let us
share in governing the country?

140
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Then you wouldn't be forced
to make up such strange tales,

141
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,600
and expect us to summon our tribes
for an imaginary war?

142
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Are you not the one who, like david,

143
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
took away the leadership of
the Israelites from us

144
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Spread his book of psalms,

145
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
and banished our books
from among people?

146
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,600
You even keep the Ark of the Covenant
for yourself!

147
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
While we, the Jewish scolars,

148
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
are the righteous heirs to
Moses possessions!

149
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Aren't you ashamed, young man,
of our white hair and old age?

150
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,200
none of God's messengers, Noah,
Abraham, Joseph, Moses,

151
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
did claim such a thing!

152
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Those men of God never said that

153
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,000
that they are able to establish God's
kingdom on earth,

154
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,600
or to launch an attack against
invisible devils!

155
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,300
They innocently attended to the
advancement of religion,

156
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,900
and the worship of God, and made
so many self sacrifices!

157
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,200
That's right! That's right! It is so!

158
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,900
When his father David proclaimed
a 9 year child as his successor

159
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,100
We objected that a king
needs experience! Experience!

160
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Return back to your towns,
noble children of Israel!

161
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Your Excellencies! Your Excellencies!

162
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Your Excellencies!

163
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Where do you prepare?
This should solve the situation!

164
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,800
Shy, son of Moared!

165
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Slave you forgotten your tribe the Ephraim
to take Solomon's side?

166
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,600
Tell the other officers as well

167
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,800
How much longer do they want to
act against their own tribes?

168
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,200
We have to take this matter
into our own hands!

169
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Dear men, you have to travel to different
towns and deliver my message!

170
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Brother, they will listen to
their chiefs, not to us!

171
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
There is no other choice!
Will you help me?

172
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,500
We are with you all the way!

173
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,700
We are ready for the messenger of
God's orders!

174
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Up to the end!

175
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Jerusalem!

176
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,400
The culminating point of the trouble!

177
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Therefore, my brother Absalom,
you stay at the capital and protect!

178
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,000
Sir Juab,

179
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
You and your son with the troops
in your command, go to Zebulum

180
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,600
Yes, my Lord

181
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
This people fought in my father's wars,

182
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
they will hopefully help us again this time

183
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Sir Yashbaom, you protect the
southern parts of the country

184
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Adonia, you should go east to Ariha

185
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,700
I sense that the first troubles
may start there!

186
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Are you taking all the forces
out of Jerusalem, your Honor?

187
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,900
There is no other choice!

188
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Take enough soldiers along with you

189
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,300
they will help to keep things in control!

190
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,900
HEBRON

191
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,900
ARIHA

192
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
Adonia?

193
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,400
ZEBULUN

194
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Sir Juab, waging war again

195
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I have come to meet with
my old war comrades

196
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,000
Will you accept us?

197
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,700
You are welcome!

198
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,900
Oh people, we are on the verge
of a tremendous trial!

199
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Doorways will be opened for
Jinns Satans to enter our world!

200
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Up to now they were able to tempt humans,

201
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
but from now they will affect us directly!

202
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,200
All evil and impurities will storm us,

203
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
much stronger and more forceful than it

204
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
has ever been experienced by mankind!

205
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Beware that we are facing a great danger!

206
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Beware that we are facing a great danger!

207
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
But you should know that Satan's deceits

208
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,600
are not effective against man's belief

209
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Then let's be strong and purify
ourselves for our creator!

210
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
God is forgiving and merciful
to his subjects!

211
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Therefore, to be safe from the
harmful deceptions of Satan,

212
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,400
We invite you to virtue, and to
obey the messenger of God!

213
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Virtue and obedience of the messenger of God

214
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,800
That is our weapon! The only weapon!

215
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,500
ZEBULUN

216
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,900
Why didn't they come?

217
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Our wives and children have been
worried sick for the past 15 days!

218
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Where will they attack us from?

219
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,300
The sea, the forest or the mountains?

220
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Some say they are everywhere, everywhere!

221
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Jerusalem

222
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,300
Jinns and Satans do not exist at all!

223
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,700
They are fabricated by your imagination

224
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,400
They have no physical body of their own

225
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
You are the one who,

226
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,800
by committing sins, are
making them in your minds

227
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,700
What is satan really?

228
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,900
Satan is your negative deeds!

229
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,300
You are the chosen race,

230
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
you should never be deceived!

231
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,700
All you have to do is follow us
the bearers of the Torah,

232
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,100
and no one else!

233
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,500
ARIHA

234
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,200
- This should be my last payment!
- You had enough time!

235
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
- How are you, Ezra?
- Master Maier, help me out!

236
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
They keep charging me interest for
the loan I received a year ago!

237
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,200
- He is the one you vouched for!
- I have no money left.

238
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800
The interest rate of the market
comes from the Jewish rabbis

239
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They have taken twice what I borrowed,

240
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,700
But my debt still remains the same!

241
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
I have lots of expenses

242
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,600
- Received my order?
- Yes.

243
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,000
This is not fair

244
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
What kind of verdict is this?

245
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,200
Has God given such an order?

246
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
Be quiet!

247
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
What do you know about God's rules?

248
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Why are you so upset?

249
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,400
If you are really stuck, go to sir Maier

250
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,100
He takes less interest

251
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,000
- These are mine!
- You can't take all!

252
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,700
I can!

253
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,400
- What are you doing? Let me go!
- These are mine!

254
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,400
So what if they are?

255
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,400
You have messed up everything!

256
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,899
You must be ashamed of yourself!

257
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,100
Look, my brother has attacked
me over a coin!

258
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,400
We had no problems up to now!

259
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,600
- A mere coin is not worth fighting!
- It's not worth?

260
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,400
You see?

261
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Since the time this city was conquered
by the children of Israel.

262
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,800
But now you have frightened
everyone so much!

263
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That they quarrel for no reason!

264
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Reason enough, Master Yueel!

265
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,400
The enemy is closing on us,
and the devils are affecting us!

266
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Oh people, come to your senses!
A great danger is approaching us

267
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Do not lie, do not cheat,

268
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,200
pay the rights of the orphans and the poor!

269
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,200
Quit being jealous and never look to
the belongings of others!

270
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Don't take or give money interest
and quit usury,

271
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,200
So that Satan wouldn't touch you!

272
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,800
Let's take refuge in the mercy of
the Compassionate Lord

273
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,600
- And repent before Him!
- Hey, young man!

274
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,200
The Life and tradition of the
tribe of Ephraim in this town

275
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:36,100
Is based on the law of Moses,
not on sayings of just anybody!

276
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
My final warning

277
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,400
if anyone has any objection,
he should leave this territory!

278
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
That's all!

279
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,800
These people have been accustomed
to this way of life for many years

280
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,400
Why do you want to change everything?

281
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
This is unbearable!

282
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,300
This turmoil is driving people to a revolt!

283
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
We can't manage the tribes any longer!

284
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,800
Everyone will be attracted to Solomon.

285
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,500
He has the Ark and magical powers

286
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,000
Their return will be to his advantage!

287
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
No! Their return is to our advantage!

288
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,600
Aral?

289
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,600
who has asked this sorcerer to come?

290
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
I invited him!

291
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,900
In this situation we must
use any possible means!

292
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Listen carefully! Can't you
hear their howlings?

293
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,500
All great men were able. with their help,

294
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,800
to conquer vast countries
and glorify history!

295
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,600
Nimrod, Pharaoh...

296
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
What great civilization they created!

297
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Now after thousands of years,

298
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,900
these hidden masters will return to earth,

299
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:23,600
and surely they will not
forget their servant

300
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,900
And If want to rule other nations,

301
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,700
have all the riches of the world...

302
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,900
Ally with them?

303
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
The wise men of the Jews?

304
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,300
What would people say?!

305
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,700
Sir Yazar!

306
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,600
From the day that Solomon became king

307
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,900
I have been waiting for a
fatal encounter with him!

308
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,100
When he falsely claimed to be a prophet,

309
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,300
my will became stronger!

310
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
If these creatures come,

311
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,000
they'll destroy this self conceited
young man!

312
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
Virtue and obedience to Solomon!

313
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,200
From these two, obeying Solomon
is the real danger,

314
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,000
and this must lead to his failure!

315
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,000
Once when he was a child,

316
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,400
there was a quarrel between a farm owner,

317
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,600
and a man whose herd of sheep

318
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,300
had destroyed his farm during the night,

319
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,200
God taught Solomon the wisdom
to solve that problem.

320
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,900
David said: Do you see how wise he is?

321
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,800
But our opponents started an uproar,

322
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
saying you want a child as your successor?

323
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,200
My son was looking at me
with his penetrating eyes,

324
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,400
And I felt that he was preparing
himself for a difficult future

325
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,100
Now that day has arrived!

326
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,300
I am worried for him, Miriam.

327
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Dear mother, God is with us
and he will not leave us alone!

328
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,800
The sons of David have been
waiting for this day!

329
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I am proud of my sons!

330
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,700
How is the baby today?

331
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,800
I feel it, everyday more than the day before

332
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,700
After a long time God has
blessed us with a child

333
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I feel sorry for myself already,

334
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,600
because after the baby's birth,
all your attention will be to the baby

335
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,700
You are going through hard times

336
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,000
No prophet in the past

337
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,200
has ever entered into such
a dangerous adventure!

338
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Will we succeed?

339
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,000
Oh, Lord!

340
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,400
People of Jerusalem and
other towns like you a lot!

341
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
But they are enslaved by their old habits

342
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Will they come out of this, honorably?

343
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,700
Stop!

344
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,400
What's happening?

345
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,400
I don't know

346
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
What are you doing? God is our refuge!

347
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,200
Solomon said: We can be
saved by trusting him!

348
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,200
The sharpness of the sword will save us now!

349
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,900
These are respectable men you seized!

350
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
They are from our tribe, let them go!

351
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
Be calm! Didn't you see
what happened last night?

352
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,700
We will just take care of them for a while

353
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,200
until everything turns to normal!

354
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,100
This is not a military town!

355
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Don't endanger the lives of
women and children!

356
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Take away the soldiers from here!

357
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Otherwise we will do it ourselves!

358
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,000
Master Maier, help me to
establish order in here!

359
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,700
No! No! No!

360
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,700
Do you see that? See that?

361
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,300
- Shimon!
- Father!

362
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,000
Now Master Solomon must issue the verdict

363
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,200
Master Solomon, their herd has
destroyed one year of our cropps,

364
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,700
Leave it for latter,
compromise for now!

365
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,700
Get on your horses, quickly!

366
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
Hurry up!

367
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
What happening?

368
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,400
He set out all of a sudden!

369
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Faster, faster!

370
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:20,000
Looks like he is going to Ariha

371
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,400
Hurry up!

372
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Brother!

373
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Adonia!

374
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,800
The fury got to its peak and
some people started attacking others!

375
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,200
We have arrested most of them

376
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,000
We took care of the possessed ones!

377
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,700
Anyone one be their prey at any moment!

378
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
- Master Solomon, we are terrified!
- Help us!

379
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Why did we get into such a misfortune?

380
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,900
Oh, Lord,

381
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,700
You the one and only creator,
and everything I have,

382
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
You are all I have in this world

383
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,300
Oh, all my hope and shelter,

384
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Oh, the one whom I have no
other refuge beside you,

385
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,400
And bring my entire grief
and misery before you,

386
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,200
So only you, who are my God,
stand to save me!

387
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Oh God, your Mercy is so much that

388
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,300
Knowing about my feeble
condition and weak body,

389
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,700
You would not desert me, alone,

390
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,900
You won't leave me in the hands
of my bloodthirsty enemy,

391
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,400
to ambush me like this,

392
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,700
and to discredit the honor
you have blessed me with!

393
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,400
Oh God,

394
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,300
turn our hearts strong again
with the light of faith,

395
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,100
so we can raise war against
your enemies and wickedess,

396
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,500
and defeat Evil for you!

397
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,200
It was your brother who
stopped us guiding people,

398
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,800
Who turned them against us!

399
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,900
He is responsible for the
disaster that happened to us

400
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,700
Nobody accepted our advice

401
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,300
This young man even used to
interfere in the market transactions!

402
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,700
Market transactions?

403
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,600
They mean usury, my brother

404
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,800
Usury?

405
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,600
Every time our people don't have enough
money to solve their problems,

406
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,400
They turn to us to us!
And we have helped them out!

407
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,300
What about the damnation of usury?

408
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,700
You kmow God deprived usury of all blessing?

409
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,800
And this illegitimate property
will harm our people?

410
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,900
Illegitimate property? Why are you defaming
the Rabbis of the town?

411
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,300
You know the Holy Book!

412
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,700
We never asked for any more interest
than our legitimate share!

413
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,300
Legitimate share? Against Moses teachings?

414
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,900
This dreadful sin among the
children of Israel,

415
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Blocking them for ever the path
of goodness and salvation?

416
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Which sin, Master Solomon?
Usury is the spice of wealth!

417
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Satisfaction of the borrower
will make it legitimate,

418
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,600
based on the written words of the Torah

419
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,900
The book that you have altered
to suit your benefits?

420
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,100
Changed its words to serve
your own interest?

421
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,300
Who said you have the right
to feed by usury?

422
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,600
Shame on you!

423
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Don't you know that this forbidden wealth

424
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,400
will turn into fire and burn
inside your bellies?

425
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,700
Them how should we make our living?

426
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,800
You want us to go hungry and
wander about like beggars,

427
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,700
and disgrace knowledge and scolars
among the ordinary people?

428
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,400
Heaven save you!

429
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,200
Heaven have mercy on you!

430
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,200
This little knowledge has become an
instrument of your doom!

431
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,800
Now I realize why God showed me

432
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,500
my kingdom as a dead corpse without a soul!

433
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,500
Get out of my sight!
I don't see any good in you!

434
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Tomorrow I'll send for someone

435
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,000
who is much wiser than you,

436
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
Whose knowledge didn't cause him to deviate!

437
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,900
If mountains tremble, he will not!

438
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,200
If the whole world shakes, he would not!

439
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,500
Remember yesterday?

440
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,500
Now is the same situation in other towns!

441
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,300
What if we are besieged by insanity again?

442
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,000
Those of you who followed God's Guidance

443
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,100
were guarded against mischief

444
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,000
From now on your duty will be the same!

445
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,900
God protects you!

446
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,500
Aren't you coming with us?

447
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Shy!

448
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,800
Asef, son of Barkhia

449
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,500
Solomon has called for him

450
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,900
He can not do a thing!

451
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,200
You told me you possess a deadly spell

452
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,000
Which you've been reinforcing for years!

453
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,700
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean!

454
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,500
Kill Solomon!

455
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,900
No! It may turn back to us!

456
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,500
His death is worth the risk!

457
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,900
Kill him, Ara!

458
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,100
My master said

459
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,300
knowledge of witchcraft comes
from the Pharaoh's great sorcerer

460
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,900
Who traveled with Moses through the sea!

461
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,300
This knowledge has been secretly
passed on by the rabbis

462
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,000
He used to ay that

463
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:45,299
the deadliest magic comes from
the most valuable sacrifices

464
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,300
Poor thing!

465
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,500
Get on with it!

466
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,700
Do what I say!

467
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,300
Oh You who worship the sun,

468
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:10,700
Oh Evil eye, Oh Hatred and poison,
Oh Jealousy,

469
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Strike the ones he loves,
and kill them with deadly arrows!

470
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
What happened?

471
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
Miriam!

472
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,400
let's move on!

473
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,700
Brother, go to Jerusalem,
we'll carry on to nearby towns

474
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,300
By God's will, we should
controll the situation!

475
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,800
Shy! Escort him with some men!

476
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yes Sir!

477
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,900
Let's go to Hebron!

478
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,600
My God give you patience, Master Solomon!

479
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,400
We, the people of Jerusalem,
We are together with you.

480
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Stay right here!

481
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,500
Yes, father!

482
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,100
I offer my condolences!

483
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,400
The death of a loved one
is so heart breaking and painfull!

484
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,400
Now you relize that what
we said wasn't in vain?

485
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,800
Ralatives and dear ones are
the first targets for danger!

486
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Our enemies don't even show
mercy on innocent woman and children!

487
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,799
From now on there will be lots of bloodshed

488
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,200
The King shouldn't consent to this!

489
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,500
You should resign from the throne,
just attend to religious matters

490
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,800
and leave the hard responsibility
of government to us.

491
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,400
The death of his your wife and child
do not force you to reconsider?

492
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,800
Your mother, brother and
companions should die,

493
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
so that you perceive the danger?

494
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,900
How many people must be sacrificed
for your ambitions? How many?

495
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:52,000
You should know that we repay
any harm we receive by benevolence!

496
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,600
You are determined to
destroy the Sons of David,

497
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,700
And I am determined to do what I can
for the salvation of your family!

498
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,600
You called for me, I came right away!

499
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,800
You remind me of my father David!

500
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,200
I'm sorry!

501
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,600
My heart aches for Miriam
and our innocent child

502
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,900
Their share of life was its vengeance!

503
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,900
They've entered the lord's blessing,
into the light of his kindness!

504
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:24,300
A path of deliverance will be
opened from this Holy Rock!

505
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,499
It is from here that the prophet
of the end of the time,

506
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:34,500
will pray in front of all other messengers
and will ascend to Heaven!

507
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,600
It's here also, that at the time
of the last savior of his generation,

508
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,800
After the final battle, Satan will
behead Iblis "Satan"

509
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,400
Then heavenly kingdom of God
will shine upon the earth!

510
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,200
Master Solomon! Couriers have brought news!

511
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,330
People of Bait Abia,

512
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,400
Bayr Hares, and Talle Rafidim overcame the
satanic pressures!

513
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,600
Sir Yasbaom and Hezgheel are
terribly involved in the action

514
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Adonia, after calming down Hebron,
went to Eyn Phares

515
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,200
We have to go to Zebulun
as quickly as possible!

516
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,200
Do you Remember?

517
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,200
This is the first armor,
made by your father David!

518
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
Shy!

519
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,900
My Lord!

520
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,500
- You stay with my brother!
- Yes, Lord!

521
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,200
Absalom, I'll entrust Jerusalem
and my mother to you!

522
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,200
God, have mercy on us!

523
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,300
Take the people to the Holy Rock,
give refuge to the woman and children!

524
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,100
Yes sir!

525
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,700
What is going to happen to us?

526
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,700
We didn't think this would end like this!

527
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,700
Sir Yazar! Sir Yazar!

528
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,100
Listen! Solomon is now on his way to the
farthest place of the country!

529
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,200
It is the golden opportunity
we've been waiting for!

530
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,700
We have to finish this
affair before he returns!

531
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
We are afraid, Lady Michael!

532
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,700
Don't be afraid! God will help us!

533
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:19,450
The city of Hebron has
fallen into our hands!

534
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,550
We captured them at the
entrance of the town!

535
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,650
Let's move!

536
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,800
- Are you OK?
- All right!

537
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,400
Let's go comrages,
quickly, let's go!

538
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:50,300
Stay calm! Don't run away!

539
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:57,050
Sit down Everybody! Sit down!

540
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Run! Outside the city!

541
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,800
Calm down everybody! Stay down!

542
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,200
Run!

543
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,500
Sir Asher, you come too!

544
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,400
Come!

545
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,700
Go towards the boats!

546
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,200
Go to the boats!

547
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,600
Come on! Throw the boats into the water!

548
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,100
Faster! hurry up!

549
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,600
Come on, come on! Quickly!

550
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,600
Come on, come on! Faster!

551
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,800
Ready?

552
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,700
No! No!

553
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,100
Bring the children!

554
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:31,250
- For God and his messenger!
- For God and his messenger!

555
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,200
With the width of the sword!

556
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:52,950
Oh God, help us!

557
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:00,850
Oh God, accept these commanders of mine

558
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:05,650
In your Mercy and Forgiveness!

559
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,750
- Master Asher!
- Why this?

560
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,400
Come to your senses, and get rid
of Satan's influence!

561
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:58,350
I am unclean, there is no hope
for me anymore!

562
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,500
I can not repent!

563
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,200
You can! Turn to God's protection!

564
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:24,200
Throw away the evil from yourself!
Have faith in God and do not despise!

565
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,600
Call god!

566
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,200
Call God! You can!

567
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:35,150
Call God!

568
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,400
I can't!

569
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:08,650
God!

570
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,300
- Oh Messenger of God!
- My brother Adonia!

571
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,100
The head of the tribes and armed forces
have moved to Jerusalem.

572
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,500
Jerusalem!

573
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:43,200
All this unrest is the result of
Solomon's incompetence

574
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:47,100
The government should return to
its legitimate owners!

575
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,600
To Yazar, the commander of the Israelites!

576
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:55,800
People! The key to your salvation
is with him' not with false prophet!

577
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yazar! Yazar! Yazar!

578
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,800
How dare you raise the flag of war

579
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,850
In the city of David the prophet,

580
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:22,550
Where its people still remember

581
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,850
the verses of the psalms sang
with his beautiful voice?

582
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:30,750
Master Asef, why are you taking the
side of this usurper family?

583
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,650
If you have chosen me
as the wisest of scholars,

584
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:38,350
You should know that this is a
precious trustworthiness in our hands!

585
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:41,650
It should be used to find
the messenger of God,

586
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:43,550
and surrender oneself to him,

587
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:46,850
Otherwise, it's not called
knowledge, it's a deviation!

588
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,250
Oh People, don't fight
with the prophet of God!

589
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
This is an unforgivable sin!

590
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,150
Do not sin!

591
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,050
Don't repeat the time when Moses
delayed returning from Mount Sinai,

592
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:00,550
and by the deception of the Samiri,

593
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,650
you revolted on Aaron calf worshippers!

594
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,150
Master Asef is telling the truth!

595
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:10,750
I testify that Solomon is
the messenger of God!

596
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:14,150
Come back, Isaac!

597
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:18,150
And this is his brother Absalom!
Son of David the prophet!

598
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:22,550
Absalom! Absalom! Absalom!

599
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:25,450
Oh people!

600
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:28,950
You better know that all tribes
have concluded a treaty with me...

601
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,200
If you don't surrender,
none of you will stay alive!

602
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,500
Asef is right!

603
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,500
Why are you distressed?

604
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,700
You have the most powerful weapon!

605
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:20,750
Oh, God!

606
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:24,450
Protect my people from the
malevolence of our enemies!

607
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:34,850
Listen to me, officers and soldiers,

608
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:38,850
You've all been cheated!

609
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,200
I am the head master of the Levi clan,
guardian of Judaism

610
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,200
I'm the one who determines
the good and evil in your religion!

611
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,800
I am calling you to the book of God,
to this Torah!

612
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,500
God's written commandments
granted to Moses!

613
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,800
You still want to fight against God?

614
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,700
We won't fight against the Torah "law"!

615
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,050
Attack!

616
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:18,800
Take the palace!

617
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,200
This time we are facing
the devils in human form!

618
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,900
We have to get to Jerusalem
as fast as possible!

619
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:35,500
But, master, all the soldiers are tired
and the horses need a rest!

620
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,200
let them rest till tomorrow morning!

621
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,200
It would take days to reach there!

622
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:49,250
Wait until dawn!

623
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,300
Oh, God!

624
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:18,300
My enemies are attacking from all sides,
and prevailing over us!

625
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:22,750
Distance are too much

626
01:28:24,650 --> 01:28:27,650
My body is weak, and my ability is limited!

627
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:31,750
My God, what shall I do?

628
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,300
Lord, help me!

629
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,800
Everybody come to the palace!
It is safer!

630
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,350
Come here! Hurry up! Quickly!

631
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:36,750
Solomon!

632
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,300
My God!

633
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,200
Solomon, our good servant!

634
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,600
We place the wind in your command!

635
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,800
Use it to take you anywhere you wish!

636
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:25,200
Bring the ships to the beach!
We have to join them together!

637
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,600
- Come, my dear!
- Come here!

638
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,400
Don't be afraid, my sweethearts!

639
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,100
Will it rise?

640
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,700
let's get on board!

641
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,100
Faster, comrades, quickly!

642
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,200
Oh Lord, you are sufficient for me!

643
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,700
Stand back!

644
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,400
Stand firm!

645
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,600
Firmly!

646
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,200
Don't let them get to
the women and children!

647
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,200
No mercy for anyone!

648
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
Kill them! Kill them all!

649
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,500
Oh, Lord!

650
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
These people see your miracles,
but turn away with disbelief!

651
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:53,700
Sin and obstinacy have covered their eyes

652
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,900
and darkened their hearts!

653
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:02,200
They are determined to destroy your faith

654
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:08,200
Oh, God, we are not afraid of dying for you,

655
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:15,400
but we can not let them destroy your
kingdom against yor wish!

656
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:25,300
Lord, once again bless us with
your mercy and support,

657
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,700
Since you are the best of supporters!

658
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,500
This is the light of God!

659
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,600
<i>Oh Solomon,</i>

660
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:48,100
<i>Be prepared for the materialization
of Jinns and Satans,</i>

661
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:53,800
<i>For we have given you the
power to control them!</i>

662
01:40:54,500 --> 01:41:00,100
<i>And this power is in your ring,
always with you!</i>

663
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:53,900
You see! Satan is the origin of all
mankind's torments and sorrow

664
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:57,900
It is the cause of
distances between us

665
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,200
Isn't it time for
repentance and forgiveness?

666
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,800
Shame on us!

667
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:25,900
Shame on us!

668
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:12,100
I order that from now on,
in our kingdom,

669
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:15,200
these creatures would be paralized!

670
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,400
So do not be afraid of these villains,

671
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,800
attack and capture all of them!

672
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:16,200
<i>Praise be to God who is the only refuge
to us defenseless humans!</i>

673
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:21,900
<i>The one who brought Jinns and Satans
to our submission!</i>

674
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:29,100
<i>Beware that at the end of time these
creatures will return to earth!</i>

675
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:34,700
<i>Once again bloodshed and corruption
will take over the whole world!</i>

676
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:42,200
<i>We will implore God to raise his mighty
helping hand once again!</i>

677
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:47,400
<i>And descend the his
bright light upon us...</i>

678
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:51,900
<i>to destroy all devils and insurgent races...</i>

679
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:55,700
<i>the same way that the previous
rebellious nations were defeated!</i>

680
01:45:57,250 --> 01:46:03,250
<i>Then the savior of mankind will come,
he who is an ocean of mercy!</i>

681
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:09,100
<i>The righteous will inherit the earth
and they will establish a heaven...</i>

682
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:14,300
<i>In which humanity will blossom
to its highest extend!</i>

683
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:21,200
<i>Then Oh Lord, grant us the
grace of good deeds...</i>

684
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:26,400
<i>To get ourselves prepared
for that time...</i>

685
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:33,100
<i>So that we'll all be your worshippers,
and faithful servants!</i>

686
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,200
<i>All be for you...</i>

687
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:38,300
<i>And all be towards you!</i>

688
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:42,500
