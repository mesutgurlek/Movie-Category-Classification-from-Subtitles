1
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,328
[Arguing and commotion]

2
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,729
Man: Gentlemen,
gentlemen, please.

3
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,932
Now, if we start
the encirclement
in this sector

4
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,334
and maneuver the enemy's troops

5
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,336
out of the central
defense lines,

6
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,938
why, the counterattack
must be successful.

7
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,939
Second man:
That stinks!

8
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,040
I beg your pardon.

9
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,342
Walter Winchell
said last night--

10
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,343
will you listen to me?

11
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:18,345
Now, here are the Nazis.

12
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,679
So what have they got, tanks?

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,581
So what's a tank?

14
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,549
In '29,
they used 'em in Chicago.

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,950
Armored cars.

16
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,685
You're living in the past.

17
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:26,487
The layout's a cinch.

18
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:27,554
Remember how Willie's mob

19
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,688
mowed down those West Side boys?

20
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,623
I'll never forget it!

21
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:31,158
That's how the British
should do it.

22
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,259
Now...

23
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,361
The fleet muscles in
at this spot,

24
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,095
we hijack their ammunition,

25
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,097
the R.A.F.
Spits on Berlin,

26
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,066
and we catch them
with their panzers down.

27
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,334
[Laughter]

28
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,102
The way you're doing it,
we'll lose the war.

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,404
What?

30
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,972
You're backing us right
into another Dunkirk.

31
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,908
Smart guy, where'd you
learn to be a general,
in the Bronx?

32
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,512
I've served some of
the greatest authorities
of our times, to wit:

33
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,114
Gunther, Kaltenborn,
Raymond, Graham, swing.

34
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,649
Listen, four-eyes,

35
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,585
if you don't keep
quiet, I'll serve you
with a blackout.

36
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,387
20 years.

37
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:00,388
Take those glasses off

38
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:01,488
and I'll pop you in the nose.

39
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:02,989
Oh, yeah? Don't let
that stop you.

40
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,991
I don't need the glasses.

41
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:05,992
Where's everybody?

42
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:06,993
[Laughter]

43
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:07,994
Where are you, fellas?

44
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,162
Wait a minute, sunshine.

45
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:09,997
I think
the general's
got a point.

46
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:11,130
What point?!

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,532
When you take into consideration

48
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,800
the carastan
on the tagabrue
with dive bombers--

49
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,868
I told you
that the fleet
muscles in here,

50
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,737
the R.A.F.--

51
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,172
what did you say?

52
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:22,141
I said the Carastan
on the tagabrue is
a very serious problem.

53
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,943
To say nothing of
the larrisanc Faye.

54
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,077
Cut out the double talk,

55
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,246
and don't camouflage
your ignorance.

56
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,614
Listen, we know just as much

57
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,549
about doping out
this war as you do,
ignoramus.

58
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,418
Ignoramus? I'll shove
a tank down your throat.

59
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,152
I'll stab you
with this--

60
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,154
man: Here comes the boss.

61
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,557
Hey, what's going on here?

62
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,891
Man: Hello, boss.
How are you?

63
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,127
I could hear you boys
clear down to 42nd street.

64
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,462
Hey, what is all this?

65
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,163
A few things
I picked up at
the five-and-ten.

66
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,298
Second childhood, huh?

67
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,566
This character
thinks he's an expert

68
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,134
on the international situation.

69
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,337
Just showing the boys
how England can win
the war, Gloves.

70
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,306
I'll arrange
a conference between
you and Churchill.

71
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,775
Now let's get down
to serious business.

72
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:56,677
Serious business?

73
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,311
This is serious business,
Gloves.

74
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,679
Don't you think it's time
you got your mind

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,781
out of the sports section
and onto the front page?

76
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,583
I can't be bothered.

77
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:03,783
That's Washington's racket.

78
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,817
Let them handle it.

79
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,586
Now, will the ambassador
from Belmont park

80
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,855
kindly give me a report
on the racing situation?

81
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,057
I clocked sweet dream
this morning at 1:40.

82
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,058
Yeah? What's
the morning line?

83
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,059
3 to 1.

84
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,294
5 grand on the schnoz.

85
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,195
Caught kid O'Brien's
workout this morning.

86
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,196
How's his left?

87
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,197
Like a machine gun.

88
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,798
10 grand he wins in 3 rounds.

89
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,199
10 grand on O'Brien?

90
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,468
What's the matter with O'Brien?

91
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:22,602
Nothing.
I like him.

92
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,003
I also like my mother,

93
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,605
but she can't fight, either.

94
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,206
Bring me my coffee
and cheesecake, Louie.

95
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,776
Yes, Mr. Donahue.
Right away, sir.

96
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,080
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

97
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,615
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

98
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,818
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

99
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,621
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

100
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,823
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

101
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,825
We have a problem.

102
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,760
No cheesecake?

103
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,495
Plenty, but not from
Miller's bakery.

104
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:49,662
What are we going to do?

105
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,364
He only likes it
from Miller's bakery.

106
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,632
Give him the
national cheesecake.

107
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,233
It's a reasonable facsimile.

108
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,635
I wouldn't advise it.

109
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,838
You wouldn't know
the difference.

110
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,455
Sunshine:
Incidentally,

111
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,656
Samson is
twirling for the
tigers today.

112
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,258
Incidentally, Samson's
got a glass arm.

113
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,660
Here you are,
Mr. Donahue.

114
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,261
Put 5 yards on the yanks.

115
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,663
5 yards
on the yanks.
OK, boss.

116
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,365
You better get those bets down.

117
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,567
Man: Hi, boys!

118
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,768
Hi, fellas.

119
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,769
Hiya, Barney.

120
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,604
Hello, coach.

121
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,771
I got the money from Callahan.

122
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,606
Did he give easy?

123
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:33,773
Just like extracting a molar.

124
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,675
Any message?

125
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:35,775
Should I leave out
the curse words?

126
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,677
No message.

127
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:37,678
Dry cleaner--
what'd he say?

128
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,945
He says he ain't no welsher,

129
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,080
but in his opinion
the taxi bet was a frame.

130
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,417
He says 4 even license numbers
in a row just don't happen
to come along.

131
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,285
Hey, there's a miracle
on 48th street.

132
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,620
He's got a nerve,
accusing us of bribery.

133
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,621
Ain't he, though?

134
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,856
Here, pay off those hackies,

135
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,424
and tell 'em it was nice timing.

136
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,959
After that, coach,
can I beat it?

137
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,694
No, you got to drive us
out to the ballpark.

138
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,295
Can't I skip the ball game?

139
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,296
I got a date with a doll.

140
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,698
Bring her along.

141
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,166
We got something planned.

142
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,302
Anything you're going to do
you can do at the ballpark.

143
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,905
I don't think so.

144
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,078
Hey, Louie.

145
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,312
Yes, Mr. Donahue.

146
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,714
When I order cheesecake,

147
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,449
I don't expect to get mucilage.

148
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,717
I'm sorry,
Mr. Donahue, but--

149
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,452
this is not Miller's cheesecake.

150
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,788
He didn't come today
yet...Today.

151
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,789
Why not?

152
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,890
We don't know.

153
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,358
There's a new invention
called the telephone.

154
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,493
You could've used it.

155
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,327
Let me get you
something else maybe.

156
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,996
A nice French doughnut
oozin' with jelly?

157
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,433
You tell Charlie
to take his cheesecake
from Miller's only...

158
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,667
Or else.

159
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,835
Wait a minute,
Mr. Donahue.
Can't you--

160
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,805
cut out the arguments.
Can't you read?

161
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,074
Who's smokin'?

162
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,344
Flowers?

163
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,446
Oh, hello, Herman.

Hello, gents,
you are not leaving?

I got a business engagement
at Yankee stadium.

But you didn't have
your cheesecake yet.

I haven't got time for that now.

168
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,354
I'll have two
for supper tonight.

What happened to you?

170
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,223
Oh, nothing, nothing.

171
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,091
I got a little pain in my back.

172
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,292
Aw, that's too bad.

173
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,761
See Dr. Lachelle and
tell him I sent you.

174
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,362
Oh, say, you going
to see my old lady?

175
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,363
Naturally.

176
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,532
Well, here, give her this.

out good at the game

Hey, Gloves,
won't you please
reconsider my request?

185

This date is personally
important to me.

Yes.

Fine, fine!

196
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,549
Any circles under his eyes?

197

I didn't see any.

198

No. Do you
expect anybody?

No, no. I was
just asking.

No, no. You go
deliver the cake.

I will talk to you
when you come back.

You didn't ask me how I am.

you have been a very

were you down at the pier

You know I go to
the pier every morning.

We'll start
in the basement
and work our way up.

What do you make of it?

338
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,086

and isolate her?

something on me for years.

May I help you?

976

No. I'm just
looking around.

977

Is there anything
in particular you're
interested in?

978
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:49,954
Yeah, but nothing
around here seems
to catch my fancy.

979
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:51,689
Perhaps if you
could tell me what
you're looking for.

What you got in there,

That's right, brother.

the cashier come out here

find it more profitable

to think about it.

00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,032
Schroeder
and Holzmeir
will be late.

1124
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:02,768
The plane has
been forced down
at Harrisburg.

1125
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,268
Bad weather.

1126
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,103
Tell them they must
get here as quickly
as possible.

1127
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,504
They must take a chance.

1128
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,706
Come in, Fleischer.

1129
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,280
Did you bring the drawings?

1130
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:17,314
I couldn't do it.

1131
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,482
It wasn't possible.

1132
00:45:18,483 --> 00:45:19,850
You had your instructions.

1133
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,585
If those drawings disappear,

1134
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:23,120
I'll be held responsible.

1135
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,721
As foreman of the plant,

1136
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,490
the police
would come
to see me first.

1137
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,892
I can't do it.

1138
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,394
I must keep my job.

1139
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:34,131
And the next time,
I break your neck.

1140
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,900
Ebbing: Now get me
those drawings.

1141
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,103
We must have them tonight.

1142
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:46,743
I'm sure he'll bring them now.

1143
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,379
Pepi, you'd better
look after Donahue.

1144
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,948
Arrange to have a truck

1145
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,850
take him and his friend
to New Jersey.

1146
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:54,985
Madame, get rid of
the other one downstairs.

1147
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:55,986
What about this girl?

1148
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:57,988
We will discuss it later.

1149
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,056
Later? Why not now?

1150
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:01,758
I said we will discuss it later.

1151
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,361
But Pepi hasn't told you
all about her.

1152
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:05,562
This afternoon, she--

1153
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,564
madame, I know my duty.

1154
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,099
I hope you know yours.

1155
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,700
What about the meeting?

1156
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,701
Are you still holding it here?

1157
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:12,903
Why not?

1158
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:14,471
Isn't it dangerous
after what's happened?

1159
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:17,007
It will take more
than Mr. Donahue
to disrupt my schedule.

1160
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:19,377
I told you
what to do.
Do it.

1161
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,780
Get Steinem on the phone.

1162
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,182
Wait in my study, Leda.

1163
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:27,051
The meeting
will be held at 3:00.

1164
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,854
Tell everybody to use
the warehouse entrance.

1165
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:31,255
Auctioneer:
I am offered 750.

1166
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:36,193
750 once, 750 twice,
sold to Mr. marlin for 750.

1167
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:38,795
We'll charge that
to your account, sir.

1168
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,897
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

1169
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,131
concludes our session
for tonight.

1170
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,666
Next week we are
offering the contents

1171
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:43,800
of a Southampton estate.

1172
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,802
I hope to see you all then.

1173
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,805
Good night,
and thank you for coming.

1174
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,408
Good night.

1175
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,212
Are you waiting for someone?

1176
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,646
Yes, ma'am,
I'm waiting
for my friend.

1177
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,815
He's kind of a tall,
dark, handsome-like
gentleman.

1178
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,317
I don't seem to remember him.

1179
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,819
Yes, you do. He's
the one that bought
the fancy desk.

1180
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,221
Paid quite
a lot of scratch
for it, too.

1181
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:06,957
Oh, yes.
The Louis xv with
the gilt ormolu.

1182
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,225
No, ma'am.
Just a desk.

1183
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:09,759
But that was some time ago.

1184
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,361
He paid for it...

1185
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:12,263
And left.

1186
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:13,830
No. He wouldn't
leave without me.

1187
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,832
I'm just like his right hand.

1188
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,634
We was kids together
down on the east side.

1189
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:20,104
I'm sorry I haven't
time to listen to
your biography.

1190
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:21,405
We're closing now.

1191
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:22,406
I must ask you to go.

1192
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:23,473
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1193
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:24,708
I ain't moving
a budge without
my friend.

1194
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:25,842
Then I shall insist.

1195
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,843
Look it, lady,

1196
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,978
when we started out tonight

1197
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,079
there was 3 of us.

1198
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,247
20 minutes later
there was only 2.

1199
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:31,848
Now there's only one.

1200
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,850
One of us ain't enough
to leave here alone.

1201
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,054
I'll go and see it myself.

1202
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,524
Hello.

1203
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,259
Will you show this gentleman
to the door, Anton?

1204
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,862
Careful, Buddy,
I got a very
nasty temper.

1205
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,464
You don't intimidate me.

1206
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:48,865
I'm warning you.

1207
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,267
I'll tell the police.

1208
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,469
I'll tell them he's here.

1209
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,670
Why don't you?

1210
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:56,406
I understand they, too,
are looking for Mr. Donahue.

1211
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:57,874
Oh.

1212
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,476
Good night.

1213
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:00,544
Good night, ma'am.

1214
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,546
I'm going.

1215
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,582
I said good night, didn't I?

1216
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:18,362
What are you doing here?

1217
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,896
Ebbing asked me to wait for him.

1218
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,897
Where is he?

1219
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:21,898
In the office.

1220
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,233
You can see him there.

1221
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,634
He asked me to wait
for him here.

1222
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:28,505
Madame, there is
no reason for you
to dislike me.

1223
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:32,009
I not only
dislike you,
I distrust you.

1224
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,044
But I'm sure you
know that if ever

1225
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:35,679
you attempted to betray us,

1226
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,914
your father
will be the first
to hear of it

1227
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,316
and the first to pay for it.

1228
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:40,717
And if you have any idea

1229
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:42,386
that your friend
Mr. Donahue
could help you,

1230
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,321
you can give that up, too.

1231
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:47,125
Pepi will take care of him.

1232
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,942
Hey.

1233
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,544
Hey.

1234
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,746
That you, sunshine?

1235
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:12,849
If it ain't, I've been
doing a lot of suffering
for the wrong party.

1236
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:13,883
Quiet.

1237
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,953
These knots must've been tied

1238
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,555
by the number one boy scout.

1239
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:19,823
Untie me, will you?

1240
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:22,027
Glad to be of service.

1241
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,966
How do them seals
get around so fast?

1242
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,368
What happened to you?

1243
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:34,971
A gentleman persuaded me
to look at his etchings.

1244
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,973
What persuaded you?

1245
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,575
That dame.

1246
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:39,843
The dame?

1247
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:40,877
Yeah.

1248
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:42,779
That makes the evening perfect.

1249
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,382
Wait'll the boys
at Charlie's
hear about this.

1250
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,984
Yeah. Couple of
smart guys we are.

1251
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,986
Speak for yourself.

1252
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,589
You and that cheesecake
started all this.

1253
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,391
Why couldn't you--

1254
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:54,591
aw, lay off, will you?

1255
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:55,593
[Door opens]

1256
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:01,765
There's a door...

1257
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:02,999
The end of the hall.

1258
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,001
It leads to the docks.

1259
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,403
I don't figure you, sister.

1260
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:08,738
First you slug me,
now you're trying
to help me.

1261
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,006
Who killed Joe denning?

1262
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,675
The same man who killed Miller.

1263
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,244
That doesn't add up,
Miller and Joe knocked off
by the same party.

1264
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,745
I can't untie these.

1265
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,547
Skip that.
Try my hands.

1266
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:20,417
Now listen, sister,
I've been tagged
for Joe's murder.

1267
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:22,018
The cops are looking
for me all over town.

1268
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,620
I've got to clear myself.

1269
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:24,621
Who killed Joe Denning?

1270
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:25,755
I can't tell you.

1271

[Approaching footsteps]

Gloves:
Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1274
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:37,768
There's a cigarette
lighter in this pocket
here. Give it to me.

1275
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,242
Good luck.

1276
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:51,581
How can you trust this girl?

1277
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:53,183
Why are you so blind about her?

1278
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:55,586
If you don't mind,
I will handle this.

1279
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,658
Call me the moment
Schroeder arrives.

1280
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,059
Sit down, Leda.

1281
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,695

01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,180
Give me a room, curly.

1596
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:05,448
With or without?

1597
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,650
It don't make any difference.

1598
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,051
Any kind.

1599
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:10,319
Boy.

1600
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,920
For me and the lady.

1601
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,190
And who might that be?
My mother.

1602
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:15,858
Have you got
any baggage?
No.

1603
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:18,060
Well, I'm sorry, but
I can't give you a room
without baggage. I--

1604
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,862
give me that key.
Call up the cops

1605
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:22,064
and tell them you got
Gloves Donahue
up in room 214.

1606
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:23,466
Who?
Gloves Donahue!

1607
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:25,201
I'm a murderer, a killer.

1608
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:27,002
There's my picture--
one of my best.

1609
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:29,472
Come on, kid.
There's a 10 grand
reward out for me.

1610
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:30,873
You'll never have
another chance like this

1611
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:32,875
till you pick the winner
in the Irish sweepstakes.

1612
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:34,378
We'll walk.

1613
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:41,151
Operator, give me
the police, quick!

1614
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:58,302
This ain't
exactly in my line,
playing nursemaid.

1615
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:01,237
Feeling better?

1616
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:02,638
Thanks.

1617
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,242
Aw, now, come on.
Cut that out, now.

1618
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:08,844
Here. Here,
have a cigarette.

1619
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,513
Sorry about tonight, kid.

1620
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,515
Sorry you had to go
through all this.

1621
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:14,383
It wasn't your fault, Gloves.

1622
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:16,118
Well, I wish you
could have found out

1623
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,254
about your old man
in some easier way.

1624
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:20,256
Quite a shock, wasn't it?

1625
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:23,125
It's all right.
Just as well.

1626
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:25,528
It's better for him this way.

1627
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,563
Sure it is.
It's better
for you, too.

1628
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,533
At least they can't
kick you around
any longer.

1629
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:33,101
How'd you ever get
tied up with them
in the first place?

1630
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,137
I came here 2 years ago.

1631
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:36,872
Ebbing found out
I was in New York

1632
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:38,407
and gave me the choice--

1633
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:41,410
my services or my father's life.

1634
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,978
Nice characters.

1635
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:45,381
What were you supposed to do?

1636
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:48,150
Meet important people,
try and get information.

1637
01:09:48,151 --> 01:09:49,752
That's why I was at the club.

1638
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:51,153
I knew you was OK

1639
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:52,555
the first time
I talked to you tonight.

1640
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:55,558
Like my old lady says,
"I had a feeling."

1641
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:57,159
Then, as the evening wore on,

1642
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,761
I got a little mixed up.

1643
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:01,163
When I caught that
conversation between
you and the head man,

1644
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:03,966
well, I...I guess
I blew my topper.

1645
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:07,169
Now, you were saying
that Miller and Joe
were bumped off

1646
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,471
by the same guy.

1647
01:10:08,472 --> 01:10:10,038
Who was it?
Pepi.

1648
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,307
Pepi? That squirt?

1649
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:12,708
What'd he have against Miller?

1650
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,310
They were
working together,
weren't they?

1651
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:16,712
No. Miller was working
under pressure, too.

1652
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,515
They must have asked him
to do something,
and he refused.

1653
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:22,184
Oh, I see. Well,
we'll get that Pepi.

1654
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:23,586
We got a special little gadget

1655
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:26,054
up in sing sing that'll
just melt him away.

1656
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,756
It isn't only Pepi, Gloves.

1657
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,592
There are hundreds
of them in New York,

1658
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:31,193
in every city of the country.

1659
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:32,595
They get around, don't they.

1660
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,196
I was glancing
through this book.

1661
01:10:34,197 --> 01:10:35,598
What's in there is nothing

1662
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,433
compared to what they're
going to do tonight.

1663
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,468
They're planning something
much more serious

1664
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,570
than anything they've
ever done before.

1665
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:42,671
Yeah?

1666
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:44,873
That's what Miller
wanted to talk to me about,

1667
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,075
and that's what I was trying
to find out from Ebbing

1668
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,611
when you came into the room.

1669
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:51,614
Holy smoke.
Haven't you got any idea
what it's all about?

1670
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:54,216
No, but I do know that
there's a meeting

1671
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:56,018
at 3:00
at the antique shop,

1672
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:59,221
and they're expecting
2 munition experts
from Detroit.

1673
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:01,824
How about that?

1674
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:03,225
Munition experts, huh?

1675
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:05,628
You say their meeting's
at 3:00?

1676
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:07,496
Yes.
Well, we'll
bust that up.

1677
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:08,964
[Knock on door]

1678
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:10,165
Man: Open up!
Police.

1679
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,234
All right, you tell the cops
everything you told me.

1680
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:14,637
That'll even up the score
for both of us.

1681
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:16,372
Come in, boys.
Am I glad to see you.

1682
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:17,906
All right, kitty,
get your coat on.

1683
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:21,109
We're getting out of here
with an escort.

1684
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,712
Ebbing:
Good evening.

1685
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:27,617
To quote you, Mr. Donahue,
"get them up."

1686
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,490
You're like a bad penny.

1687
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:35,991
Are you all right, Leda?

1688
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,259
Yes.

1689
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,995
Good. He won't annoy you
any longer.

1690
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:41,597
Can I go now?

1691
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:42,999
Yes.

1692
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,506
Yes...I know.

1693
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:53,776
I'm sorry, but your father was
an enemy of the state.

1694
01:11:53,777 --> 01:11:55,544
That's no excuse for murder.

1695
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:58,080
I'm afraid you will be
of no further use to us.

1696
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,916
Take them both.
If you please, Mr. Donahue.

1697
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:04,152
Ok, buster. It looks
like it's your pot.

1698
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,755
Mm-hmm.

1699
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,431
You mind if I check out?

1700
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:17,032
Keep quiet.

1701
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:18,635
[Sirens approach]

1702
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:23,839
Hiya, boys!

1703
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,609
Now I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

1704
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:28,844
You're just in time, boys.

1705
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,446
I got a little
something for you.

1706
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:31,714
Good evening, officer.

1707
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:32,981
Mr. Donahue
tried to escape,

1708
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:34,583
but we managed
to keep him.
Good night.

1709
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:36,318
Thanks, Buddy--
hey, you!
Come back here!

1710
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:37,720
Don't let them
get away with that!

1711
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,321
They're spies!
They're fifth columnists!

1712
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,956
Yeah, and I'm Hitler.

1713
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,591
But I'm telling you,
you dope, don't let them
get away with it!

1714
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:44,192
Gloves: Remember
that explosion

1715
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,461
in the powder plant last week

1716
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:46,862
and that fire in
the shipyard a month ago?

1717
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,363
This outfit's back of all that,

1718
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,332
and that antique
joint's the front
for the whole works.

1719
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,734
You take my breath away.

1720
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,336
Now, why don't
you start your story

1721
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:55,871
with "once upon a time"...

1722
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,473
Now, stop kidding around,
will you, Forbes?

1723
01:12:57,474 --> 01:12:58,874
I'm giving it to you straight.

1724
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,476
It's all down in that book
I was telling you about.

1725
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,545
Oh, yes, the book.
We mustn't forget the book.

1726
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:04,480
He's right,
lieutenant. You've
got to believe us.

1727
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,749
All I want to know is
who killed Joe Denning?

1728
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,484
A goggle-eyed
little rat named Pepi,

1729
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:10,052
and he's the guy
that got Miller, too.

1730
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,788
You're making a very naughty boy
out of this Pepi.

1731
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,222
What I don't understand is,

1732
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,959
what is the connection
between Joe Denning and Miller?

1733
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,326
I told you 50 times.

1734
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,896
I don't grasp it.
Maybe I'm not big
enough mentally.

1735
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,898
Listen, if you don't quit
munching that sandwich

1736
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,833
and throw that
feeble brain of yours
into high gear,

1737
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:26,902
those guys are
going to hijack
the statue of Liberty.

1738
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,337
Come on, will you, Forbes?
I'll show you their hangout.

1739
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,739
Ok, I'm no prude.

1740
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,776
I'd like to see
this den of bogeymen.

1741
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:36,779
Now, don't let anyone
take that sandwich.

1742
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,615
And that goes for you, too.

1743
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:48,791
What are you going
in this way for?

1744
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:50,225
They got a trick entrance
around in the back

1745
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,627
through the warehouse.

1746
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:53,261
I like to be conventional.
Let's go in the front way.

1747
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,563
You might just as well
have phoned and told him
you were coming.

1748
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:56,198
Listen, Gloves,
I'm a simple man.

1749
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:59,067
I can only digest
one hunk of bunk
at a time.

1750
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:01,403
Yeah, well, you'll
change your mind
when you get inside.

1751
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:04,006
It's possible
I could be convinced.

1752
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:06,174
Well, here we go.

1753
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,543
Well?

1754
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,012
Open up.

1755
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:11,547
What do you want?

1756
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:12,948
What do I want?

1757
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,583
What do I look like?
Open up.

1758
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,151
Yes, sir.

1759
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:18,887
Don't worry, boys.
They told me there'd
be nights like this.

1760
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:20,156
All right.

1761
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:25,160
The main office is
right down this hall.

1762
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:26,562
This'll open up your eyes.

1763
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:27,896
You're scaring me.

1764
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:30,065
Sounds like the next
installment of superman.

1765
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:31,568
My kids will enjoy this.

1766
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:38,440
How about this?

1767
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:40,544
Very convincing.

1768
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:46,849
Yeah, but...
I don't get it.

1769
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,584
There was a bunch
of desks in here,

1770
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:50,452
and a lot of maps
on the wall, and--

1771
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:51,954
and a shortwave
radio over there,

1772
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:53,421
and a picture of
what's-his-name,
and--

1773
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,823
maybe they're still here.

1774
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,592
Maybe we just can't see them.

1775
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:57,860
Aw, why don't you
quit being funny.

1776
01:14:57,861 --> 01:14:59,361
I saw them with my own eyes.

1777
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:01,463
Great evidence.
An invisible office.

1778
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:02,865
Hey, you...

1779
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:05,467
What became
of all the stuff
that was in here?

1780
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:07,135
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1781
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:09,071
This has been a storeroom
as long as I've been here.

1782
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:11,139
What are you trying to
tell me? I was in here
only an hour ago and I--

1783
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,141
don't get excited, Gloves.
Take it easy.

1784
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:14,409
Yeah, but this guy's
one of them, too.

1785
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,644
How long you been working here?

1786
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:17,279
Oh, 5 or 6 years.

1787
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,648
He's lying.
I've never seen
him here before.

1788
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:22,117
Anything been moved
out of this room tonight?

1789
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,251
Not that I know of.

1790
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,588
The gentleman must have
another place in mind.

1791
01:15:25,589 --> 01:15:27,055
No, I haven't got any
other place in mind--

1792
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:29,792
now, Gloves, the good little
fairy won't like it.

1793
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:31,326
Gloves,
the elevator--

1794
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:33,796
they must have
moved all the stuff
into the warehouse.

1795
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:35,463
The elevator, that's it.
I forgot all about that.

1796
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,066
Come on, boys.

1797
01:15:39,803 --> 01:15:41,670
Right over here
behind this wall.

1798
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:43,238
How do you get in there, baby?

1799
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,573
There's a switch over here.

1800
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:46,809
Now, you fellas
better stand back.
It opens out that way.

1801
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,210
Gloves,
it's gone.
What?

1802
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,813
There was a button
releasing a spring.

1803
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:52,080
I think I have a clue, folks.

1804
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:53,548
Aladdin dropped in
with his lamp,

1805
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,817
gave it a couple of rubs,

1806
01:15:54,818 --> 01:15:56,084
and the whole thing disappeared.

1807
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:57,720
Now, you got to listen
to me, Forbes--

1808
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,021
I've been listening
to you. Now you
listen to me.

1809
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:00,555
I'll tell you what we'll do.

1810
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,290
We'll all get
on our magic carpet

1811
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,692
and get back to the station.

1812
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:05,794
We'll let the D.A.
Unravel this
in the morning.

1813
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:06,962
But tomorrow morning
will be too late.

1814
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:08,130
We've got to find them tonight.

1815
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:09,632
He's telling you
the truth, lieutenant.

1816
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:10,933
We've got to stop them tonight.

1817
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:12,434
I'm sorry, miss Hamilton.

1818
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:14,837
You're acting
your part fine, but
I'm a bad audience.

1819
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:16,304
Now, I'm booking you
for murder, Gloves,

1820
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,106
and holding
your girlfriend for
further questioning.

1821
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:19,708
I'm telling you
that behind that wall

1822
01:16:19,709 --> 01:16:21,309
there's an elevator
that leads to a warehouse

1823
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,577
in the next block.

1824
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,979
I've had
enough of that--

1825
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,448
elevators, radios,
secret panels!

1826
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:28,785
I'm tired chasing butterflies!

1827
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:32,988
Ok, baby, I guess it's no dice.

1828
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:35,590
The lieutenant
is losing his temper.

1829
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,592
I surrender, dear.

1830
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,262
Come on.

1831
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,066
Wait.

1832
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:45,467
What is it now?

1833
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:47,202
Leda...

1834
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,938
That curtain.

1835
01:16:52,876 --> 01:16:55,477
Oh, the curtain!
Of course!

1836
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:57,012
You gonna start that again?

1837
01:16:57,013 --> 01:17:01,350
No...I think that's
what I been looking for.

1838
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:15,097
What do you see?

1839
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:16,631
Nothing.

1840
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,100
See you later, baby!

1841
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:19,768
Forbes: Come back
here, Gloves!

1842
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:21,169
Don't let him
get away, boys!
Go get him!

1843
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,238
You can't get away
with this, Gloves!

1844
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,841
[Gunshots]

1845
01:17:30,847 --> 01:17:33,249
[Pounding on door]

1846
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,863
Come back, Gloves,
or I'll shoot.

1847
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:51,466
Sunshine:
Hello, hello? Yeah.

1848
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:52,600
Let me talk to Benny.

1849
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,036
Here you are, sunshine.

1850
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:55,670
Hello, Benny?
You seen anything
of Gloves tonight?

1851
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,072
Yeah, we know the cops
are looking for him.

1852
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:58,941
Keeps your lamps open,
and if you see him,

1853
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:00,809
we're waiting at Spats' place.

1854
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,210
Can I use the phone, please?

1855
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:03,812
Go away.
What about yip's place?

1856
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:06,214
I called him.
No soap. I'll try
the golden rule.

1857
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:07,682
Can't I please phone Annabelle?

1858
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,951
Hey, what's eating you?

1859
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:10,218
I'm worried about my honeymoon.

1860
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,987
I just got
married tonight.
So what?

1861
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:13,621
Gloves might be lying
in an alley with a knife
in his back.

1862
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,824
You ought to be
worrying about him,
not your honeymoon.

1863
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,292
Can't I worry about them both?

1864
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,360
Ah, the line's busy.

1865
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:19,962
Can I use the phone,
please, can I, huh?

1866
01:18:19,963 --> 01:18:21,563
All right, call her,
but make it a quickie.

1867
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:22,998
Well, what do we do now?

1868
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,967
The best thing
for Gloves to do
is to get on a plane

1869
01:18:24,968 --> 01:18:26,568
and go as far as it'll take him.

1870
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,136
What kind of a mouthpiece
are you?

1871
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:30,238
You're making
a convict out of him
before they convict him!

1872
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,140
Hey, don't you
start complaining.

1873
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:34,309
You're the guy that
got him mixed up in this
thing from the first.

1874
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,543
Who me?
Yeah, you!

1875
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,246
I told you, we were
at the ball game
this afternoon

1876
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:40,983
when his old lady called up
and told us about that
Miller's cheesecake--

1877
01:18:40,984 --> 01:18:42,717
if I hear that story again,
I'll go nuts.

1878
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,119
Wait a minute.
Hey, fellas, please.

1879
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,720
I'm trying
to converse
with Annabelle.

1880
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,022
Converse, converse!

1881
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:48,656
Don't get
sore, Annabelle.
I can't help it.

1882
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,058
I'm lonesome, too.

1883
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:53,061
I'm doing the very best I can.

1884
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,063
I'm only human, after all.

1885
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,465
I'm at Spats' place,
honest I am!

1886
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:58,801
I'm waiting here for Gloves!

1887
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:00,135
Tell her, will you, fellas?

1888
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:01,703
Forget her!
I'll get you another dame.

1889
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,138
Annabelle, I don't
want another dame.

1890
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:05,207
No, I don't love Gloves
more than I love you.

1891
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,741
Please tell her,
will you, fellas--

1892
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,143
hang up, stupid!

1893
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:09,611
No, Annabelle--
Anna--

1894
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,013
all right, she hung up.

1895
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:12,480
Now you see what you've done?

1896
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,748
She's going to divorce me

1897
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,150
and name Gloves as corespondent.

1898
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:17,152
Don't worry, junior.
You need the experience.

1899
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:18,753
But I haven't had
any experience!

1900
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:19,955
Sunshine:
Hey, Spats!

1901
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,389
What's the matter?

1902
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,126
Quick!
Give a look!

1903
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:28,363
Sunshine: Callahan
and his boys are downstairs.

1904
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:29,597
Uh-oh.

1905
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:30,933
We're wasting our time, boys.

1906
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:32,634
Gloves will never pass
through that picket line.

1907
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:34,136
He'll show.
I'll sign an affidavit.

1908
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:35,770
Hey, fellas, what
about these cowboys?

1909
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,472
I can't hold on
to them much longer.

1910
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:38,941
If I have to listen
to that song once more,
I'll shoot them both.

1911
01:19:38,942 --> 01:19:40,175
And I'll bury them.

1912
01:19:40,176 --> 01:19:41,609
Do me a favor.
Let them go.

1913
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,045
What about the poker game?

1914
01:19:43,046 --> 01:19:44,612
Forget it.
What?
Forget 20 grand?

1915
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,214
Gloves is in a jam,
and that dough will buy
a lot of writs

1916
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:48,050
of surceasement
and habeas corpuses,
ipso facto.

1917
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:49,517
Hey, that's good.

1918
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,786
You take them over.
I'm running out
of double-talk.

1919
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,055
All right, come on.

1920
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:54,789
Cowboys: * home,
home on the range *

1921
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,091
there they are.

1922
01:19:56,092 --> 01:19:58,060
* where the deer and
the antelope play *

1923
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:59,461
how you doing, boys?

1924
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,663
I'll tell you, partner,
I'm getting mighty weary

1925
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:03,065
waiting for this here
Mr. Donahue.

1926
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:05,067
Me, too! I'm all
for hitting the trail

1927
01:20:05,068 --> 01:20:06,668
back to the motel.
Come on!

1928
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:08,070
Now, now, now...
Wait a minute, buck.

1929
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:10,205
It's like I told you.
Mr. Donahue's delayed,

1930
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:12,207
but he'll be up here
any minute now,
right, Starchy?

1931
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:14,076
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keep your spurs on.
After all,

1932
01:20:14,077 --> 01:20:16,678
you can't expect
pyramid aldatia for
Benson all the time.

1933
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,080
Lay off that gab, will you?

1934
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:20,315
Come on,
come on there, Barney.
Cheer up the boys.

1935
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:23,852
Let's whoop it up, wranglers!

1936
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:27,422
All: * home,
home on the range *

1937
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:28,623
[knock on door]

1938
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:32,694
* where the deer
and the antelope play *

1939
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:36,298
come right in.
Come right in.

1940
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:37,499
Hello, Barney.

1941
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,035
Mrs. Donahue,
what are you doing here?

1942
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:41,503
Well, I been looking for Gloves,

1943
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:42,637
and I can't find him.

1944
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:44,506
I been to his apartment
and down to his office,

1945
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,575
and I thought maybe
he might be here.

1946
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:49,844
He just stepped out
for a little air.

1947
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,246
He'll be right back.
Oh.

1948
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:52,714
Why don't you come on in?

1949
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:53,982
Sit down.
There's a nice chair.

1950
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:55,250
You know the boys, don't you?

1951
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:56,684
Good evening,
mother!
Hello, ma.

1952
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,153
How are you,
Mrs. Donahue?

1953
01:20:58,154 --> 01:20:59,988
Barney, I'm that worried
about Gloves.

1954
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:01,990
It says here in the paper
that he killed somebody.

1955
01:21:01,991 --> 01:21:04,426
Oh, they're just
trying to build up
circulation.

1956
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:06,528
Exactly!
Well, I don't
understand it.

1957
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,263
Now, when I come in here
a little while ago,

1958
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:10,732
there was Callahan
and his boys downstairs,

1959
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:12,367
and they tried to search me!

1960
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,602
What?!
They can't do that
without a search
warrant.

1961
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,138
Say, mother, how about
a little drink, huh?

1962
01:21:16,139 --> 01:21:17,739
Fix you a nice
little glass
of Sherry.

1963
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,141
Oh, no, thank you, Barney,

1964
01:21:19,142 --> 01:21:21,176
but I wouldn't mind
a little bit of bicarbonate.

1965
01:21:21,177 --> 01:21:23,478
Oh, yes.
Bicarbonate.
I'll get it.

1966
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:25,014
[All talking]

1967
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,220
[Rustle, thud]

1968
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:40,162
Gloves! Hey, fellas,
it's Gloves!

1969
01:21:40,163 --> 01:21:42,365
It's Gloves, fellas,
it's Gloves!

1970
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:48,972
Hey, Marty.

1971
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:55,177
Now, don't start shooting.

1972
01:21:55,178 --> 01:21:57,513
Let me get my mitts
on him first.

1973
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,184
Gloves: So I do
a beautiful swan dive...

1974
01:22:02,185 --> 01:22:03,718
Quiet.
Into the east river.

1975
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,054
They don't follow
because they figure
I'm at the bottom.

1976
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:09,224
And that's the story up to now.

1977
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:10,858
What's the idea,
Callahan?
Shut up!

1978
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,794
You've got no right
to break in here
like this, you big--

1979
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:14,062
keep out of this, Spats!

1980
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:15,330
This is illegal entry!

1981
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:16,831
Gloves has got a date
with the hot seat,

1982
01:22:16,832 --> 01:22:18,166
and I'm going to see
that he keeps it.

1983
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,567
Son!
It's ok, mom.

1984
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:22,204
Marty, you got me
figured all wrong.

1985
01:22:22,205 --> 01:22:24,072
I didn't kill Joe,
but I know who did--

1986
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:25,673
Pepi, your piano player.

1987
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:26,941
Don't try
to tell me--

1988
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,343
that grease ball
is part of a mob

1989
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:29,877
that makes you and me
look like little Bo-peep,

1990
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:32,080
and they been using
your joint to do
their finagling in.

1991
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:33,415
When did you dream that up?

1992
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,017
Sunshine:
That's no dream.

1993
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:37,085
Gloves is referring
to certain parties
from across the pond.

1994
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:38,686
Yeah. Tracking down
this Hamilton doll,

1995
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,024
I uncovered a nest
of fifth columnists,
fivers, spies to you.

1996
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:43,958
Pepi was one of them.
That's what Joe found out,

1997
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,527
and that's why
Pepi knocked him off.

1998
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:46,961
Well, if that's on
the level, what are
you telling me for?

1999
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,230
Why don't you spill
it to the cops?

2000
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:50,632
I tried to, but no soap.
Now, listen, Marty.

2001
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,367
I know you're no mental giant,

2002
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:54,102
but try to juggle this,
all of you.

2003
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:56,771
I got a firsthand report
tonight on what it's like
on the other side,

2004
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:59,241
from that Hamilton babe,
and brother, I'm telling you,

2005
01:22:59,242 --> 01:23:00,708
we got to watch our steps.

2006
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,345
Those babies are
strictly no good
from way down deep.

2007
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:04,979
They're no bunch
of petty racketeers

2008
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,381
trying to muscle in
on some small territory.

2009
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:07,915
They want to move in wholesale,

2010
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,284
take over the whole country.

2011
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:11,253
So what?
It don't make
no difference to me

2012
01:23:11,254 --> 01:23:13,055
who runs the country
as long as they stay
out of my way.

2013
01:23:13,056 --> 01:23:15,257
That's just it.
They're not going to
stay out of your way.

2014
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:16,724
Oh, yes, they will.

2015
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:18,160
Aw, now, listen, big shot,

2016
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:19,661
they'll tell you
what time you get up
in the morning

2017
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,263
and what time
you go to bed at night.

2018
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:22,697
They'll tell you what you eat,

2019
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:24,532
what kind of clothes
you can wear,
what you drink.

2020
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:26,534
They'll even tell you
the morning paper
you can read.

2021
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:28,303
They can't do that.
It's against the law.

2022
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:30,004
Yes, it's unconstitutional.

2023
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,439
How do we know
you ain't making
this up?

2024
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,041
Why don't you read the papers?

2025
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:34,709
It's on the front page
every day.

2026
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:37,145
Every order that Berlin
dishes out, these babies
follow through.

2027
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:38,746
Up to now, we've had
only the preliminaries,

2028
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:40,148
but tonight's the main bout.

2029
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:42,417
We got to
find out what it is
and stop it quick,

2030
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:44,886
and I need your help.
What do you say?

2031
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:46,288
Ok, count us in.

2032
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:47,789
Good.
Give me that coat.

2033
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,891
Cowboy: I'll help you
track down them coyotes,
partner.

2034
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:51,293
I tackled them in 1918,

2035
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:52,827
and I ain't afraid
to tackle them now.

2036
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:55,297
Me, too. They going
to make a warmonger
out of me yet.

2037
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:56,598
The first one of
those guys I tag,

2038
01:23:56,599 --> 01:23:58,166
I'm going to kick him
right in the swastika.

2039
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,434
Callahan:
Where do we go?

2040
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:00,702
That's what I got to find out.

2041
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,170
Spats, you round up
everybody we know.

2042
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:03,438
Barney and sunshine,
you come with me.

2043
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:05,039
I'll call you back
in a few minutes.

2044
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,441
Mrs. Donahue:
Be careful, son!

2045
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:07,709
Where are we
going to look for
these lugs, coach?

2046
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,911
You said the antique joint
was cleared out.

2047
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:11,313
That's right,
but the kid will know.

2048
01:24:11,314 --> 01:24:12,914
They got her in
the 47th street police station.

2049
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:14,782

We were forced to meet here

because of an indiscretion

destroy their confidence.

this by an action

as the one planned for tonight.

Now...The vessel
will sail at 4:27.

01:30:48,577 --> 01:30:51,312
It will proceed
from the Brooklyn Navy yard,

And according to our plan,

2154
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:05,727
the vessel will reach
the minefield

at approximately 5:15.

Yes, doctor?

5:21, to be exact.

2159
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,603
Based on the coast
guard tide reports,

2160
01:31:15,604 --> 01:31:17,872
it is a mathematical
certainty that,

2161
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:19,741
barring unforeseen events,

2162
01:31:19,742 --> 01:31:21,743
we can hardly be a second off.

something about it.

I was told you inspected
the mines tonight.

2226

Oh, yes, yeah.
We gave the mines

Well, the way
I figure it is, uh...

2239
01:34:49,818 --> 01:34:51,685
Oh, yeah. The stratavan
is on the paratoot

the mockters prockters.

That is correct, Herr Schroeder.

2242
01:34:54,256 --> 01:34:55,957
The stratavan is definitely
on the paratoot

the mockters prockters

to my calculations,

we'll be ok, right?

near the warehouse.

2368
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:25,379
Thanks for the tip, lady.
I'll put in a plug for you.

2369
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,980
Coach! How'd it go?

2370
01:41:26,981 --> 01:41:28,382
Coach! Everything
all right?

2371
01:41:28,383 --> 01:41:29,816
Yeah. Take Leda
over to my joint

2372
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:31,685
and turn this dame
over to the cops.
With pleasure.

2373
01:41:31,686 --> 01:41:32,687
So long, kid.

2375
01:42:17,265 --> 01:42:18,766
[Footsteps]

2376
01:42:39,421 --> 01:42:42,423
I hope you find it
interesting,
Mr. Donahue.

2377
01:42:42,424 --> 01:42:44,024
Drop your gun.

2378
01:42:44,025 --> 01:42:46,427
Did you hear me?
Drop it.

2379
01:42:46,428 --> 01:42:48,263
Get your hands up.

2380
01:42:49,597 --> 01:42:53,301
Pardon my curiosity,
but what is all this?

2381
01:42:54,202 --> 01:42:55,602
Explosives.

2382
01:42:55,603 --> 01:42:57,604
High explosives,
Mr. Donahue,

2383
01:42:57,605 --> 01:42:59,606
for the newest
American battleship.

2384
01:42:59,607 --> 01:43:02,743
Looks like a little bit
of flash Gordon, to me.

2385
01:43:02,744 --> 01:43:06,647
You don't think you can
sink one of them big boats
all by yourself, do you?

2386
01:43:06,648 --> 01:43:09,216
Why not? One man,
if he's inspired,

2387
01:43:09,217 --> 01:43:11,685
can change the world.
Get into the boat.

2388
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:12,753
What for?

2389
01:43:12,754 --> 01:43:14,888
Since you have been kind
enough to follow me,

2390
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:17,157
I shall take advantage
of your services.

2391
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:18,492
Get in.

2392
01:43:18,493 --> 01:43:20,361
I could very easily
kill you, Mr. Donahue.

2393
01:43:20,362 --> 01:43:22,964
Don't tempt me.
Take the wheel.

2394
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:39,112
And now you will see,
Mr. Donahue,

2395
01:43:39,113 --> 01:43:42,249
what kind of man
the new order breeds.

2396
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,851
Get underway.

2397
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:52,793
You don't think
I'm going to sit here
and drive this canoe

2398
01:43:52,794 --> 01:43:54,661
into one of our
battle wagons, do you?

2399
01:43:54,662 --> 01:43:56,263
If you make one false move,

2400
01:43:56,264 --> 01:43:57,798
I'll kill you
and take the wheel myself,

2401
01:43:57,799 --> 01:43:59,533
so you might as well
do as I say.

2402
01:43:59,534 --> 01:44:01,668
Them boats ain't made
out of tissue paper.

2403
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:03,404
Are you sure this stuff
is going to work?

2404
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:05,672
Not even the steel plates
of your battleships

2405
01:44:05,673 --> 01:44:07,741
can withstand
these new explosives.

2406
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:08,710
What do we do,

2407
01:44:08,711 --> 01:44:10,411
dump this stuff
over the side and run?

2408
01:44:10,412 --> 01:44:11,878
There will be no time for that.

2409
01:44:11,879 --> 01:44:13,179
What do you mean?

2410
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,149
We'll strike the ship
the moment the explosion
occurs.

2411
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:17,551
Yes, Mr. Donahue.

2412
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:20,654
In a few minutes,
you and I and Hansel
will die.

2413
01:44:20,655 --> 01:44:22,055
You're not afraid
to die, are you?

2414
01:44:22,056 --> 01:44:23,424
I don't mind dying,

2415
01:44:23,425 --> 01:44:26,159
but I hate
to be divided up
into small pieces.

2416
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,762
There she is.

2417
01:44:36,304 --> 01:44:39,440
Now bear toward
the center of the ship.

2418
01:44:39,441 --> 01:44:40,974
Now faster!

2419
01:44:40,975 --> 01:44:42,709
Brother,
I hate to tell you,
but you're nuts.

2420
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:45,178
You fool--it's our
destiny to conquer,

2421
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:46,648
and no one can stop us.

2422
01:44:47,649 --> 01:44:50,183
Go on!
Faster now! Faster!

2423
01:44:50,184 --> 01:44:52,118
Go on!

2424
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:53,955
Faster! Go on!
Faster!

2425
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:10,337
Yes, Mr. mayor.
Yes, sir.

2426
01:45:10,338 --> 01:45:12,739
Donahue's in my office
right now. He's ok.

2427
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:15,342
That motorboat
smashed into a barge
loaded with lumber,

2428
01:45:15,343 --> 01:45:16,943
made toothpicks out of it.

2429
01:45:16,944 --> 01:45:18,345
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.

2430
01:45:18,346 --> 01:45:19,746
Whatever you say,
Mr. mayor.

2431
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:21,247
Yes, sir, you're right.

2432
01:45:21,248 --> 01:45:23,884
That's what I been
saying for years.
We got to wake up.

2433
01:45:23,885 --> 01:45:25,819
Yes, sir.
I'll tell him right away.

2434
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,020
Yes, sir!

2435
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:28,389
What's up, Forbes?

2436
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:30,357
Yes, how about the D.A.?
What's he going to say
about this?

2437
01:45:30,358 --> 01:45:32,359
Take it easy, boys.
Take it easy.

2438
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:35,362
Come on. Break it up.
Break it up.

2439
01:45:35,363 --> 01:45:37,097
I've got a message
for you, Mr. Donahue.

2440
01:45:37,098 --> 01:45:38,399
Ok, sweetheart, spill it.

2441
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,933
The D.A. Says

2442
01:45:39,934 --> 01:45:41,768
the charges against you
and your girlfriend
are dropped.

2443
01:45:41,769 --> 01:45:43,770
The chief says
you're a free man.

2444
01:45:43,771 --> 01:45:46,773
And the mayor says
as soon as he can
find his fire helmet,

2445
01:45:46,774 --> 01:45:48,509
he'll meet you at the city hall.

2446
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:49,943
Well, how about that.

2447
01:45:49,944 --> 01:45:51,578
Looks like
you're national hero
number one, Gloves.

2448
01:45:51,579 --> 01:45:52,813
Reporter: What's
the next stop,
Mr. Donahue?

2449
01:45:52,814 --> 01:45:54,415
Are you invited
to the white house?

2450
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:55,582
Second reporter:
I hear you're going
to work for the F.B.I.?

2451
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:56,817
Well, I'll tell you,
boys--

2452
01:45:56,818 --> 01:45:58,385
how do you feel about
this, miss Hamilton?

2453
01:45:58,386 --> 01:45:59,786
Yes, let's hear your story.

2454
01:45:59,787 --> 01:46:01,922
Well, I feel a little
like the Princess

2455
01:46:01,923 --> 01:46:04,525
who's been
rescued from the dragon
by the white knight.

2456
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:07,528
Aw, that's you, Gloves.
You're the white knight.

2457
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:08,962
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2458
01:46:08,963 --> 01:46:12,733
Anybody that prints that
can expect the usual trouble.

2459
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:13,934
What else?
Go ahead.

2460
01:46:13,935 --> 01:46:15,802
Well, I also feel
it's about time

2461
01:46:15,803 --> 01:46:18,271
someone knocked
the axis back
on its heels.

2462
01:46:18,272 --> 01:46:20,474
Excuse me, baby.
What she means is,

2463
01:46:20,475 --> 01:46:24,411
it's about time somebody
knocked those heels
back on their axis.

2464
01:46:24,412 --> 01:46:26,613
See you later,
chief. Mom!

2465
01:46:26,614 --> 01:46:29,282
Hello, son.
Are you all right?

2466
01:46:29,283 --> 01:46:30,551
Sure, I'm ok.

2467
01:46:30,552 --> 01:46:32,018
Oh, something
terrible's happened.

2468
01:46:32,019 --> 01:46:33,086
Yeah?
What is it now?

2469
01:46:33,087 --> 01:46:34,688
5 will get you 10
the milkman disappeared.

2470
01:46:34,689 --> 01:46:36,423
How'd you know?
Didn't I tell you?

2471
01:46:36,424 --> 01:46:37,958
It's true.
He didn't come
home last night,

2472
01:46:37,959 --> 01:46:39,693
and I'm afraid
something's
happened to him.

2473
01:46:39,694 --> 01:46:41,428
Oh, what makes you think that?

2474
01:46:41,429 --> 01:46:43,229
Well, son,
I've got a feeling--

2475
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:46,768
all: And when
you've got a feeling,
you've got a feeling.
