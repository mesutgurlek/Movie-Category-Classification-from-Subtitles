1
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:09,702
Our bosun's mate.
Been on quite a bender tonight.

2
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:20,213
Who are those pigs?

3
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:37,138
Their fireboat drill.
They're all from my boat.

4
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:02,863
Captain.

5
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:13,416
Marten's crew.
They move out at dawn.

6
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:25,222
lt's time to find ourselves
a little French quail.

7
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:30,741
Do you know how to flush it out?

8
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:36,023
They're scared. They comfort
themselves in women and schnapps.

9
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:40,973
- What's going on here?
- Ready ... Fire!

10
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:52,813
- Sir.
- My second officer.

11
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:59,741
This is Lieutenant Werner.
War correspondent.

12
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:06,900
He'll ship out with us, and report
the truth about life on a submarine.

13
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:12,698
- Welcome on board, Lieutenant.
- Good evening.

14
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:21,502
Come and have a drink with us.

15
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,935
- Good evening, Captain.
- Two beers, please.

16
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:47,458
Where's our friend Thomsen?
He should be celebrating his medal.

17
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:54,138
Have you talked to your wife?

18
00:05:57,063 --> 00:06:01,534
No calls to Germany
before 10 o'clock.

19
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,616
- Two beers.
- Thanks.

20
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,781
Captain.

21
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,335
My report from U96, sir.
All provisions and arms aboard.

22
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:24,462
- Thank you.
- One more thing, Captain.

23
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:32,934
On the way here
some of the crew molested me.

24
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:38,496
lt was ... quite outrageous.

25
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:42,771
- They stopped me and ...
- You were initiated?

26
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:48,373
- Exactly.
- Me, too.

27
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:58,298
May l have your attention?
Silence would be appreciated!

28
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:04,254
l'd like to call on Lt. Thomsen,
our latest hero!

29
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:21,982
Thomsen is from the old guard.
He's always drunk now.

30
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:46,252
Quiet in this whorehouse!

31
00:07:53,983 --> 00:08:01,776
To our wonderful ... abstaining ...
womanless Fuhrer, -

32
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:08,178
- who rose gloriously
from an apprentice painter -

33
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,094
- to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

34
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:16,778
lsn't it true?

35
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:25,453
He's a great naval expert.
Who, in his infinite wisdom ...

36
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:37,412
How does it go again?

37
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:43,499
Our great Fuhrer has been showing
their English bed-wetter ...

38
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:48,100
... the cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill ...

39
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:54,975
... where exactly to go
and stick his stinking cigars.

40
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,697
Excuse me.

41
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:40,220
l'll see you in the morning.
l must phone home.

42
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:58,776
Phillip, the old bunch has gone.

43
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:06,338
Look at these new heroes.
All wind and smoke. Big mouths.

44
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:09,620
Yeah, yeah ...

45
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:14,413
Cheeks together.
Balls in hand.

46
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:19,498
And the belief in our Fuhrer
in their eyes.

47
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:22,735
They will know in time.

48
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:15,301
Combat! Conquer! Order!

49
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:35,377
Come on, Phillip.
Give me a hand. Help me get him up.

50
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:47,577
l wanted to really ...
screw my brains out tonight, -

51
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:52,134
- but l'm not
in any condition to fuck.

52
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:10,733
That's Thomsen's boat.
Find anything wrong with our boat?

53
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:15,931
- The propeller plate was banged.
- l see.

54
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:22,815
- That explains the whining noise.
- We've got a brand new one.

55
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:57,614
That's our boat.

56
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:05,655
Stand by for inspection! Attention!
Eyes left!

57
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:17,257
All hands present and accounted for.
The boat is clear for sea, Captain.

58
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:20,654
Thank you, Number One.

59
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:28,342
At ease.

60
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:48,096
Well, men ...

61
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:52,697
- All set?
- All set, sir!

62
00:13:55,463 --> 00:14:01,015
We have a guest on board.
Lt. Werner.

63
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:07,941
A war correspondent.
He has even brought his camera.

64
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:20,852
He is writing about war heroes.
See you remember your manners.

65
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:27,053
- Aye-aye, sir!
- Harbour stations, men.

66
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:16,932
Sink them all!

67
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:41,583
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.

68
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:46,418
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.

69
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,417
Fish store, where we maintain
and store the torpedoes.

70
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,735
- You're going to be in the papers!
- Thank you, men.

71
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:59,897
Follow me. Here we have the can.
Just one for 50 men.

72
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:05,774
The other one's full of provisions.
You can't eat shit. Logical, no?

73
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:13,497
Here's the Chief Petty Officer's
quarters. My home away from home.

74
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:18,532
- l've brought plenty of books.
- You have it really cosy here.

75
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:23,652
- Where are you, Lieutenant?
- l hope you don't get sea sick.

76
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:29,853
Here's the radio and the hydrophone.
The eyes and ears of the boat.

77
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:35,700
Here's the control room.
The boat's command post.

78
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:42,098
Through here, Lieutenant.

79
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:46,220
Wake up, you've got company.

80
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:49,693
Good morning, Lieutenant.

81
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:53,936
The petty officers' bunk
sleeps 12 men.

82
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:57,698
Two to a bunk.
One sleeps while one is on duty.

83
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:02,891
One man comes off watch and
climbs into the other man's stink.

84
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:08,342
You've got a bunk to yourself
since you're a guest on board.

85
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:12,781
- Here.
- This is your escape gear.

86
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:18,575
- You can use it in the shower.
- The mask helps out with the stink.

87
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:22,452
Of Frenssen's feet!

88
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:26,013
Come on.

89
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:33,382
This is our galley.
And here's Johann, our phantom.

90
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:40,456
Johann, everything in order?

91
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:46,615
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

92
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:10,140
lt's better to take photos
on our return from the mission.

93
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,773
What do you mean?

94
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:17,731
They'll have grown beards by then.

95
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,858
The British will be ashamed
to see these shaven faces.

96
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:38,132
Pale-faced kids.
lnnocents dragged from mama's skirt.

97
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:46,182
Sailing with them
makes you feel so old.

98
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:53,736
lt's like a children's crusade.

99
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:05,217
- Permission to pass, sir.
- Carry on.

100
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:09,171
- <i>Bon appetit</i>
- Thank you.

101
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:36,820
- From Mexico, aren't you?
- Yes. South of Mexico City.

102
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:43,536
- Good there?
- Very nice. Good climate.

103
00:19:55,503 --> 00:20:01,817
- Quite a way.
- As a German, l had to come.

104
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:09,580
- Did you work there?
- On my step-parents' plantation.

105
00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:15,700
- You're the boss's son?
- You could say so.

106
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:22,180
- <i>Stand by, fiirst watch.</i>
- Excuse me.

107
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:27,737
Can l get by?

108
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:39,253
Permission to go on watch, Captain.

109
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:47,891
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.

110
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,661
A young machine.
He follows orders without question.

111
00:20:55,823 --> 00:21:01,295
He's so uptight he could
crack nuts with his butt cheeks.

112
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:17,014
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

113
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:19,856
Stand by main vents.

114
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:30,415
- Shut out main engines!
- All hands forward!

115
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:37,216
All hands forward!
Come on, move it.

116
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:42,537
Come on, move! Move! Faster!

117
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:45,740
Get a move on, you guys!

118
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:52,579
lt's an alarm, not a blasted cruise!
Get into diving positions!

119
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:12,493
Blow negative tank.

120
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:18,336
Stern planes ease to 10 degrees.

121
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:34,298
Not bad. Practice makes perfect.
lt keeps you from getting rusty.

122
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:37,057
A practice drill.

123
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:44,179
- Level off, Chief.
- Bow up 15. Stern up 10.

124
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,540
Planes on zero.

125
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:53,702
- Levelled off, sir.
- Shut all main vents.

126
00:22:54,863 --> 00:23:01,302
- Main vents shut.
- Dive. Let's see how she does.

127
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:05,781
Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

128
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:21,618
The boat is rated to 90 metres,
but of course we could go deeper.

129
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:36,862
There's a limit somewhere.
We can only take so much pressure -

130
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:42,222
- before the boat will be crushed.

131
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:58,500
Check all valves.

132
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:05,013
Check all valves.

133
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:08,812
- The pressure.
- Yeah, sure.

134
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:19,055
Deeper.

135
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:23,659
140 metres.

136
00:24:28,623 --> 00:24:33,743
- She must take this depth.
- 150.

137
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,340
160 metres.

138
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:52,892
- That'll do for now. Surface.
- Bow up 10. Stern up 5.

139
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:56,214
Ourjournalist is sweating.

140
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:38,534
Your girl?

141
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:45,059
French girl?

142
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:57,616
Do you know the flower shop
beside Café A l'Ami Pierrot?

143
00:25:57,783 --> 00:26:01,662
- A l'Ami Pierrot.
- Sure, l know it.

144
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:05,862
The two pretty salesgirls.
Jeannette and ...

145
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,060
Francoise.

146
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:14,942
Nobody knows ... but we're engaged.

147
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:18,061
Unofficially.

148
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:26,860
Can l see?

149
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,256
Very pretty. Really.

150
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,614
What's wrong?

151
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:47,213
She's pregnant.

152
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:54,452
Don't you know what that means?

153
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:58,696
lf the resistance finds out?
A German baby.

154
00:26:58,863 --> 00:27:05,575
l told her,
but she wants to have it.

155
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:13,334
- She wants a baby.
- You've got problems, friend.

156
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:06,018
Our masters spend all their time
finding Churchill new nicknames.

157
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:08,902
What's the latest?

158
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:15,179
Drunken pig.

159
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:18,255
Fat boy.

160
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:21,415
Paralytic.

161
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:26,577
For a drunken paralytic
he's putting up a damn good fight.

162
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:32,340
We'll cut the swine to shreds.
That is my firm belief.

163
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:42,815
Listen, smart guy. Mr. Churchill
is a long way from shreds.

164
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:49,021
l'd like to know how many
of his ships are getting through -

165
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:53,415
- while we sit on our behinds
waiting for orders.

166
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:57,496
Our patrol planes.
Where are they, Herr Göring?

167
00:28:57,663 --> 00:29:04,535
The British have plenty of them.
Talking big is all he's good for.

168
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:13,341
Big heroes.
Nothing but hot air ... all of them.

169
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:28,098
Put that one down. lt'll make
exciting reading in your epic.

170
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:35,455
The Propaganda Ministry
will love it.

171
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:39,013
Music we need.

172
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:44,576
Do you think our Hitler Youth leader
might put a record on for us?

173
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:51,297
The ''Tipperary'' song
if you have no objections.

174
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:05,895
- That stuff makes me puke.
- Now we're in the Royal Navy.

175
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:19,819
A record won't make you
into the king of England.

176
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:38,416
- Shut the door, you lazy pig!
- Stupid jerk!

177
00:30:39,783 --> 00:30:45,733
They should use him as a doorstop,
his rear end's big enough.

178
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:52,900
One day he'll stick it in the can
and he'll never get it out again.

179
00:30:56,183 --> 00:31:01,416
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.

180
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:06,853
- lt stinks in here.
- Sweaty feet and hair grease.

181
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:11,414
Pilgrim's specialty.

182
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:23,013
Smells just like old socks ...
these rotten eggs.

183
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:31,379
- Baby poo-poo.
- Pilgrim needs a chicken house.

184
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:35,377
Right. Ducks in the bilge.
Sweet little ducklings.

185
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:40,617
We could fatten them up
with jam from your filthy feet.

186
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:48,258
They'd have good fun
feeding on Frenssen's toe jam.

187
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:22,661
Aid to cleanliness, four letters?

188
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:27,898
Bath.

189
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:32,341
Thank you.

190
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,940
A desert animal with two humps?

191
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:47,902
- Camel.
- Perfect.

192
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:02,854
lntellectual starvation l would say.

193
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:14,016
lt's completed, sir. Signal decoded.

194
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:24,979
One moment.

195
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:58,852
lt could just about do it.
Five, six, seven ...

196
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:04,415
- Eight.
- New course, sir?

197
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:11,621
One minute.

198
00:34:15,223 --> 00:34:18,932
What's the signal position, sir?

199
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:27,580
''Convoy square at AK 22,46.''

200
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:33,375
''Mean course: 60 degrees.
Speed: 8 knots. U-boat 37.''

201
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:38,219
U-boat 37. That's Marten's boat
moving in to attack.

202
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:48,538
- Too far away. We'd never make it.
- Bad luck.

203
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:54,692
Damn it!
When do we get some orders?

204
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:08,222
Come on, pull it out!
Slap more grease on it!

205
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:13,298
- For yourjournal?
- Yes, wonderful stuff.

206
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:16,455
You there, this way a moment.

207
00:35:16,623 --> 00:35:22,380
lt's nicely greased with vaseline.
We're ready to ram it in!

208
00:35:22,543 --> 00:35:27,822
Can you just look this way?
Yes, good.

209
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:35,900
Not quite so fast. This way. Great!

210
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:41,854
Stay here in the foreground.
Let's have some with a different ...

211
00:35:53,463 --> 00:35:56,455
Who did that?

212
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:01,297
Who did that?

213
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:52,015
Tell me now ...
Have you got any hairs up your nose?

214
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:57,900
- Why?
- l've got some up mine.

215
00:36:58,063 --> 00:37:02,022
Maybe we could knit them together.

216
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:15,019
''2nd November, 1941.
Dear Francoise ...''

217
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:33,171
''20th day at sea.''

218
00:37:33,343 --> 00:37:37,734
- Alarm!
- Alarm!

219
00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:44,098
- Hatch secured!
- All main vents open!

220
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:49,178
- Shadow off the starboard beam.
- Take her down 30 metres.

221
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:54,656
Bring her up easy.
Planes on zero.

222
00:37:54,823 --> 00:38:00,659
- Anything on the starboard beam?
- Propeller sounds.

223
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:12,021
1 10 degrees.

224
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:19,812
Way aft of us.

225
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:31,572
Contact growing fainter.

226
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:42,374
Fading fast, sir.

227
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:55,575
Right ... we'd better stay down now.
Steer 120.

228
00:38:59,823 --> 00:39:05,819
A lone ship traveling fast.
We have no chance in this light.

229
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:33,062
''lt's more than superficial to take
care in personal appearance.''

230
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:38,581
''lt denotes that the inner man
is wholesome and upstanding.''

231
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:45,660
''An officer should be unpretentious
in his dress and deportment.''

232
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:50,658
''ln the old days young officers
were treated indulgently in this.''

233
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:56,181
''Knowing they risked their lives,
their superiors ...''

234
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:59,221
lt's comfortable here.

235
00:39:59,383 --> 00:40:03,217
No mail. No telephone.

236
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:09,572
A well-ventilated boat.
Solid wood panelling.

237
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:17,536
Free food, too.
We're in clover here.

238
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:21,742
Like fresh horse droppings.

239
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:27,978
They're rolling in clover, too.
No need to work.

240
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:32,182
They're even allowed to smoke.

241
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:57,100
U-boat special cocktail.
Want some?

242
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,415
Stop that!

243
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:33,498
Our recent triumphs.

244
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:37,542
''Dived to evade enemy aircraft.''

245
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:43,778
''Dived to avoid destroyer.
Depth charged.''

246
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:53,297
The British
have stopped making mistakes.

247
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:04,734
Cut off extra supply of fuel
to the engines!

248
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:13,933
Torpedo rooms ...
check the gyro-angles.

249
00:42:20,423 --> 00:42:27,215
- Watch out!
- Check periscope alignment.

250
00:42:27,383 --> 00:42:32,980
- What's going on?
- Here we go, girls.

251
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:38,422
U-32 has spotted a British convoy.
We should be there in 10 hours.

252
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:50,942
<i>U</i> - <i>32 is operating against a convoy.</i>
<i>We are joining in the hunt</i>

253
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:55,540
<i>Contact expected</i>
<i>any time after 18:00 hours.</i>

254
00:42:56,303 --> 00:42:59,693
These beauties
are ready for blast off.

255
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:05,097
Over 30 freighters.

256
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:10,462
Berthold is waiting for us to
arrive. He's following the convoy.

257
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:18,212
For me it's the best thrill
with U-boats and sailing ships.

258
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:21,500
Skimming across the sea.

259
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:28,853
l've sailed on a schooner.
Roomy. Holds as big as churches.

260
00:43:35,703 --> 00:43:40,902
- That's a fine way to waste fuel.
- Lunatic!

261
00:43:47,263 --> 00:43:50,175
Damn this weather!

262
00:43:56,063 --> 00:44:00,500
We could pass the British completely
without seeing them.

263
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:07,740
We should be within range.
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?

264
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:13,978
Why haven't we heard from H.Q.?

265
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:20,538
Visibility is nil, sir.
lt's useless!

266
00:44:26,223 --> 00:44:29,533
Prepare to dive!

267
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,773
Clear the bridge now!

268
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:45,659
Diving positions.
Stand by main vents.

269
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:13,623
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.

270
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:19,778
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.

271
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:25,973
Bow planes zero. Stern zero.

272
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:30,455
What's up? Why are we diving?

273
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:33,342
A hydrophone check.

274
00:45:33,503 --> 00:45:38,293
ln bad weather you can hear more
than you can see on the surface.

275
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:43,981
Stern planes up 5.
Easy. Both planes zero.

276
00:46:15,423 --> 00:46:19,132
Can't you make a contact?

277
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:33,053
Nothing?

278
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:22,532
Captain, come here.

279
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:29,131
Contact bearing 060. Quite faint.

280
00:47:43,343 --> 00:47:46,779
Depth charges.

281
00:47:48,303 --> 00:47:52,216
They are blasting someone.

282
00:47:57,503 --> 00:48:01,621
What's the bearing from us now.

283
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:09,699
Moving right. 045 degrees.

284
00:48:09,863 --> 00:48:13,538
Moving away from us.

285
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:24,536
- Surface. Steer 330.
- All ahead two-thirds.

286
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:30,494
Note this in our log book. Despite
bad weather, commencing operation.

287
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:06,655
Damn this stinking weather!
How does it look?

288
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:17,336
- The enemy should be here.
- Freighter on the starboard bow.

289
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:28,413
- Over there! 040 and closing.
- Damn it!

290
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:40,695
That's no freighter.
Oh no! A destroyer!

291
00:49:41,343 --> 00:49:46,258
lt's coming straight at us.
Clear the bridge.

292
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:55,053
Take her down!

293
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:01,372
Diving stations.

294
00:50:03,663 --> 00:50:09,932
- Come to periscope depth.
- All planes up 10.

295
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,857
Steady at 2 metres.

296
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:32,536
Both planes zero.

297
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:41,981
Stern down 5.

298
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:46,057
Come up.

299
00:51:05,903 --> 00:51:09,976
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.

300
00:51:10,143 --> 00:51:14,102
- Stand by battle stations.
- Out of the way, damn it!

301
00:51:14,263 --> 00:51:17,414
Gangway!

302
00:51:19,023 --> 00:51:22,572
Faster! Faster!

303
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:33,099
Keep her level, Chief.

304
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:47,336
- Flood tubes one to four.
- Flood tubes one to four.

305
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:54,179
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.

306
00:51:56,103 --> 00:52:01,700
- Watch your depth, Chief.
- Bow planes up 2. Stern down 2.

307
00:52:04,943 --> 00:52:08,379
Come on.

308
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:14,493
Both planes come to zero.
13.5 metres.

309
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:20,011
Open bow caps now.

310
00:52:32,063 --> 00:52:39,378
Enemy's speed: 10.
Range: 6,000.

311
00:52:39,543 --> 00:52:42,615
Depth: 2 metres.

312
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:49,052
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread torpedoes one and three.

313
00:52:49,223 --> 00:52:52,454
Spread shots one and three.

314
00:52:53,223 --> 00:52:57,341
Tubes one through four are ready.

315
00:53:19,223 --> 00:53:24,251
Damn it! What happened to them?

316
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:41,903
Close bow caps! Dive!

317
00:53:49,703 --> 00:53:54,458
Depth charges dropped.

318
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:11,294
- Get some fuses, quick!
- Check all valves and closures.

319
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:40,053
No serious damage.

320
00:54:43,143 --> 00:54:47,182
They must've spotted our periscope.

321
00:54:47,343 --> 00:54:52,815
- Control room all secure.
- lncredible in this sea.

322
00:55:19,223 --> 00:55:25,492
- ls it getting louder?
- lt seems constant. Ahead of us.

323
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:32,261
280.

324
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:46,573
280 minus 35 ...

325
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:59,382
- lt's pulling further ahead. 295.
- Left full rudder.

326
00:56:02,063 --> 00:56:07,695
- Rudder is left full.
- Steer due north.

327
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:11,856
- Deeper, Chief.
- Bow planes down 15. Stern up 10.

328
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:18,656
- Pump 200 litres forward.
- Steering due north, sir.

329
00:56:20,663 --> 00:56:27,341
- 200 litres forward.
- Main motors ahead one-third.

330
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:35,739
Now it gets psychological, friends.

331
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:37,214
Easy, men.
There's more to come yet.

332
00:57:50,023 --> 00:57:54,016
Kill unnecessary lights.

333
00:57:59,063 --> 00:58:04,535
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines at 50 rpm.

334
00:58:04,703 --> 00:58:08,173
Both engines indicate 50 rpm.

335
00:58:21,303 --> 00:58:27,822
Contact coming closer.
Starboard bow. Closing fast.

336
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:32,374
Main engines full ahead.
Right full rudder.

337
00:58:35,183 --> 00:58:38,619
Both main engines ahead full.

338
00:58:55,823 --> 00:59:00,021
They're coming straight for us.

339
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:14,698
- He knows what he's doing. Deeper.
- Bow down 20. Stern up 5.

340
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:52,460
- Destroyer almost above us.
- Deeper, Chief. Quick.

341
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:03,301
DEPTH GAUGE

342
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:14,421
Don't be afraid.
lt's only the pressure.

343
01:00:22,663 --> 01:00:27,020
- Deeper.
- Stern up 15.

344
01:00:48,903 --> 01:00:51,940
150 metres.

345
01:00:54,263 --> 01:00:57,221
Hurry!

346
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:05,416
- Tighten that flange.
- Bring her up to 150 metres.

347
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:09,815
Forward up 20. Stern down.10.

348
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:17,378
Come on, Frenssen, quickly!
Get the damn thing tightened!

349
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:42,893
Hull valves secured.
Both planes read zero.

350
01:01:45,463 --> 01:01:49,502
Level at 150 metres.

351
01:02:00,103 --> 01:02:05,621
Becoming louder.
She's turned around. 055.

352
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:18,491
Go on, get it over.

353
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:26,578
Contact closing fast.

354
01:02:33,823 --> 01:02:39,898
They are above us ...
just above us.

355
01:03:06,343 --> 01:03:10,222
Contact fading to starboard.

356
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:22,735
22.

357
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:33,142
- 23.
- They are far away.

358
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:44,732
Contact receding aft.

359
01:03:51,463 --> 01:03:55,376
l can barely hear it.

360
01:04:12,463 --> 01:04:17,139
- Now?
- lt has passed us by.

361
01:04:28,183 --> 01:04:31,334
l think that will be all, this time.

362
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:41,215
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.

363
01:04:43,623 --> 01:04:52,531
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- All compartments report damage.

364
01:05:12,823 --> 01:05:15,940
From my private collection.

365
01:05:28,863 --> 01:05:32,822
- How is the engine room?
- Smashed up badly.

366
01:05:32,983 --> 01:05:37,977
- Will you be able to patch her up?
- l've already started.

367
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:44,059
Make it good. l've got a feeling
we're going to see some action.

368
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:58,135
Nothing?

369
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:19,293
- We've waited over an hour now.
- l guess we have shaken them off.

370
01:06:19,463 --> 01:06:26,141
Don't be too sure. He could
have stopped and be waiting -

371
01:06:26,303 --> 01:06:33,937
- to surprise us when we surface.
Not dumb, the British.

372
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:38,301
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark, we'll surface.

373
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,580
l see better in the dark.

374
01:06:41,743 --> 01:06:44,303
Captain.

375
01:06:47,743 --> 01:06:50,177
Thanks.

376
01:06:57,903 --> 01:07:03,819
- What's it like up top?
- lt's dark.

377
01:07:05,783 --> 01:07:12,302
- Go up to 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 15. Stern up 5.

378
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:16,502
90, 80 ...

379
01:07:16,663 --> 01:07:21,179
70, 60 metres.

380
01:07:21,783 --> 01:07:25,617
50. Coming up fast.

381
01:07:26,183 --> 01:07:33,214
- Sound check at 30.
- She's level at 30 metres.

382
01:07:43,943 --> 01:07:46,935
Well?

383
01:07:50,263 --> 01:07:53,619
Periscope depth.

384
01:07:57,623 --> 01:08:03,573
Bow up 3.
Stern down five.

385
01:08:07,303 --> 01:08:10,136
Zero.

386
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,177
- Surface.
- All set to blow.

387
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,742
Cut it out! All this damn noise!

388
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:34,220
- l've got bad news, men.
- What's up now?

389
01:09:35,863 --> 01:09:39,094
Our team is losing.

390
01:09:41,063 --> 01:09:44,612
5-0.

391
01:09:46,823 --> 01:09:50,418
Not a chance
of making the finals now.

392
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:54,019
lt can't be! l don't believe it!

393
01:10:02,383 --> 01:10:05,693
Drop 'em!

394
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:30,018
You dirty little boy. Crabs!

395
01:10:30,663 --> 01:10:36,420
A whole army of them. They'll eat
your winkie down to the bone.

396
01:10:40,183 --> 01:10:43,778
Give him a go with gun powder!

397
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:52,132
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

398
01:11:14,663 --> 01:11:18,736
This meat needs a shave.

399
01:11:22,503 --> 01:11:27,497
What are those things
crawling about on your eyebrows?

400
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:32,100
- Pardon?
- You'd better see the medic.

401
01:11:32,263 --> 01:11:36,017
Crabs by the look of them.

402
01:11:41,383 --> 01:11:47,458
When the creatures begin to surface,
it's the fifth stage.

403
01:11:57,103 --> 01:12:03,099
- Get it all in the torpedo room.
- You two, give me a hand.

404
01:12:06,663 --> 01:12:10,941
Bosun,
do you know where the medic is?

405
01:12:11,103 --> 01:12:14,652
Yeah, in the bow compartment.

406
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:21,860
- The more the merrier.
- Have the crabs got you, too?

407
01:12:39,263 --> 01:12:46,294
- Lieutenant!
- What?

408
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:52,732
Take it easy! Calm down!
Have you gone crazy?

409
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:02,213
Have you heard the latest?
Our Dufte is tying the knot.

410
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:08,901
- The stupid pig.
- Half the fleet have tried her.

411
01:13:09,063 --> 01:13:13,056
They should stick you in a zoo
with a chimpanzee.

412
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:19,617
- Here's the pictures of her!
- You dirty, rotten swine!

413
01:13:23,103 --> 01:13:27,893
Don't tell me this hag
lets you sleep with her.

414
01:14:04,783 --> 01:14:11,655
These boats are built to take it.
You should try a sailing ship.

415
01:14:12,663 --> 01:14:15,461
You hardly feel a thing down here.

416
01:14:25,743 --> 01:14:28,780
- Captain.
- Compass.

417
01:14:40,183 --> 01:14:44,222
She's heaving to starboard.
l can't keep on course.

418
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:48,697
No cause for concern.

419
01:14:51,543 --> 01:14:57,732
lt's pointless, sir.
We're burning up fuel for nothing.

420
01:15:03,943 --> 01:15:06,855
Prepare to dive.

421
01:15:07,023 --> 01:15:11,653
Diving stations.
Stand by all main vents.

422
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,982
Nothing exciting out there?

423
01:16:16,383 --> 01:16:23,380
Position reports and very faint
SOS calls from enemy freighters.

424
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:30,701
When the rudder breaks
on one of those old tenders ...

425
01:16:34,143 --> 01:16:37,772
... there's nothing to do but pray.

426
01:16:41,623 --> 01:16:48,540
The sea can't sink us, Hinrich.
No ships are as safe as our U-boats.

427
01:16:59,903 --> 01:17:02,701
Hinrich.

428
01:17:02,863 --> 01:17:09,177
Put the record on again.
You know the one.

429
01:18:17,783 --> 01:18:20,058
Watch out!

430
01:18:30,343 --> 01:18:32,493
Look out!

431
01:18:37,983 --> 01:18:40,543
Man overboard!

432
01:18:43,103 --> 01:18:45,901
Pilgrim!

433
01:18:49,423 --> 01:18:52,017
Hold on!

434
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:21,617
- Get his legs.
- l've got him. Make way!

435
01:19:22,903 --> 01:19:27,579
- His legs!
- Hurry, will you? Move!

436
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:33,098
- Lay him out flat.
- Get his hood off quickly.

437
01:19:33,263 --> 01:19:36,335
Pilgrim.

438
01:19:36,503 --> 01:19:41,782
Bring the first-aid kit, damn it!

439
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,411
Prepare to dive.

440
01:19:53,303 --> 01:19:58,616
''Self-discipline is the only road
to military leadership ...''

441
01:20:00,983 --> 01:20:05,420
Three ribs cracked
and a gash on the head.

442
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,655
He was lucky.

443
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:16,097
What a rotten month.
Absolutely rotten.

444
01:20:17,423 --> 01:20:20,495
Mildew is good for you.

445
01:20:23,183 --> 01:20:29,053
lt's the next best thing to ...
fresh-grown lettuce.

446
01:20:31,823 --> 01:20:38,262
Anything that grows on this boat
we've got to be grateful for.

447
01:20:44,103 --> 01:20:47,857
lt must be snowing already
back home.

448
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,016
Very funny.

449
01:20:58,623 --> 01:21:01,660
lt's been years since l saw snow.

450
01:21:04,863 --> 01:21:08,253
- Can l look?
- Sure.

451
01:21:20,983 --> 01:21:23,497
Your wife?

452
01:22:25,503 --> 01:22:29,576
Look! There, in front!

453
01:22:34,103 --> 01:22:37,857
Captain, U-boat on port bow.

454
01:22:39,103 --> 01:22:42,698
lt's one of ours.

455
01:22:45,663 --> 01:22:51,135
A German U-boat! Over there!

456
01:22:56,583 --> 01:23:00,098
You're right.

457
01:23:00,263 --> 01:23:04,973
- Both engines stop.
- Bring up the lights.

458
01:23:34,703 --> 01:23:38,332
Look, it's Thomsen!

459
01:23:39,263 --> 01:23:43,939
- All back.
- lt's Thomsen!

460
01:23:57,743 --> 01:24:02,498
Good hunting, you old rascal!

461
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:16,492
My God, Phillip!
So they pushed you out to sea again.

462
01:24:22,783 --> 01:24:22,823
Damn it! How can this happen?

463
01:24:22,823 --> 01:24:26,452
Damn it! How can this happen?

464
01:24:28,903 --> 01:24:35,502
12 boats we've got on the Atlantic,
from Greenland to the Azores.

465
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:41,135
But still we almost collide
with one of our own.

466
01:24:41,303 --> 01:24:45,979
60 metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.

467
01:24:48,263 --> 01:24:51,892
Something is wrong here.

468
01:24:53,783 --> 01:24:57,935
- Have you checked on our position?
- More or less.

469
01:24:58,103 --> 01:25:01,698
More or less is not good enough!

470
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:08,302
We've not had a sun shot in 14 days.
We've been drifting in this storm.

471
01:25:08,463 --> 01:25:12,138
lt's hard to compute.

472
01:25:18,263 --> 01:25:25,613
lf we make an error in our position,
and the others do the same, -

473
01:25:25,783 --> 01:25:30,095
- we end up playing collision games.
The route is wide open.

474
01:25:30,263 --> 01:25:35,860
The British could shove
the whole armada through.

475
01:25:36,023 --> 01:25:39,140
Yeah, yeah ...

476
01:25:41,743 --> 01:25:46,578
Another story in the middle
of the ocean, Lieutenant.

477
01:25:46,743 --> 01:25:52,454
l hope you're making notes. Maybe
headquarters will listen to you.

478
01:25:52,623 --> 01:25:59,813
- You've more influence than l have.
- So ... you believe that?

479
01:26:13,063 --> 01:26:19,980
Have you got your flashlight ready?
lt's bound to be a false alarm.

480
01:26:27,143 --> 01:26:31,933
- What's up?
- A convoy.

481
01:26:45,223 --> 01:26:50,138
- Permission to come up?
- Permitted.

482
01:27:34,903 --> 01:27:41,456
Outward bound convoy. Five columns.
Very juicy.

483
01:27:44,823 --> 01:27:48,702
Any escorts in sight? Destroyers?

484
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:54,301
No, no screen.
They have no protection. Nothing.

485
01:27:59,263 --> 01:28:01,697
That's funny.

486
01:28:03,543 --> 01:28:08,663
They could be off
chasing one of ours.

487
01:28:15,063 --> 01:28:18,692
That damn moon!

488
01:28:20,903 --> 01:28:25,533
- How many of our boats are here?
- Five.

489
01:28:28,063 --> 01:28:31,055
Do we risk it?

490
01:28:33,023 --> 01:28:37,062
lt's worth a try, Captain.

491
01:28:38,223 --> 01:28:40,862
Come left to 180.

492
01:28:41,023 --> 01:28:45,141
Left 5 degrees rudder.
New course: 180.

493
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:48,852
Steady on course 180.

494
01:28:49,703 --> 01:28:53,662
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?

495
01:28:55,903 --> 01:28:59,418
lt'll work. We've got them.

496
01:29:10,703 --> 01:29:15,731
Prepare tubes one to four
for surface firing.

497
01:29:15,903 --> 01:29:21,023
- l'm going in.
- Master-sight to bridge.

498
01:29:23,703 --> 01:29:26,695
Tubes one to four flooded.

499
01:29:39,503 --> 01:29:44,099
All ahead full. Left full rudder.
Stand by to attack!

500
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:52,376
Watch the pressure
of the lubricating oil.

501
01:29:53,783 --> 01:29:58,573
- Bearing: 050.
- Locked on.

502
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:01,576
<i>Range: 2,200 metres.</i>

503
01:30:01,743 --> 01:30:08,091
Those two over that way.
Then we'll drop on the big one.

504
01:30:08,263 --> 01:30:14,736
- <i>Targets identifiied.</i>
- <i>Open the bow caps.</i>

505
01:30:14,903 --> 01:30:21,422
Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle: 063.

506
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:25,542
Follow for bearing.

507
01:30:25,703 --> 01:30:31,972
Tubes one and two,
fire when matched.

508
01:30:32,143 --> 01:30:34,532
Tube one, fire!

509
01:30:36,783 --> 01:30:41,538
Tube two, fire!

510
01:30:41,703 --> 01:30:46,219
- Tube three, fire when matched.
- Tube three ready.

511
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:49,932
Tube three, fire!

512
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:57,255
Tube four ready.
Tube four, fire!

513
01:30:57,423 --> 01:31:00,301
Destroyer ahead!

514
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,461
Alarm!

515
01:31:06,623 --> 01:31:11,139
All men forward! Diving positions!

516
01:31:13,263 --> 01:31:16,653
Quick, keep it moving!

517
01:31:16,823 --> 01:31:21,499
- Clear the way.
- Move, move, move!

518
01:31:32,703 --> 01:31:37,060
- Battle stations!
- Out of the way.

519
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:44,012
Bow planes up 10. Stern up 5.

520
01:31:44,783 --> 01:31:47,980
Keep quite!

521
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:52,371
Down 80 metres. Easy.

522
01:31:52,543 --> 01:31:57,856
Bow down 15. Stern up 10.

523
01:32:00,303 --> 01:32:05,696
- What about the torpedoes?
- Any minute now.

524
01:32:10,143 --> 01:32:13,533
Not long to go now.

525
01:32:13,703 --> 01:32:16,581
1 10 ...

526
01:32:23,303 --> 01:32:28,935
- 120.
- Those torpedoes don't run true.

527
01:32:29,103 --> 01:32:36,578
lt was crazy to attack like that.
That destroy won't let us go.

528
01:32:37,743 --> 01:32:41,816
He'll try and hunt us down.

529
01:32:48,743 --> 01:32:54,181
- We hit the first.
- Out of the way. We hit her!

530
01:32:55,223 --> 01:32:58,135
Quiet!

531
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:23,496
Time's up for the third torpedo.

532
01:33:28,063 --> 01:33:30,816
Number three.

533
01:33:45,343 --> 01:33:48,813
Now they are going to the bottom.

534
01:34:00,663 --> 01:34:04,576
lt's the bulkheads.
They've collapsed.

535
01:34:21,103 --> 01:34:24,095
This is it.

536
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:30,740
Now we have the payoff.

537
01:34:39,783 --> 01:34:46,222
Destroyer bearing 044.
Moving left. Fading, sir.

538
01:35:00,463 --> 01:35:05,378
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

539
01:35:05,543 --> 01:35:11,015
Rudder's right full.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

540
01:35:11,183 --> 01:35:14,937
They're astern of us ...

541
01:35:16,303 --> 01:35:20,091
... way astern of us.

542
01:35:22,463 --> 01:35:26,251
They're spitting
in the wrong direction.

543
01:35:33,743 --> 01:35:40,057
We haven't thrown them off yet.
l reckon they won't be too happy.

544
01:35:40,223 --> 01:35:46,822
Propeller noises bearing 270.
Closing.

545
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:52,658
Both engines ahead one-third.

546
01:35:59,143 --> 01:36:04,900
- Both engines ahead one-third.
- Now we'll see.

547
01:36:30,463 --> 01:36:36,379
All ahead full.
Pump out 150 litres.

548
01:36:40,223 --> 01:36:43,852
Pump out 150 litres. Ahead full!
