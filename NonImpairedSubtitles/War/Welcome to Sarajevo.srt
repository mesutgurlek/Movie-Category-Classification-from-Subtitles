00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Today, the city
of Vukovar has fallen.

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
lt is now no more than rubble.

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
ln the past two months,
the Serbs have pounded it

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
with more than two million shells.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
These survivors
are heading for Bosnia,

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
hoping to escape the war.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But tonight
we must face the possibility

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that this... is only the beginning.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
# We strolled through the hills

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
# All wet with rain

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
# And back along the lane again

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
# There with the sun shining

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
# ln the sweet summertime

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
# The way that young lovers do

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
# l kissed you on the lips once more

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
# And we said goodbye

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
# At your front door
in the night time

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
# Yeah, that's the right time

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
# To feel the way

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
# That young lovers do

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
# Then we sat on our own star

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
# And dreamed
of the way that we were... #

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
# Then we sat on... #

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh...

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
# Then we sat on our own star

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
# And dreamed
of the way that we were

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
# And the way that we wanted to be

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
# Then we sat on our own star

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
# And dreamed
of the way that l was for you

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
# And you were for me

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
# l would like to
dance the night away... #

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
- Get the cross.
- l've got it.

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, Christ! Go back. Go back.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Go back.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Get the sniper!

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, yeah, l got him.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Get the priest.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
ls he mad?

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
ls he mad?

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Come on.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
- You don't want this?
- Come on!

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is the wrong street.

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go back.

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
- Michael, let's go back.
- lt's here.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Shit!

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They put roadblocks.
l turned the van round.

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Others are going to be
stuck here for hours.

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Easy!

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
- What did you get?
- We need a new driver.

50
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
lt was hard to get Joey. He was
a cabbie. He knows the city.

51
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's an idiot.

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's been selling our petrol.
AND he's an idiot.

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We've been running round the
streets trying to find him.

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
ls that true about the petrol?

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
lt was full this morning
and it's empty now.

56
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's it. From there.

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now, another three.

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No one dares move the body.

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then the boy.

60
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
- This now.
- No, the boy.

61
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
l just saw this footage
of Flynn being shot at.

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
- Got that?
- No.

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
- Why not?
- Why not what?

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why haven't we got it?

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
General decline
in journalistic standards.

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
lt's this news as entertainment
bollocks. So patronising.

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
- l hate that.
- l hate that, too.

68
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Jane?

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
l actually think it was very brave,

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and most people respond to bravery.

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ooh!

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
'They were
yards from the church

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
'when the sniper opened fire,
and now the mother is dead.

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
'Another innocent victim
killed in cold blood.

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
'This is Jordan Flynn in Sarajevo.'

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
l'm not worthy of
applause, but l'll take money.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, thank you.
You'll be remembered.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you so much.

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh-ho! Well, look
who's here - Henderson.

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And Gregg.
Care to make a contribution?

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
l don't have anything small enough.

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sure you do,
but l was thinking about money.

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What d'you think?
Syndicated worldwide.

84
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Your producers must be delighted

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
- Exactly.
- They sent you to get killed.

86
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now it looks like you will.

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
- Good one!
- Good night.

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Henderson, how about
a little Bushmills?

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hey, Gregg - Bushmills.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
See ya.

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
l can't believe
you're turning down Bushmills.

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
There's a first.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He was only trying to help.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're here to report.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Haven't seen Bushmills
in a long time.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Michael, are you all right?

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
- Michael, are you all right?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Good.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
- We're gonna drink to the line.
- Lower...please. Better.

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
l make my important decisions
after reaching that line.

102
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
l liked what you did.
lt was really brave.

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
- lt stank.
- Ooh, God!

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You thought it stank?

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
lt wasn't about Sarajevo,
it was about YOU.

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Back home no one's heard of
Sarajevo but they all know me.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
- She with you?
- Freelance.

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Figures. Who would hire her?

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You should never drink
serious whisky without water

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
because the strength of the alcohol

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
smothers the complex flavour.

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ls that right?

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
- Chiverly!
- Chiverly!

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Cheers.

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
l am in love with you. ln spite
of the company you keep.

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you.

117
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
l'd like to save you from this.

118
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Leaving so soon, Mr Flynn?
The war is young.

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
- Hi.

Try - you might be lucky.

123

Very good. Here.

'Yeah, hang on.

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Er, it's...well, you're an hour
behind - it's twenty past ten.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
- 'She's awake again.'
- 'Mummy!'

139

'Can you hear that?'

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah. All right. You'd better go.

141

Everything in English
this morning. Gotta practise.

148
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This is my last clean one.

149
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thanks.

lt's from Marks & Spencer in Paris.

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You don't believe it?

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
- No.
- What's this?

153
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Certainly is
a woman of experience.

- Hey! Dig those threads.

159
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah. lt's a great colour.
Sort of unusual.

160

My man, Zeljko!
Thank you. Do you have it?

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
She ask if this
is where you come from.

325
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Ah! Yes. Yes.

326
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
lt's changed a bit since then.

327
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
She want to get out of Sarajevo.

328
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Your film would help
to get us out of here?

329
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yes. l hope so.

330
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
She wants a promise.

331
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
lt's a promise.

332
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
lt's a Haggadah.
lt's the story of the Exodus.

333
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Oh.

334
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
lt was in the museum. When
the Nazis came, it disappeared.

335
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
When the war was over, it was back.

336
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And now it's disappeared again.

337
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
- lt's lovely.
- Yeah, it's nice.

338
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
On the real one you can see
fingerprints and wine stains

339
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
where it's been used.

340
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
People say that after this war,
it will return.

341
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But it's been sold to buy weapons.

342
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
No, that's not true.

343
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
When the museum was bombed, the
old guy, Professor lmamovich,

344
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
he found the book in the rubble.
Now it's somewhere safe.

345
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
lt'll be back.

346
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
- What are you doing?
- l use books to cook with.

347
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
lt's all there is.

348
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
lf you have to burn books,
you should at least enjoy it.

349
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You know - special occasion,
special book.

350
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Besides, l could never
relate to the Exodus.

351
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
(# The Happy Mondays: ''Donovan'')

352
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You know what l'm going to do?

353
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
l'm going to make
a concert here in Sarajevo.

354
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
ls that such a good idea?

355
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
l will defy death in the name of Art.

356
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
What about the audience?

357
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The audience will die happy
listening to me.

358
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But l'm not going to do it yet,

359
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
because Sarajevo is only
the 14th worst place on Earth.

360
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
l'm waiting until we're number one.

361
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
- What is number one?
- LA, of course.

362
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Help with the babies.

363
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You want the children upstairs?

364
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
- Yes.
- OK.

365
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
'We came here this evening

366
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
'to make another report
on the Ljubica lvezic Orphanage.

367
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
'When we arrived, the building
next door was on fire

368
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
'and one room of the orphanage
had been destroyed.'

369
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Roadrunner's coming.

370
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Roadrunner's coming.
Come on. Let's go.

371
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The Bosnian government

372
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
is against any kind of evacuation.

373
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
From their point of view,
the Serbs want the city empty.

374
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
lf they evacuate,
we're helping the Serbs.

375
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Evacuation is actually
collaboration,

376
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and that's a quote.

377
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
lt will take time to find
a solution to the problem.

378
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Thus we must have patience.

379
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
This is cold.

380
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Here, have mine.

381
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
- Zeljko!
- No, l want a fresh cup.

382
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
- ls that hot?
- l want a fresh cup.

383
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
- Got a pen?
- Give me your book.

384
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Look at 'em. They're like vultures.

385
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Look at US. We're like vultures.

386
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Working vultures. lt's grand.

387
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Great.

388
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That's mine
and Mr Henderson is inside.

389
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
- Happy?
- Thanks.

390
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
- Thank you.
- OK. Bye.

391
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Just a sec. Thanks.

392
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
lt's extraordinary, is it not,

393
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
that with children trapped
in the most dangerous corner

394
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
of the most dangerous city on Earth

395
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
that this plane will fly
out of here completely empty.

396
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
'lt would be a simple matter
to move the children

397
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
'but someone somewhere along the
bureaucratic line is saying no.'

398
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Cheer up, Michael.

399
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You'll be back in London by Tuesday.

400
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Put that back.
That's my lucky hat.

401
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Working wonders for us.

402
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Six years in that -
l've never been shot.

403
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Swap it for my lucky knickers?

404
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
- No.
- Charming.

405
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
l'm not gonna film a war
wearing your knickers.

406
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
On your head!

407
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Do they stop you getting shot?

408
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
No. l just get lucky wearing them.

409
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Flynn!

410
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Where've you been? Thought
you'd gone to the seaside.

411
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Met a lady who needed a lift.

412
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
- Hi, Henderson.
- Hi.

413
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
- Annie.
- Get it?

414
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
- Yeah.
- Got what?

415
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
- Was it terrible?
- Yeah. lt WAS terrible.

416
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
- Where've you been?
- Uh, Omarska and Trnopolie.

417
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
lt was...a real party.

418
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
'lTN was given
permission to visit these camps

419
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
'by Radovan Karadjic,
the Bosnian Serb leader.

420
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
'There are 4,500 prisoners held here.

421
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
'These are the ones
we were allowed to talk to.'

422
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Can you just hold on?
Hold on. Michael...

423
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Sorry.

424
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
l...didn't wanna
let it go and, um...

425
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
No, no, no. You did
the right thing. Absolutely.

426
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
- Well done.
- Thanks.

427
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Annie, it's a great story.
Congratulations.

428
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Thank you.

429
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Henderson.

430
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
- You, uh...you got any petrol?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You think l might be able
to get a lift across town?

432
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
- Now?
- Yeah.

433
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah. All right.

434
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Top man!

435
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah. Uh...

436
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Uh...l got... l was with...

437
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You speak Bosnian, eh?

438
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Describing it in English,
it doesn't sound real.

439
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
lf any language could
do it justice, it's Bosnian.

440
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And does it?

441
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
l'm still learning.
Little, simple things.

442
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Um, ''do you have an avocado?''

443
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
''l'm desperate for a toilet.''

444
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
- Ah!
- Ah.

445
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
(Flynn) Little things, you know,
like that. Thank you.

446
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Here's the cake.

447
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
- Take the small piece.
- Toast.

448
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
- What's that?
- To their son.

449
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah. To your son.

450
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
'History has shown us
that you can't allow

Great.

the Republican Convention.

Maybe, uh...

How about, uh, the Superbowl?

Super bollocks!

- Why is it when Americans...?
- Why?

474

Why is it that Americans,

475
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
when they're playing sport,
wear so much padding?

476

You spend more time
dressing up than playing.

477
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Sure, we don't dress
to the nines like cricket.

478
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But...what about basketball?
Just a vest.

479
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Basketball isn't a sport.
Basketball's a freak show.

480
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Easy. You're on sacred territory.

481
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The side with
the tallest player wins.

482

Also, it's a girls' game.

483
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You know, only two good
things ever came from England.

484
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
One - America, two - the Beatles.

485
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Beatles aren't English.

486
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
They're from Liverpool.

487
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You even pad up to play girls' games.

488
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You know...

489
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Henderson...

490
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Those orphans are not
your responsibility.

491
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You're here, you're a reporter.

492
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You're here to report.

493
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
FUCK YOU! ASSHOLE!

494
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
GET A JOB!

495
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Zeljko. Would you take care of these?

496
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Mr Henderson, you leaving?

497
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yes.

498
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Have some of those. l don't smoke.

499
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
- Thank you very much.
- OK.

500
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
- Oh, hi there.
- Hi.

501
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
- Good night?
- Yeah. Very good.

502
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
- Hi.
- This is Nina.

503
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Hello. Welcome to the
14th worst place on Earth.

504
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Thanks.

505
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
- Nina's an aid worker.
- ls this water?

506
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
- Yeah.
- Can l...?

507
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
A children's charity.
The Children's Lifeline.

508
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
We've got a bus.
Bring in food and take out kids.

509
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
l'm pitching our story
to your network.

510
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
- What sort of children?
- Boys and girls.

511
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Children who are sponsored
abroad or have relatives abroad.

512
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And babies.
They're easy to find homes for.

513
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
l can get babies. There's an
orphanage on the front line.

514
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
- D'you need babies?
- Aren't you leaving?

515
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You COULD leave - with us.
An epic story for you.

516
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The Exodus!

517
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Can you help any of them?

518
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Well...we'll try. We'll try.

519
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
lt's for the baby.

520
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
What's their name?

521
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
She thinks that she's going.

522
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
She says, ''You promised me.''

523
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
lt's OK if we don't have
birth certificates.

524
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Here they are.

525
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
lf she had somewhere to go,
could you take her?

526
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
- Nina?
- What?

527
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Emira. She wants to leave.

528
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Does she have somewhere to go?

529
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
- No.
- No, l can't take her.

530
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We have to prove the older kids
are visiting relatives.

531
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
No evacuation - that was the deal.

532
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
- What if she was visiting me?
- What d'you mean?

533
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
lf she was coming to London
to visit me...?

534
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
lt's not that simple.

535
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Mrs Savic?

536
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
l can't speak for her.
You have to ask her yourself.

537
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
What's that?
ls that a yes?

538
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Yes. That's yes.

539
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
l thought she might want to stay.

540
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
She's been with me always.

541
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But it's OK. l'm glad she doesn't.

542
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
lt's just for a short time.
Until the war's over.

543
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah...

544
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
For a short time. l hope so.

545
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Hello, TV man.

546
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You got any cigarettes?

547
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You know this is
completely illegal, don't you?

548
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yes.

549
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Why are you doing this?

550
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
l don't know.

551
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
- Married?
- Yes.

552
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
- Kids?
- Yes.

553
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
OK. l don't want anyone
to know what you're doing.

554
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Not your news crew,
your producer, no one.

555
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Don't sit near her on the bus.

556
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
l want you to treat Emira
like all the other kids.

557
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Right.

558
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000

What does he want?
l'll give it to him!

643
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Munira, tell him now,

644
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
we have papers to get us
through this territory.

645
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
We have documents for each
and every child on this bus.

646
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
No, no. She's English. She's with me.

647
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
She's English!

648
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Emira! Stop!

649
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Stay here.

650
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Where are they taking them?!

651
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Stay. Stay.

652
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
There wasn't anything you could do.

653
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Can you swim?

654
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Leila!

655
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Looks like you missed the boat, kid.

656
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
- The boat?
- Mmm. You should be on it.

657
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
No.

658
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
- 'Hello?'
- Hello. lt's me.

659
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
'Michael! Hi! Where are you?'

660
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
ln Split. l'll be home tomorrow.

661
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
'Oh, brilliant!
ls everything all right?'

662
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah. l'm talking quietly
'cause, uh...

663
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
l'm bringing someone home with me.

664
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
'lt's not Gregg, is it?'

665
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
No...no, not Gregg.

666
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
She's a girl from Sarajevo.
She's from the orphanage.

667
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
l wanted to call earlier
but l didn't know what to say.

668
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
- 'How old is she?'
- She's nine.

669
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
l don't really know
why l've done this.

670
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
She'd somehow thought
that l could help her get out.

671
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And l realised that l could and
there wasn't any reason not to.

672
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
'Well, it's, uh...

673
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
'lt's good, l guess.
lt's...it's good.'

674
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Yeah?

675
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
'Yeah.'

676
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
'Mmm... Hmm.'

677
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
- You OK?
- 'Yeah. Yeah. l'm fine.

678
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
- 'Just come home, OK?'
- OK.

679
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
'OK. Can't wait to see you.'

01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

'See you tomorrow.'

682
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
# l've...l've got a reason

683
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
# To know your name

684
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000

01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000

lt's for you.

704
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000

01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Hello.

706
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
- 'Henderson.'
- Flynn!

707
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
How did you get a call out?

708
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
The network got me one
of these satellite phones.

709
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
l'm selling calls on the side,
making a fortune.

710
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
l hope the war keeps up.

711
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Listen, the woman l love -
you know, one way -

712
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
wants to talk to you...
brace yourself.

713
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
- 'Hi, Michael.'
- Hi, Jane.

714
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
'How's the kid?'

715
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Oh... Yeah. Good, you know?

716
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Complicated but good.

717
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
- Does she wanna come back?
- No.

718
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
The thing is...that, um...

719
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
someone here wants her to come back.

720
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Someone like who?

721
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
The uncle contacted us here.

722
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
She has a mother, Michael,
and she wants her back.

723
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
'Sorry, Michael.'

724
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
l shouldn't have brought her out.

725
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Of course you should.

726
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
What's it gonna be like
for her now, going back?

727
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
- lt's just...
- Maybe she won't have to go.

728
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Mmm?

729
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Maybe she won't have to go back.

730
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
l didn't know she had a mother.

731
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
l know, l know.

732
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
- When are you going?
- Tomorrow.

733
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
How long will you be?

734
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
l don't know.
l have to find your mother.

735
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Depends where she is.

736
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,000
l have to get her to sign some
papers. Then we can adopt you.

737
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
What if she says no?

738
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
She won't.

739
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Don't worry.

740
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
- Michael...?
- Sorry.

741
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
- You OK?
- Yeah.

742
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Yeah. What's the time?

743
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Half past six.

744
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Gotta go.

745
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Welcome to
Miss Beseiged Sarajevo.

746
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
# And you...tell me

747
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
# Over and over
and over again, my friend

748
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
# Ah, you don't believe

749
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
# We're on the eve
of destruction... #

750
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
- Hey! Henderson, hey!
- Flynn!

751
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
# And you tell me

752
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
# Over and over
and over again... #

753
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
- You never got another job?
- No, l am,

754
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
l'm covering the Miss World
contest. Starting with Sarajevo.

755
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
You're serious about this
place, Flynn, admit it.

756
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Look who's here.

757
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Jane, what's happened to you?

758
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
# And you tell me... #

759
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

760
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
# ..and over again, my friend

761
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
lf we ever get out of here,

762
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
we're ALL gonna take the kids back!

763
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Good idea!
You'll make a great mother.

764
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
l'm looking
for Risto Bavic.

765
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Michael. Welcome to hell.

766
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Brought you some Mars Bars
in the hotel.

767
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Fantastic. l started to get cravings.

768
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
lt's like being pregnant, you know?

769
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
This week, it's dental floss.

770
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
l never flossed my teeth in my life,

771
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
but...l want some floss now.

772
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And before that, warmth. Oh...

773
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
- You haven't changed.
- l have.

774
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
l have lost my innocence.

775
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
l don't remember
you having innocence.

776
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
l thought my life and the
siege were different things.

777
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Now l realise there is no life
in Sarajevo except the siege.

778
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
The siege lS Sarajevo.

779
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
lf you're not part of it,
you're dreaming, asleep.

780
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
You've killed someone.

781
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Yes. lt was not so bad.

782
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
l don't know...therapeutic.

783
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
These are of Emira's mother.

784
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
She looks, uh, like Emira here.

785
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
No. No Emira, Munira.

786
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
l'm just saying she looks like Emira.

787
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
He says, uh, her family
made her give the baby up.

788
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
And now he wants to help.

789
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
ls this her address?

790
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Ciao!

791
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
This is where they want her to live?

792
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Ready to play Sarajevo's
favourite game?

793
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
What's that?

794
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
lt's called, ''ls there a God?''

795
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
- Does he know?
- l don't know.

796
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
We shouldn't go with him.

797
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
- Why?
- l don't know him.

798
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
- lt's OK.
- Hey, Michael...

799
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Michael, don't!

800
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
lt's all right.

801
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Come on, come on.

802
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
No, no, no.

803
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
We're just looking for someone.

804
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
No, no, no. We're just looking for...

805
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
- Could you tell them?
- l know.

806
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
lt's OK.

807
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
lt's OK. lt's all right.
lt's all right.

808
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
We're looking for someone.
We're not police.

809
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Deutschmarks. Deutschmarks, here.

810
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
English! Thank you very much!

811
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Now what?

812
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
- Don't bring her back here.
- l'm TRYlNG not to.

813
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
- Promise me.
- What?

814
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
- Promise me.
- All right.

815
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
All right, l promise.

816
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
No one should have
to come back to this.

817
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
There are compensations
to being in a siege.

818
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh, yeah?

819
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
There's this girl called lnela.
l went to school with her.

820
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
She's the most beautiful
girl in the world, no question.

821
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
But she doesn't look at me.

822
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
l don't know why.
What's wrong with me?

823
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Now in Sarajevo,
everything is for sale.

824
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
l figure one day soon, even
lnela herself will be for sale.

825
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
l got a packet of Marlboro

826
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
and cake of soap
hidden away for then.

827
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Listen, l'm going to find her
and she will be for sale.

828
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
l will buy her, dang, dang, dang,

829
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and die really, really happy.
lnela!

830
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
See, every cloud has a silver lining.

831
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Have you seen her, this lnela?

832
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Yeah, but l think
she's past her best.

833
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So is he.

834
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Aren't we all?

835
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Look at me -
a little grey but still...

836
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Still hot?

837
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Still hot, baby, yeah.

838
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
(# The Rolling Stones:
''Waiting On A Friend'')

839
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
You're maybe further past
than most, Risto.

840
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Not looking good so far, is it?

841
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
- Mr Henderson.
- Hello.

842
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Don't you remember me?
l remember YOU.

843
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
- l worked in the Holiday lnn.
- Yes, l do.

844
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
- Zeljko.
- Zeljko.

845
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
- You gave me cigarettes.
- Yeah.

846
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
They were...very useful. Now
l'd like to return the favour.

847
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
l'm told you need help.
l can help you.

848
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
- You're getting soft!
- God!

849
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
l peaked on the sixth.

850
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Oh, God!

851
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Come on, you slack arse!
Get up!

852
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Very funny.

853
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Oh, my God! OH, GOD!

854
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Oh, fuck!

855
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
# Don't need a whore

856
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
# Don't need no fools

857
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
# Don't need a virgin priest

858
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
# But l need someone
l can cry to

859
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
# l need someone to protect

860
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
# Ooh, making love
and breaking hearts

861
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
# lt is a game for you

862
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,000
# But l'm not
waiting on a lady

863
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
# l'm just waiting on a friend #

864
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
This place is
a virus you can't shake.

865
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Sometimes l feel like
l'll never make it home.

866
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Sometimes l feel as if
you'll never make it home.

867
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
- Goodbye, Jane.
- Bye.

868
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Please, Jane...
He was a good man.

869
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
lt may be inappropriate
but now that he's gone,

870
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
- maybe you and l could...
- Please!

871
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
- Not funny.
- Ohh!

872
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Sorry. l'm only joking.

873
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Will you find the mother?

874
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
- Zeljko thinks he's found her.
- Zeljko's a gangster.

875
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
l know.
Less trouble at the checkpoints.

876
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
- Why not let me drive, Jane?
- No.

877
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
ln the back, Flynn.

878
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Fucking, fucking door!

879
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
This is it.

880
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
- This is Emira's mother.
- Right.

881
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
She wants you to sit down.

882
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
She knew you were coming.
lt was in the beans.

883
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
She knows what l've come for, then.

884
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
To talk about Emira.

885
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
You have said that you will
bring her back after the war.

886
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yes, l said that, but...
things have changed since then.

887
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
The orphanage no longer exists.

888
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Mrs Savic is in hiding.
And Emira is happy where she is.

889
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
She wants to thank you
for helping Emira.

890
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Mr Henderson...

891
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
l'm her mother. And l'm alone.

892
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
l know l was a bad mother.

893
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
That l gave her up, but l love her.

894
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Do you understand
why l want her back?

895
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
- Understand?
- Yes.

896
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Da.

897
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Yes, l understand.

898
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
But, um...

899
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Emira...hardly knows you.

900
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
You've seen her twice in eight years.

901
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
- And to be honest...
- l don't translate this.

902
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
l don't translate. You listen.

903
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
l have been listening
and l have things to say.

904
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
- Zeljko, will you translate?
- Wait.

905
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
l am giving you Emira
to be your daughter.

906
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
But because l was a bad mother,
l have no memories of her.

907
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
l want to see her...

908
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
To hear her voice.

909
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Good car, huh?

910
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
How you get money for this car? Mmm?

911
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
lt's through here.

912
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
l have a tape of Emira
if Mrs Hodzic wants to see it.

913
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Would you ask her that?
Ask if she wants to see this?

914
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Yeah.

915
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
- Can l have these?
- Yes.

916
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
She looks happy there.

917
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
'Right, in there.'

918
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Hi. lt's me. Could you put Emira on?

919
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Hold on.

920
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
- Emira?
- Yes?

921
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
- Telephone.
- OK.

922
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
- You OK?
- Yes?

923
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
- lt's Michael.
- OK. Yes? Hi.

924
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Emira? l've got your mother
here. She wants to talk to you.

925
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
- 'Hello.'
- Emira?

926
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
'Hello? Yes?'

927
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
'What do you want?

928
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
'Let me speak to Michael.'

929
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
She cannot understand
what she's talking about.

930
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Can she speak Bosnian?

931
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Emira, you have to talk in Bosnian.

932
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Emira?

933
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
She will sign.

934
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Stop here, please.

935
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Henderson - good luck.

936
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Thank you.

937
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Don't, don't live under this dream

938
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
that the West will come
and sort this problem out.

939
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
