1
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,520
Looks abandoned.

2
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,820
Or worse.

3
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,780
Let's go, Shortwave.

4
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,660
<i>It was Chinese New Year.</i>

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,260
<i>The Tet holiday.</i>

6
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,640
<i>The communists had
called a 36-hour truce.</i>

7
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,740
<i>It should've
been a routine patrol.</i>

8
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,960
<i>But we weren't
taking any chances.</i>

9
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,860
Get DiNardo up here.

10
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,320
<i>DiNardo was my right hand.</i>

11
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,200
Go!

12
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,280
<i>The kind of gung-ho fighting machine</i>

13
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,880
<i>that Marines are famous for.</i>

14
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,340
<i>We'd been to this village before</i>

15
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,680
<i>and a lot of smiling,</i>

16
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
<i>shaking hands
and bowing</i>

17
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,940
<i>to show that we
were the good guys.</i>

18
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,840
<i>The people were friendly.</i>

19
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,920
<i>We like them
and they liked us.</i>

20
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,280
<i>DiNardo knew enough Vietnamese</i>

21
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,260
<i>to be a big hit.</i>

22
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,200
<i>So it really hurts
to see their heads on stakes.</i>

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,300
<i>This rotten war was
getting to us.</i>

24
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
<i>We'd stay too long,</i>

25
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,880
<i>we seen too much.</i>

26
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,920
Jesus Christ. . .

27
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,560
Sonofabitch!

28
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,560
DiNardo!

29
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,360
Got more in the wells.

30
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,480
Jesus. . .

31
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,560
<i>No amount of training</i>

32
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,960
<i>could prepare you for an experience like this.</i>

33
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,640
<i>Shortwave said he'd seen worse</i>

34
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,200
<i>on the streets of Detroit.</i>

35
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>But that's the kind of bullshit</i>

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,920
<i>you use to keep from going crazy.</i>

37
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,980
<i>Murphy was the one
that's hit the hardest.</i>

38
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,880
<i>He was a green college
kid from Indiana.</i>

39
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,280
<i>The closest he'd been to death</i>

40
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,800
<i>was his grand dad's funeral.</i>

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
Sergeant Hafner!

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,960
Yo!

43
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,260
This is insanity.

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,640
This is effective.

45
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,880
Charlie's got this valley
by the balls.

46
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,960
Won't nobody step outta
line around here.

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,560
Sergeant Major!

48
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,160
Yo!

49
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,640
We got a boy, Sergeant Major.

50
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,320
He's alive!

51
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,150
Please, kid.

52
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Calm down.

53
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,220
C'mon, Juicy?

54
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,320
Wanna Juicy?

55
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,520
Juicy, Juicy, Juicy.

56
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,780
There ain't no
ceasefire around here

57
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,900
that's for damn sure.

58
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,320
Somethin' comin' down.

59
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,200
Somethin' heavy.

60
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Oh, we gotta find out
what it is.

61
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,760
We gonna leave
the village like this?

62
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
Torch it.

63
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,800
<i>We radioed headquarters,</i>

64
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,340
<i>but they didn't read the signs</i>

65
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,480
<i>like we did.</i>

66
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,580
<i>Just another bunch
of dead gooks</i>

67
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,980
<i>What else is new?</i>

68
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,760
<i>DiNardo was pretty
steamed up inside</i>

69
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
<i>so I put him on point.</i>

70
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,480
<i>Best therapy
I could think of.</i>

71
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
<i>As point men go,</i>

72
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,280
<i>DiNardo had few equals.</i>

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,280
<i>He had a sharp eye</i>

74
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
<i>and a good nose for trouble.</i>

75
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,360
Hold on.
It's DiNardo, sir.

76
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,160
What do you got?

77
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,260
Two VC by a cave.
I'm gonna pop 'em.

78
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,160
We got contact.

79
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,040
Murphy, I want you to check
out the area.

80
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,520
Need to know how many
dinks we're dealing with here.

81
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,220
You sure you wanna do this alone?

82
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,600
Yeah.

83
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
My turn.

84
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Besides, I had needed a bath.

85
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,640
Okay Nard, you got the ball.
if I ain't back in ten,

86
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,160
use your imagination.

87
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Sure..

88
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,560
Stay on 'em.

89
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
Jesus Christ.

90
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,200
You look like a fucking ghost.

91
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,360
Whose were these?

92
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,860
I lost. . .

93
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,960
Lost my whole patrol.

94
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,960
What's your unit, son?

95
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
There were thousands.

96
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,200
We saw. . .

97
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,720
We saw thousands of 'em.

98
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
What's your name, son?

99
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,720
I don't. . .

100
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,800
I don't know.

101
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,040
No. . . No. . .
I'm whip-bounding.

102
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
Two clicks back. . .

103
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,380
Abandoned camps.

104
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,460
Looked about company size.

105
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,320
Well, there's a company,

106
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
there's a battalion.
- Come.

107
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,660
Tell DiNardo to get everybody

108
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,840
ready to pull out.
-Right.

109
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
C-4's in place, Sergeant Major.

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,900
Might be a pretty good
idea to blow it up.

111
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,620
Yes, sir.

112
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,080
Dinks up ahead!

113
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,080
Twenty, maybe thirty.

114
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,500
You know the program,
DiNardo.

115
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
Do your thing.

116
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,380
I want you bunched up
around the casualty.

117
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,120
Let's move.

118
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
<i>DiNardo was like a brother
I never had.</i>

119
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,820
<i>He's always getting into trouble.</i>

120
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,960
<i>And I was always gettin' him out.</i>

121
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,720
<i>But when the times got tough,</i>

122
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
<i>he was the one
I knew I could count on.</i>

123
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,840
<i>For a while, there had been
some tension between us.</i>

124
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,000
<i>And it needed to be resolved.</i>

125
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,160
<i>But now was not the time.</i>

126
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,000
<i>Now, I needed the best
rifleman in the squad</i>

127
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,280
<i>covering my back.</i>

128
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,960
Any VC in your area?

129
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,960
No VC here.

130
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,340
Only fish made in bottles.
-Yeah, I bet.

131
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,720
Where the boy come from?

132
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,340
We found the boy in An Lap village.

133
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,960
An Lap village?

134
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,960
I don't like it.
Let's move.

135
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Let's get outta here.

136
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,960
I don't like the looks
of this at all.

137
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,560
Get on the horn.

138
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,800
There's not a swinging dink here

139
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,040
that ain't recruiting age.

140
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Tell DiNardo to lock and load.

141
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,240
Watch the one
with the hairy face.

142
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,560
Lock and load, DiNardo.

143
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,800
It don't look good.

144
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,000
Sergeant Major's saying: watch
the one with the beard.

145
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,280
Shortwave, get your dumb black
John Wayne ass down!

146
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,840
Get down!

147
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,640
Get that Fifty on the boat!

148
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,960
Ceasefire! Hold your fire!

149
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,320
I want these boats
under water.

150
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,400
Don't use our frags.

151
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,680
There's plenty of dink
grenades up here.

152
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,240
I'd like to know where these needle-dick

153
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,760
dinks are getting new AK-fuckin'-47s at.

154
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,440
What the hell's goin' on here, Spider?

155
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
You on Rand R?

156
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,800
Get down here and
help Hawk sink those boats.

157
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,600
Shortwave, you get in touch
with the damn chopper yet?

158
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,800
No, sir. Sergeant Major.

159
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,700
Keep trying.

160
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Hey, DiNardo!

161
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,160
Yo!

162
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,400
I want an accurate body count.

163
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,560
I got it!

164
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
Twenty males. Nine females.

165
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,640
Three goddamn tots.

166
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,120
You'll love this shit.

167
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,080
VC regulars.

168
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,040
Just beautiful.

169
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,940
Happy Chinese New Year.

170
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,440
Murphy, are you ready yet?

171
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,480
I want that chopper in
here, right now.

172
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,540
Doin' my best, Sergeant Major.

173
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,120
Yeah, well. That's not
quite good enough.

174
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,920
Try harder.

175
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,920
Golden Eagle,
this is Shortwave.

176
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,240
What the hell am
I gonna name you, huh?

177
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,400
How 'bout, Pee Wee, huh?

178
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,440
Can you say, Pee Wee?

179
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,350
Pee Wee.

180
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,520
Pee Wee.
- Pee Wee

181
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,600
Pee Wee, I named you
Pee Wee.

182
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,120
Pee Wee Reese.

183
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,520
The greatest baseball player

184
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,840
for the Brooklyn Dodgers
that ever lived.

185
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,460
Don't get too goddamn
attached to that boy.

186
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,320
You know, what?

187
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,500
He sure as hell
doesn't look like Jimmy.

188
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,640
But he's got the
same spark in his eye.

189
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,560
You know what I mean?
Look at him.

190
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,880
It doesn't get any
goddamn easier.

191
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,200
Does it Nard?

192
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,640
Nope.

193
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,680
So, Sergeant Major. Where
the hell are we going now?

194
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,280
A little goddamn firebase.

195
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,780
Gloria's the name of it.

196
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,280
What?

197
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,880
Gloria!

198
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
Ain't too far from here.

199
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,480
Shit!

200
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,260
Fuck!
We're we hit?

201
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,720
Don't worry 'bout it.

202
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,400
We're comin' down.

203
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,400
Take it port side.
- Sergeant Major!

204
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,760
This sucker's dead meat.

205
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,520
Get us down. Now!

206
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,960
You got it, chief!

207
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,760
Set it down. Now!

208
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,400
It's alright. It's alright.

209
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,600
We'll be getting outta here.

210
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,160
Be cool!

211
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,960
We're goin' down.

212
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,040
Just cut the fuel!

213
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,400
Get the fuck outta here!

214
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
C'mon! C'mon!

215
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,420
Jesus.

216
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,160
C'mon, let's get the Ghost
down to the aid station.

217
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,680
Murphy, see to it that
the kid gets de-loused.

218
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,440
DiNardo, your radio with me.

219
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,720
Let's move.
Let's move.

220
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,080
Where's your CO?

221
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,660
He's in the CP
jackin' off.

222
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,240
Yeah, he's at the pod now, sir.

223
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Must've jerked off for the
second time by now, baby.

224
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,560
Good afternoon, sir.

225
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,320
You are the CO?

226
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,560
Who're you?

227
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Sergeant Major Hafner.

228
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,520
Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol, sir.

229
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:42,720
Yes.

230
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,160
The French Foreign Legion had

231
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
difficulty in this country, you know.

232
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,840
Difficulty.

233
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,040
Street Without Joy.

234
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,760
You read it?

235
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,080
Yes, sir. I have.

236
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,420
Your opinion?

237
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,760
It's history, sir.

238
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,720
History.

239
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,640
Very good.

240
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,480
And you know that fortified positions

241
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,320
linked by mobile reconnaissance

242
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,400
has survived the strategy?

243
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
Are you paying attention, soldier?

244
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,120
Sir. we have just encountered
heavy enemy activity

245
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,560
in the vicinity of An Lap.

246
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,680
Don't be impertinent, soldier.

247
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,520
The Sergeant Major and I here
were discussing history.

248
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:32,940
History.

249
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,760
Well it seems to me that you would
like to know what the hell. . .

250
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,160
Nothing is 'seems to be'.

251
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,880
You remember that, soldier.

252
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,320
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,040
Even the incomparable Clausewitz

254
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,680
underestimated the
value of airborne artillery.

255
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,280
Then, how could he possibly know

256
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,420
given the historical contexts.

257
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,420
Sir, the gooks are on
the move out there.

258
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,960
Of course they are, Sergeant-Major.

259
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,080
It's the Tet holiday.

260
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,340
Every gook in the country is
on the way to his mama-san's

261
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,260
for fucking fish heads and rice.

262
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,440
We just rescued
an American prisoner,sir.

263
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,360
And he's given us vital information

264
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,120
about heavy . . .

265
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,500
Soldier.

266
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,240
Come here.
Come here, soldier.

267
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,880
What?

268
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,880
Lemme I ask you a question.

269
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,520
Does she or doesn't she have

270
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,040
the greatest set of tits

271
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,860
you've ever seen in your entire life?

272
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,080
Yes, sir.

273
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,560
Yes, sir!

274
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,260
That'll be all, gentlemen.

275
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Dismissed.

276
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,040
Oh, by the way, Sergeant Major.

277
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,100
Put your men to work on

278
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,820
repairing the mess tin refs.

279
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,720
Haven't had ice cream in two weeks.

280
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,660
Complete air superiority

281
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,600
and they can't freeze a couple

282
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,260
gallons of fucking ice cream!

283
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Let's get outta here.

284
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,400
So. . .ah.

285
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,200
Staying, Sergeant Major?

286
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,160
Hundreds of places to live.

287
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Sergeant Major. . .

288
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,250
I would say,
this is a perfect time

289
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,480
for a change of command.

290
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,920
For Chrissakes,

291
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,000
he's already brain-dead

292
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,880
If we don't do it

293
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,360
it's gonna get
everybody killed

294
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,640
including ourselves.

295
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,520
Sergeant Major. . .

296
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,240
Sergeant Major!

297
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,220
Goddamit, Nard, I hear you.

298
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,880
Wait until nightfall.

299
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,920
I don't want him killed.

300
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,720
No problem.

301
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
Incoming!

302
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Ceasefire! Ceasefire!

303
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,600
What the fuck was that?!

304
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,360
Incoming rounds.

305
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Oh, hell. They got the CP.

306
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,600
Medic!

307
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,320
Medic!

308
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,440
Get the fuck here, now!

309
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,720
Goddamit. . .

310
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,200
Huh. Nobody.

311
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,520
Mighty Mouse never get us out this shit.

312
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,520
Okay. . .

313
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,440
Mighty Mouse and Underdog.

314
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't know. . .

315
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,800
Yet. . .

316
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,400
No. No. No.

317
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,920
How much time you got up here?

318
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,920
Yeah. Seventeen more days.

319
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,220
I'm gonna miss you.

320
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,440
Yeah, I'll miss you too.

321
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,080
Varia, it's Jones here.

322
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,140
I read you, Sergeant.

323
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,540
I'm on my way.

324
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,840
Who're you?

325
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,640
Sergeant Major Hafner.

326
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,000
Where's Captain Williams?

327
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Unconscious, down at sick bay.
We had incoming last night.

328
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Poor guy.

329
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:31,940
Shit.

330
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
What's your status?

331
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,920
First Sergeant Jones, sir.
just in from patrol.

332
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,920
Sit down.

333
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Well, you're my First
Sergeant now, Jones.

334
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,080
Wha'd you see out there?

335
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Three hundred on the move.

336
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Maybe more.

337
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,980
All regulars.

338
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,720
Yeah, we can add
about two thousand to that.

339
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,440
Maybe in ballpark.

340
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Where?

341
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,280
An Lap. Yesterday.

342
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
Crap's gonna hit the fan, Top.

343
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,280
And this fuckin' place ain't
prepared for the shit.

344
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,360
This firebase can't be defended.

345
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,380
How many people do you have
out there, that ain't brain-dead?

346
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,400
I don't have anyone
who's willing to trip over

347
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,180
his guts for the
Vietnamese way of life.

348
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
-This I know...

349
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,640
Any illusions about yours or my
brand of democracy, First Sergeant?

350
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,440
We're gonna re-fortify this shit-hole,

351
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,240
then we're gonna protect it like
it was your daughter's cherry.

352
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,880
I hate, I'm gonna die here.

353
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,600
Right.

354
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,680
There's no doubt in my military mind

355
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,640
that we are in a deep-shit situation, people.

356
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,380
Now, if any of you dog-faced dope smokers

357
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,640
don't feel like pulling your
share of the load around here,

358
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,560
you can pack your shit
and get your young asses

359
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,680
off of my firebase right now.

360
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,960
Sandbag this west sector, now!

361
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,660
Move your ass!

362
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,960
Somebody get me a
goddamn vehicle up here

363
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
and drive this heap of shit outta here!

364
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,640
I want these fresh
lines squared away.

365
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,120
Break your legs
and do a purpose dig.

366
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,240
You find them, tonight.

367
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,120
there is hope, damn tomorrow.

368
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
It's as simple as...

369
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,920
What the fuck is that?

370
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,320
Combat photographer.

371
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Crazy as a bedbug.

372
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,400
They say, he's got the best
Cambodian Red around.

373
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,400
Yeah?

374
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,640
Oh, we'll see about that.

375
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,120
Hey. . .God what a defensive fighter.

376
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Matter of fact, not a bad idea.

377
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,880
I understand you got some
pretty badass Cambodian Red.

378
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,280
Ain't the truth, isn't it?

379
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,840
Fine, my weed here. Been
smoking opium for a month.

380
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,660
This takes the edge off ev'rything.

381
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Goddamn. That's my favorite kind.

382
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,400
No, shit.

383
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Give it to me.

384
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Wha-why should I give it for?

385
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
I said fucking give it to me.

386
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,160
Hey man. This should cost me
two cases of peaches, man.

387
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,000
-Nard.
You've been strip-searched by a Marine.

388
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,080
Because I suggest
you reach in and find it.

389
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,880
But you sure as hell,
you don't want me to do it.

390
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,560
Now, do it right now!

391
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:34,860
Now!

392
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,600
All right, all right!

393
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Hey, call a dog laugh.
Hey, all right.

394
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Shit.

395
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I hate this game.

396
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,620
Sergeant Major.

397
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,620
Can I keep it?

398
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,220
Yeah, you found it.

399
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,320
It's all yours, Nards.

400
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Give him a rifle and
put him on the line.

401
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Yes, let's go Doctor Leary.

402
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
You can't do this.
I'm a civilian.

403
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah, well you've just been
fucking drafted, sweetheart.

404
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm an innocent objector.
Hey, alright I'm comin'.

405
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,320
We work for a living now.

406
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
So you're staying!?

407
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,800
What about the nurses?

408
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,300
Nurses?

409
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,320
Yes, there are nurses
up at the station.

410
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Doin' this field exercise.

411
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,760
Shit's gettin' pretty goddamn
deep around here.

412
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,520
Is there any nuns or Girl Scouts,
that I should know about

413
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,440
on the firebase?

414
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,320
That's what happens when
you inherit wealth.

415
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,220
Lucky you.

416
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,200
Yeah, lucky me.

417
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Aid station, Sergeant Major.

418
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,020
Alright,

419
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,060
I want these troops patched
up and back out on the line,

420
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,560
ASAP.

421
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,760
If they can fire a rifle, they
can send my gratitude.

422
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,800
I take it you're in command?

423
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
You take it right.
What's your trade or field?

424
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Captain Flanagan.

425
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
199th Evacuation Hospital.

426
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,540
Sir, did I hear you say you want

427
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,120
my wounded back on the line?

428
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
That's affirmative, Captain.

429
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
We're facing a regiment
of VC out there.

430
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,780
Breaking it down
into layman's terms,

431
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,220
that's five to one in their favor.

432
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,920
I'm not too goddamn
crazy about you ladies

433
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,000
being on my firebase
in the first place.

434
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,960
But I guess I can learn
how to live with it, can I?

435
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
I understand.

436
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,240
I want you to get a
list of supplies together

437
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,960
that you gonna have
to have turned over to

438
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
First Sergeant here take care of this.

439
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Good morning, Miss Flanagan.

440
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Captain...

441
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
The rank's Captain.

442
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
I'm real impressed.

443
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,460
Maybe you are made to see it.

444
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
C'mon, First Sergeant.

445
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,320
<i>Headquarters still didn't buy
my analysis of the situation.</i>

446
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,800
<i>Hell, they had experts staying
in air-conditioned offices in Saigon</i>

447
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,800
<i>who understood that we're a whole lot
better than anyone in the front line.</i>

448
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,800
<i>We had asked for
ammunition and reinforcements.</i>

449
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,400
<i>What we got was the mail run,
a few cases of beer and a VD film.</i>

450
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,420
<i>They just wouldn't believe we were
up against a regiment of Vietcong.</i>

451
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,920
<i>They didn't even bother to
send a replacement CO.</i>

452
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,420
Nice knowing you, sir

453
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,000
<i>There were times when
we all wondered whether</i>

454
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,200
<i>headquarters was
fighting the same war.</i>

455
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Incoming!

456
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Cover!

457
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,120
Get me the fuck outta here!

458
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Shit!

459
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,700
Damn, all you arty motherfuckers.

460
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
I'm an officer.

461
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
An officer?

462
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,800
If I'd knew you were officer,

463
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,100
I'd left your ass right
out there, motherfucker.

464
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,200
Nardo, we got contact.

465
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,020
Visual. Two figures.

466
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Two hundred yards.

467
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,420
Hello.

468
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,960
Yeah. Hi! Hi!

469
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,460
We friend.

470
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
No, no. Stay there, stay there.

471
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,460
American, mai loi.

472
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
What you got, Murph?

473
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Ah, just a couple of girls.

474
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,500
Wanna come out?
Whaddaya think?

475
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Me friend.

476
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Bullshit.

477
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
I smell sapper.

478
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Cut 'em down.

479
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Goddamit, Murphy.

480
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
I said take your weapon. . .

481
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Fuck you, you just fuck it...

482
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
No!

483
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
For God's sakes, no!

484
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Listen to me.

485
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
This is Vietnam, you understand?

486
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Pretty girls got balls.

487
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,360
Instead of their mommies
putting books in their hands,

488
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
and sending 'em to school,

489
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,360
they wrap 'em up in dynamite
and send 'em off to kill GIs.

490
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
You got that?

491
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,760
That's the enemy, Murphy.

492
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
That's the enemy!

493
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
Get it together!

494
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,360
<i>Charlie just reminded us
he had nothing to lose</i>

495
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,360
<i>and everything to gain.</i>

496
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,360
<i>You had to admire his
strength of purpose.</i>

497
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,360
<i>He'd been fighting off foreigners
for hundreds of years.</i>

498
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,360
<i>The Chinese, Japanese,
the French and now, us.</i>

499
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,120
<i>We knew. We just knew he
was never going to give up.</i>

500
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,920
<i>That night, Charlie pulled the
biggest publicity stunt of the war.</i>

501
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,840
<i>The last thing the folks at home
were expecting to see</i>

502
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,760
<i>on their tv sets that
day was a ravaged embassy.</i>

503
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,520
<i>Any news that the Tet offensive had started.</i>

504
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
<i>Had been told the war was almost won.</i>

505
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,600
<i>They would not be so trusting again.</i>

506
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,400
<i>All headquarters told me
was to hold the firebase,</i>

507
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
<i>whatever it took.</i>

508
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,880
A little religious communication

509
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,120
might not be a bad idea
this late in the game.

510
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,240
I myself, I don't take any chances.

511
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
I talk to Mohammed,

512
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
Buddha

513
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,740
and to Jesus H. Christ

514
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,800
and any other religious
honchos I can come up with.

515
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,600
There is no sense staying as
an atheist in a combat situation.

516
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Now we don't have a chaplain here,

517
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,600
but I don't see that as any major setback.

518
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,000
You can rest assured,

519
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,560
you will not go in that bag

520
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,060
until I've said a few
appropriate words over you.

521
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,720
I figured about 450 yards.
Set up the main tube.

522
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Pound them!

523
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,960
Recoil 25 four!

524
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,940
Fuck their guns!

525
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,120
All right, hold your fire!

526
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Wait now. Wait for my command!

527
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,680
Forceps.

528
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Captain.

529
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
I can help.

530
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,740
Give me something to do.

531
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,840
I've done field dressing.
-Uh-huh.

532
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,040
This is a big chance to be a hero.

533
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,320
I want you to maintain
constant contact with DiNardo.

534
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,120
You got it?

535
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Yes, Sergeant Major.

536
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,520
Hold your fire, goddamn it!

537
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,280
Fire!

538
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,600
Yeah, what's it like?

539
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
What's it like!?

540
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,280
How many of 'em?

541
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Medic!

542
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Medic!

543
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,640
<i>Charlie was testing us.</i>

544
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,640
<i>He lost his first assault on the northern side</i>

545
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
<i>when we were better prepared.</i>

546
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,640
<i>Then through his waiting,
DiNardo's position</i>

547
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,520
<i>on the east perimeter
was tougher for him.</i>

548
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,520
<i>but not so strongly defended.</i>

549
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
<i>Nice thinking, Charlie.</i>

550
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,880
<i>You damn your fathers
with our pants down.</i>

551
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,680
Pull back!

552
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Get on the horn to Haffner!

553
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
Tell him we're being overrun!

554
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,680
Shortwave!
This is Murphy!

555
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,680
Tell Hafner we need backup.
Now!

556
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Right now!

557
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
That's affirmative!

558
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
Let's go!

559
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,880
Jones, this is Hafner!

560
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
DiNardo's getting overrun.

561
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
There are gooks through the wire.

562
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,280
Gather as many as your troops
together as you can spare,

563
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,880
get 'em over to him, right now!

564
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,680
We're on our way!

565
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,080
Move out!

566
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Let's go!

567
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,540
Let's go. Payback time!

568
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,540
Now!

569
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,640
Howdy, you scumbag!

570
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
That's right! Go back!

571
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
All the way back to Hanoi!

572
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,260
Murphy, Spider, Hawk!

573
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,160
You're all on death detail.

574
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,260
Get out there
and kill the wounded.

575
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,260
I don't want any surprises, overnight.

576
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,060
Murphy, if you can find it
in your sweet little heart

577
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,360
to bring back a prisoner.
I'd appreciate it.

578
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,660
No problem.

579
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,660
Murphy.

580
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
What's goin' on with you?

581
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,660
Everything?

582
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,560
Jesus Christ!
They're killing wounded.

583
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,260
Don't tell me you're
feeling sorry for 'em, Sergeant?

584
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,160
They're soldiers just like us.

585
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,000
Wounded!

586
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Snipers! There!

587
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,800
Yes!

588
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,080
You have a good time?

589
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,620
You're fuckin' crazy,
you know that?

590
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,000
You're really diggin' this shit.

591
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
What were you
back home, a rapist?

592
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:16,920
No.

593
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,920
I'm just another
dumbass, like you.

594
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,920
All right, hang in there.
It'll be all right.

595
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,440
This is your ticket home, man.

596
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,680
It'll be all right.

597
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
Hang in there.

598
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,760
Okay, Mr. Commanding Officer.
Where's the medevac?

599
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,760
I've got eight people who will
be dead within the hour.

600
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,000
We're running out of morphine.

601
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,160
Where are the supplies I ordered?

602
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,280
You listen to me, Flanagan.

603
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,080
You listen good.

604
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,080
Communications bunker is history.

605
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,480
We are on our own.

606
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,480
There will be no resupply.

607
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,080
So you tighten up and
make do with what you've got.

608
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,380
You're a captain.

609
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,680
Be a goddamn captain.

610
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,680
Just the guy I was looking for.

611
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,840
Woo! Hot damn it, Murphy.

612
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,560
I told you to bring me back a live one.

613
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,800
Hey, he's still alive.

614
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,240
He's fine, pretty still alive.

615
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,960
For that matter, so am I.

616
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,480
Get him at the aid station.

617
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,840
I want this little dink talkin'
to me in twenty minutes.

618
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,840
No problem.

619
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,720
What the hell are you doing?

620
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,720
Leave him alone!

621
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,720
Leave him alone!

622
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,720
Look lady, this is called
extracting information.

623
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,880
You understand that?

624
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,720
So we torture prisoners
now, do we?

625
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,200
You goddamn right.
This ain't Nebraska, lady.

626
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,680
But you don't do it in my hospital.

627
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,080
No?

628
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,680
Goddamn it, talk to me!

629
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,680
Talk to me!

630
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,680
What kind of animal, are you?

631
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Animal?

632
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,680
Yeah.

633
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,760
Lady, you have any idea

634
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,880
if Charlie got in here.

635
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
What will they do?

636
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,760
He will rape you.

637
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,280
Your nurses.

638
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,640
Until you are dead.

639
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,480
But you know what?

640
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,600
They'd have to kill me first.

641
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,500
Animal?

642
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,160
I'm not that --- The Animal.

643
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,640
Sergeant Major.

644
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,640
Now, I mind being your radio operator.

645
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,000
I was trained Recon.

646
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,660
No patrols.

647
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,320
Goddamn it,
you're a short-timer.

648
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,880
You just don't need it.

649
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,120
Hi guys.

650
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,800
Can you stand a
little more excitement?

651
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,100
Whaddaya got, Nard?

652
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,100
They're digging.

653
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,100
Where?

654
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,600
At the edge of the tree line.

655
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,600
And they're headed
right this way.

656
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,840
My little Cong tells me that

657
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,720
two big guns are arriving
the first thing in the morning.

658
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,760
Where's your little Cong now?

659
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,920
He's probably shaking hands
with Buddha right now.

660
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,120
You'd think you could
get into their camp?

661
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,480
Sergeant Major.

662
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,800
You're in Bangkok.

663
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,320
It's Friday night.

664
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,520
And you got a fistful of dollars.

665
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,520
You think you could get laid?

666
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,160
Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah, I think you could too.

667
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,280
Shortwave, let's go to Bangkok.

668
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Okay. Go on.

669
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,080
Alright.

670
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,080
Keep your head down.

671
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,120
<i>We learned we were up
against the Dong Nai Regiment.</i>

672
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,120
<i>under the command of Colonel Cao Van.</i>

673
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,800
<i>He wasn't exactly one
of my favorite people.</i>

674
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,880
<i>He'd overrun 9th Motor
Transport last year.</i>

675
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,760
<i>and that'd really pissed me off.</i>

676
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,280
<i>So I thought I'd let
him know we weren't</i>

677
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,920
<i>gonna lay down
and die that easy.</i>

678
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,200
<i>It was time to sprinkle
some shit in Charlie's rice.</i>

679
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,760
Goddamn it, Jones. You have any idea

680
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,960
how close you just
came to get blown away?

681
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,600
Where the hell do you think
you are anyway, Iwo Jima?

682
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,900
No, this ain't exactly Suribachi, either.

683
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,720
I didn't know that you
were a flag-waver, Jones.

684
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,720
I care.

685
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,080
I don't care for a lot of it.

686
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,580
What I care for, care for a lot.

687
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,580
Know what I mean?

688
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,180
I've been a dedicated soldier

689
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,680
for twenty-three years.

690
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,440
Does that tell ya
something, hmm?

691
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,360
Yeah, I came in
the Marine Corps

692
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,160
when I was
seventeen years old.

693
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,160
So hell no.

694
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,680
I wouldn't change
a goddamn thing either.

695
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,280
Shit!

696
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,280
Goddamn it!

697
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,280
DiNardo!

698
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
DiNardo, I'm on a mine.

699
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Closer, Coates.

700
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,420
Give me a knife, man.
- I got ya. I got ya.

701
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,920
Goddamn it.
There's a patrol up there.

702
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,480
I'd like to see you back in one
piece. You understand me?

703
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,680
Oh, we'll just
leave him here, man?

704
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,520
Yeah, we're going.

705
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,360
Now!

706
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,760
DiNardo! Comin' in!

707
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:15,820
Password!

708
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,220
Fuck your password!

709
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,440
Yo! Comin' in !

710
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,440
What's the password?

711
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,440
♪Moonlight over Saigon.♪

712
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,440
♪It's so enticing.♪

713
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440
How you've been?
-Lovely.

714
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
You're little flat, Murphy.

715
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,440
It's the wording.

716
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,440
I think that got my name on it.

717
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,440
Good night.

718
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,080
How did you do this?

719
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
With a knife.

720
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,080
That's a little silly.

721
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,080
Silly?

722
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,080
I guess it is a little silly.

723
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,080
What's your name?

724
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,280
Cathy.

725
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,200
Kinda remind me of my girl.

726
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,720
Her name's Polly.

727
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,680
We're gettin' married in May.

728
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,040
We're supposed to be
married last November.

729
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,280
But leave got canceled.

730
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,280
But that's okay.

731
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,480
I like May better, anyway.

732
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,580
You got a piece?

733
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,080
What?

734
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,280
A rifle.

735
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,280
You have a rifle?

736
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,280
Uh-uh.

737
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,280
You might need one.

738
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,280
Tomorrow, were gonna
be attacked for sure.

739
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
Why don't you take mine?

740
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,280
Aren't you gonna need it?

741
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,280
I'll find another one.

742
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,280
Safety on. Off.

743
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,780
It's got a full clip.

744
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,780
Thanks.

745
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Wish me luck?

746
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,480
Good luck.

747
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,680
Soup's up. Let's break a leg.

748
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,920
<i>All over the country, Charlie
was giving us big trouble.</i>

749
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,920
<i>Nothing was out of his reach.</i>

750
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,880
<i>I just hoped
there was someone,</i>

751
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,050
<i>somewhere who
hadn't forgotten us.</i>

752
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,640
Fuck me dead!

753
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,640
No love for you today, mother?

754
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,640
Where we going, Skipper?

755
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,640
A fuckin' outpost called Gloria.
It's on the map.

756
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,640
Don't wait for it.

757
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,640
It's gonna go!
Get clear!

758
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,640
There goes our escort.

759
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,640
Picked a fine time to
leave me, Lucille.

760
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,640
Alright, saddle up!

761
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,240
Attack!

762
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,240
Eat this!

763
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,920
All right!

764
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,780
They're breakin' through.

765
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,280
Murphy, you hold this line!

766
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,640
Get back!
Get the fuck back!

767
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,280
Let's go!

768
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Fill it in!

769
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Quickly, get it
moved out, right now!

770
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,040
C'mon, Murphy!

771
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,160
Hold the line!

772
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,800
Is that it?

773
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,800
Sure is.

774
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,800
Which ones are our guys?

775
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,800
The ones in the middle.
I think.

776
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,400
Alright, squeeze the
cheeks together.

777
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,000
This fucker's gotten warmer.

778
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Guys, I'm goin' in low.

779
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,760
Just see 'em where you see 'em.
I'll come out over the trees.

780
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,760
Let's make it hard for Charlie.

781
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,600
This is fucking hairy.

782
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,560
Alright.

783
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,560
Boys maul up
that Twelve-Seven.

784
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,640
I see it!

785
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,640
In the tree line.

786
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,640
Alright, I got it.
I got it.

787
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,640
Got a rocket
right up your ass.

788
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Damn it, missed!

789
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
Fucked up their garden.
Somethin' awful.

790
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,160
Yes! Yes!

791
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,840
Hi. May I take your order?

792
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,240
Yeah, we need
C rations, ammunition, radio

793
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,240
and above all,
bring back the Air Cav.

794
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,240
You want French fries with that?

795
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,600
No, but I'll tell you what

796
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,820
you can have a clean shave

797
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:13,880
next time you come back.

798
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,520
You look a goddamn hippie!

799
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,520
Aye, General.

800
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,520
Back at noon.

801
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,040
<i>The Air Cav has bought us
a little more time.</i>

802
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,040
<i>God knows when they'll
come our way again.</i>

803
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,040
<i>The dead piled up</i>

804
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,440
<i>and too many of them were ours.</i>

805
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,440
<i>We were killing Charlie wholesale.</i>

806
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,200
<i>But he didn't seem to care.</i>

807
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,680
<i>Yes, we'd do the same if
Charlie occupied South Carolina.</i>

808
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,680
Jesus. . .

809
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,680
Fuckin' war.

810
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,680
They called it a 'police action'.

811
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,580
You took some hits, Skipper.

812
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,480
You've estranged the game
through this thing.

813
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,680
Gimme another one, Chief.
I need fifteen, yeah.

814
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,680
Got it.

815
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,520
Guys, I know you
got other missions

816
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,080
but I need some volunteers.

817
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,080
I'm on vacation.

818
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,520
There's a ceasefire. Can't you tell?
-Yeah.

819
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,520
We cease. They fire.

820
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
You guys like a
little excitement?

821
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,520
There's a firebase in
rat's ass called Gloria.

822
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,020
They're in deep shit.

823
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,520
How 'bout it?

824
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,520
Fuck it, why not?

825
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,520
Beats the mail run.

826
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,520
Check!

827
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,520
We're like heroes.

828
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,120
Yo, Skipper.
-Yeah.

829
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,120
We gassed and done, the fuckin' CO
wouldn't give us the aircraft.

830
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,120
What?

831
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,520
The supplies are
waiting too.

832
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,120
Says who?

833
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,120
Fucking ground officer.

834
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,120
Okay.

835
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,120
It's time to play captain.

836
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,120
Hey you. Boy.

837
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,120
Who you callin' 'boy'?

838
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,620
Number One, shut your mouth.

839
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,120
Number Two, I'm Captain Moran.

840
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,620
Sorry, Captain. I was just...

841
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,120
I don't care what
the fuck your name is.

842
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,120
What I care about is the
aircraft, right over here.

843
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,120
I'm taking that one.
I'm taking those two, as well.

844
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,120
I swear to God, if you waste
any more of my time.

845
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,620
You're a fuckin' dead guy.

846
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,620
Yes, Captain.

847
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,620
Start cleaned up, soldier.

848
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,120
Carry on.

849
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,740
Six-One-Two, this is Six.

850
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,240
Thirty second pass, over the canopy.

851
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,740
Let's burn Charlie's ass.

852
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:04,740
Gunners on your left, you'll
notice targets of opportunity.

853
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,740
Please fire at will and thank
you for flying Moran Airlines.

854
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,560
Yeah, yeah!

855
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,780
Help's coming.
Help's coming!

856
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,720
It's down. Let's get 'em in a hurry.
C'mon, crates. Move!

857
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,440
<i>The choppers were
bringing what they could.</i>

858
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,440
<i>But it didn't change a lot of line.</i>

859
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,440
<i>We were surrounded, outnumbered</i>

860
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,440
<i>but no place to go.</i>

861
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,440
<i>There was no doubt
in my military mind</i>

862
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,440
<i>the next attack could be the last.</i>

863
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,440
<i>It was a do or die situation.</i>

864
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,440
As ordered, General.

865
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,440
Outstanding.

866
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,440
Don't call me "General", no more.

867
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,440
I got you arms and some
medicals and a radio.

868
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,440
Hope that works.

869
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,440
I gotta go.

870
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,440
What's this?

871
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,440
Thought you said,
you needed a shave.

872
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,440
Good luck, General.

873
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,480
Six-One, Two. This is six.

874
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,480
Let 'em know who we
are on the way out.

875
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,480
Six, this is Six-One.

876
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,480
Ah, I got some rockets left.

877
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,480
We don't get paid
to bring them home.

878
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,480
Leave some widows behind.

879
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,480
Six, this is Six-One.

880
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,480
Sweep the deck,
set Two-Niner-Seven.

881
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Them motherfuckers.

882
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,200
They're at it again!

883
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
Alright, that's it.

884
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
Deadeye, you cut
those fuckers down

885
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,200
before we go out of business.
- Got ya!

886
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,200
Out-fucking-standing!

887
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,440
Yeah! Baby!

888
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,440
Ah, yes.

889
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,520
Pee Wee.

890
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,440
Pee Wee.

891
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,640
<i>The nights were always
beautiful that time of the year.</i>

892
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,640
<i>But you were no safer at night</i>

893
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,140
<i>and the long hours of stillness.</i>

894
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,640
<i>worked on your fears.</i>

895
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,640
<i>Night was the time you wondered
what the hell you were doing here.</i>

896
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,640
<i>And when do you get your
balls blown off tomorrow.</i>

897
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,640
<i>You can do some ugly
pretty thinking at night.</i>

898
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,640
<i>For some of us, the nights
were gettin' far too long.</i>

899
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,920
You're turning to
shit on me, Nard.

900
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,920
Huh?

901
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:47,920
Look at yourself.

902
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,920
You don't look like any kind of
goddamn Marine I've ever seen.

903
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,920
What is this?

904
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,600
You turnin' into
some kind of goddamn

905
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,480
Cambodian witch doctor on me?

906
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,320
What's next?

907
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,320
A hole in your nose?

908
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,320
A fuckin' plate on your lower lip?

909
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,880
Fuck the Marines.

910
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,360
I'm gonna act like
I never heard that.

911
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,360
What?

912
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,880
I'm gonna act like I
never even heard that.

913
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,880
Fuck the Corps. . .

914
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,880
. . .and fuck the war.

915
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,880
If I didn't raise
you from a puppy

916
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,880
and hold your hand
all the way up

917
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,880
through the
United States Marine Corps,

918
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,880
I would step on
your goddamn dick

919
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,240
right here and now.

920
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,240
Do you think I care?

921
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,280
I mean, do you think
I'd give a shit anymore?

922
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,920
Aw hell, now seventeen are dead.

923
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,400
When I was seventeen,

924
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,000
I want to be just like you.

925
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,080
Badass Marine

926
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,800
Go out and find myself

927
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,280
a shitty little war

928
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,280
and fight communism.

929
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,280
Okay?

930
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,520
You're goddamn war hero.

931
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:04,840
But I tell you what,

932
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,520
at seventeen years later,

933
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,800
I don't even know
what a communist is.

934
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,680
What? Some dink in

935
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,680
black pajamas

936
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,420
runnin' around
in rice paddies.

937
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,600
Ha, that's a commie?

938
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:24,160
Hell, that poor sonofabitch
hasn't even heard of Karl Marx.

939
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,680
This has dick to
do with dinks,

940
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,160
commies, or
Karl fucking Marx

941
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,160
and you know
as well, as I do

942
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,160
it has to do with
your little boy Jimmy.

943
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,800
But he died, he took you
right along with him, didn't he?

944
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,300
No.

945
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,800
Sergeant Major.

946
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,800
You just got too personal.

947
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,180
That's right.

948
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,840
Turn your back on him.

949
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,840
Go out there and bury your
goddamn head in the sand

950
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,840
like a fuckin' ostrich.

951
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,440
Maybe it'll all go away.

952
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,120
Goddamn it! He was the
only thing I ever loved!

953
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,840
You let me down, Nard.

954
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,440
I let you down.

955
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,440
That's right.

956
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,120
When the boy died,
you can come to me.

957
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,620
You let me put my arms around you

958
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,620
and cried with you.

959
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:22,120
You left for San Francisco and
stayed drunk for three weeks.

960
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,120
AWOL.

961
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Got busted all the
way down to corporal.

962
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,440
I didn't go AWOL.

963
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,320
I went crazy.

964
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,320
And I went to hell.

965
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,360
May I please be dismissed?

966
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,400
Go to bed, Nard.

967
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Go on.

968
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,520
How's it goin', soldier?

969
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,520
I'd rather be home, sir.

970
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,840
Where is home?

971
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,840
Little Rock.

972
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,960
You're better off here, boy.

973
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:38,960
Think so?

974
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,260
Yeah.

975
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,540
Just keep your
ass down, you hear?

976
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,840
I hear you, sir.
- Okay.

977
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:53,580
Shit!

978
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,100
Hafner.

979
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,200
East 50.
On the double.

980
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:06,080
Anyone know
who these belong to?

981
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,080
This is Corporal Miller.

982
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,080
He's dead.

983
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,080
Hell the whole
gun crew's dead.

984
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,640
And to add insult to injury,

985
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,920
Charlie took the Fifty fucking
caliber machinegun with him.

986
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,040
I don't any respect
for Corporal Miller anymore

987
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,320
Because he allowed
his group to relax.

988
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,320
They let their guard down
for five fucking minutes.

989
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,320
And Charlie took
advantage of it.

990
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
Look at 'em
God damn it!

991
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
Pay attention.

992
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,320
Stay alert.

Stay alive.

It's as simple as that.

01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:39,840
All right. Move back

How ya doin', Champ?

Out of luck.

I can't feel nothin'.

We'll medevac you out.
You'll be in Saigon in no time.

Yeah, yeah Nard.

Do me.

Do me, now.

1034
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,840
Get the hell outta
here, Flanagan.

1035
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,520
You ain't needed.

1036
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:25,800
No...

1037
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,600

I can't.

1041
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,920
Goddamn it.
We had a deal.

1042
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,920
I ain't going
home like this.

1043
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,920
That fucking deal
was for me, man.

1044
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:49,920
You do it, now.

<i>I lost a lot of good men at Gloria.</i>

1055
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,160
<i>But then, so did the Dong Nai.</i>

1056
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:34,080
<i>The Air Cav shot them up all the
way back to the Phu Loi river.</i>

1057
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,420
<i>In the four months of the Tet Offensive,</i>

1058
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:13,200
<i>Charlie lost 55,000 men.</i>

1059
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:18,960
<i>After that, the Vietcong ceased to
exist as an independent fighting force.</i>

1060
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,560
<i>And Hanoi took control of their war.</i>

1061
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:45,660
DiNardo,

1062
