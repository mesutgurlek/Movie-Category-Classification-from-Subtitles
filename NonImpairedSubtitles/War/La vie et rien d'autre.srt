1
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,879
LIFE AND NOTHING BUT

2
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,312
Keep your back up.

3
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,312
Be careful.

4
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,634
Sit up straight.

5
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,250
Come on, up straight.

6
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,522
I warned you.

7
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,591
I can't hear you.

8
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,132
Not hurt?

9
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,539
I'll hold the horse.

10
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,802
Sister.

11
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:56,440
Military hospital 45, please.

12
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,070
Up past the beached skiff.

13
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,943
Thank you.

14
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,955
My brother loved those cars.

15
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,515
Ready?

16
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,213
One...

17
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,019
Six.

18
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,317
No memory?

19
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,791
Name, age, nothing?

20
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,021
Can hardly talk either.

21
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,653
He sings sometimes.

22
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,459
Sings what?

23
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,794
Depends.

24
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,768
Tantum Ergo, or some filthy limerick.

25
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,135
Put down Tantum Ergo, Trevise.

26
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,343
He could be a priest.

27
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,208
Dirty-minded priests do exist.

28
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:11,010
I need signs scars, warts, tattoos.

29
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,312
Tantum Ergo's a tattoo of sorts.

30
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,410
You photograph bodies too?

31
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,148
Yes, dead bodies.

32
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,020
The living...

33
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,117
The dead don't move.

34
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,660
The living talk.

35
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,660
Theoretically.

36
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,458
That costs money.

37
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,760
Another thrifty guy.

38
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,562
Know what "missing in action" means?

39
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,364
Sure.

40
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,235
Tou're the first then.

41
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:42,509
A guy's maybe living or dead, or half-and-half,
meaning deaf, blind, legless, amnesiac...

42
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,946
like your pal there.

43
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,415
Or a deserter.

44
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,452
And I get 'em all.

45
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,850
So I take photos.

46
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,683
File them.

47
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,654
Snoop about.

48
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:59,096
And sometimes I put a name on a face,
or vice versa.

49
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,860
That makes one less.

50
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,671
<i>Walking down from Nantes</i>

51
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,899
<i>from Nantes to Montaigu</i>

52
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,770
<i>Hi-diddle-dum!</i>

53
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,504
<i>Diddle-my-bum!</i>

54
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,943
He sang that one?

55
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,810
Think so.

56
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,883
<i>I met a fair lass</i>

57
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,885
<i>Who slept quite bare-assed</i>

58
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,579
Excuse me.

59
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,853
<i>Quite bare-assed</i>...

60
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,449
What, dammit!

61
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,789
I said Excuse me.

62
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,363
Can't you knock?

63
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,364
I did, on 10 doors.

64
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,127
Knock on 11.

65
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,531
Knock till...

66
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,103
somebody answers.

67
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,946
Definitely a priest.

68
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,826
Dr Mortier, please.

69
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,059
There's no sign.

70
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,862
Ask at the office.

71
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,335
But where is it?

72
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,575
Madame de Oourtil?

73
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,712
Dr. Mortier sent me.

74
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:28,887
Stretch your left leg.

75
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:33,218
We have somebody who fits your description.

76
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,588
Don't get your hopes up.

77
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,922
I'm used to it.

78
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,393
Tou've been here?

79
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,398
No, but in Vittel, Biarritz, all over.

80
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,933
Of course.

81
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,963
My father-in-law met the doctor
at the Senate last month.

82
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,470
The heads are shaved-scalp disease.

83
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,569
Changes their looks.

84
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,475
Here we are.

85
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,486
There's a resemblance.

86
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,931
Have him stand.

87
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,231
Too tall.

88
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,206
Men grow after 20.

89
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,073
My husband would be 34.

90
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,545
Illness lengthens them.

91
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,147
He just wanted to touch you.

92
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,445
He's harmless.

93
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,886
Show me the others.

94
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,484
Even Napoleon scored less.

95
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,796
Not even a million dead in twenty years.

96
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,832
And <i>we</i> scored 1, 500,000 in four years.

97
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,164
Fourteen to eighteen. Four years!

98
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,169
Maybe even more.

99
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,774
You'll say some journalist made it up.

100
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,605
But it's in print.

101
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,839
"P<i>roportionally</i>...

102
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,811
<i>France paid the highest toll:</i>
<i>An eloquent record</i>."

103
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,820
The Huns took us for idiots!

104
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,719
But we're the record!

105
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,588
All clean.

106
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,820
You're dry at least.

107
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,691
I'll be on my way.

108
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,924
We'll call you.

109
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:20,760
Good!

110
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,630
One more!

111
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:29,740
Sorry, dear lady, that's the last of my leftovers.

112
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:36,304
I'll give you a note for my friend Favradanne at the
Vetrille center for aphasia.

113
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,178
Thank you.

114
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,886
It's nothing at all.

115
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,084
I admire the Senator.

116
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,490
My respects.

117
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,323
Let's see the lung cases.

118
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,226
- And the gas victims?
- Two dead this week.

119
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,269
Good.

120
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,771
It's calming down.

121
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,078
Snubbing me, Simone?

122
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,407
Not home in Reims?

123
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,347
I'm a flighty fellow.

124
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,714
You're thinning down.

125
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,151
Eat.

126
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,416
Find what you wanted, Madam?

127
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,219
Yes, thanks.

128
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,224
If I can help...

129
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,319
You at least stopped singing.

130
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,837
Those are hospital dead.

131
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,963
Even Germans and Arabs.

132
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,234
We treat everybody.

133
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,173
Crosses.
Names.

134
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,574
I know how it's done.

135
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,738
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes, madame.

136
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,839
- With the mouth.
- Oh, good.

137
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,825
Put that in the bar, on the double.

138
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,589
At last!

139
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,328
My bicyle chain keeps breaking.

140
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:09,136
The general's here and the shit's hit the fan.

141
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,640
Predictable.

142
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,644
Petitions, articles, Senate speechs.

143
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,270
But you're oblivious.

144
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:19,511
Only your statistics count, your hotchpotch...

145
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,678
you give no signs of life.

146
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,086
You're never around, Major...

147
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,559
Not on the 24th...

148
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,355
A field mission, sir.

149
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,259
- And the 29th?
- Another one.

150
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,491
I've cornered you now.

151
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,534
I need an unknown soldier.

152
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,660
You're the man.

153
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,101
No, General,

154
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,574
I've done twenty missions - no unknowns.

155
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,509
- My mission's to find and identify...
- Yes, FIND!

156
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,342
- Military dead... or missing.

157
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,008
Up your alley!

158
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,348
Perrin, your opinion?

159
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,355
"In each military zone..."

160
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,018
"exhumation of an unidentified French soldier".

161
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,925
It's clear, dammit!

162
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,758
"Soldier".

163
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:05,626
"French".

164
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,096
"Unidentified."

165
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,291
Your department!

166
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,064
I won't pick a body to learn
its name a week later.

167
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,662
But you haven't managed in 2 years.

168
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,174
I have countless investigators...

169
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,712
Hundreds of questionnaires out...

170
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,716
which may return any day, saying
"Your soldier was called so-and-so."

171
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,013
Then I have a family on my hands.

172
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,648
There won't be questions
because they won't know.

173
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,854
Can you read "Top Secret."

174
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,054
Fine, sir.

175
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,099
- I'll search.
- Don't search. Find.

176
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,134
Today's the 5th.

177
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:47,228
"Bodies from nine zones are due
in Verdun at the latest..."

178
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,967
Guess?
"November 9th, 1920."

179
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,442
I want him signed,
sealed and delivered tomorrow.

180
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,672
If this leaks...

181
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,717
Leaks how?

182
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,684
The newspapers.

183
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:07,783
Then your unknown soldier's mystery evaporates
and loses it's symbolism.

184
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,861
Still a Dreyfusard.

185
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:12,658
Get lost.

186
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,528
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,304
Stick a pin in the map.

188
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,909
At random, General?

189
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,711
At random.

190
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,981
Better over there.

191
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,327
"Top Secret".

192
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,794
You won't look?

193
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,231
You alone are in charge.

194
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,099
Oh?

195
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,733
And no Brits or Huns
under the Arch of Triumph.

196
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,258
Hurry up! Hurry up!

197
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,299
You too! Hurry up!

198
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,862
Look what I get.

199
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,964
Orientals.

200
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,940
And tiny, to boot.

201
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,239
They're good diggers.

202
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,371
Even in chalk.

203
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:42,853
- So I start with...
- That's your affair.

204
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,857
For the coffins see Lambert:
The best oak wood...

205
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,258
silver handles, lead lining.

206
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:54,856
- I'd rather go to Garnier...
- Lambert lost 2 sons.

207
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,334
The work will do him good.

208
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,564
Be careful.

209
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,571
I know.

210
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,141
No English or Germans...

211
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,504
And no negroes.

212
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,805
Of course.

213
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,673
Chateau de Vétrille... in Vétrille.

214
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,447
But there's no such name.

215
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,352
He must have mentioned a city.

216
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:23,861
It's clear " Hospital zone...

217
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,157
Château de Vétrille."

218
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,130
Yes, but Vétrille?

219
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,935
I'll ask.

220
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,709
You're not fast enough.

221
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,678
The schoolmistress!

222
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,250
At last.

223
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:56,226
- You recognize me?
- Mr. Lagrange - my inspector.

224
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,989
Miss Vallier.

225
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:02,227
I was afraid I'd miss you.

226
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,631
It's the holiday period.

227
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,968
- I asked that the kids...
- It was taken care of.

228
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,506
That's fine.

229
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:14,045
But you know I'm here for a reason.

230
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:24,647
And my reason is Jacques Lecordier,
licensed teacher, is back for his post.

231
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,818
Which is yours.

232
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,135
Silence!

233
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,469
No hurry.

234
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,468
I can stay with my family.

235
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,102
I have board too.

236
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,478
The kids nearly scare me now.

237
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,847
They're nice.

238
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,396
Château de...

239
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,989
I'm in a rush.

240
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,923
The stuff keeps coming up.

241
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,098
Look, old boy.

242
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,504
Parisians...

243
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,838
Rich Parisians.

244
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:01,082
But we're fine as we are.

245
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:07,125
Those yellow-bellies may be comfy,
but they're all cuckolds.

246
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:12,129
Figure how many of their wives I fixed on leave.

247
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:17,760
But hell, you got the clap as bonus.

248
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,046
Don't move, old boy.

249
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,480
This is big stuff.

250
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,813
A 220, I'll bet.

251
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,651
Got to undo the nag so's he won't move.

252
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,487
Fetch the Mine Squad.

253
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,552
Quick as ye can, son.

254
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,595
Easy, old boy...

255
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,032
Take it slow.

256
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,475
The one I replaced has replaced me.

257
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,554
Could I work full time for you?

258
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,922
If it's okay with the boss...

259
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,392
Ask him.

260
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,953
But what'll she ask for?

261
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:25,128
Before, she had the school pay coming.

262
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,367
But now... How much you want?

263
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,377
Only what you'd pay another.

264
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,246
That's alright.

265
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,647
Can you start now?

266
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,116
Thanks, Madame Valentin.

267
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,744
I'll take my bike in.

268
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,550
I'll fix you a rum coffee.

269
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,283
No rum, you know.

270
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:01,501
Siemens and Shukert are back at
the Alsacian coal and lumber union.

271
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,972
So?

272
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,872
They're Germans.

273
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,274
So?

274
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,471
The losers do better than us.

275
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,447
Just be glad we're still on our feet.

276
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,450
Looks like little Alice.

277
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,520
She's back?

278
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,714
Hope and zippers spring eternal.

279
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,792
Shame on you for such talk.

280
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,417
The boy wants the Mine Squad.

281
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,927
Hear that?

282
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,360
Nobody's in.

283
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:30,663
Abel's horse turned up a shell.

284
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,967
The Mine Squad's in the Fartout woods.

285
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,870
I can cycle there.

286
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,739
Take my bike then.

287
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,587
Look at that crowd.

288
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,535
It must be a sale.

289
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,905
I see soldiers.

290
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,972
A sale of what?

291
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,479
- A harvest.
- A harvest?

292
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,449
Eggs, or snails.

293
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,712
Or mushrooms.

294
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,811
It must be mushrooms.

295
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,822
There are women too.

296
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,119
They're buying!

297
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,127
Of course, André!

298
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,356
You always have an answer.

299
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,558
The angelus-bell!

300
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,225
Time for your midday munch.

301
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,634
It can wait a wee bit.

302
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,853
The July law is crap!

303
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,593
Letting families retrieve the bodies!

304
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,760
It <i>is</i> understandable.

305
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:21,745
In the battlefields and the cemeteries the dead
could be counted, or at least approximated.

306
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:25,476
But once the bodies are dispersed,
the issue is clouded.

307
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,677
It's a political ploy!

308
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,583
We'll write the mayors.

309
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,679
With what personnel?

310
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,883
That's why we have to hurry!

311
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,552
Put men in the stations!

312
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:41,099
Count all the coffins before it's too late!

313
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,689
This not pork, Miss?

314
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,099
It's a roast!

315
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:52,507
See, it's written on the board -
<i>roast</i> with puréed peas!

316
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,717
Here's tea.

317
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,445
I want the wine-mug!

318
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,487
No liquor at this table.

319
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,384
Not for the Muslims!

320
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,888
I'm allowed!

321
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,822
I'm Christian!

322
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:15,857
It's not the retrieval of bodies
that set things going,

323
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,528
but the retrieval of missiles,
cartridges, weapons...

324
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,801
that turns into tons of steel, copper and nickel.

325
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,239
All that has value!

326
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:29,679
It gets turned into bullion... gold bullion!

327
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,774
This is my younger brother Julien.

328
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,683
Artist, painter...

329
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,121
Joined up in '15, two wounds, three mentions.

330
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,920
In the infantry.

331
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,190
A doughfoot's not worth a gunner,
but he's gotta eat.

332
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,559
May I?

333
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,860
Have a seat.

334
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,303
Alice!
My coffee!

335
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,434
And this "unknown soldier" bit...

336
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:02,309
it's been going on for three,
no, four years - November 16th!

337
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,349
Now they want to botch it in four days!

338
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,714
The cheese has a taste...

339
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,720
Of gas, the carpenters say.

340
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,882
I'm in a hurry, my child.

341
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,586
My cheese has a taste, Major?

342
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,687
I didn't have any, but I hope it has a taste...

343
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,663
...of camembert.

344
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,494
Major.

345
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,065
I lost my teaching job.

346
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,332
Do you need anybody?

347
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,930
And here?

348
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,100
This is temporary, not a career.

349
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,973
I have a diploma!

350
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,282
You should return home, child.

351
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,611
You know I can't!

352
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,845
I know, I know, your fiancé.

353
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,789
You should forget about him too!

354
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,592
What do you think you're going to find?

355
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:59,335
A handsome young man, a soldier in uniform?

356
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,064
Even if he's alive...

357
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:08,272
if by some miracle you find him,
you may wish you never had!

358
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,647
Because he'll be missing half his body
or half his face!

359
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,016
How can you say that?

360
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,249
I say it because it's better...

361
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,350
for both of you.

362
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,622
My coffee...

363
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,133
Come round my office.

364
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,102
I'll try to find you work.

365
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,733
Absolutely not!

366
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,614
That's nice!

367
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,621
My brother did it.

368
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,486
He needs a job.

369
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,890
Like everyone else!

370
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,689
Isn't that the Fargny mill?

371
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,388
Yes, sir.

372
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,058
July '16.

373
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,226
July first.

374
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,701
Nasty spot...

375
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,567
I'll say!

376
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,003
A real artist!

377
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,404
I've nothing to offer.

378
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,000
- You know Mercadot?
- The sculptor?

379
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,136
I'll mention you to him.

380
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,080
Bring him along to the tunnel tomorrow.

381
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,377
Thank you, Major.

382
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,881
Five plum brandies!

383
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,130
How will you manage?

384
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,675
I'll put the tray on the seat.

385
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,443
We mostly make mint tea, for the Arabs...

386
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,522
at least it's hot.

387
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,856
Here's sugar.

388
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,458
You're really not hungry?

389
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,193
I have no appetite.

390
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,735
I can bring some cookies...

391
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,804
They're clean.

392
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,065
No, thanks.

393
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,004
Unless you have fruit?

394
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,633
Fruit, fresh vegetables...

395
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,304
even milk for the kids is a big fuss.

396
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,641
You have children?

397
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,010
I had over twenty.

398
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,084
Not mine!

399
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,016
I was the schoolteacher.

400
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,451
Not any more?

401
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,147
As of today!

402
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,359
Now I recognize you.

403
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,122
You had a bike?

404
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,263
It's good, huh?

405
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:18,462
As long as it doesn't taste of cork or vinegar...

406
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,367
At three francs, that's a good wine!

407
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,905
It goes down well.

408
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,911
Have a glass.

409
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,720
Have a look at the headlines.

410
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,696
Grézaucourt...

411
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,601
That name sounds familiar.

412
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:58,642
You passed by it for sure,
coming the way you did.

413
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,608
It's a tunnel?

414
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,736
Yes!

415
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,508
The bloody Huns mined it during their retreat...

416
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:08,985
A whole train blew up inside -
a Red Cross train!

417
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,282
It's only being dug out now?

418
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,482
It's not as if they haven't tried.

419
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,185
Lots of railroad workers here.

420
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,659
We know what's up.

421
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,923
It keeps caving in!

422
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,467
The place I'm looking for
is the Château de Vétrille.

423
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,022
The "Deposit"?

424
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,254
A deposit of what?

425
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,852
A deposit of memories.

426
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,159
Of the poor guys who died in there.

427
00:28:55,266 --> 00:29:01,000
You must have noticed it from the road.

428
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:05,736
I thought they were mushrooming!

429
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,839
I bother them.

430
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,408
You can laugh, you the Artist...

431
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,750
I upset them!

432
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,383
Because I keep accounts
which never come out right.

433
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,393
"Mind your own business!"

434
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:27,261
"Yourjob's the missing, not the dead!"

435
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,300
But I do it anyway.

436
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,561
So?

437
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:37,608
So... 200,000 soldiers
haven't been accounted for.

438
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,609
And I find more every day!

439
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,406
200,000 more,
200,000 less!

440
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,572
My figures are exact!

441
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,376
200,000 dead have been concealed!

442
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,452
So what if they have?

443
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:53,957
Humanity's entered its final stage,
the dance of life and death -

444
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,855
the great apotheosis!

445
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,954
We plug up the holes and screw
to prepare for the next war!

446
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,125
Here's a good spot!

447
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,964
What?

448
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,471
I'll stick their bloody monument right here.

449
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,839
Eight doughboys, four on each side,

450
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:18,246
in gilded bronze, and Victory above,
her wings outspread.

451
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,283
What do you say?

452
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,251
That's all?

453
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,481
It's very nice...

454
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,785
it looks a little like a brooding hen, but...

455
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,123
What are you hanging around for?

456
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,218
Major...

457
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,663
They want to dig up my land.

458
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,394
Your land?

459
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,265
I was given this plot.

460
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:45,070
Excellent soil for growing vegetables, Major.

461
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,041
For beans...
For lettuce...

462
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,909
I'll see what I can do.

463
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,106
Want a lift back?

464
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,047
Think of it!

465
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:57,850
I'm on the Fine Arts jury at Verdun,
for the November 10th ceremony.

466
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,014
What ceremony?

467
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,318
The lottery for the "Unknown Soldier"!

468
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,792
We can't very well shoot craps!

469
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,644
Château de Vétrille?

470
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,269
This is it.

471
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,541
Where's the entrance?

472
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,581
Right there.

473
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,479
It's locked.

474
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,643
Yes, it's locked.

475
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,984
My husband may be hospitalized here...

476
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,184
Hospital's gone.

477
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,727
The Baroness lives here now, at last!

478
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,127
It's a château again.

479
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,722
She's not displeased.

480
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,281
Please sit down, believe me, I'm sorry...

481
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,852
The hospital was disaffected
three weeks ago!

482
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,387
The letter is dated last week!

483
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:08,118
I understand, Madam, but these disaffections are
not within our limits...

484
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:13,755
I've gone in circles on your roads - no markers, no
roadsigns!

485
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,958
Road repair is limited to...

486
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,261
Yes, it's the limit!

487
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:21,862
No, I said "is limited to" not "it's the limit"...

488
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:25,567
I say it's the limit - of incompetence!

489
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,271
Where is the ledger?

490
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,744
Of complaints!

491
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,344
This is outrageous!

492
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:37,547
All public places have them - but not you...
You get off easy!

493
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:42,592
This letter (which comes from
the National Assistance Board)...

494
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,925
"Liaison with Military Hospitals" - I can read!

495
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,658
But that's not us!

496
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,132
"Hospital Services of Military Districts"

497
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,898
"A ward for non-identified
mentally-ill patients..."

498
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,474
"may exist at the temporary hospital
in Vétrille".

499
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,271
"<i>May exist</i>...

500
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,039
<i>temporary hospital</i>".

501
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,080
Give that to me!

502
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,784
It won't shut!

503
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,650
You neither know or understand a thing!

504
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,520
You're imbeciles and brutes
and you break things!

505
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,922
Leave me be!

506
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:20,623
Will you honor me with your presence, Madam?

507
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,869
Please sit down.

508
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,802
I'm in charge of these brutes and imbeciles.

509
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,904
My name is Dellaplane.

510
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,610
Your outburst is unjust.

511
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,118
It's only normal that I intervene.

512
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:47,487
You may remember we met near Berck.

513
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:52,029
You are unjust because
our service does what it can.

514
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,759
You say we neither understand
or know a thing...

515
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,359
"Iréne de Courtil, née Santelloz..."

516
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,531
"wishes to locate Infantry Sergeant François de
Courtil, her husband..."

517
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,007
"missing in action near Moronvilliers..."

518
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:10,411
"on September 26, 1918,
on reconnaissance."

519
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:15,919
Pretty good for a
bunch of know-nothings, isn't it?

520
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,320
- "Caught under artillery fire
- " French artillery fire!

521
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,892
That, Madam...

522
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,429
"of great violence, he was seen to fall..."

523
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,963
"while requesting the lifting of fire."

524
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,829
So he's dead rather than missing.

525
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,094
Yes...

526
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:31,964
No!

527
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:37,975
We thought he was dead, we wore mourning, but
one day a sergeant came to see us.

528
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:45,482
He said my husband had been picked up by the
Germans and hospitalized near Buzancy.

529
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,676
He didn't react or speak, but he was alive!

530
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,618
This fellow was sure he was alive.

531
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,484
I have his name somewhere.

532
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,582
Corporal Liebourg, farmer.

533
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,059
You knew that?

534
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,858
Have you a portrait of your husband?

535
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,836
Cnly a small medallion.

536
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,429
May I have it for a few minutes?

537
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,940
The De Courtil dossier in the senatorial files!

538
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:28,419
Make me an enlarged pantograph.

539
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,050
What will you do?

540
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,254
Have no fear, it's technical.

541
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,263
We won't dent it.

542
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:41,601
As for the German military hospital,
during our victorious offensive,

543
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,903
they evacuated their own wounded.

544
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,137
- As for ours, including, probably...
- Certainly!

545
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:56,381
Probably - certainly - your husband, they were
brought to the Vézillé and Vouziers stations.

546
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:03,256
But the lists of wounded evacuated by train were
destroyed by the bombardments.

547
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:07,422
Thus... thus you know nothing more
than years ago!

548
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,397
It's as clear as day!

549
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:12,529
Recognize this?

550
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:13,797
My father-in-law.

551
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,270
Yes!

552
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:21,710
The Senator has a terrifying idea
of the Republic!

553
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:28,611
There are 350,000 families
in the same unhappy situation,

554
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,244
but Paul de Courtil couldn't care less!

555
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,583
He writes!

556
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,624
Tirelessly!

557
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,751
His colleagues intervene -
the Senate, the Ministry, my superiors -

558
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,958
all the bloody pains in the asses!

559
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:46,196
You just wanted to get back
at my father-in-law?

560
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,204
Give me back my portrait!

561
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,206
Just a minute.

562
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,436
Your behavior is absolutely...

563
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,875
shameful!

564
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,209
"For personal and other reasons..."

565
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,647
"I urgently need to know my son's fate."

566
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,877
"Please give orders so that..."

567
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:06,116
"priority be given, due to the interests at stake."

568
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,316
Interests at stake!

569
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,087
I'm not interested!

570
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,595
"Services rendered
over the years by Shukert & De Courtil..."

571
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,189
That's a closet.

572
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,767
"Permit me to request"

573
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:21,702
"a special effort from the Search Bureau", etc.

574
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:25,572
- And here, concerning me...
- My portrait!

575
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:30,409
"The Bureau Chief, whose statistical passion
equals his staggering incompetence..."

576
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,175
François wasn't like that.

577
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,717
He volunteered - at the worst moment.

578
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,480
I know. In May, '17.

579
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,849
Better late...

580
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:43,552
So you've decided to be an obstacle.

581
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,356
No, Madam.

582
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:50,662
I don't have time to explain,
but no, I'm not an obstacle.

583
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,864
Except that there are
350,00 missing soldiers.

584
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:59,341
349,771 to be exact.

585
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,277
So tell the patriarch of Shukert & De Courtil

586
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:10,048
that a 350-thousandth of my staggering
incompetence is devoted to his personal case.

587
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,386
A 350-thousandth of my time, but that's all!

588
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,392
Your medallion.

589
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,663
What do you think?

590
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:28,034
Dolicho... I mean Dolichocephalic.

591
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,970
Blond?

592
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:30,904
Dirty blond.

593
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,909
Dirty blond, probably long-limbed.

594
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,605
178-180?

595
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:41,174
- In centimeters...
- One meter 86.

596
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:45,051
No, he was born in '86!

597
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,420
About my height?

598
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,425
Shorter.

599
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,427
This high?

600
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,258
Taller.

601
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:57,994
Well, let's leave it at my 78-80...

602
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,332
Eyes?

603
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,837
Light.

604
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:12,575
Incredible the range you get in clear eyes.

605
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,083
Even dark eyes.

606
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,813
Yours for instance.

607
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,513
François' were light blue.

608
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,041
Your blue is really grey.

609
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,411
Let's say tall...

610
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,744
size 3...

611
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,116
medium grey... section F.

612
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,823
Can I help?

613
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:09,136
I may sing dirty songs, but I know my manners.

614
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,455
It's frightening.

615
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,193
Only the first pages...

616
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:35,129
Then it's like an herbarium.

617
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,080
A Hotchkiss?

618
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,879
Don't think so.

619
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,453
Remember Duchene's?

620
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,749
The general's?

621
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,120
Yeah, the bastard.

622
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:05,457
Well this hood's much bigger.

623
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,030
Can we?

624
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,725
Not the glass.
It'll dirty.

625
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,825
Still warm.

626
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,895
Does at least 60 mph.

627
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,531
No, 80!

628
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,180
It's all set.

629
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,045
You can eat at the Red Cross cantine
in 10 minutes.

630
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,277
Eat rice possible?

631
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,046
Sure.

632
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,317
Eat rice possible all the time in those places.

633
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,517
Sure it's a rice-terant.

634
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,288
You take that one.

635
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,396
Leaving the region?

636
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,432
I've seen so many hospitals.

637
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,524
And you close them all.

638
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:48,332
Where can I reach you if I find a lead?

639
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,339
At my father-in-law's.

640
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,569
I'll do everything in my power.

641
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,145
A 300-thousandth of your power.

642
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,499
Dig up your anonymous holy relic?

643
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,965
Not yet.

644
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,729
You looked at least?

645
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,270
I have the coffin.

646
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,170
Thirty two oak.

647
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,572
Impeccable.

648
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,667
Not a shrapnel mark.

649
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,178
Answer my question the body?

650
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,908
Packaging first.

651
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,108
If I find my man...

652
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,811
I must know where to put him.

653
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,046
And those?

654
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:38,644
Reserve.

655
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,316
We're digging up more than we need,
you know...

656
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,360
I don't quite read you, Perrin.

657
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,487
Get your demoralizing display out of sight.

658
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,225
I need a van.

659
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,130
There is no van.

660
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:57,663
Put all this in your wheelbarrow
and get it out of sight.

661
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,107
Do it as if it were an order.

662
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,041
Fine, Major...

663
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,911
Those coffins were inferior stuff.

664
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,283
My father was a carpenter.

665
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,253
Supplied the area.

666
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,552
I should know.

667
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:21,154
True, at that price you can't expect rosewood.

668
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,927
They make profits on quantity.

669
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:28,201
A 100 just for Grézaucourt.

670
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,069
A franc an item = 100 francs.

671
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,665
Grézaucourt?

672
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,266
Is that a hospital?

673
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,073
Hospital? No.

674
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,670
A deposit.

675
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:42,616
A convoy hit a mine in the tunnel to Buzancy.

676
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,211
Is it far?

677
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,119
We passed it today.

678
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,987
The mushrooms.

679
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,856
Let's go back.

680
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:55,625
Monsieur ordered the car
for the Senate in the morning.

681
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,224
He won't go on horseback.

682
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,462
Drive me to a train.

683
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,174
Is Grézaucourt direct from here?

684
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,577
It's not accessible.

685
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,116
But you can get off at Vézillé.

686
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,709
There are trucks from there.

687
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,723
At 6:54, change at Moncornet.

688
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,156
And lodging?

689
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,196
Tonight?

690
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,725
No hotels?

691
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,859
A villager can put you up.

692
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,339
My other son's room is bigger but colder.

693
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:39,932
This is fine.

694
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,944
Dinner's at seven.

695
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,038
Vegetable soup and parmentier.

696
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,344
I eat little.

697
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,685
I can bring a pitcher of hot water.

698
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,882
I'll come down.

699
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:12,667
Drink it hot.
I added cinnamon.

700
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,471
Put it there.

701
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,443
You're exaggerating to ask
for a day off already.

702
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,485
It's a break.

703
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,451
The major agreed to take me along.

704
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,819
But the boss will complain.

705
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,516
He always does.

706
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,286
Still, you exaggerate.

707
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:34,156
How did you get on before?

708
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,393
You worry me.

709
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:42,370
You're not going to be like those poor women who
pass daily.

710
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:46,307
I take their photos out of charity.

711
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:52,110
But I feel like saying the dead are dead,
even if you can't find them.

712
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:59,622
It's not their photos that will bring them back.

713
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,761
That's a nice thing to say.

714
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:09,594
I'd say the same to my daughter.

715
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:15,127
But I'm going anyway.

716
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,610
Another brandy?

717
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:27,582
Sleep well.

718
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:37,055
I thought of a job for you.

719
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:43,489
Writing letters to veterans associations
and town halls.

720
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,192
That's fine.

721
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:01,149
I've got my 812 for June 17!

722
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,345
The Senegalese make 812.

723
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,913
They weren't counted.

724
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,556
Vézillé-Prin: Two minute stop.

725
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,965
Vézillé.

726
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,864
One franc, eighteen, madam.

727
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:57,104
Hurry, I've got the tickets to collect.

728
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:12,353
<i>VÉZILLÉ - PRIN TEMPORARY STATION</i>
Do you have the pass?

729
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,889
In my pocket.

730
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,532
Passengers for Grézaucourt.

731
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:37,077
The truck won't leave for 40 minutes.

732
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:42,345
There are hot drinks offered by
the 113th in the tent.

733
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,519
Prepare your passes.

734
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,489
Do you have one?

735
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,457
In my bag.

736
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,197
What's happening?

737
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,200
Soldier stepped on a mine, Lt.

738
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,826
What do we do?

739
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,428
Turn right.
We sent the darkies.

740
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,114
Car cranks are dangerous.

741
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:55,055
My fiancé broke his hand on one.

742
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:59,595
I took him to the hospital in Decize.

743
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,129
He was white as a sheet.

744
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,598
I'll continue on foot from here.

745
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,430
You coming, Artist?

746
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:11,564
Stay put.
The path is rocky.

747
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:31,958
They've had it up to their eyeballs with Rodin!

748
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,831
He was great with clay, okay.

749
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,458
With his thumbs, fine.

750
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:45,064
But on stone I'm his equal.

751
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,767
And now that he's dead...

752
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,812
I'm better than him.

753
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,846
It'll be fine here.
In the open.

754
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,523
Sculpture going well for you?

755
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:12,068
The Golden Age, my friend.

756
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,263
Nothing like it since the Greeks.

757
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,567
Since the cathedrals.

758
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:21,075
Even shitty artists have their hands full.

759
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,043
A monument per village.

760
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:27,082
300 sculptors for 35,000 towns.

761
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:33,513
Everybody wants his doughboy, his widow,
his pyramid, his marble.

762
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:38,617
Bas-reliefs, inscriptions... it's a factory.

763
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:42,255
Better than the Renaissance -
it's the resurrection.

764
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,629
Thanks to our dead.

765
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,999
Thanks to them.

766
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,725
I can't let you through.

767
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:14,388
I'll pick you up this evening.

768
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,265
What do I do?

769
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,531
I'm speaking to you, sir.

770
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,731
Later, Madam.

771
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,176
Please group your baggage together.

772
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,143
Those with passes...

773
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,478
examination up there on the table.

774
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:04,246
Not all spring chicks.

775
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:36,161
Ah, the Major and his sculptor.

776
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,317
This truck will take you.

777
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,820
I won't leave.

778
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,287
Be reasonable.

779
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,949
I won't be treated like this.

780
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:01,326
I demand permission - I didn't make this trip... Don't
touch me!

781
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,328
What's going on?

782
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,031
No pass, sir.

783
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,268
Back to the station.

784
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,071
Have a paper?

785
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:27,281
Well... it needs a stamp...

786
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,249
Yes, sir...
since it's you...

787
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,599
Get moving, greenhorns!

788
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,176
Good work...

789
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,507
Nearly 40 bodies identified.

790
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,136
You have the list?

791
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:56,275
- Inform the families here.
- Yes. They'll come to the office.

792
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,684
Check family and Christian names.

793
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:02,155
We can't play around with figures.

794
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:05,659
A question of ethics.
Ethics!

795
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:10,495
Coutrell family to the identification bureau, please.

796
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,089
You here, too?

797
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:38,456
Lift her wings.

798
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,256
She looks like a brooding hen.

799
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:43,958
It's Victory!
Make her palpable, sensual!

800
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,932
Hey, miss...

801
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:51,099
Somebody threw my cap off.

802
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:57,869
Can you put it back on?

803
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:18,163
My name is Eugene Dilatoire -
investigations and research.

804
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:22,728
Specialist in military disappearances...

805
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,933
Get lost!
They're bandits...

806
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:27,904
I know all about it.

807
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,172
It cost me 20 francs...
for peanuts.

808
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,621
Cur soldiers are buried here.

809
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,220
Along the road are the Huns.

810
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,731
Huns...

811
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,995
Or Arabs.
And two Belgians.

812
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,569
Arabs...

813
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:55,899
Only Arabs towards the end!

814
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,371
Except the officers.

815
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,969
I'm looking for a French soldier.

816
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,309
Really French.
And anonymous.

817
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,905
The one at the well.

818
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,109
A grenade went off in his hand.

819
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,749
Name was Mounier.
From Le Mans.

820
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,658
Anonymous, Madam.

821
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,125
Anonymous.
No name.

822
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,789
No identity.
An unknown soldier.

823
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:22,956
Unknown?

824
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,556
We knew them all a little.

825
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:29,400
Our records indicate
three unidentified bodies here.

826
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,803
Yes, an American...

827
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,609
An American...
I don't care...

828
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:43,174
They were two - burned in their plane.

829
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,690
You haven't an idea... where?

830
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,852
It was during the harvest.

831
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:53,986
I see...

832
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,894
He's a prisoner?

833
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,595
Not any more.

834
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,638
He's happy here...

835
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,038
Who are they?

836
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:08,610
Orientals.

837
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,440
Very nice.

838
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,447
Especially the little one...

839
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,378
It's the nephew's.

840
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,384
Sure it's my boy's goblet.

841
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:22,584
He wrote me "Since it's calm, I've engraved a daisy
on the bottom of my mug."

842
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,785
- Regiment?
- 2nd Infantry.

843
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:25,826
2nd infantry.

844
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,794
Got a few of those inside...

845
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:31,263
Lebégue, Lebégue...

846
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,232
no Lebégue...

847
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,638
I have a no-name.

848
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,939
A no-name, that could be him.

849
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:50,043
You see, his fiancée, well, the girl he dated at
home, her name was Daisy.

850
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:53,020
Probably that's why he drew a daisy!

851
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:56,614
I'll buy that.

852
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,626
Red label.
You're in luck.

853
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:02,256
That means it was found on the remains.

854
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,332
Remains?

855
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,365
A body.

856
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,230
Or what's left.

857
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,864
You're going to show us?

858
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,599
I have to - identification!

859
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,642
Don't worry.
They were preserved in clay.

860
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,574
Fresh as bottles in a wine-cellar!

861
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:22,277
But we keep 'em inside 'cause out in the air, the
sun... Lefébvre!

862
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,655
No salute?

863
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:32,125
Take these folks to visit n<i>o</i>14.

864
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,598
- But, the girl...
- No, not the girl!

865
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:12,463
I told him, I told the nephew, don'tjoin up.

866
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,058
They don't ask your opinion.

867
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,797
I know.

868
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:21,371
I served 16 months, and then - ciao!

869
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,176
- Ciao?
- Yep. Ciao!

870
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,211
Surprised, eh?

871
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,628
What's that?

872
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,000
- Tunnel's not too solid.
- Really?

873
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:52,268
- Maybe we'd better not...
- No, it's over there that...

874
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,707
Let's hurry then.

875
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:56,609
N<i>o</i> 14.

876
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:06,978
My God!

877
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,354
How thin he is!

878
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,120
- It's him?
- Yes.

879
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:15,463
God, the beard changes him!

880
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,294
Hair and nails keep growing.

881
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,459
Yep, so they say.

882
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,299
Why isn't he in his uniform?

883
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,396
Ambulance car...

884
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,340
He must've been resting.

885
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:33,042
- I'm gonna faint...
- Come on, kid.

886
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,911
Demarchy!

887
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,045
No Demarchy?

888
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,245
Should we change the water?

889
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:46,551
Charles, my fiancé, was a bit like that corporal.

890
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:48,323
Impressive.

891
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,423
It's his bearing - so straight.

892
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,128
I was a pharmacist.

893
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,831
I mean, I worked in my parent's shop.

894
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,873
Let's empty that.

895
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,745
We'll fill it at the spring.

896
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,884
A Mark...

897
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,614
There were Germans aboard?

898
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:14,246
Not for certain.

899
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:19,225
- Be our guests?
- What's the menu?

900
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,229
Either mutton & beans or beans & mutton.

901
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:23,628
You never eat?

902
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,167
I'll find an apple or something.

903
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,634
Gotta eat hot!

904
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:29,864
No one's watching you, you know.

905
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:32,704
Wait, let me!

906
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,572
Help the lady.
I'm used to it.

907
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,447
Hey, what's going on?

908
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,852
He's good-hearted,
it upset him to show us the kid.

909
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,519
Grub's up!

910
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,722
Beans as usual!

911
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,338
You didn't do Africa, Trévise?

912
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:17,352
Here and there, you see herds grazing in the new
grass, among the baboons.

913
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,478
Nothing really beautiful.

914
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,181
And suddenly...

915
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,053
an antelope...

916
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,558
Iost...

917
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,924
majestic!

918
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,862
All antelopes are beautiful.

919
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:35,328
You know why?

920
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,702
Because they're scared.

921
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,867
Their eyes are black and they're scared.

922
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:45,744
They're right to be; the world is full ofjaws!

923
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:52,118
- Transport of the body is free.
- Nothing to pay?

924
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,210
Nothing.

925
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:56,120
July 31st Law of Finance.

926
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,591
And what must be done?

927
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,559
I can take care of everything.

928
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:05,157
For a modest sum, I open a file
and handle all formalities...

929
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:06,968
What do you think?

930
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,037
We'll bring him home ourselves!

931
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,876
Is it better than at Valentine's?

932
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,501
We'll soon see.

933
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,479
How's it going inside there?

934
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,644
There's a lot trickling down, but it's OK.

935
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,278
Water?
Infiltrations?

936
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,482
Earth too.
Sometimes a lot.

937
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,059
I'll check it out.

938
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,961
She won't come to my studio at Warin.

939
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,658
I didn't say that!

940
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:42,260
I won't go to any studio to pose for you!

941
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:43,497
That's what I said.

942
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,871
Such beautiful shoulders...

943
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:53,241
In my desk, right-hand drawer,
bring me my cup, plate, silverware.

944
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:57,911
Think of all the boys who gave
a piece of flesh to the Republic

945
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,457
and you won't lend your young chest
forjust a two-hour session?

946
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,822
Stop such talk!

947
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,916
I'll pay you 100 sous.

948
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,427
- Keep it!
- Per tit!

949
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:14,131
Chow's nearly all gone.

950
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,899
Give me a piece that's lean.

951
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,882
For the lady, over there.

952
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,695
From the Major.

953
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,631
A soldier is like a sack.

954
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:51,229
When it's full, it stays up.

955
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,934
When it's empty, it collapses.

956
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,343
An empty sack flops!

957
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,243
A soldier with an empty stomach flops!

958
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:04,478
Thus the expression "Nothing in his guts".

959
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,790
You can tell it's men's stew.

960
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,885
I always put garlic and thyme in the mutton.

961
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:15,020
Not you?

962
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,060
Major!

963
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,097
Please come to the tunnel...

964
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:56,000
Monsieur Fagot!

965
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,300
Come with me, please!

966
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:08,977
<i>O Woman, when upon your shoulders</i>
<i>Your hair loosely falls,</i>

967
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:16,184
<i>Let me play the comb</i>'<i>s role,</i>
<i>and with</i> My <i>fingertips unravel</i>

968
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:21,286
<i>The intricacies of silk</i>.

969
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,955
Look at that!

970
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,089
It's the Major's.

971
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,000
He has the same cup at the canteen,
engraved with "D".

972
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,232
His family is mostly wealthy doctors.

973
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,235
Two of his nephews were killed.

974
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:36,971
One in a submarine,
the other at Chemin des Dames.

975
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:38,740
His wife's nephews.

976
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,851
There's a name here.

977
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:48,248
..."Caussade".

978
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,118
Caussade?

979
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:01,329
<i>Women, women,</i>

980
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:05,464
<i>How to suppress</i>

981
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:10,841
<i>All that our love desires</i>...

982
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,814
This convoy carried everything -

983
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:19,718
troops, ambulance cars, artillery wagons,
detonators, fuses...

984
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,483
even gas!

985
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:24,718
It seems the convoy started from Vézillé.

986
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,590
The Yanks were on the attack.

987
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:31,428
They hitched their wagons
to an artillery convoy.

988
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:34,094
We added our ambulance cars -
and off it went!

989
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:38,367
Unfortunately, the Jerries
had mined the tunnel.

990
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,840
Why aren't the bodies in coffins?

991
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,410
It was lunchtime.

992
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,479
Here's where it gets worse.

993
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,639
But I told you to buttress it.

994
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:47,977
The wood, Major.

995
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,072
The wood?

996
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,621
It was sold to a contractor who paid double.

997
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:54,211
Christ!

998
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,553
Smells of ether, no?

999
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:00,060
An ambulance car was damaged and containers
broke.

1000
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:02,858
I want that wood-merchant's name...

1001
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:06,765
If the roofs resisted, we should be able to assess
the damage...

1002
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:35,689
- Give the alarm!
- Two men with me!

1003
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,476
No one into the tunnel!

1004
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,936
Were you alone?
The railroad guy...

1005
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,675
Help the Major!

1006
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,373
Bring a stretcher!

1007
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:28,313
Easy now...

1008
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:31,510
Easy does it, careful...

1009
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,111
Put him on the stretcher.

1010
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:40,556
Two men with gas masks,
go fetch the lunatic in there!

1011
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,528
Put him on the stretcher!

1012
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,656
Not you, not now!

1013
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,826
I was a stretcher-bearer, Sir.

1014
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,300
All right.

1015
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:54,343
First-aid kit, iodine, lint, and all the rest.

1016
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:59,580
Breathe in, softly, breathe deeply...

1017
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,656
Can't see a thing!

1018
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,785
What a mess!

1019
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:22,268
The North is that way?

1020
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,063
What?

1021
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,303
North.

1022
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:35,676
No, no, North.

1023
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,717
I don't understand a thing...

1024
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,482
Tell me...

1025
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:42,784
we, um, we...

1026
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,723
South, south-west!

1027
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:49,787
Whenever there's a fog, it's my turn.

1028
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:56,634
Send a group to recover the bodies.

1029
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,606
And have them wear their gas masks!

1030
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,834
And the civilians?

1031
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:03,207
Let them go home!

1032
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:05,177
Pains in the asses!

1033
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,180
We shut the site, and that's that!

1034
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:15,880
Or rather, tell them we'll consolidate tonight and
see about the rest tomorrow.

1035
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,491
Ladies and gentlemen.

1036
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:24,593
Your attention.

1037
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:30,395
An accident has forced us to
temporarily shut the site.

1038
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:34,408
The Engineers Corps will advise us tomorrow...

1039
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,943
But tomorrow we work!

1040
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,068
And my boy!

1041
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,113
We're not going to leave him in this hole?

1042
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:42,183
Pierre Lebégue, n<i>o</i> 14.

1043
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:47,620
Now I remember - I recognize his watch.

1044
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:48,690
You don't know...

1045
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,088
Yes, I do!

1046
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:54,652
Léon Couvert, born July 8, 1896
in Heudreville.

1047
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,560
Write it down...

1048
01:13:56,665 --> 01:14:00,533
Those who wish to depart can take the train.

1049
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:07,838
Otherwise, you'll find a temporary hotel
two miles up the rail-line, at the Warin factory.

1050
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,635
How'll I get to work?

1051
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,339
I'm sorry - but you understand!

1052
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,850
- What'll I do?
- I'll take you if I find a bike.

1053
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:19,147
Are there private rooms at the hotel?

1054
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,982
At these rates, wine is extra.

1055
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,422
What's made here?

1056
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:26,858
Ironwork, machine tools.

1057
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,453
Right!
Warin's an old family from here.

1058
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:33,467
Before the war, part was sold to
Shukert & De Courtil.

1059
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:34,896
You didn't know?

1060
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:39,030
The De Courtils never talk shop with the women.

1061
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,842
Hardly <i>grand luxe,</i> eh?

1062
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,846
We had the best hotel for ten miles around.

1063
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,941
It'll be rebuilt, but meanwhile, we make do.

1064
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,644
The lavatories are brand new.

1065
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:55,553
It's big - but women and men
will have to share.

1066
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,090
The lady's quarters.

1067
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,298
That's the generator that...

1068
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:13,374
Everything you need is in the night-table.

1069
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,773
I'll see to the stoves.

1070
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,210
It's far from comfortable, but...

1071
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,581
for a few hours...

1072
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,154
I know. Thank you.

1073
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:34,028
I have to telephone, but afterwards,
care to join a man who detests dining alone?

1074
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,829
I understand...

1075
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,560
you're tired...

1076
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,384
May I help.

1077
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,987
You're sweet. I'll manage.

1078
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,356
You have two beds?

1079
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:14,564
The parish priest will hold mass at 9 a.m.

1080
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:15,830
Thank you.

1081
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:17,872
Where is the telephone?

1082
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:18,940
The what?

1083
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,474
Never mind.

1084
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:24,508
Charpin, yes, Major Charpin, Engineers Corps.

1085
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,243
I'll wait for the call, yes.

1086
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:36,118
- I'll pay for the wine
- Please, let us.

1087
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:37,350
Next time then.

1088
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,051
I'm the one who sings.

1089
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:40,423
But <i>we</i> play.

1090
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,190
And <i>I</i> sing.

1091
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,231
I'm two notes over.

1092
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,695
May I telephone?

1093
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,048
Then go find him.

1094
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,622
Your five minutes were up ten minutes ago.

1095
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:11,784
I didn't ask for Marshal Foch,
only a simple Engineers officer!

1096
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,453
So find him!

1097
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:16,395
May I try?

1098
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:17,795
It'll be short.

1099
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,298
You see... I'm waiting...

1100
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,835
Excuse me, please go ahead.

1101
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,670
Forty-seven in Mescil.

1102
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,507
Very well.

1103
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:34,877
Article 106.

1104
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:41,183
July 31 Finance Law: The bodies
will be transferred as of December 1, 1920...

1105
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:42,313
in just a month.

1106
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,686
And until then?

1107
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,158
I handle everything.

1108
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:51,198
As soon as I've opened a file,
I handle everything.

1109
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,776
Mr. Mercadot's studio, please?

1110
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,970
You refused to set foot in there.

1111
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,843
He's going to work on the sculpture.

1112
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,711
That way, to your right.

1113
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,284
I'm at the Warin factory...

1114
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,185
That's right.

1115
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,757
By sheer coincidence...

1116
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,394
I don't know yet.

1117
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,793
As soon as possible...

1118
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:28,829
Believe me, Pony,
this situation is difficult for me too!

1119
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:33,203
I want an end to this uncertainty,
this ambiguity...

1120
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,906
Pony, you know how I feel...

1121
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,673
Priority!

1122
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:41,976
I'm awaiting a call.

1123
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,915
I have priority on the line.

1124
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,782
You're mad!

1125
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,117
Completely mad!

1126
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,657
Military requisition, Madam!

1127
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,035
Excuse me?

1128
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,605
I don't know what woman you mean.

1129
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,372
Put him on!

1130
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:17,179
Charpin?
It's none too soon.

1131
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:22,416
Listen here. I need...
heavy material for tomorrow morning,

1132
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,014
or maybe for tonight.

1133
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,029
Ask the Americans, they've got men in there!

1134
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:33,662
Stop it...

1135
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:37,035
Let's just talk...

1136
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:39,767
I'm talking to you.

1137
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,012
I don't want to...

1138
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:46,910
I'm not free, I told you.

1139
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,316
Then why kiss me?

1140
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,944
It was <i>you</i> who...
No, stop...

1141
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:56,216
I swear I'll scream!

1142
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:57,814
You're hurting me!

1143
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:00,453
Get out!

1144
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,928
Go find your stiff.

1145
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,191
You should be ashamed!

1146
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,393
No!

1147
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:10,164
I saw thousands like him,
thousands and thousands!

1148
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:13,400
They can go to hell, because <i>I</i>'<i>m here!</i>

1149
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,165
May I come in?

1150
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:43,366
Please, may I come in?

1151
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,777
What's the matter?

1152
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:01,183
Should we share this room?

1153
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,084
I was going to ask you.

1154
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,758
When the moon is full,
autumn nights are like summer nights.

1155
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,458
Sleepless...

1156
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:44,465
Have a swig.

1157
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:49,599
It's the mating season.

1158
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,301
Great post-war copulation.

1159
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,434
The stags are in rut.

1160
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,213
The little soldier too.

1161
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:03,214
Thought he was alone with Alice.

1162
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,047
Tried, but...

1163
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,189
The feeling dampens the fire!

1164
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:14,854
The idiot asked her permission.

1165
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:22,299
And your affairs, Major?

1166
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:24,198
My affairs?

1167
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,903
Now, now, my friend!

1168
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:30,539
My job's sniffing things out.

1169
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:32,410
I have good eyes.

1170
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:34,577
Work tools!

1171
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:40,314
Eyes that watch other eyes,
glances that meet on a tightrope!

1172
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,851
That's how Love travels, pal.

1173
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:49,187
Those with eyes can see it.

1174
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:52,292
Without a balancing pole...

1175
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:59,233
Between art and art-Iovers, dogs and masters,
men and women...

1176
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,636
between you and her.

1177
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:06,838
And even the other way around.

1178
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:11,579
At my age...
it's not possible.

1179
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,615
In mere hours.

1180
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,957
"When the full moon looms..."

1181
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,690
"the earth's in a swoon."

1182
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,393
I'm an ass.

1183
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,728
The telephone is an invention...

1184
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:29,262
I couldn't bear her talking.

1185
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,873
"Yes, Pony, of course, Pony."

1186
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,345
I thought I'd die.

1187
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,780
You like that kind of woman.

1188
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:44,518
Feelings <i>afterwards</i>.

1189
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,452
The act first, then the analysis.

1190
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:49,457
The act!

1191
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:50,591
Bang!

1192
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:54,588
You're just a footslogger.

1193
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:57,663
When you catch your breath...

1194
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:01,364
maybe resort to manners...

1195
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,537
<i>maybe!</i>

1196
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:07,270
You're a hopeless case.
Hopeless.

1197
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:21,654
I don't have a single one of his letters.

1198
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:26,427
My parents burned some;
the rest were stolen.

1199
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:29,063
Can you imagine?
Stolen!

1200
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,092
Perhaps a rival.

1201
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,939
I recopied lines I could remember,
the prettiest... real poems.

1202
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,709
Did yours write you?

1203
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,838
At the beginning.

1204
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:51,651
Will you go to Mass?

1205
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:53,752
Why?

1206
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,554
Just because.

1207
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,027
I don't think so, no.

1208
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,124
You're against it?

1209
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,530
You're against God?

1210
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:11,897
I should be.

1211
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:15,466
All humans should be.

1212
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:17,935
You're right.

1213
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:19,638
Especially women.

1214
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:21,845
Only we don't dare.

1215
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,502
Try to understand, by God.

1216
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:49,065
Try to understand!

1217
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:52,772
What I'm touching there...

1218
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:55,111
it's not the dead man, it's wood.

1219
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:59,312
It's not bones, it's the coffin.

1220
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,911
The two of us can't lift this alone.

1221
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:08,690
Your religion forbids you to touch the dead, CK, but
this is wood - like your shovel handles!

1222
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:11,026
Wood touch dead man is dead man.

1223
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,895
Shit!

1224
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:15,698
Shit!

1225
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:19,433
I've had it.

1226
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:24,638
It might even be the right one, for all I know.

1227
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,681
We need a strong rope.

1228
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:29,306
A rope.

1229
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:32,443
I dunno.

1230
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:33,816
Will a rope do?

1231
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:38,991
I'll go see.

1232
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:44,427
You pull rope, you eat rice.

1233
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,500
You eat rice.

1234
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:33,069
Could you please make less noise?

1235
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:37,077
The Lord forbids work on Sunday.

1236
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,117
You're working.

1237
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:40,782
It's my day!

1238
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:43,482
Us, it's every day.

1239
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:52,994
Today let us thank the Lord for the restoration of
diplomatic relations between our country,

1240
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:58,232
elder daughter of the Church, -
errant daughter!

1241
01:27:58,339 --> 01:27:59,533
- And the Vatican.

1242
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,085
Cabbage.
And veal kernel?

1243
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:13,244
I got what I could.

1244
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:14,753
Anyway, it's veal.

1245
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:16,824
Where'd she come from?

1246
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:18,221
She was at Mass.

1247
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:20,954
There was boar for sale.
But I didn't dare.

1248
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:22,495
Depends on the price.

1249
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:25,361
You're plucky to walk so far.

1250
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,933
I like to walk.

1251
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:28,525
Have you made up my bill?

1252
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,625
No indeed.

1253
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:31,500
It's already paid.

1254
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:33,665
The Major.
That's what he said.

1255
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,709
Impossible!
Where is he?

1256
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,368
My dear, you don't know?

1257
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:38,740
At two a.m.,

1258
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:41,314
all hell broke loose in the tunnel.

1259
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:50,587
It's forbidden to go past.

1260
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:48,008
We've done all we could.

1261
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:55,022
I'll send my compliments to your superiors
requesting special leave.

1262
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,351
Thank you.

1263
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:59,358
Assemble your men.

1264
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,121
Return to quarters.

1265
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,906
We did all we could.

1266
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:23,916
Your night must have been...

1267
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:24,882
dreadful.

1268
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,150
Pretty dreadful, yes.

1269
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:33,493
For all sorts of reasons.

1270
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:38,327
It'll take weeks to clear - clear what?

1271
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:41,231
Mud and ashes...

1272
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:44,395
You're hurt?

1273
01:30:56,684 --> 01:30:58,709
Thank you.

1274
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,616
It's as if the war was still on.

1275
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:08,827
You saw the war from afar.

1276
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:12,396
War is worse...

1277
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:18,133
so much worse.

1278
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:23,233
Acres and acres covered
with rotting cadavers, no trees,

1279
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:26,711
fly-covered heads sticking out of water-holes...

1280
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:28,111
It stinks!

1281
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:29,774
- Swarming with rats.
- Shut up!

1282
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:32,250
We do nothing but shut up!

1283
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:34,981
Who'd listen to us anyway?

1284
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:36,716
Who'd print it?

1285
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:40,225
The newspapers want only lies
and official idiocy.

1286
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:45,595
"The war's devastating allure only
<i>appears to be destructive</i>."

1287
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,429
I read that!

1288
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,765
Signed: General Cherfils.

1289
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:54,103
1,500,000 deaths only <i>appear to be dead!</i>

1290
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,698
Bastards!

1291
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:59,004
Bastards!

1292
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,309
Who is Pony?

1293
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,084
I said, who is Pony?

1294
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:11,420
- It must be your fatigue.
- No reply?

1295
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:15,223
I'm the one with the questions.
That's why I came.

1296
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:17,221
By what right...?

1297
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:19,959
Your behavior last night...

1298
01:32:20,067 --> 01:32:21,659
of a ruffian!

1299
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:24,795
No, no, that term is old-fashioned.

1300
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:28,467
- Last night I eavesdropped...
- Shame on you!

1301
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:30,373
Your behavior is odious!

1302
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,673
I'm ashamed, but I heard you...

1303
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:35,340
So who is he?

1304
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:36,916
My father-in-law.

1305
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:38,610
I don't believe you.

1306
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:42,246
He's always been called that in the family.

1307
01:32:42,356 --> 01:32:44,824
And like it or not, I'm part of that family.

1308
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,359
The Senator?

1309
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,155
"Pony"?

1310
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:52,657
Like a little pony?

1311
01:32:55,636 --> 01:32:58,366
Major, two men are missing.

1312
01:32:58,472 --> 01:33:01,100
- Are you sure?
- I checked...

1313
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:02,470
Wait here.
I'll go.

1314
01:33:17,224 --> 01:33:18,213
Come on!

1315
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:21,489
He inhaled a ton of gas.

1316
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,257
Let's go...

1317
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:25,161
walk...

1318
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:38,402
Glass capsules inside the shells shatter
and release the gas.

1319
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:44,940
Until the last one releases its poison,
we'll have this kind of...

1320
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:49,285
I must be jealous!

1321
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:52,189
Pardon?

1322
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:54,454
You asked "By what right?"

1323
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:56,655
It's obvious.

1324
01:33:56,764 --> 01:33:58,322
I must be jealous.

1325
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,132
Your husband wasn't?

1326
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:04,033
My husband?

1327
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:07,470
It's so long ago.

1328
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:11,739
I'm linked to him only by this pursuit...

1329
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:18,115
I thought I found his signet-ring.

1330
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:21,154
- Was it his?
- No.

1331
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:22,415
Anyway, rings...

1332
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:24,115
We've found thousands...

1333
01:34:24,225 --> 01:34:26,318
His was special.

1334
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:30,761
It was sawed in two after an accident
and badly repaired.

1335
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:35,930
He broke his hand cranking up a car.

1336
01:34:36,037 --> 01:34:38,164
I know, you already told me.

1337
01:34:38,272 --> 01:34:40,069
- Me?
- Yesterday.

1338
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:40,902
Really?

1339
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:44,535
But I'd completely forgotten about it until now!

1340
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:49,142
At the hospital in Decize!

1341
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:50,774
That's right!

1342
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:53,149
The factory had withdrawn nearby.

1343
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:55,154
I told you all that?

1344
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:57,622
I'm losing my mind...

1345
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:06,297
These bottles weren't here.

1346
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,961
Yes, they were.

1347
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:14,405
The families left them behind.

1348
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:15,702
Left them?

1349
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:17,801
Yes.

1350
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:19,402
Like bottles in the sea.

1351
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:21,105
Each has a few words.

1352
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:23,775
"If you find Col. E.
Blanchot of the 112th..."

1353
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:27,047
"...notify
his family in Greenvale Wood..."

1354
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:29,850
I use "Greenvale" because its colorful...

1355
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:36,328
About your husband's accident...
Were you there?

1356
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:38,921
No.
He came to Paris on weekends.

1357
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:42,434
Otherwise he ran the factory.
Why?

1358
01:35:42,536 --> 01:35:43,901
Oh, never mind.

1359
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:47,804
Sorry, my head's not clear either.

1360
01:35:52,947 --> 01:35:54,915
De Courtil's pantograph.

1361
01:35:56,851 --> 01:35:58,819
And the fiancé?

1362
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,784
Alice's?

1363
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:02,685
Want both?

1364
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:10,191
Could be my imagination...

1365
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:13,289
two descriptions by two women...

1366
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:18,235
and the same details about a crank
and a broken hand at Decize.

1367
01:36:18,339 --> 01:36:20,330
Yes, I heard Alice.

1368
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,932
But which other woman?
Mme de Courtil?

1369
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:25,307
- Why the same man?
- Why not.

1370
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,243
Was his name François?

1371
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:29,611
Charles.

1372
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:31,981
Charles Férou.

1373
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:34,281
There's no connection.

1374
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:35,821
The initials!

1375
01:36:35,923 --> 01:36:36,981
F.C.

1376
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:38,422
C.F.

1377
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:40,118
The same!

1378
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:41,251
That proves nothing.

1379
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:43,660
But both women are here.

1380
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:46,995
That's no coincidence, but a consequence.

1381
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:50,832
They came the same way... for the same man!

1382
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:53,236
Like two rivers meeting.

1383
01:36:55,943 --> 01:36:58,104
Keep this to yourself.

1384
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:03,649
These days I'm stumbling against everything.

1385
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:12,186
I have to leave my car for the gas victim.

1386
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:14,056
We can wait for it.

1387
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:18,962
Our last year together was empty.

1388
01:37:19,066 --> 01:37:23,867
He scorned his advantages and social position.

1389
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:26,906
The war was an escape from his privileges.

1390
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:29,202
I couldn't hold him back.

1391
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:33,010
Maybe I didn't want to.

1392
01:37:33,113 --> 01:37:35,240
I'm beginning to see...

1393
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,647
The hospitals!

1394
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:39,343
The wild procedures!

1395
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:40,750
The zeal!

1396
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,186
Excessive?

1397
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:45,224
In fact, yes.

1398
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:51,731
Had I really loved him, I'd have fought tooth and
nail to stop him.

1399
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:55,598
I'd have laid down before his train.

1400
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,830
But I didn't.

1401
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:00,668
Because I hoped...

1402
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:04,473
he'd return different.

1403
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:06,705
Closer...

1404
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,248
I'm cold.

1405
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:17,348
I can do this in a bigger model if you want.

1406
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:19,050
The price?

1407
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:22,492
Check the catalogue there.

1408
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:25,724
We want shells in it too.

1409
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:26,800
Four shells.

1410
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:32,066
With marble and name plates.

1411
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:37,075
In Brizelle, there's an obelisque
with 36 names...

1412
01:38:37,177 --> 01:38:38,701
nine on each side.

1413
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:45,615
But they forgot the Lambert boy and had to make a
separate plate.

1414
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:50,213
37 dead for 906 inhabitants.

1415
01:38:50,324 --> 01:38:51,518
Too much, almost?

1416
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,354
A fair average.

1417
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,758
10% of those called up.

1418
01:38:55,863 --> 01:38:57,091
How many for you?

1419
01:38:57,197 --> 01:38:59,062
That's precisely...

1420
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:01,726
why we want to see this officer.

1421
01:39:01,835 --> 01:39:03,996
He seems to have contacts.

1422
01:39:04,104 --> 01:39:06,834
Notably the Prefect Blancart.

1423
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:08,408
Tell me.

1424
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:09,840
I have contacts too.

1425
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,809
It's like this...

1426
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:16,039
our village, Lacagne, had 17 called up.

1427
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:21,019
As luck would have it, not one casualty.

1428
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:23,681
Some luck!

1429
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:26,282
Imagine the insinuations!

1430
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,793
And we get no priorities.

1431
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:33,196
Not a centime from the county or ministry.

1432
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:36,394
What's the prefect to do with this?

1433
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:45,340
A farm in the next township had two dead...
one son and a farmhand.

1434
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:51,681
If we could change the district boundaries we
could claim the dead.

1435
01:39:51,785 --> 01:39:54,652
They had more than 30 anyway.

1436
01:39:54,755 --> 01:39:56,086
Wouldn't hurt them!

1437
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:57,851
More than 30!

1438
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:04,629
Nobody asked for two bodies.

1439
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:06,393
It was safer.

1440
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:10,664
- I wasn't sure...
- Sure about what?

1441
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:15,003
One of them may have been a Yank.

1442
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:17,509
He was missing an ear.

1443
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:20,341
Meaning what?

1444
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:22,711
You know Indians.

1445
01:40:25,652 --> 01:40:28,382
I was waiting for your return.

1446
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:30,821
Some clients for you.

1447
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:32,255
This isn't the place.

1448
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:35,328
They just need a minute.

1449
01:40:36,263 --> 01:40:41,826
It's like this... Our village had 17 called...

1450
01:40:41,935 --> 01:40:44,870
But no dead.

1451
01:40:44,972 --> 01:40:46,234
Not a one.

1452
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:54,674
Charles and I bathed twice together in the same
tub...

1453
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:56,943
François would've hated that.

1454
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:20,465
It's so beautiful.

1455
01:41:22,342 --> 01:41:24,105
You take them everywhere?

1456
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:26,111
It's easy with the car.

1457
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:33,842
Stop!
We'll smell like floozies!

1458
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:36,685
The horrid smells everywhere!

1459
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:38,849
The cemeteries, the mass graves...

1460
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:42,352
Worst are the ossuaries!

1461
01:41:46,733 --> 01:41:50,533
You'll find your man.

1462
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:52,264
I don't think so.

1463
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:56,132
He's here.

1464
01:41:56,243 --> 01:41:57,904
In Grézaucourt.

1465
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:00,744
Charles too.
I'm sure.

1466
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:04,376
I found a Swiss knife.

1467
01:42:04,485 --> 01:42:06,578
I threw it away.

1468
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:07,847
But it could have been his.

1469
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:10,253
They all had one.
Mine too.

1470
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:11,346
With a cross?

1471
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:12,584
I think so.

1472
01:42:12,693 --> 01:42:14,718
Hundreds were distributed.

1473
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:16,762
For all they helped...

1474
01:42:18,699 --> 01:42:20,530
Why throw it away?

1475
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:23,595
It's a dead man's knife.

1476
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:25,467
I want him alive.

1477
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:30,066
- You just said...
- I know I often contradict myself.

1478
01:42:30,177 --> 01:42:34,773
But alive, yes!
That would be best.

1479
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:43,785
All these months I feared finding him in some
hospital...

1480
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:45,620
Alive but broken.

1481
01:42:49,796 --> 01:42:52,230
Slowly the thought of him dead became...

1482
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:54,163
a comfort.

1483
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:58,001
I'm not even sad.

1484
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:00,735
I feel soothed.

1485
01:43:01,808 --> 01:43:03,571
How can you say that?

1486
01:43:04,311 --> 01:43:06,404
I say it sincerely.

1487
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,707
Very sincerely.

1488
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:12,915
I was looking for Alice.

1489
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,180
Me?

1490
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:17,648
You broke a flask?

1491
01:43:19,593 --> 01:43:21,925
She'll be right back.

1492
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:33,599
I managed to get the portraits of some bodies in
the train.

1493
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:36,938
Most were burntjust after.

1494
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:38,807
Anyway...

1495
01:43:39,913 --> 01:43:43,974
See if any correspond.

1496
01:43:50,991 --> 01:43:52,959
Charles!

1497
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:56,455
Are you sure?

1498
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:58,190
I <i>knew</i> him.

1499
01:43:58,298 --> 01:43:59,925
1 m 80.
Light eyes.

1500
01:44:00,033 --> 01:44:01,500
Yes.

1501
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:03,092
You saw him often?

1502
01:44:03,203 --> 01:44:04,602
Yes, at first.

1503
01:44:04,705 --> 01:44:06,104
Which region?

1504
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:08,470
You know.
In Nievres.

1505
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:11,066
What did he do?

1506
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:13,544
He worked in armaments, I think.

1507
01:44:13,647 --> 01:44:16,514
Then he enlisted.

1508
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:18,050
In 1917.

1509
01:44:18,151 --> 01:44:19,778
May '17.

1510
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:22,013
Why these questions?

1511
01:44:22,122 --> 01:44:23,350
Verification.

1512
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:25,985
He wore this ring.

1513
01:44:27,661 --> 01:44:29,390
We weren't married yet!

1514
01:44:29,496 --> 01:44:33,262
Yes, my child... he was.

1515
01:44:37,704 --> 01:44:42,004
We'll close this file later in my office.

1516
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:56,514
You dared tell her?

1517
01:44:57,624 --> 01:44:59,148
Why such brutality?

1518
01:44:59,993 --> 01:45:01,119
To help her.

1519
01:45:01,228 --> 01:45:02,752
By torturing her?

1520
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:04,592
By stunning her.

1521
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:11,103
You have to strike once,
so hard it's like a nightmare.

1522
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:16,466
Later you wake up and life seems gentler.

1523
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:22,909
The 7:50 train won't do...

1524
01:45:23,016 --> 01:45:25,678
Full of soldiers on leave.

1525
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:30,420
I'll put you on the morning train.

1526
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:32,583
Are you hungry?

1527
01:45:34,494 --> 01:45:36,155
Ravenous.

1528
01:45:36,396 --> 01:45:40,196
Ragout and beef for the surveyors.

1529
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:46,161
He was a typical wellborn lad.

1530
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:48,036
I was dazzled.

1531
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:50,006
So we danced and I was hooked.

1532
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:53,375
You were really an orchestra violinist?

1533
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:54,777
Not an orchestra. No.

1534
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:58,215
Well, yes.
For charity lepers...

1535
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:00,980
Chinese... orphans...

1536
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,385
The deaf?

1537
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:05,355
Good-Iooking.

1538
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:07,386
He was attractive.

1539
01:46:07,494 --> 01:46:08,893
That annoyed him.

1540
01:46:08,995 --> 01:46:10,963
Life's badly made.

1541
01:46:11,064 --> 01:46:13,294
I would have loved to be attractive.

1542
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:18,435
He was shy.

1543
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:20,938
More natural than the rest of his family.

1544
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:25,671
That's a fact in his favor.

1545
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:28,247
Why all this hate?

1546
01:46:28,348 --> 01:46:31,078
Hate?

1547
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:34,017
The word's much too... weak.

1548
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:38,823
Did you know that Pony...

1549
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:48,493
was go-between in the restitution of a captured
German munitions ship...

1550
01:46:48,869 --> 01:46:51,599
to its owner Krupp!

1551
01:46:51,705 --> 01:46:52,603
In mid-war!!

1552
01:46:52,706 --> 01:46:54,037
Impossible!

1553
01:46:54,141 --> 01:46:56,200
He's a patriot.

1554
01:46:56,309 --> 01:46:58,209
He made huge donations.

1555
01:46:58,311 --> 01:46:59,505
And here?

1556
01:46:59,613 --> 01:47:02,582
See any destruction?

1557
01:47:02,682 --> 01:47:06,516
Oh, the villages, woods,
hospitals, churches, yes!

1558
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:08,679
- But this factory?
- Unusable!

1559
01:47:08,789 --> 01:47:11,781
Not in use, rather.

1560
01:47:11,892 --> 01:47:17,762
When the war started, we beat a strategic retreat...

1561
01:47:17,864 --> 01:47:24,997
thus delivering into German hands the plants of
Brécy and Thionville.

1562
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:25,969
In return for...?

1563
01:47:26,072 --> 01:47:34,411
The Germans spared these and other gems of
industrial architecture when they retreated.

1564
01:47:34,514 --> 01:47:36,448
Reciprocity!

1565
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:37,744
Absurd!

1566
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:41,548
This plant can be active in two months.

1567
01:47:41,655 --> 01:47:50,563
Hence the patriarch's impatience to file
the "missing-in-action" as "killed-in-action."

1568
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:53,960
Legally a missing soldierjams the works.

1569
01:47:54,067 --> 01:47:59,937
A dead hero restores a firm's prestige.

1570
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:04,875
- If that turns out to be true...
- What will you do?

1571
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:08,607
Keep out of my affairs!

1572
01:48:08,715 --> 01:48:11,343
Understand?

1573
01:48:11,451 --> 01:48:12,941
Did I ask about your ring?

1574
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:14,247
It's my mother's.

1575
01:48:14,354 --> 01:48:16,288
You must have a wife.

1576
01:48:16,389 --> 01:48:18,254
You never mention her.

1577
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:24,297
An officer's wife - that's interesting.

1578
01:48:24,397 --> 01:48:26,524
Not any more.

1579
01:48:26,633 --> 01:48:32,128
She's now a notary's wife in Orléans.

1580
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:36,840
Hot pear tarts.

1581
01:48:36,943 --> 01:48:38,604
Last of the season.

1582
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:41,340
From the last living pear tree in Verdun.

1583
01:48:41,448 --> 01:48:42,608
Some champagne?

1584
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:48,845
Between what the Huns drank
and the Yanks took...!

1585
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:20,419
Want to try one of the new dances?

1586
01:49:21,888 --> 01:49:24,152
I'm a throwback...

1587
01:49:24,257 --> 01:49:26,487
a man of 1913.

1588
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:14,663
- Can you play that?
- That? Kid's stuff!

1589
01:50:25,652 --> 01:50:27,210
You think it's immoral?

1590
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:29,845
Champagne and dancing for a widow?

1591
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:37,829
And now the One and Only Cora Mabel of the
Concerts Parisiens.

1592
01:50:39,532 --> 01:50:42,729
I'm not immoral because I'm no longer a widow.

1593
01:50:42,836 --> 01:50:45,134
For sons of the dead.

1594
01:50:50,377 --> 01:50:57,112
<i>After four years in the trench</i>
<i>there met in a singular bout</i>

1595
01:50:57,217 --> 01:51:04,316
<i>Tiny</i> P<i>ierre for the fighting French</i>
<i>and Franz the mighty Kraut</i>.

1596
01:51:04,424 --> 01:51:08,690
<i>Hate was the only compass</i>
<i>Guiding them through the gas,</i>

1597
01:51:08,795 --> 01:51:12,925
<i>From the French mountain ridge</i>
<i>to the tall Belgian grass</i>.

1598
01:51:13,033 --> 01:51:19,666
<i>At dawn</i> P<i>ierrejumps to his feet,</i>
<i>Screaming across to his foe</i>

1599
01:51:19,773 --> 01:51:21,832
"<i>Rendezvous with the crows!</i>

1600
01:51:21,941 --> 01:51:25,502
<i>Today</i>'<i>s your final retreat!</i>"

1601
01:51:26,179 --> 01:51:33,676
<i>Lunging forth bayonette gleaming</i>
P<i>ierre wounds Franz</i>.

1602
01:51:33,787 --> 01:51:40,192
<i>His blood is streaming, :</i>

1603

<i>His butt cracks the head of our</i> P<i>aris pleb</i>.

1604
01:51:45,398 --> 01:51:56,935
<i>Both now stagger, their forces drained</i>
P<i>ale as ghosts, crimson-stained</i>

1605
01:51:57,043 --> 01:52:02,140

<i>It</i>'<i>s the cease-fire</i>

1606
01:52:02,248 --> 01:52:09,711
<i>Then the</i> P<i>russian falls to his knees</i> P<i>leading</i>
"<i>Have pity please</i>

1607
01:52:09,823 --> 01:52:16,592

1608
01:52:16,696 --> 01:52:24,034
<i>And throwing down their arms</i>
<i>The two warriors confide</i>

1609
01:52:24,137 --> 01:52:34,445
<i>Sharing in the blink of an eye</i>
<i>Tears, blood, and laughter!</i>

1610
01:53:23,196 --> 01:53:26,324
I have a locomotive for you.

1611
01:53:44,217 --> 01:53:45,878
Is something wrong?

1612
01:53:45,985 --> 01:53:47,748
I'd like to leave, please.

1613
01:53:55,695 --> 01:53:58,562
I wanted to leave that place.

1614
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:02,601
They're young; they've suffered so much.

1615
01:54:03,303 --> 01:54:07,239
One patriotic song - and off they go to war!

1616
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:10,241
And you too - off to war!

1617
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,069
It's a club.

1618
01:54:13,179 --> 01:54:18,981
It'll be a club for years to come,
the club of those who won the war!

1619
01:54:19,085 --> 01:54:23,545
And the losing side will have its club too!

1620
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:28,059
You know why I think of clubs?

1621
01:54:28,895 --> 01:54:31,659
Because women aren't admitted.

1622
01:54:32,398 --> 01:54:37,392
Nothing scares you more than women,
their wombs, their courage,

1623
01:54:37,503 --> 01:54:39,027
their watching eyes...

1624
01:54:42,675 --> 01:54:43,835
Stop the car!

1625
01:54:44,244 --> 01:54:46,075
Stop the car!

1626
01:54:53,152 --> 01:54:55,052
Do you want me?

1627
01:54:55,822 --> 01:54:57,756
As I really am?

1628
01:54:59,626 --> 01:55:01,355
But, listen!
Really!

1629
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:03,520
You say such things...

1630
01:55:05,531 --> 01:55:07,021
You hardly know me.

1631
01:55:07,133 --> 01:55:10,500
I don't mean a business partnership.

1632
01:55:10,603 --> 01:55:14,232
It's not a question of confidence, but of love.

1633
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:15,739
Of passion.

1634
01:55:18,645 --> 01:55:24,515
In mere seconds we can know of
our desire to be together - forever!

1635
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,351
I'm 15 years older than you.

1636
01:55:28,454 --> 01:55:31,582
Maybe more.
So what?

1637
01:55:33,826 --> 01:55:36,158
A formula exists, Major.

1638
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:37,559
Three words.

1639
01:55:38,398 --> 01:55:42,494
Just say them, and I'm sworn to you, irrevocably,

1640
01:55:43,736 --> 01:55:51,666
I'll follow you everywhere, with my dresses, my
black eyes, my violin, and my

1641
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:53,837
my romantic past.

1642
01:55:59,152 --> 01:56:04,488
Three words and we're together.

1643
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:09,184
I'm listening...

1644
01:56:12,365 --> 01:56:13,559
You!

1645
01:56:13,666 --> 01:56:15,133
You!

1646
01:56:15,234 --> 01:56:17,031
Tomorrow...

1647
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:20,264
we'll see things more clearly...

1648
01:57:10,423 --> 01:57:14,416
Monsieur Maginot,
Minister of War and Pensions!

1649
01:57:19,265 --> 01:57:23,167
These women represent
the widows and mothers.

1650
01:57:23,269 --> 01:57:25,635
And the soldier for the lottery?

1651
01:57:28,241 --> 01:57:29,503
But he fought?

1652
01:57:29,609 --> 01:57:32,009
Class of '19, volunteer,
son of a missing soldier.

1653
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:33,703
He fought in Champagne, Verdun, Alsace.

1654
01:57:33,813 --> 01:57:37,510
A rare survivor.

1655
01:57:37,617 --> 01:57:40,916
Soldier, approach!

1656
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:50,195
Soldier Auguste Thain.

1657
01:57:56,869 --> 01:57:59,133
I've been told of your record.

1658
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:02,934
You're very young.

1659
01:58:03,042 --> 01:58:04,134
Yes, Sir.

1660
01:58:04,243 --> 01:58:05,574
All the same.

1661
01:58:05,678 --> 01:58:08,442
So you leave me in the lurch?

1662
01:58:08,548 --> 01:58:10,106
I was held up.

1663
01:58:10,216 --> 01:58:11,513
Held up by what?

1664
01:58:11,617 --> 01:58:13,050
By everything.

1665
01:58:22,295 --> 01:58:23,626
Soldier!

1666
01:58:27,967 --> 01:58:38,070
Take this bouquet picked on the battlefield of
Verdun amid the graves of our patriotic dead.

1667
01:58:40,079 --> 01:58:42,707
Lay it on one of these eight coffins.

1668
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:51,254
It will be that of the Unknown Soldier which the
nation will accompany to the Arch of Triumph.

1669
01:58:52,024 --> 01:58:54,083
Supreme homage!

1670
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:59,254
The finest France ever paid
to one of its children.

1671
01:58:59,365 --> 01:59:05,201
Yet none too great when <i>he</i> must symbolize

1672
01:59:05,304 --> 01:59:14,838
and immortalize the valiant soldier whose
anonymous sacrifice and superhuman heroism

1673
01:59:14,947 --> 01:59:18,508
safeguarded homeland,

1674
01:59:18,618 --> 01:59:22,554
justice and liberty.

1675
02:00:04,197 --> 02:00:05,960
Not interested?

1676
02:00:07,733 --> 02:00:09,360
It distresses me.

1677
02:00:10,736 --> 02:00:12,795
But it reassures them.

1678
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:18,705
They had 1,500,000 killed,
but now they'll think only of <i>this</i> one.

1679
02:00:18,811 --> 02:00:21,780
This sham is a scandal!

1680
02:00:22,915 --> 02:00:24,849
<i>You're</i> a scandal!

1681
02:00:24,951 --> 02:00:27,078
My final list, General!

1682
02:00:27,753 --> 02:00:29,948
I found 51,000!

1683
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:31,546
In two months!

1684
02:00:31,657 --> 02:00:36,253
Have you finished bugging me with your maniacal
accounts?

1685
02:00:52,645 --> 02:00:54,340
To the dead!

1686
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:25,509
Why did you choose n<i>o</i>6?

1687
02:01:25,611 --> 02:01:27,238
I'm of the 132nd.

1688
02:01:27,346 --> 02:01:30,144
I added up the digits.

1689
02:01:30,249 --> 02:01:32,945
And my regiment's in the 6th corps.

1690
02:01:33,052 --> 02:01:34,747
Hold still!

1691
02:01:42,228 --> 02:01:45,686
Why only 8 coffins for 9 zones?

1692
02:01:45,798 --> 02:01:50,792
One zone wasn't sure about its body's nationality.

1693
02:01:50,903 --> 02:01:53,394
<i>Nobody</i> knows his identity?

1694
02:01:53,506 --> 02:01:54,734
He's my uncle.

1695
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:07,851
I try not to judge...

1696
02:02:07,953 --> 02:02:12,356
That's what these years have taught me.

1697
02:02:13,292 --> 02:02:15,157
Another thing...

1698
02:02:16,228 --> 02:02:17,422
the tea.

1699
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:19,930
You make it much too strong.

1700
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,192
Ah?

1701
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:23,234
But I never...

1702
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,031
Oh yes!

1703
02:02:25,137 --> 02:02:26,195
In the car.

1704
02:02:26,305 --> 02:02:28,739
- Two days ago.
- Two days ago?

1705
02:02:28,841 --> 02:02:31,674
It seems like weeks.

1706
02:02:31,777 --> 02:02:37,875
Putjust a little in a tea-ball,
and don't boil the water.

1707
02:02:37,983 --> 02:02:39,780
It's not really important...

1708
02:02:39,885 --> 02:02:43,821
unless you live with a tea-drinker.

1709
02:02:56,202 --> 02:02:57,567
As a souvenir...

1710
02:03:05,578 --> 02:03:06,875
Wait...

1711
02:03:19,425 --> 02:03:21,552
I'll remember you.

1712
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:22,991
Me, too.

1713
02:03:25,264 --> 02:03:28,427
I'm going home.
My parents are waiting.

1714
02:03:30,236 --> 02:03:32,136
Teacher.
Yhat's fine.

1715
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:34,172
It will be.

1716
02:03:34,273 --> 02:03:37,242
I'll say goodbye to the Valentins.

1717
02:04:15,548 --> 02:04:19,541
"Bédarieux, January 6,1922.

1718
02:04:19,652 --> 02:04:24,646
My dear, dear Iréne,

1719
02:04:35,601 --> 02:04:39,469
Your letter gave me great hope
and thus greatjoy.

1720
02:04:39,572 --> 02:04:40,664
You at last!

1721
02:04:40,773 --> 02:04:45,107
At last a few words revived your voice,
your gaze,

1722
02:04:45,211 --> 02:04:49,079
the poignant silhouette
of my relentless solitude.

1723
02:04:50,883 --> 02:04:57,186
God brings my message to you in New York as
you prepare to leave for Wisconsin.

1724
02:04:57,289 --> 02:05:00,156
It's a tiny spot on my globe.

1725
02:05:00,259 --> 02:05:04,457
How will I find you if you disappear there?

1726
02:05:18,844 --> 02:05:22,507
You say new life, new faces, new start.

1727
02:05:22,615 --> 02:05:24,606
Why all this novelty?

1728
02:05:24,717 --> 02:05:29,381
You who renew things so well especially
the old hearts of old men.

1729
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:34,057
You didn't understand my emotion,
my silence...

1730
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:36,286
Did I myself?

1731
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:42,396
I still tremble with deep tenderness.

1732
02:05:42,501 --> 02:05:46,130
Your fervor and force paralyzed me.

1733
02:05:46,238 --> 02:05:49,696
Frightful night in my memory.

1734
02:05:51,010 --> 02:05:56,744
I only had to murmur those three words,
but I kept silent.

1735
02:05:56,849 --> 02:06:02,810
Now I shout them a hundred times a day,
with all my force,

1736
02:06:02,922 --> 02:06:06,585
hoping they bridge
the great expanse between us.

1737
02:06:06,692 --> 02:06:08,125
I love you.

1738
02:06:08,227 --> 02:06:11,025
Yes, I love you.

1739
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:12,927
Forever.

1740
02:06:14,934 --> 02:06:18,734
You may laugh after all these months apart.

1741
02:06:18,837 --> 02:06:20,304
My confession calms me.

1742
02:06:20,406 --> 02:06:24,502
It proves I'm alive, at peace with myself.

1743
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:27,010
The rest is trivial...

1744
02:06:29,782 --> 02:06:31,841
I made big resolutions...

1745
02:06:31,951 --> 02:06:37,548
such as leaving the army,
which let me go without difficulty.

1746
02:06:37,823 --> 02:06:41,953
As I have no taste for cities or suits,

1747
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:49,695
I've returned to my childhood home where I have a
few acres of rocks and vineyard.

1748
02:06:49,802 --> 02:06:53,636
Without illusions,
I offer you this paltry kingdom.

1749
02:06:54,306 --> 02:06:56,103
It's 10 p.m.

1750
02:06:56,208 --> 02:07:03,046
There's dung, mint, and caramel in the air
(because I dropped sugar on my stove).

1751
02:07:03,148 --> 02:07:10,452
Tomorrow I'll see if my boars have left for Spain,
and begin to wait.

1752
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:12,251
For you.

1753
02:07:12,358 --> 02:07:14,087
I already am.

1754
02:07:15,461 --> 02:07:18,089
I'll only wait 100 years.

1755
02:07:18,197 --> 02:07:20,427
Let's say 101 years.

1756
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:27,129
P<i>ost scriptum</i>
These are my final dreadful statistics.

1757
02:07:27,239 --> 02:07:33,474
In comparison to the duration of the Allied Victory
March down the Champs-Elysées,

1758
02:07:33,579 --> 02:07:35,706
about three hours, I think,

1759
02:07:35,814 --> 02:07:40,842
I calculated that given the same speed,
step, and military formations,

1760
02:07:40,953 --> 02:07:44,548
the march of those who died
in this inexpiable madness

1761
02:07:44,657 --> 02:07:48,821
would have lasted 11 days and 11 nights.

1762
02:07:48,927 --> 02:07:51,691
Forgive me this crushing accuracy.

1763
02:07:51,797 --> 02:07:54,095
Yours, for life.
