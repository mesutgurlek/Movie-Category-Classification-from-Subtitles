1
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,606
That can really only happen...

2
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:21,277
...when a tyrannical system
is so well-established...

3
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,182
...that it can dominate
the entire fabric of society.

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,359
And the Germans are good
at organizing.

5
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,337
People's consciences too?

6
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,076
Yes. You see, that's an area...

7
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:52,150
...where Hitler did
a huge amount of harm.

8
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:56,516
He actually tried to manipulate the
consciences of the German people.

9
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,414
He convinced them...

10
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,152
...they had a task to do, they had to
exterminate the Jews, because...

11
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,263
...the Jews caused all our problems.
It wasn't Hitler's own idea...

12
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,128
...it had been put forward much earlier.

13
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,394
That they had to make a sacrifice.

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,868
And I can remember a writer...

15
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,472
...she interviewed a soldier
who had been stationed...

16
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,304
...in a concentration camp.

17
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,278
He was a guard, and she asked him:

18
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,084
"Didn't you feel any pity at all...

19
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,812
...for the people
you treated so badly there?"

20
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,622
And he replied,
"Yes, I certainly did feel pity for them...

21
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,590
...but I had to overcome it.

22
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:40,165
That was a sacrifice I had to make
for the greater cause."

23
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,295
And that's what happened
to conscience.

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,529
After all, Hitler always used to say:

25
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,271
"You don't have to worry, any of you...

26
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,638
...you just have to do whatever I say,
and I'll take responsibility."

27
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,679
As if anyone can take charge of
another person's conscience.

28
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,216
I do think you can make someone's
conscience more sensitive...

29
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,479
...or desensitize it, or manipulate it.

30
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,672
Traudl Junge, n¨¦e Humps,
was born in 1920...

31
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:28,678
...and was Hitler's secretary
from 1942 until the end of the war.

32
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,578
She also took dictation
for his last will and testament.

33
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,278
For more than 50 years
she kept her memories to herself...

34
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:39,789
...and remained silent about her life,
her adversities and her distress.

35
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,357
Frau Junge married
Hitler's manservant...

36
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,225
...Hans Hermann Junge, in 1943.

37
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,528
Shortly thereafter he enlisted
for frontline service...

38
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,832
...and was shot and killed 14 months
later in France during a low attack.

39
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,171
Starting in the mid-1950s, she lived
in a one-bedroom flat in Munich.

40
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:04,507
In April and June 2001
several meetings with Frau Junge...

41
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,847
...were arranged
by author Melissa M¨¹ller...

42
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,319
...which resulted in this film.

43
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,493
The longer I live, the older I get...

44
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:59,331
...the more I feel this burden...

45
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:03,202
...this feeling of guilt,
because I worked for a man...

46
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,640
...and I actually liked him, but...

47
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,246
...he caused such terrible suffering.

48
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,315
You see, details came out later
about what really...

49
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,418
...happened in the concentration
camps.

50
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,522
I read Viktor Klemperer's books,
and it was much later, of course...

51
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,251
...but it did give me
the very strong sensation that...

52
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,295
...all these problems at least began
for the Jews...

53
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,400
...right at the start, in 1933 or 1934.

54
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,695
And the feeling that I was so unaware
and so thoughtless....

55
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,602
I didn't notice or pay attention.
That feeling...

56
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,868
...has oppressed me more and more.

57
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,476
It seems to me
that I should be angry...

58
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:47,348
...with the child I was,
that juvenile young girl...

59
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,653
...or that I can't forgive her
for failing to recognize in time...

60
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,088
...what horrors that monster caused.

61
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,661
The fact that I didn't see
what I was getting involved in...

62
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,288
...and above all that I just said "yes"
without thinking at all.

63
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,834
After all, it wasn't as though
I were a fervent Nazi.

64
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,198
And when I went to Berlin,
I could have said:

65
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,103
"No, I don't want that job...

66
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,836
...I don't want to be sent
to the F¨¹hrer's headquarters."

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,138
But I didn't do that,
because I was simply too curious.

68
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,910
And I suppose
I couldn't really imagine...

69
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,086
...that destiny would drive me on
and leave me in a situation...

70
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,316
...that I had never aspired to at all.

71
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,526
But nevertheless...

72
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,755
...I find it hard to forgive myself
for everything.

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,359
I mean, of course today
there's no doubt about it. I have to say:

74
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,836
He was an absolute criminal.

75
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,268
He was a criminal--
It's just that I didn't realize it.

76
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,342
At some point afterwards I began to
wonder if I should have seen that.

77
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,918
But then I think I was only 13 years old
when he first came on the scene...

78
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,316
...and I was quite late developing
in lots of ways...

79
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,428
...and after all, apart from me there
were millions who didn't see that.

80
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,896
I mean, it's not as though
everyone apart from me...

81
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,431
...realized what a criminal he was.

82
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,235
And I try to take heart
from those thoughts.

83
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,951
And Hitler did somehow embody
something monumental...

84
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,724
...at first, when I was a child.

85
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:38,824
The first time I met him
he probably had a kind of paternal...

86
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,768
...protective attitude towards me too...

87
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,369
...and that's something
I had longed for.

88
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,772
I'd never been able to follow
my own inclinations...

89
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,435
...and I'd never had that feeling...

90
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,811
...of security in a complete family.

91
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,010
My mother did everything for us,
it's true...

92
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,483
...but I used to envy children
who could say things like:

93
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,457
"My father says so and so,"
or "My father thinks...."

94
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,889
I used to think having a father
must be very important.

95
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,569
Then I started working for Hitler,
and suddenly I had...

96
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,932
...that sense of security too.

97
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,232
There really was a certain kind
of security in that...

98
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,774
...community, which cut itself off
so much from the outside.

99
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,241
I think I matured late, as well.

100
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,255
I think I had a very subservient
attitude toward him...

101
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,359
...as a father figure.

102
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,589
But that can easily...

103
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,065
...be transformed into hatred,
if your father disappoints you.

104
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,910
Unfortunately,
my family was completely apolitical.

105
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:02,370
My mother brought us up by herself,
and her father...

106
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,242
...who was a general...

107
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,648
...was really a tyrant in the house.

108
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,449
Devil at home and angel in company,
people always used to say.

109
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,787
He wasn't at all interested
in politics...

110
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,486
...and the subject
was never discussed.

111
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:23,931
We were brought up according to
various other principles:

112
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,034
Doing without things,
making sacrifices and backing down.

113
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,571
They were all seen as virtues,
although...

114
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,439
...today the attitude is virtually
the opposite.

115
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,047
And I think I was incredibly
conformist as a child.

116
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,874
I always had to do without things
and make sacrifices...

117
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,918
...because my mother had
such a difficult time.

118
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,716
She ran the household for her father...

119
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,793
...and since she didn't have any
money, as a divorced woman...

120
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,453
...he always made it clear to us
that he was supporting us.

121
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,624
And there was always that pressure...

122
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:01,130
...that mental and moral pressure
surrounding the whole situation.

123
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,470
I actually ended up with Hitler
by complete coincidence...

124
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,706
...by chance and foolishness,
I'd have to say.

125
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,978
When I was a young girl I didn't really
have any exact ideas or plans...

126
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,556
...that I wanted to achieve in my life,
or any sense...

127
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,057
...of wanting to be something.

128
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,656
And I couldn't go to high school...

129
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,595
...because the school fees were
a problem for my mother.

130
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,999
So I had to leave secondary school
after the first state examination.

131
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,833
And then they said, "You'd better
go to commercial school...

132
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,807
...and get a job in an office, that's
the quickest way to earn a living. "

133
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,947
And so that was to be my fate...

134
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,016
...and I couldn't see
any other chance at all.

135
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,578
I suppose I also felt awkward
because I was the oldest...

136
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,657
...and I was still at home...

137
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,125
...while my younger sister was out
in the big wide world.

138
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,726
Then she came up with an idea.
She said:

139
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,026
"l know, let's ask Albert Bormann...

140
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,500
...if he can get you transferred
to Berlin."

141
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:10,370
And I said all right,
without any idea at all, of course...

142
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,670
...what the consequences would be.

143
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,211
I ought to explain something else.

144
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,216
At that time, you see,
which was 1941...

145
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,581
...I'd always thought that as well as
working in an office...

146
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,557
...I could satisfy
my passion for dancing...

147
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,857
...and I really wanted to go
to dance school.

148
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:37,628
So in 1941 I took the entrance exam
for dance school...

149
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,170
...and the result was very good,
so I thought I could...

150
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,942
...escape from office work forever.

151
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,973
But they wouldn't let me leave
the publishing company...

152
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,081
...where I was working,
because during the war...

153
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,019
...you could only change your job with
the permission of your employer.

154
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,781
And that made me so disappointed
and so cross...

155
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,951
...that I poured my heart out
to my sister...

156
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,030
...who was a dancer in Berlin
by that time.

157
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,725
And then she got her best friend...

158
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,201
...to talk to her brother-in-law,
Albert Bormann, and ask him...

159
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,633
...to have me transferred.

160
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,742
So that was a chance for me...

161
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,105
...to get away from home...

162
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,215
...and also get back
at them in a way.

163
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,179
It was an act of defiance too...

164
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,053
...against my employer,
who didn't want to let me go.

165
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,857
I should also say that
when I was in Berlin...

166
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,222
...working in the
F¨¹hrer's chancellery...

167
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,555
...I never saw Hitler face to face at all.

168
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,100
I used to open his mail...

169
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,797
...and read the love letters
women would send him...

170
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,840
...but he wasn't there in person at all.

171
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,604
None of the others
ever saw him either.

172
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,509
He was in his personal headquarters...

173
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,049
...far away from his outer office,
you might say.

174
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,151
Then one day a typing competition...

175
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:09,988
...was announced, throughout the
whole of the chancellery complex...

176
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,563
...and it was rumored that...

177
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,895
...Hitler was looking for
a young girl to be his secretary.

178
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:21,472
Albert Bormann absolutely insisted
that I should take the test.

179
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:26,344
So I did, but I genuinely didn't have
any real ambition to get the job...

180
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:31,279
...because I was actually quite content
with my life at that time.

181
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,542
Living with my sister was fine...

182
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,645
...and the job was quite interesting....

183
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,225
Anyway, I took the typing test...

184
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,731
...and apparently I was quite good...

185
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,397
...even though I had the feeling
that I was awful.

186
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,169
In any case, one day,
I think it was in...

187
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,203
...October or November, or later....

188
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,274
No, it was much later,
it was early in December...

189
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,504
...and the 10 best girls
from the typing test...

190
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,539
...were told to board
the F¨¹hrer's special train...

191
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:09,051
...and taken to the Wolf's Lair,
Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia.

192
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,558
At first we stayed
on the F¨¹hrer's train...

193
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,287
...which was in the grounds
of the headquarters...

194
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,762
...until Hitler had time to see us...

195
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,057
...which took days, in the end.

196
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,365
And then, one night we were taken
through a dark forest...

197
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,337
...to the F¨¹hrer's bunker.

198
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:35,240
And that's where the decisive
meeting actually took place.

199
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:41,146
It was a very unpleasant building,
that bunker was...

200
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,521
...and in the anteroom,
the servant's area...

201
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,215
...we all lined up.
There were some...

202
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,226
...chairs with cork seats...

203
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,724
...and we waited until Hitler came.

204
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,200
Now, I'd only ever seen him...

205
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,137
...in newsreels and public
appearances.

206
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,140
So I knew his military expression...

207
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,609
...with his arm outstretched.

208
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,477
And then a kindly old gentleman
came up to us...

209
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,782
...speaking in a low voice
and giving us a friendly smile.

210
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,783
He shook hands with each of us...

211
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,253
...Iooked straight into our eyes with
that famous gaze of his...

212
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,418
...asked our names...

213
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:29,797
...said a few words to us with
a sort of friendly, paternal air...

214
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,065
...and then disappeared again.
When he went...

215
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,799
...he just said, "Good evening."

216
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,176
The experience of meeting him
was completely different...

217
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,610
...than I had imagined beforehand.

218
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,812
It wasn't at all frightening,
and there was a...

219
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,646
...harmless, peaceful atmosphere.

220
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,458
When it was over we said,
"Now we're curious...

221
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,926
...to know who he's chosen."
And then Bormann said:

222
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,066
"Not so fast,
now you'll have a trial dictation."

223
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,963
So I went for a trial dictation.

224
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:08,334
But Bormann sent another girl
along with me, just in case...

225
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,604
...because apparently Hitler...

226
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,639
...had already had a nasty
experience one time...

227
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,177
...when he asked a secretary...

228
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,284
...to write down something
he wanted to dictate.

229
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:25,355
She was so nervous that she had
a sort of hysterical fit...

230
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,992
...and he was afraid of that
happening again.

231
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,129
Well, I entered the room...

232
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:36,662
...and I could feel how cold it was.
Hitler didn't like warm rooms.

233
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,000
And he was very friendly
towards me, again.

234
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,300
"My child," he said,
"Don't be nervous.

235
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,501
You can't possibly make
as many mistakes as me.

236
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,376
Sit over here.
Shall I fetch a heater for you?"

237
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,540
He meant an electric heater.

238
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,654
We had special typewriters
that were quiet.

239
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,357
They were called Silenta typewriters.

240
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,220
And then he started
dictating something.

241
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,025
Well, I started typing,
but I knew my hands were trembling...

242
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,294
...so much that I didn't hit
any of the right keys.

243
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,598
I stared down at the paper,
and it looked like Chinese.

244
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,368
And then, thank God,
or perhaps unfortunately...

245
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,479
...his servant came in, Linge,
and said to Hitler:

246
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,172
"My F¨¹hrer,
Ribbentrop is on the phone."

247
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,683
So Hitler picked up the phone
and talked for a while...

248
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,784
...Iike any other boss would do.

249
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,490
And that gave me time to calm down
and rewrite the sentence...

250
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,059
...in correct German.

251
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,089
Then he dictated some more,
and it was fine.

252
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:44,463
It was actually quite easy.

253
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,273
At the end I gave him the paper,
and I went.

254
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,238
He was quite happy,
and I was quite happy.

255
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,777
I did find it exciting.

256
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,446
I didn't know
what had happened to me.

257
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,108
Suddenly there I was,
little Traudl Humps, sitting...

258
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,583
...opposite the F¨¹hrer.

259
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,213
And the F¨¹hrer himself,
whatever you thought about him...

260
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,656
...was a great man in those days.

261
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:13,127
It was such an extraordinary
situation...

262
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,028
...so incredible, such an adventure.

263
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,836
And then he called for me
a few more times, to take dictation...

264
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,009
...even though there were other
secretaries available...

265
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,305
...the two old secretaries.

266
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,517
I really liked being in the F¨¹hrer's
headquarters, in the forest.

267
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,279
In fact, all my life
I've disliked working...

268
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,450
...those rigid office hours...

269
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,755
...and sitting at a desk all day long.

270
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,555
And there was none of that there.

271
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,525
After all, Hitler didn't want someone
in the outer office...

272
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,469
...a secretary sitting there all day long,
managing appointments...

273
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,543
...and taking phone calls and
making coffee for him.

274
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:03,203
The secretaries weren't stationed
in an office at all.

275
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,146
They had their own apartments,
their own rooms...

276
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,684
...and were only called
to take dictation.

277
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,881
He only dictated public speeches...

278
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,490
...or private letters...

279
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,789
...or some other personal things.

280
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,464
We never had to write anything...

281
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,534
...about politics or military matters.

282
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,263
Then he called for me again...

283
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,466
...and the two old secretaries were
standing to his left and right...

284
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,644
...and he said, "Fr?ulein Humps...

285
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,645
...now I should like to ask you...

286
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,583
...if you wish to remain with me."

287
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,115
And then he said:

288
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,349
"You know,
it's always a problem for me...

289
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,359
...if I take pretty young secretaries.

290
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,190
Someone always marries them
and whisks them off.

291
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,627
Maybe they should have to wear
disfiguring ornaments...

292
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,362
...Iike Negro women, in their lips."

293
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:04,406
And I must have been mad,
because I said to him:

294
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,477
"My F¨¹hrer,
you don't have to worry in this case.

295
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,275
I've been without a man
for the last 22 years...

296
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,217
...so it's no problem for me."

297
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,879
And he just burst out laughing.

298
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:21,649
At the time I didn't realize
what nonsense I was talking.

299
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,228
"I've been without a man
for the last 22 years!"

300
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,891
Now, I have to confess I couldn't
really say "no" at that point.

301
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:36,163
I didn't have any reason to say,
"No, I don't want to stay with you."

302
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,504
To be honest,
I must admit I liked the idea.

303
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,674
In February '43, after Stalingrad...

304
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,976
...things were really quite different...

305
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:53,816
...though I didn't notice it very much
because I was so new.

306
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,261
But the atmosphere
in the F¨¹hrer's headquarters...

307
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,593
...must have changed at that time.
There was an...

308
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,930
...oppressive atmosphere.

309
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,235
Up until that time...

310
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,846
...Hitler used to take his meals
with his officers in the mess...

311
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,442
...which of course meant that...

312
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,216
...everyone would talk shop.

313
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,322
It wasn't very relaxing for him.

314
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,894
Then it occurred to him that he could
take his meals with his secretaries...

315
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,924
...and we were told not to bother him...

316
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,862
...with questions about Stalingrad
or other subjects.

317
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,834
He wanted to take it easy
at mealtimes.

318
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,872
So it was arranged that
of the four secretaries...

319
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,807
...two would have lunch with him
each day.

320
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,278
The other two would have dinner
with him...

321
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,976
...and the two from lunch would have
a cup of tea with him at night.

322
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,854
You know, I never had the feeling...

323
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,687
...that he was conscious of pursuing
criminal aims.

324
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,261
For him they were ideals.

325
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,626
For him they were great goals.

326
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,335
And human life meant nothing to him
in comparison.

327
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,002
But that only became so apparent
to me afterwards.

328
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,072
You see, in the inner circle
surrounding him...

329
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,778
...in his private sphere...

330
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:26,910
...I was shielded from the
megalomaniac projects...

331
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,077
...and the barbaric measures.

332
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,051
That was the awful thing,
that's what gave me...

333
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,296
...such a shock later, when I realized
what had been happening.

334
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,296
When I started working there
I thought...

335
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,101
...I was at the source of information...

336
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,637
...and in fact, I was in a blind spot.

337
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,846
It's like...

338
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,975
...in an explosion, there's one place
where calmness reigns.

339
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:07,521
And that was the great illusion...

340
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,662
...the great, not disappointment,
but the great...

341
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,727
...Iie that I had made myself believe.

342
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:21,129
That same man who made speeches,
when I think back...

343
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,001
...with that rolling R
and all that roaring...

344
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,405
...and clipping his words...

345
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,479
...I never heard him speak
like that in private.

346
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:34,017
He could speak in such a flattering--
Such a modulated tone.

347
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:39,886
In his private life he had that
gentle Austrian intonation too...

348
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,357
...and he used some words
that were typically Austrian.

349
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,224
For example, nimmermehr,
or "nevermore"...

350
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,525
...isn't used in Bavaria
or the rest of Germany.

351
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,966
"l heard it nevermore."
And things like that...

352
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,500
...did fascinate me, really.

353
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,302
The courteous manner...

354
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,446
...he displayed in his private life.

355
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,983
Apart from his stomach and
digestive disorders, he gave...

356
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,347
...the impression
of being very healthy.

357
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:13,184
And he had to cope with...

358
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,349
...an unhealthy way of life.

359
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,019
Far too little fresh air,
far too little exercise.

360
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,225
He didn't smoke or drink alcohol...

361
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,733
...although being healthy
is more than that.

362
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:30,006
But his problems were all connected
with the stomach and digestion.

363
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,071
And maybe that's the underlying
reason why he...

364
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:38,046
...had a vegetarian lifestyle,
or such an unbalanced lifestyle.

365
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,485
He was very dependent on Dr. Morell,
his personal physician.

366
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,457
And the doctor was a very
exotic character.

367
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,584
He had been a ship's doctor,
and he'd lived in lndia for years.

368
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,960
His approach to medicine was what
I would today describe as "holistic."

369
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,260
With some homeopathic elements...

370
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,133
...and natural remedies.

371
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,771
Dr. Morell had to help him a lot...

372
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,602
...constantly giving him some sort of
pills for his digestion...

373
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,009
...or for gas, and he also gave him...

374
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:14,448
...hormone and vitamin injections.
He used to swear by them.

375
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,022
I often used to ask Hitler's servant
about his personal habits...

376
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,092
...and he would tell me
some things himself.

377
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,229
For example,
he never liked being touched.

378
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,992
He didn't think much of massage
or other things...

379
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,260
...to do with the body.

380
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:35,099
And one time he said to me:

381
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,238
"l can't wear shorts
because my knees are so white.

382
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,105
I'm not the athletic sort."

383
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,212
Or he once said:

384
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,474
"Eva always wants me to
keep my back straight...

385
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,349
...but I always say she should try it
with such heavy keys in her pockets."

386
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:55,185
He used to talk a lot about
private matters...

387
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,487
...and also about
quite personal things.

388
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,598
For instance, once the war
had started he never...

389
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,497
...wore anything but army gray.

390
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,468
Before the war he wore tails
for formal occasions...

391
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,406
...or his brown SA uniform.

392
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,636
It was a matter of principle for him.

393
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,877
He was a clean, well-groomed man.

394
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,708
For instance, he always...

395
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,684
...washed his hands when he
had been stroking his dog.

396
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,156
His dog Blondie
meant an awful lot to him.

397
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:32,558
Blondie could provide a whole
evening's entertainment.

398
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,157
He was convinced that she was
incredibly clever and sophisticated...

399
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,462
...an absolutely wonderful dog
all around.

400
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,698
And she had a real fixation
with him too.

401
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,810
Even though she had been trained
by a dog trainer...

402
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,411
...and was very well looked after.

403
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,177
I don't think Hitler fed
the dog himself.

404
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:58,846
But I remember now that in Hitler's
small bedroom in the bunker...

405
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,283
...there was a big wooden box
for Blondie, as well.

406
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,259
It was very large,
in case she had puppies.

407
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,594
It was crowded in there with us all
gathered around the bed.

408
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,362
If you wanted to leave,
everyone had to stand up.

409
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:13,663
Well, anyway...

410
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,171
...Blondie could do
all sorts of tricks too.

411
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,708
She could bark
when given a command...

412
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,937
...and not just bark, she could sing!

413
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,182
She could make a sort of
howling noise, and if Hitler said:

414
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,376
"Sing deeper, Blondie,
sing like Zarah Leander"...

415
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,420
...Blondie would sing
an octave deeper.

416
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,922
He was very proud of that trick.

417
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,261
He was also immensely proud
that she always obeyed him.

418
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,863
She really did obey his every word.

419
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,100
Sometimes he'd go for a walk
with her in the grounds...

420
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,202
...where lots of obstacles
had been built...

421
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,898
...and he was really pleased
to see how clever she was.

422
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,733
Sometimes he'd throw a dumbbell
for her...

423
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:57,746
...but then she'd just pick it up
at one end...

424
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,781
...and it would hang down sideways.

425
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,613
Then he used to show us
what she would do.

426
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,982
He'd put his head on one side...

427
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,918
...and imitate Blondie gazing up
at him, to check...

428
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,389
...he was looking. And he'd
have to say, "Blondie, properly!"

429
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,293
And then she'd put it down properly.

430
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,629
He used to tell lots of stories
like that...

431
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,498
...and I think he really enjoyed it.

432
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,299
When I think about it now,
and listen to what I'm saying...

433
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,378
...all of these...

434
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:33,210
...Iittle stories sound so banal.

435
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,646
I think those characteristics of his...

436
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,755
...the personal mannerisms he had...

437
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,289
...aren't really at all important now...

438
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,986
...because the total effect
was so terrible.

439
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:50,401
I mean, at the time it was quite
important for me, of course...

440
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,763
...to see his human side.

441
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,565
But today it's almost as though...

442
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,368
...I'd rather not describe these things
so clearly.

443
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,582
Was there a moment...

444
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,843
...a certain time,
when you had the feeling that...

445
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,880
...the issue of the Jews came up?

446
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:21,932
I'll tell you about one incident...

447
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:27,901
...which took place at the Berghof...

448
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,442
...when Himmler was also present,
I think it was the only time.

449
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,313
Then he talked about
concentration camps.

450
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:42,283
He said that there was...

451
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,787
...what was called a "method"...

452
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:50,552
...and it was managed quite cleverly.
So for example...

453
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,756
...if someone was an arsonist,
he was put on fire duty...

454
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:58,926
...and you could be quite sure
there would never be a fire.

455
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,436
That comment was the only time...

456
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:08,409
...that the term concentration camp
was ever mentioned there.

457
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:14,276
The word Jew was virtually
never used...

458
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,920
...in everyday speech.

459
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,556
The fact that Hitler would,
at times...

460
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:23,023
...say something in his speeches
about "international Judaism"...

461
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,822
...or "the Jews,"
that was virtually ignored.

462
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,069
Nobody ever raised the subject...

463
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,772
...at least, not in our presence.

464
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,070
Actually, the only time
I can remember...

465
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:45,338
...the subject really being an issue...

466
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,781
...was one evening at the Berghof...

467
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,388
...when Frau von Schirach
was a guest.

468
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,684
I wasn't there at the time,
I only heard about it.

469
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,556
I was out of the room
when it happened.

470
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:03,661
She was on fairly cordial terms
with Hitler...

471
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:08,135
...and she suddenly raised the subject.
She told the F¨¹hrer directly...

472
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,907
...that it was quite terrible, the way...

473
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,944
...the Jews were treated in Amsterdam.
They were packed into trains...

474
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,777
...she said, and it was
an inhumane way to behave.

475
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,409
It must have made him very angry...

476
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,818
...and he said to her:

477
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,584
"Don't interfere in things
you don't understand.

478
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,627
This mawkishness
and sentimentality."

479
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,765
He really was very annoyed.

480
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,960
He walked right out of the room
and didn't return.

481
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:43,699
And Frau Schirach was never invited
to the Berghof again.

482
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,367
I think my husband told me about it.
He was there at the time.

483
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:52,539
It's something I often thought about
since then....

484
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:57,211
You couldn't discuss anything
with him...

485
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,821
...that was somehow sensitive...

486
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,392
...or difficult.

487
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:08,896
It was one aspect of him.
And that was really the only time...

488
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,799
...a conflict situation developed.

489
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,997
But I sometimes think...

490
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,376
...if I ever had the opportunity...

491
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,240
...to meet Hitler again, in this life...

492
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,677
...or in some other world...

493
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,643
...I really would like to ask him...

494
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,748
...what he would have done if he
had found some Jewish blood...

495
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,425
...in his own family.
Would he have gassed himself?

496
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,193
He didn't think in human dimensions.

497
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,061
Humanity was never
of any importance to him.

498
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,227
It was always the concept
of the superman...

499
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,272
...the nation,
always this abstract image...

500
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:54,070
...of a vast German Reich,
powerful and strong.

501
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,645
But the individual never mattered
to him.

502
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,647
Though he always said he wanted
to make people happy.

503
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,581
He started a variety of welfare...

504
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,520
...and recreational organizations
in the Third Reich.

505
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:11,560
Personal happiness was never
of the slightest importance to him.

506
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,174
Love was quite alien to him?

507
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,112
He never really spoke about love.

508
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:37,280
In fact,
I never heard him say the word.

509
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,353
That has just occurred to me.

510
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,663
His ideas on the subject...

511
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,063
...were really what you'd almost
call primitive.

512
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:56,132
The greatest hero deserves
the most beautiful woman.

513
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:01,802
He once said that Robert Ley,
the politician, had a beautiful wife...

514
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,081
...and she must have been beautiful.

515
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,513
But in the same way that
Brigitte Helm was...

516
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:11,849
...as if she were made of marble,
that amazingly regular, blond beauty.

517
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,156
Although I think she was
incredibly boring.

518
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:20,059
He couldn't understand how a man
with such a beautiful wife...

519
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,166
...could be unfaithful
with a less beautiful woman.

520
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,664
He couldn't imagine that a woman
could have any other...

521
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,272
...qualities apart from flawless beauty.

522
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,666
I don't think he really
knew very much about women.

523
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:41,345
And I never had the feeling
that his relationship with Eva...

524
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,219
...had a very strong erotic element.

525
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:48,382
He certainly exerted
considerable attraction, but...

526
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,359
...I don't know whether I'm right
about this, but I had the impression...

527
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,191
...that he felt uneasy
about anything erotic.

528
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,398
I can't really explain it.

529
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,811
I think he wasn't prepared to
let himself go.

530
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,578
And that's a very important part
of an erotic relationship, after all.

531
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,347
He really liked arranging marriages...

532
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,857
...but if he was ever asked
why he didn't marry, he'd say:

533
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:27,393
"l wouldn't be a good husband.
I couldn't allow myself to be."

534
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,897
And he probably wanted to maintain
the image of an unmarried man...

535
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:35,604
...for the sake of the female voters.

536
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,298
I mean, women were crazy about him.

537
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,205
I really don't know why.

538
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,246
He did once say something else
on the subject.

539
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,818
He said,
"Children are always a risk.

540
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,319
Sometimes the children of a genius
turn out to be cretins."

541
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,385
And even though I was such
a naive young girl...

542
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,529
...it struck me as very odd.

543
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,494
How can anyone regard himself
as a genius?

544
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,396
It made me flinch inside.

545
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:12,400
The 20 of July, 1944...

546
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,645
...was a particularly hot,
oppressive day.

547
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:21,317
Frau Christian and I took advantage
of the weather that morning...

548
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:25,820
...to go for a bicycle ride outside
the restricted area, to a little lake...

549
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,517
...where we could swim around
and lie in the sun for a while.

550
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:34,290
We didn't say a word to each other,
we were just dreaming.

551
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,563
When the sun was high in the sky,
and we knew it must be noon...

552
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,762
...we decided it was time to start back.

553
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:45,306
We didn't know if the
situation report meeting had started...

554
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,536
...and we might have been needed
earlier in any case.

555
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,280
When we got back to the camp...

556
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:55,852
...the officers' cars were parked there,
so the meeting was still in progress.

557
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,352
We went to our room...

558
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,790
...and all of a sudden there was
a terrible bang.

559
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,028
There were often loud noises...

560
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,457
...if a deer stepped on one
of the land mines...

561
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:12,433
...or there was an air-raid exercise,
or a new weapon was being tested.

562
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,867
We didn't think anything of it.

563
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,499
But then suddenly there was
a huge uproar outside.

564
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,577
Someone called the doctor.

565
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,910
We raced out of the barracks,
and somehow we could tell...

566
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,983
...that something had happened.

567
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,255
Then we ran towards
the F¨¹hrer's bunker...

568
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,550
...and there were soldiers
running towards us, saying:

569
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:38,922
"You can't go any further,
there's been a bomb explosion."

570
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,394
But we didn't know whether
the F¨¹hrer had been hit...

571
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,001
...or any details
about what had happened.

572
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,739
Then we headed for the building
where the meeting had taken place...

573
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,464
...and we wanted to go inside...

574
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,734
...but just then someone came...

575
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,902
...towards us covered in blood,
General Jodl, I think...

576
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,073
...and Major Weizenegger,
one of the staff officers...

577
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,585
...and they said to us:

578
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:07,349
"There's no access here, you can't
go on. You'll have to turn back."

579
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,852
It really was a big shock for us...

580
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:15,294
...because it made us wonder
what would happen to us...

581
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:18,128
...if the F¨¹hrer really
had been killed...

582
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,093
...how things could carry on.

583
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,032
There were all sorts of wild thoughts
in our heads:

584
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,831
"What will happen to us?"

585
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,843
Or, "Who could continue to lead us
in the war after the F¨¹hrer?"

586
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,779
It really was an atmosphere
of extreme panic.

587
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,414
We went back to our room...

588
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,115
...and waited there.
Then Otto G¨¹nsche came to see us.

589
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:45,093
He looked very disheveled
and anxious...

590
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,627
...but he said, "No need to worry,
nothing happened to the F¨¹hrer.

591
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,528
He's in his bunker now...

592
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,727
...and you can go and see him,
if you like."

593
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,565
So we made our way
to the F¨¹hrer's bunker...

594
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,607
...and he was standing
in the anteroom.

595
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,642
He looked so funny,
we almost burst out laughing.

596
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,542
His hair was standing on end...

597
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,809
...his trousers were hanging
in tatters...

598
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:12,547
...but he greeted us with an almost
triumphant smile, and said:

599
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,987
"l have been saved.

600
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,995
Destiny has chosen me,
providence has preserved me.

601
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,394
It is a sign that I must see my mission
through to the end.

602
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:26,525
Those cowards were too scared
to open fire and risk their own lives...

603
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,864
...they planted a bomb."

604
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,473
He was raging and cursing...

605
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,439
...and he thought the
construction squad...

606
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,637
...that had just built the barracks...

607
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:41,683
...might have hidden a bomb
in the floor of the building.

608
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,254
Then we left him.

609
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,186
He told us with great pride...

610
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,351
...that Dr. Morell had taken his pulse,
and it was quite normal.

611
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,522
He just had some bruises
on his right arm, which hurt him...

612
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,760
...so he kept it inside the jacket
of his uniform.

613
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,435
At the time we were very relieved...

614
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:08,567
...because after all,
we had been spared a huge change...

615
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,476
...that would have affected us
in ways...

616
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,844
...we could hardly imagine.

617
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:18,286
We had dinner with him that evening.

618
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:23,417
No, that afternoon Mussolini
came for a visit.

619
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,161
Hitler was very proud when he showed
him the site of the explosion.

620
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,699
He explained that the building...

621
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,737
...had been completely destroyed.
It was a fairly flimsy structure.

622
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,332
And of course he stressed again...

623
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:44,412
...that it was an act of fate,
an act of divine providence...

624
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,574
...that the meeting had not been
held in the bunker...

625
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,515
...as originally planned.

626
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,384
Since the bunker wasn't finished,
it had been moved to the barracks.

627
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,321
If it had been in the bunker,
he said:

628
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,519
"l would no longer be alive."

629
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:03,597
But very soon afterwards
something came to light...

630
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,760
...that shocked him to the very core.

631
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,264
He was in talks...

632
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,808
...to establish how the attack
had been mounted...

633
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:18,113
...when suddenly the telephone
operator came up to him and said:

634
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,412
"My F¨¹hrer, Colonel Stauffenberg...

635
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,646
...has left the barracks.

636
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:29,418
He said he was going to make
a phone call, but he didn't."

637
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,120
Apparently he used that as a pretense
to leave the barracks...

638
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,562
...but the telephone operator said,
"He didn't make any phone calls."

639
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:41,228
So straight away suspicion
fell on certain officers...

640
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,067
...instead of the construction squad...

641
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:48,143
...and of course the information
was sent to Berlin immediately.

642
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,837
Goebbels was informed,
and in Berlin...

643
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,343
...the whole apparatus
was set in motion.

644
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:57,749
The Army Supreme Command
stepped in, or was informed...

645
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,523
...and Goebbels contacted
Colonel Remer...

646
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:04,024
...who was in command of the
greater Deutschland regiment.

647
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:08,825
They occupied the radio station,
and other important sites too, I think...

648
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:13,870
...so everything went very,
very wrong for Stauffenberg.

649
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,571
Meanwhile...

650
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,105
...in the F¨¹hrer's headquarters...

651
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:24,611
...this betrayal by senior staff
officers naturally...

652
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:28,051
...caused a huge panic.

653
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,086
Hitler flew into a rage.

654
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:35,047
He started cursing the cowards
who wanted to get rid of him...

655
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,784
...and had absolutely no idea...

656
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,093
...what would happen in Germany
and throughout Europe...

657
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,426
...if he were no longer alive...

658
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:49,369
...if Judaism were once more in power,
full of hatred that would destroy...

659
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,135
...Germany, the whole of Europe
and the entire culture.

660
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,143
"They have no idea," he said...

661
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,305
..."what our enemies plan to do
with Germany and Europe."

662
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,350
The Western powers would never
be powerful enough...

663
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,251
...to resist Bolshevism, he claimed.

664
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,618
Only he had the capacity to do that...

665
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:12,626
...and he would not be prevented
from carrying out his mission.

666
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,765
There was no other solution,
Germany had to win the war.

667
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,458
By this time he had
worked himself up...

668
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,628
...into an almost euphoric mood.

669
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,872
And the incident made him feel even
more certain he was on the right path.

670
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,236
I have often wondered whether...

671
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:33,782
...it might have been possible before
then, when the situation wasn't...

672
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,512
...so absolutely terrible, for him to say:

673
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,713
"l can't win the war."

674
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,522
Perhaps he would have said
at some point:

675
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,822
"l have to make peace."
But after the attack...

676
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:50,264
...any hope of that was
completely in vain.

677
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,528
He felt so reinforced in his beliefs...

678
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:58,240
...and that evening he made a speech
to the German nation...

679
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,776
...saying he had been saved
in a miraculous way and...

680
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:07,876
...telling us we had to stake everything
on winning the war.

681
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,688
"We must triumph!"
That stupid, "We must triumph...

682
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,756
...because triumph we must!"

683
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:19,285
Hitler always used to say,
"lt is impossible...

684
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:23,797
...for Bolshevism to be victorious.

685
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:28,727
I am the only one
who can prevent that.

686
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:32,603
Without Germany, the Western
powers are not strong enough...

687
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,676
...to halt this avalanche."

688
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,541
He was convinced of that...

689
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,406
...but he must also have seen
that victory was impossible.

690
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,753
I actually think...

691
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,484
...he had lost touch with reality.

692
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,395
He simply no longer...

693
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,303
...had his feet firmly on the ground.

694
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,963
So then he wanted
to make a clean sweep...

695
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,674
...and drag everyone else
down with him.

696
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,608
As for myself, deep in my heart...

697
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,378
...I did have some doubts,
and I wondered:

698
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,544
"ls all this absolutely right?"

699
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:23,421
But then to question the situation...

700
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:27,894
...actually to initiate a discussion...

701
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,965
...would have taken more courage.

702
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,066
And I think it's also the case that
if you value and respect someone...

703
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,708
...you don't really want to destroy
the image of that person...

704
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,609
...you don't want to know, in fact...

705
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,715
...if disaster lies behind the fa?ade.

706
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:55,482
I don't think he considered war
a light-hearted matter.

707
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,991
He regarded it as a terrible thing...

708
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,187
...although he never said so.

709
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,357
For instance, whenever
there were reports of air raids...

710
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,596
...and people described the situation,
or if I said something like:

711
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,100
"My F¨¹hrer, you can't imagine
how miserable it is...

712
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:18,271
...for all those homeless people
whose houses have been bombed...

713
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,417
...it's just so terrible."

714
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,882
He'd stop me right away and say:

715
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,453
"l know exactly how it is,
but we shall strike back.

716
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,420
We shall take revenge,
and with our new weapons...

717
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,220
...everything will change.
Vengeance will be ours!"

718
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:35,729
He would always say that,
and in particular he'd say that...

719
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:40,060
...we would rebuild everything after
the war and make it better than ever.

720
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,436
I think there was a general policy
of denial.

721
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:47,441
He never did see a city
that had been badly bombed.

722
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:52,514
We traveled through Germany in the
special train with the blinds down...

723
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:58,715
...and when he reached Anhalter
Station in Berlin at night...

724
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,650
...the chauffeur would take the streets
that weren't so badly damaged.

725
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,960
Another thing, he would never
have flowers in his room.

726
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,992
He hated to have dead things around.

727
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,934
And that's strange,
when you think about it.

728
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,007
Someone who kills thousands
of people...

729
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:23,203
...doesn't want dead flowers in
his room, beautiful flowers.

730
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:32,817
With a sort of last thirst for life,
Eva Braun tried...

731
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,114
...to organize one final party.

732
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,557
She took the people
who were still there...

733
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,425
...back up to her old living quarters...

734
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:46,126
...and played one single record called,
"Red Roses Tell You of Love. "

735
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,670
There was dancing and champagne...

736
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,038
...and she was almost
hysterically cheerful.

737
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:59,649
But there was a forced,
desperate atmosphere...

738
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,978
...and it was eerie.

739
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,553
The Russian rocket launchers
provided an accompaniment.

740
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:10,250
I was there for a while, but then I left.

741
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,658
I was in a very miserable mood.

742
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,824
Then I went down to the bunker,
where I had sleeping quarters...

743
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,863
...and I tried to get some sleep.

744
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,540
The following day,
which was the 22 of April...

745
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,072
...Hitler called a meeting
to discuss the situation.

746
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:34,740
All the officers from the general staff
came along...

747
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,819
...General Krebs, General Burgdorf...

748
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:41,215
...and all the adjutants.

749
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,486
All of a sudden...

750
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,663
...he opened the door
of the conference room...

751
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,825
...walked out into the anteroom,
to his study...

752
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,694
...and sent for us.

753
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,603
I mean the women
who were still there:

754
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,742
Frau Christian and me...

755
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:06,145
...and the cook, Fr?ulein Manzialy...

756
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,481
...and Eva Braun. And he said:

757
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:14,146
"All is lost.
You must leave Berlin at once."

758
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,952
His face was like
a mask of stone.

759
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:22,162
In fact, it already looked as though
he were wearing a death mask.

760
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,465
We stood there, completely stunned...

761
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,129
...and then Eva Braun
walked up to him...

762
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,434
...took both his hands in hers
and said:

763
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,602
"But you must know I'll stay with you.
I shall never leave you."

764
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,772
And then he leaned forwards...

765
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,613
...and for the first time
that anyone had ever seen...

766
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,812
...he kissed her on the lips.

767
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:51,483
Then Frau Christian and I both said:

768
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,323
"I'm staying here."

769
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,931
I don't know why I said it.

770
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,068
I suppose I couldn't imagine
where else to go.

771
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,704
And I felt quite anxious, in a way.

772
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:05,232
I was scared of leaving that
secure environment.

773
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,311
Maybe I didn't really believe
it was so serious, as well.

774
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,513
Then he said,
"l shall shoot myself."

775
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,041
And he added:

776
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,279
"l only wish my generals
had as much courage as you."

777
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,555
Then we left the room...

778
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,922
...and everyone from the meeting
was standing there.

779
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:29,122
Their faces were either red
or as white as corpses.

780
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,994
And they stood completely still.

781
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,198
I don't remember what I did
after that.

782
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,670
The whole situation had somehow...

783
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,569
...Ieft me in a state of shock.

784
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:49,776
But life went on,
at least for a while.

785
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,586
Hitler insisted there was
no way of saving the situation...

786
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,123
...although the generals
kept on trying...

787
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,751
...to persuade him
there were some possibilities.

788
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,622
But after the 22 of April...

789
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,030
...there was one disaster
after another.

790
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,367
Then all personnel who could
be spared left and headed south.

791
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:15,972
Hitler's chief adjutant,
a man called Schau...

792
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:19,445
...was an old warrior from
the early days, a loyal follower...

793
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,514
...and he had to pack...

794
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:27,521
...all the private documents
and papers in a box.

795
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,285
He burnt some of them
in front of the bunker...

796
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,658
...and he put the others
in the last plane to leave.

797
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,592
Then he had to get away himself.

798
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:42,796
He had to set off for Munich,
so he could do the same thing there.

799
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:47,042
Sort through all the files
and documents...

800
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,507
...and destroy some of them.

801
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:52,170
He parted from the F¨¹hrer
with tears in his eyes.

802
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:56,112
Fr?ulein Wolf and Fr?ulein Schr?der
also had to leave Berlin...

803
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:02,421
...and those of us who were left started
to lead a sort of shadowy existence.

804
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:06,022
We lost track of whether
it was day or night.

805
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:09,427
We would have meals without
knowing what we were eating.

806
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,762
We still tried to conduct
conversations...

807
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,097
...but from that point on,
most of the talk was really about...

808
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,133
...the best, most certain
and most painless way...

809
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,541
...to put an end to our lives.

810
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:30,617
Naturally we said to Hitler,
"Why don't you try to get away?"

811
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:34,154
His reply was, "l do not wish
to fall into enemy hands alive."

812
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,225
So we said, "Why do you insist
on killing yourself?"

813
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:40,158
He said, "l do not want the enemy
to take me alive.

814
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,163
I have no strength to fight
at the head of my troops...

815
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:47,292
...and none of my loyal followers
will shoot me when I ask them to.

816
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,439
So I shall have to do it myself."

817
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:55,772
At that point he obtained some
poison capsules from Himmler.

818
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,438
We asked for some too.

819
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:04,152
The stories about
what the Russian troops...

820
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:08,223
...did to the women when they
occupied German towns...

821
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,882
...were so terrible and frightening...

822
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,890
...that we also asked...

823
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:17,495
...if we could have cyanide capsules
for use in an emergency.

824
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:21,098
He gave us some tablets,
and as he did so, he said:

825
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,672
"l would have preferred to give you
a nicer farewell gift."

826
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:29,133
We were also allowed
to learn to shoot.

827
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:34,645
Although for some time we
had been shooting at targets...

828
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,184
...in the grounds of the chancellery.

829
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,221
We had requested this before,
back in East Prussia...

830
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,416
...but he had refused.
Now he granted our request.

831
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,493
Eva Braun joined in.

832
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:53,369
A couple of days later, it must
have been about the 24 of April...

833
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:57,897
...Goebbels happened to see me
in the corridor, and he said:

834
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:03,510
"Frau Junge, my family will now
be moving into the F¨¹hrer's bunker.

835
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:07,547
See to it that the children
are given somewhere to sleep."

836
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:12,250
I passed the message on
to the household steward...

837
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,550
...or the director of the F¨¹hrer's
living quarters...

838
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,523
...and a room was provided
for the children.

839
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:22,461
There were bunk beds for the children,
all set up.

840
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:26,432
Not long afterwards Frau Goebbels
came along with the six children.

841
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:29,128
The children were in a good mood
and happy...

842
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,433
...that they could be with Uncle Hitler.

843
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,736
I suppose someone said,
"We'll be safer in here."

844
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:39,378
I don't think they had begun
to suspect...

845
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:43,576
...that it was going to be a very,
very bad time all around.

846
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:49,688
Naturally all through this period...

847
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:53,158
...there was a terribly tense
atmosphere everywhere.

848
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:58,233
What was going to happen in this
last round of attack and defense?

849
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,392
Reports would come from the front...

850
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,631
...but without providing any real news.
There were always crisis meetings...

851
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,208
...that broke up without any hope.

852
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,902
There were no more attacks...

853
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,204
...and there was no more defense.

854
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:17,214
Because Hitler had given up
all hope...

855
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,413
...and he had withdrawn,
withdrawn into himself.

856
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,753
He became completely numb
and apathetic...

857
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,328
...and he would just sit in the corridor
with one of the puppies.

858
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:30,398
Blondie had had puppies by then.

859
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,536
They lived in a small room
in the bunker...

860
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,466
...a washroom.

861
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,837
He would sit there with a puppy
in his lap, staring ahead blankly.

862
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,201
We didn't know
what he was waiting for...

863
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,213
...but the officers kept on trying....

864
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,716
Suddenly they came along with
a suggestion that General Wenck...

865
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:53,913
...who was heading west
with his army at the time...

866
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,589
...could turn back...

867
00:54:55,759 --> 00:55:00,628
...and meet up with General Steiner
coming down from the north.

868
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,960
Then it should be possible
to save Berlin.

869
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,627
That gave Hitler a new lease of life.

870
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,602
He started to show an interest
in the situation again...

871
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:14,574
...there were more meetings,
and we would sit around.

872
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,235
By now we didn't know
if it was day or night.

873
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,780
There were no more
regular mealtimes.

874
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,315
Nothing was done with
any ceremony anymore.

875
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,888
People even started smoking
in Hitler's presence.

876
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:36,430
There were still conversations
around the dinner table.

877
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,133
And still tea in the evening.

878
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,669
Though Hitler was
very apathetic then...

879
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:44,701
...and the mood was very subdued...

880
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,533
...which was naturally to be expected.

881
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:51,147
And there were also a few attempts...

882
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:56,616
...at a kind of gallows humor like,
"Chin up while you've still got one!"

883
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,350
It was an awful time.

884
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,492
We all acted somehow as if we were...

885
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,457
...automatons, without....

886
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:08,688
I simply can't remember
any genuine feelings at all.

887
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,523
It was like drifting...

888
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,159
...and not really being yourself at all.

889
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,566
You have to imagine
what the situation was like.

890
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,508
The deafening roar...

891
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,138
...of artillery and air raids...

892
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:30,286
...the completely ghostly atmosphere...

893
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,149
...against a background
of constant noise.

894
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,984
But despite everything...

895
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:38,150
...sometimes when there was a break
in the shelling...

896
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:43,223
...and it was quiet up top,
I'd go outside with...

897
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,029
...Eva Braun and Frau Christian,
into the grounds.

898
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:50,164
And it was spring up there!

899
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,537
The narcissuses were in bloom,
there were buds on the trees...

900
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,272
...the sun was shining, and somehow
that raised our hopes again...

901
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:01,781
...made us feel alive again...

902
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,748
...because nature had not come
to a standstill.

903
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:11,015
Afterwards we would go back down
into the bunker feeling quite refreshed.

904
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,594
And everyone
would be sitting around...

905
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,822
...hopeless and full of despair.

906
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,396
Eva Braun was with us
the last time...

907
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:22,197
...we went up to the grounds
for a walk...

908
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:26,433
...and in the grounds of the next
building, the Foreign Ministry...

909
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:32,206
...she saw a very beautiful statue
of a nymph beside a fountain.

910
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,646
She was so impressed that
she went back into the bunker...

911
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:40,153
...and said to the F¨¹hrer,
"You know, there's a statue up there...

912
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:44,089
...and if you win the war,
I'd like you to buy it for me."

913
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,228
And then he said:

914
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:49,797
"But I don't know who it belongs to.
It's state property.

915
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,557
I can't just buy it and put it
in your private garden."

916
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,703
It's amazing, the things that went on.
Then she said:

917
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,741
"But if you do manage
to triumph over the Russians...

918
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,845
...you could make an exception
just this once."

919
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,514
And it was really bizarre, you see,
because conversations like that...

920
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:12,246
...actually did take place, and then
afterwards we would go back...

921
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,890
...to discussing the best way
to commit suicide.

922
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:18,092
The surest way is to shoot yourself
in the mouth.

923
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,729
If you shoot yourself in the head...

924
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:23,491
...you might end up like
General Stiegler in Paris...

925
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:28,160
...who shot himself in the head after
the attack and only blinded himself.

926
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,603
And Eva said,
"l want to be a beautiful corpse...

927
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,264
...so I'll take the poison."

928
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:40,347
That paradoxical roller coaster
of emotions left you...

929
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,548
...feeling completely drained inside...

930
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:45,881
...and quite numb.

931
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,181
Being in that situation,
as I remember it...

932
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,192
...was like being in a trance
or a state of shock...

933
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,330
...where you function automatically...

934
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:58,627
...without analyzing your emotions
or even really feeling them.

935
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:03,430
And some of the situations that arose
were so weird.

936
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,902
Suddenly there was a rumor
that Himmler...

937
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:14,750
...had been holding peace
negotiations with Count Bernadotte.

938
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:19,312
Then Hitler became incredibly
worked up and suspicious...

939
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:24,188
...because he thought one of
the liaison officers with Himmler...

940
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,296
...General Fegelein or an SS doctor
called Stumpfegger...

941
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:31,763
...might be involved in a conspiracy
with Himmler...

942
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:34,460
...to bring him out of
the bunker alive.

943
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,798
He even turned Dr. Morell away...

944
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,704
...when he came to give him
his usual injections:

945
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,770
"Get out of my room
and leave this place at once!"

946
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,939
He was afraid...

947
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,344
...that someone might
have been bribed...

948
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,485
...to make an attempt to get him
out of Berlin alive.

949
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:59,456
He had told everyone he wouldn't go,
but they had all tried to persuade him.

950
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:04,698
Then Eva Braun, who suddenly
developed a loyalty complex, said:

951
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:08,234
"And where's Speer?
Speer's your friend, isn't he?

952
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:11,532
He should be at your side
during this difficult time."

953
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,699
And he said, "Listen, my child...

954
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:18,506
...Speer has important things
to do outside.

955
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:23,380
His place is where he has work to do,
not in here with me."

956
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:28,456
And she replied, "But he is your friend,
so he's bound to come."

957
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,855
In fact, Speer actually did come.

958
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:32,517
Yes, Speer came...

959
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:36,765
...and had a long talk with Hitler.

960
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:43,628
I don't know what they discussed.
Hitler didn't say anything about it.

961
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:48,307
But Speer couldn't persuade him
either...

962
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,571
...and I don't even think he tried.

963
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,410
I almost think that
at that moment...

964
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:58,483
...Speer had decided not to carry out
the scorched earth policy.

965
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,982
Afterwards it was said...

966
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:06,523
...that he somehow tried to gas
everyone in the bunker...

967
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,756
...with gas in the air shaft.

968
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:14,835
But I'm not sure if that is true
or if he intended to do it.

969
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:20,435
And then there was another
startling turn of events.

970
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:24,774
G?ring had been appointed
vice-chancellor by that stage...

971
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,744
...and he was at the Berghof.

972
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:31,216
Suddenly he sent a telegram saying,
"My F¨¹hrer...

973
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:36,654
...since you have no more scope
for action or decisions in Berlin...

974
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,353
...I shall consider myself appointed
your successor...

975
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,364
...if I hear nothing from you by 2200."

976
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:49,701
This telegram had been received
by Martin Bormann...

977
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:54,400
...who still controlled the information
that reached Hitler.

978
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:59,139
Nothing ever landed on Hitler's desk
without Bormann seeing it first.

979
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,651
Bormann had handed the telegram
to Hitler...

980
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:07,518
...and presumably offered
his interpretation.

981
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:12,593
In any case,
Hitler regarded it as high treason...

982
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:15,629
...and no doubt Bormann reinforced
that view.

983
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:20,167
He gave the order for G?ring
and his entire staff to be arrested.

984
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:25,802
This act of betrayal made him much,
much more suspicious.

985
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,236
He even ordered...

986
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:32,507
...his brother-in-law, Fegelein,
to be shot.

987
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:38,477
Although he had released Fegelein
from his duties on the 22 of April:

988
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,679
"You may leave if you wish."

989
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:44,293
The people who had stayed behind
had declared...

990
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,157
...that it was their choice,
but one day Fegelein vanished.

991
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,391
Fegelein wasn't just liaison officer
with Himmler...

992
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,694
...but also Eva Braun's brother-in-law.

993
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,600
He had married Eva's sister, Gretel.

994
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,607
And Gretel was expecting a baby.
She was in Munich.

995
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:04,437
Fegelein suddenly went missing.

996
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,674
Suddenly he wasn't to be found
in the bunker.

997
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,148
Hitler wanted to see him,
but he couldn't be found.

998
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,714
Then Eva managed to contact him
in his apartment...

999
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,759
...and he said to her,
"I'm begging you...

1000
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:22,830
...come to Munich with me.
You'll die if you don't get away!"

1001
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,630
And Eva replied,
"Hermann, you know I'll never leave.

1002
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,966
I want you to come here at once.
The F¨¹hrer needs you."

1003
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,568
Fegelein didn't turn up...

1004
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:37,702
...so someone was sent to fetch him,
and he was completely drunk.

1005
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,842
Then Hitler had him shot.

1006
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,712
Eva shed many tears about that...

1007
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,755
...but she did accept it.

1008
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:53,555
It was one more betrayal
at a time...

1009
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:57,825
...when there was no hope left, a time
when Hitler wanted to kill himself.

1010
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,237
I could hardly comprehend
what was going on...

1011
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:06,000
...because it was all so ambiguous.

1012
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:13,977
And then, on 26 of April...

1013
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,379
...when everything was in flames
around us...

1014
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,384
...with smoke billowing around...

1015
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:22,183
...and there were bomb craters
everywhere...

1016
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,223
...on the main road in front...

1017
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:27,226
...of the Brandenburg Gate,
a Storch light plane landed.

1018
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:31,890
It was Hanna Reitsch, the aviator,
and General von Greim.

1019
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,031
He was wounded.
Enemy fighters had attacked them...

1020
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,637
...and Greim had a bullet in his leg.

1021
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:43,376
Dr. Stumpfegger tended his wound...

1022
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:47,642
...and Hanna Reitsch beamed
as she approached...

1023
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:51,844
...her beloved F¨¹hrer.
I never saw a woman...

1024
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:56,355
...greet the F¨¹hrer with such
obsessive devotion...

1025
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,356
...with such willingness to die for him.

1026
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:04,622
She wasn't passive, like Eva Braun.
She was a fighter.

1027
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:09,937
Then she sang some lullabies
with the Goebbels' children.

1028
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:16,268
Greim was intended
to succeed G?ring...

1029
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:21,314
...so Hanna Reitsch was ready
to make-- What should I say...

1030
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:25,584
...a rallying call when
she flew out of Berlin again.

1031
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,916
And she got away safely.

1032
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:32,789
But it was a macabre incident
at the time.

1033
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:40,697
Suddenly someone from
the outside world burst into...

1034
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,600
...that trap we were in,
and then flew off again...

1035
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,571
...spreading a message of hope.

1036
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,437
We were left behind...

1037
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:52,308
...and it was only three more days
to the bitter end.

1038
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:01,718
I don't really know how we carried on,
it was a shadowy existence.

1039
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:06,851
We kept on handing round cups
of tea and sitting there...

1040
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:10,658
...still hoping for something,
still waiting.

1041
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:15,327
But the counterattack with Wenck
and Steiner never came off.

1042
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:19,941
Other things did happen, though.

1043
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:24,136
A girl who worked in the kitchen
got married.

1044
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,639
They fetched a registrar to the bunker.

1045
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:35,390
Then someone brought the bride's
parents in from the bombed city.

1046
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:38,957
They got married,
and then there was a party.

1047
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:44,122
With the thunder of the artillery
and shells bursting all around.

1048
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:47,059
I think people were even dancing.

1049
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:48,928
Someone had an accordion.

1050
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:51,903
It really was a bizarre moment.

1051
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,972
And then Hitler...

1052
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:02,409
...decided to poison his dog.

1053
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:06,120
After Fegelein was executed...

1054
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:10,620
...and Himmler's treason became
known, Hitler no longer trusted...

1055
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,988
...the cyanide Himmler had given him.

1056
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:17,428
He wanted to test it on his dog
to make sure it worked.

1057
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:21,933
So then poor Blondie was poisoned.

1058
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,833
The poison worked very well.

1059
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:29,000
It left that smell of bitter almonds
in the bunker...

1060
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,009
...which was terrible.

1061
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:35,610
I remember thinking,
"That is the worst thing of all...

1062
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,753
...dying down here in the bunker."

1063
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,451
But that was only part of my feeling...

1064
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:46,118
...because I also felt there might
just be some way out.

1065
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:55,996
I was sitting outside the bunker
one other time...

1066
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:59,232
...with Eva Braun, in the open air...

1067
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,601
...and at one very silent moment
she said:

1068
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:05,178
"Go on, give me a cigarette too."

1069
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:08,006
And then she said,
"l shall be weeping this evening."

1070
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,846
And I said, "What do you mean?
Has the time come?"

1071
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,011
"No, no," she said, "not that."

1072
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:17,592
And that evening,
it was the 28 of April.

1073
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,728
That evening...

1074
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,761
...was when Hitler....

1075
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:27,899
How did it happen?

1076
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:34,208
Yes, Hitler married Eva Braun.

1077
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,511
A registrar was fetched again...

1078
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,774
...and the two of them were married...

1079
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:45,182
...to the thunder
of the Russian artillery.

1080
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:50,315
When she signed her name
Eva started writing a B, and then...

1081
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,518
...she changed it to an H.

1082
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:58,691
So she emerged from that inferno
as Frau Hitler...

1083
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:02,531
...and walked past the staff,
who were lined up...

1084
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:06,899
...saying to them,
"You may now call me Frau Hitler."

1085
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:11,836
Before then the staff had always
referred to her as "Fr?ulein."

1086
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:17,715
Then they all went into the room
were Hitler took tea in the evenings.

1087
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:20,378
I was going to follow them.

1088
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:23,252
But he said,
"My child, have you rested a little?"

1089
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,653
I said, "Yes."

1090
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,988
And he said,
"Please come into the next room...

1091
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,230
...I have some dictation for you."

1092
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,930
And I thought to myself,
"What does he want to dictate now?"

1093
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:38,406
I went into the room,
which was very bare...

1094
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,432
...with just one big table...

1095
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,841
...a bench against the wall
and a few armchairs.

1096
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:49,248
And he said,
"Fetch a shorthand pad."

1097
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,578
That was the first time.

1098
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:54,280
I had never in my life
taken shorthand from him.

1099
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:58,415
I didn't have a pad with me,
so I had to go and find one.

1100
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:01,662
I sat down, and he started speaking.

1101
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:06,058
Leaning forward at the desk,
resting on his hands...

1102
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:10,498
...and with a blank expression,
gazing into the distance.

1103
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,732
He said, "My political testament."

1104
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:16,969
And I thought to myself:

1105
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,811
"Now I'm going to find out
what really happened.

1106
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:23,816
Now I'm going to find out
why the war is lost.

1107
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:26,921
He's going to make excuses
and provide justifications.

1108
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,319
Now he's going to explain everything."

1109
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:33,986
Then he started speaking,
and all of a sudden...

1110
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:37,457
...it was all the old phrases,
"The Jews are to blame."

1111
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:40,830
And, "The struggle was necessary...

1112
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:44,734
...in order to prevent a worse fate
and save the world."

1113
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,843
And, "The German people were not
ready for their mission...

1114
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:52,811
...so they must perish."
And, "National Socialism will die...

1115
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,506
...and nevermore rise again."

1116
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:58,050
But he also named a government
to succeed him.

1117
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,482
Even while I was writing I thought
I hadn't heard properly.

1118
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:07,391
It was so incredible,
it made no sense at all.

1119
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,323
I finished writing that text.

1120
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:14,026
And then he made
his private testament.

1121
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:22,407
If we were going to lose the war,
and the enemy was...

1122
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,910
...going to treat us the way
he always predicted...

1123
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:28,708
...then there would be no point
writing either of those documents.

1124
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:32,648
But he dictated them,
he remembered his housekeeper.

1125
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,789
He disposed of his pictures...

1126
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:40,156
...he settled a few more details,
and then he said:

1127
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:44,660
"Type up three copies as
quickly as possible, my child."

1128
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:49,065
So I went into a room...

1129
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:54,433
...which was a sort of office that
the telephone operator also used.

1130
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,101
I brought my typewriter,
and I started...

1131
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,404
...typing up my shorthand notes.

1132
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,516
I made far fewer mistakes than usual.
I don't know why.

1133
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,482
I was typing so mechanically.

1134
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,520
Normally I very often made
typing mistakes...

1135
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,888
...but this time I think there were
only two little mistakes.

1136
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,562
You must remember there
was no Tippex in those days...

1137
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:19,030
...and no correction key,
so you had to rub out any mistakes.

1138
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:22,398
With copies you had to
put something in between...

1139
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:23,902
...so it didn't go through.

1140
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,802
I wrote it up...

1141
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:29,671
...and I was able read it properly.
He kept on coming over.

1142
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:34,976
By now everyone was sitting
in Hitler's little living room...

1143
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,983
...and celebrating the wedding.

1144
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,451
They toasted with champagne.

1145
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:44,554
I wasn't there,
but it must have been macabre.

1146
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:47,787
There was just Goebbels, Bormann...

1147
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,897
...one of the adjutants who were left...

1148
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:54,001
...Frau Christian...

1149
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:56,865
...and of course Frau Goebbels.

1150
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:01,142
Hitler kept coming over and asking,
"Have you finished yet?"

1151
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,471
I was working as fast as I could.

1152
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,442
Then Goebbels came in.

1153
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:13,282
His face was almost covered
with tears...

1154
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,583
...with a completely bleak,
defeated expression...

1155
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:20,160
...and he said, "Frau Junge,
the F¨¹hrer has ordered me...

1156
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,318
...to leave Berlin.

1157
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,795
But I can't do it,
I am the governor of Berlin...

1158
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,795
...my place is in Berlin,
and at his side."

1159
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,728
Then he dictated an appendix
to the testament...

1160
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:35,300
...stressing that he was
in a horrible situation...

1161
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:38,275
...because he could not obey
Hitler's last order...

1162
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:43,384
...acknowledging that he would be
described as disloyal, but insisting...

1163
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,110
...he couldn't act any other way.

1164
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:48,381
He said his place was there,
and he would put an end to his life.

1165
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,185
But first, I must tell you this.

1166
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:56,423
First Goebbels told
the people of Berlin...

1167
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,793
...that their F¨¹hrer was in Berlin...

1168
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,365
...and would take charge
of defending the city.

1169
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:04,665
Because it was always the way,
wherever Hitler was...

1170
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,173
...the defenses held,
and defeat was impossible.

1171
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:15,714
That was one of the many big lies.

1172
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:20,313
Well, I wrote all that,
and then it was taken away.

1173
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:24,858
The three copies were to be sent
by three couriers:

1174
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:29,194
One to D?nitz...

1175
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:32,561
...one to Schrammer...

1176
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,099
...and I don't remember
about the third.

1177
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:39,570
Anyway, the three copies of
the testament were sent on their way.

1178
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:44,872
Then Hitler said as soon as he
received confirmation one arrived...

1179
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,808
...it would be time for him
to make his farewell.

1180
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:51,252
So we were left waiting again.

1181
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:56,586
I destroyed the carbons and
the shorthand notes, of course.

1182
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:02,726
I don't remember how
we got through that time.

1183
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:06,299
There wasn't that much left,
but it was still two days...

1184
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:07,730
...and two nights.

1185
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,670
It was a nightmare.

1186
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,169
And the children
were still in the bunker...

1187
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,475
...with Frau Goebbels wandering
around like a ghost...

1188
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,311
...with the poison in her bag.

1189
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,851
At least we only had our own
deaths to consider...

1190
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,884
...but she went through that six times.

1191
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:32,590
She couldn't talk to her children
anymore, either.

1192
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:36,456
The children had been told,
"You will have to be vaccinated...

1193
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:40,363
...because you're living so close
to Uncle Hitler...

1194
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,699
...in the bunker, where there are
lots of people."

1195
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:51,411
The oldest, Helga,
was 10 years old...

1196
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,542
...and she had such sad eyes.

1197
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:58,215
She was so quiet that I felt...

1198
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,947
...she somehow sensed
what was going on.

1199
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,848
That was awful.

1200
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,787
I simply don't remember
how we spent the last days.

1201
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:14,231
I can only remember one day,
the 30 of April...

1202
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,871
...at about lunchtime,
the children looked so lost.

1203
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,239
I said, "Didn't you have any lunch?"
"No, we're hungry."

1204
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:27,576
So I took them to a place
on the stairs...

1205
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:31,580
...between the central section of
the bunker and the F¨¹hrer's quarters...

1206
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,946
...where there was a sort of platform...

1207
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:36,556
...with a round table and a bench.

1208
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:39,383
I made some lunch for the children.

1209
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,961
Bread and butter with marmalade,
I think.

1210
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,360
They really enjoyed it...

1211
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:48,195
...and they started counting
the direct hits...

1212
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,895
...because they felt so safe
down in the bunker.

1213
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:54,634
They knew there was no danger
under 11 meters of concrete.

1214
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,642
I'm sure I remember
there was a bang...

1215
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,281
...and Helmut said,
"That was a direct hit!"

1216
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,615
And it seems to me that
was the shot when Hitler--

1217
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:13,020
Oh, I forgot, of course,
Hitler said goodbye first.

1218
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,757
That was on the 30.

1219
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,365
Suddenly Linge appeared and said:

1220
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,127
"Frau Junge and Frau Christian!"

1221
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,933
We went to the big corridor
outside Hitler's room...

1222
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,173
...and G¨¹nsche said:

1223
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:31,244
"Come here, the F¨¹hrer
wants to say farewell."

1224
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,514
I walked up to him
like a waxwork doll...

1225
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:40,053
...and he was standing there
with a completely distant expression.

1226
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,991
He had already departed
from this world.

1227
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:47,324
He shook hands with me
and gazed ahead blankly...

1228
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,488
...and then he said something
I couldn't make out.

1229
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,726
So I never understood
the last words he spoke to me.

1230
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,931
He turned round and shook hands
with Frau Christian...

1231
01:17:58,106 --> 01:17:59,505
...and Frau Manzialy.

1232
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,405
Then Eva Braun
gave me a hug and said:

1233
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:05,238
"Frau Junge, try to get back home...

1234
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,348
...and say hello to Bavaria for me."

1235
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:13,213
I should also tell you
about Eva Braun's maid, Liesl.

1236
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,686
She said to Frau Goebbels
again and again:

1237
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:20,621
"I'll take the children with me
and try to get through!"

1238
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:24,529
But Frau Goebbels just said,
"No, that's impossible.

1239
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:34,473
In a Germany,
without National Socialism...

1240
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,668
...my children would have no chance.

1241
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:39,742
I shall not expose them
to scorn and ridicule."

1242
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,209
You see, we didn't know...

1243
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,716
...we simply couldn't imagine...

1244
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,421
...what life outside would be like.

1245
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,557
We had been so isolated
all that time...

1246
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:56,426
...so cut off from real life,
from the war and everything else...

1247
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:59,395
...and we had absolutely no idea...

1248
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,059
...what would happen
after National Socialism.

1249
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:05,729
Apart from the terrible visions
Hitler had portrayed...

1250
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,532
...although they weren't at all clear.

1251
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:12,169
All the men would be castrated...

1252
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:17,284
...Germany would be completely
razed to the ground...

1253
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:21,718
...reduced to a primitive state
without any industry...

1254
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,116
...and all the women would be raped.

1255
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:27,360
They were visions from Bosch.

1256
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:32,327
I was unable to imagine
how life could continue.

1257
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,604
So Liesl set off
without the children...

1258
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,535
...and Hitler said his farewell.

1259
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:45,535
I was sitting on the stairs
with the children...

1260
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:49,115
...there was a bang,
and Helmut said:

1261
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,616
"That was a direct hit!"
And I was convinced...

1262
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,085
...that was the final shot.

1263
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:58,084
I stayed where I was,
and after a while...

1264
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,751
...Otto G¨¹nsche came up the stairs...

1265
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:04,463
...from the F¨¹hrer's bunker...

1266
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,624
...as white as a sheet...

1267
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:12,232
...and he said, "l have just obeyed
the F¨¹hrer's last order.

1268
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:14,068
I have burnt his body."

1269
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:25,375
I didn't go down
to have a look for myself.

1270
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:30,586
I went off somewhere
so I could be alone.

1271
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:37,121
There's a gap in my memory
at this point.

1272
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,527
Something was finally over.

1273
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:48,706
It's a black hole in my mind.

1274
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,476
And the first thing I remember...

1275
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:56,676
...is coming back to find the others...

1276
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,913
...and they were all sitting around
in the big corridor...

1277
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,120
...drinking and smoking.

1278
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:07,124
There was Bormann,
General Burgdorf...

1279
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:09,453
...Goebbels was still there...

1280
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:14,326
...the adjutants, Linge and G¨¹nsche.

1281
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:20,638
You know,
I felt such hatred for Hitler...

1282
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,640
...because he had abandoned us...

1283
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:26,246
...a very personal hatred...

1284
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,442
...because he had simply gone off...

1285
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:32,587
...and left us stuck in that trap.

1286
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:35,382
Suddenly the other people
hanging around...

1287
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:40,392
...were like lifeless puppets when
the person pulling the strings lets go.

1288
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,620
None of us had lives of our own.

1289
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:48,363
We all had poison in our pockets,
but that was all.

1290
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:53,907
I really had no idea
what my next step should be.

1291
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,846
Now I must have a break.

1292
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:11,118
After Hitler's death, Frau Junge
managed to escape from his bunker.

1293
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:15,059
But her attempt to reach her mother
in southern Germany failed.

1294
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,824
On June 9, 1945,
she was arrested by the Russians...

1295
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,331
...and remained their prisoner
until December 1945.

1296
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:25,667
Under house arrest, she was allowed
to work in the Charit¨¦ Hospital.

1297
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,434
With the help of an Armenian
who had served as interpreter...

1298
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,669
...during her interrogation
by Russian officers...

1299
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,609
...she managed to escape
to the Western Sector.

1300
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:37,411
In May 1946 she reached
her home in Bavaria.

1301
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,850
There she was imprisoned
by the Americans...

1302
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,786
...for three weeks
in the Starnberg Castle prison.

1303
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:47,326
After her release there was
no real interest in her story.

1304
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:51,761
In 1947 Traudl Junge, who had never
been a member of the Nazi Party...

1305
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:54,925
...was "de-nazified"
without any charges against her.

1306
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:59,904
As a so-called "juvenile fellow traveler,"
she was granted juvenile amnesty.

1307
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:03,302
In the early days after the war...

1308
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:07,346
...the past wasn't an issue,
strangely enough.

1309
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:10,583
It wasn't a subject to be discussed
in public either.

1310
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,845
And there weren't any books about it.

1311
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:16,123
In politics there wasn't yet
the process...

1312
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:18,156
...of coming to terms with the past.

1313
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:23,161
Not even the Nuremberg Trials
started that process...

1314
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,697
...the way it happened later,
in the '60s.

1315
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:28,461
I don't know exactly why, but...

1316
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:32,262
...suddenly there were
so many books.

1317
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,307
And lots of voices were raised.

1318
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,240
We heard about the SS state...

1319
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,778
...and then the diary
of Anne Frank...

1320
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:43,213
...and there were people
who had survived the whole thing.

1321
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:45,943
People who had resisted
also spoke out.

1322
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,888
The thing that made
a very strong impression on me...

1323
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:54,457
...was that after the war...

1324
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:59,166
...the world wasn't at all the way Hitler
had portrayed it...

1325
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:00,926
...and predicted it would be.

1326
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:03,932
Suddenly there was
a spirit of freedom...

1327
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,298
...and especially the Americans--

1328
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,935
I didn't get home until a year
after the occupation.

1329
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:11,578
But especially the Americans...

1330
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:14,943
...turned out to be
very good democrats...

1331
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,184
...and very helpful people.

1332
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:20,287
The care parcels started coming.
I suddenly realized...

1333
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:22,389
...that none of it was true.

1334
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:25,759
So in the early years
it didn't really occur to me...

1335
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,488
...to come to terms with my past.

1336
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:35,261
Naturally all the horrors that emerged
in the Nuremberg Trials...

1337
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,302
...about the six million Jews...

1338
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:41,499
...and people of other faiths
and beliefs...

1339
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:47,740
...who lost their lives--
All that struck me as very shocking.

1340
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,451
But I wasn't able at first
to see the connection...

1341
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:53,416
...with my own past.

1342
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:56,352
I still felt somehow content...

1343
01:24:56,524 --> 01:25:01,393
...that I had no personal guilt
and had known nothing about it.

1344
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:04,190
I had no idea of the extent
of what happened.

1345
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:06,230
But then one day...

1346
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:10,262
...I was walking past the memorial
in Franz Josef Street...

1347
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:14,775
...to Sophie Scholl,
a young girl who opposed Hitler...

1348
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,401
...and I realized that she
was the same age as me...

1349
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:23,608
...and that she was executed the
same year I started working for Hitler.

1350
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,249
At that moment...

1351
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,383
...I really sensed...

1352
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:32,048
...that it is no excuse to be young...

1353
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:38,427
...and that it might have been possible
to find out what was going on.

1354
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,901
After the war Traudl Junge worked as
a secretary at the magazine Quick...

1355
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:52,103
...as a consultant to director G. W.
Papst on his film Der letzte Akt...

1356
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,408
...about Hitler's final days,
on the staff of a literature magazine...

1357
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:56,948
...and as a science journalist.

1358
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,352
Due to severe depression
she went into early retirement.

1359
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,787
From then on she spent a large part of
her free time reading to blind people.

1360
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:06,483
On the day this film premiered
at the Berlin Film Festival...

1361
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:07,650
...on February 10, 2002...

1362
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,888
...Traudl Junge died of cancer
in a Munich hospital.

1363
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,259
Shortly before her death,
in a telephone conversation...

1364
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,697
...with Andr¨¦ Heller
and Othmar Schmiderer, she said:

1365
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:16,632
"l think I'm starting to forgive myself."
