1
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:45,797
Jesus, the days that we have seen!

2
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,882
(both chuckling)

3
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:51,886
Do you remember
since we lay all night in the windmill

4
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,097
in St. George's field?

5
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,141
No more of that, Master Shallow.

6
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,308
(Shallow laughs)

7
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,394
'Twas a merry night!

8
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,815
Is Jane Nightwork alive?

9
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,151
She lives, Master Shallow.

10
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,154
Doth she hold her own well?

11
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,739
Old.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,033
Old, Master Shallow.

13
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,828
Oh, no, she must be old.

14
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,247
She cannot choose but be old.

15
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,959
- (sighs)
- Certain she's old.

16
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:28,423
And had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork
before I came to Clement's Inn.

17
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:32,177
Jesus, the days that we have seen!

18
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,429
Ha, Sir John? Said I well?

19
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:37,432
We have heard the chimes at midnight,

20
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,100
Master Robert Shallow.

21
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:42,437
That we have! That we have! That we have!

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,439
In faith, Sir John, we have.

23
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,191
(bell tolling)

24
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:49,778
Jesus, the days that we have seen.

25
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,864
(tolling continues, fades)

26
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:05,186
NARRATOR: <i>King Richard II was murdered,</i>

27
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,482
<i>some say at the command
of the Duke Henry Bolingbroke,</i>

28
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,359
<i>in Pomfret Castle</i>

29
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,737
<i>on February the 14th, 1400.</i>

30
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,826
<i>Before this, the duke Henry
had been crowned king,</i>

31
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,454
<i>though the true heir to the realm
was Edmund Mortimer,</i>

32
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,374
<i>who was held prisoner by the Welsh rebels.</i>

33
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:30,461
<i>The new king was not hasty
to purchase his deliverance,</i>

34
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:34,757
<i>and to prove this,
Mortimer's cousins, the Percys,</i>

35
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,719
<i>came to the king unto Windsor.</i>

36
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,512
<i>There came Northumberland,</i>

37
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:42,849
<i>his son, Henry Percy, called Hotspur,</i>

38
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,517
<i>and Worcester,</i>

39
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:49,314
<i>whose purpose was ever
to procure malice and set things in a broil.</i>

40
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,775
Shall our coffers then be emptied
to redeem a traitor home?

41
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,737
- My liege ‒
- No, on the barren mountain let him starve.

42
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,739
For I shall never hold that man my friend

43
00:03:57,822 --> 00:04:02,285
whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
to ransom home revolted Mortimer.

44
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:06,497
"Revolted Mortimer"? He never did fall off
my sovereign liege but by the chance of war.

45
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,875
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,

46
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,002
unapt to stir at these indignities.

47
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:15,506
And you have found me,
for accordingly you tread upon my patience.

48
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,425
Our house, my sovereign liege,

49
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:21,679
little deserves the scourge of greatness
to be used on it.

50
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,306
And that same greatness too,

51
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,851
which our own hands have helped
to make so portly.

52
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:28,978
Worcester, get thee gone,

53
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:32,440
for I do see danger
and disobedience in thine eye.

54
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,775
My lord ‒

55
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,653
Henceforth let me not hear you
speak of Mortimer,

56
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:40,615
or you shall hear in such a kind from me
as will displease you.

57
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,033
My good lord, hear me.

58
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:45,536
My Lord Northumberland,
we license your departure.

59
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,957
With your son.

60
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,476
"Speak of Mortimer."

61
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,978
Zounds, I will speak of him.

62
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,647
And let my soul want mercy
if I do not join with him.

63
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,148
Hear you, cousin, a word.

64
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,317
Hark you, Uncle, did not King Richard

65
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:19,320
then proclaim my brother, Edmund Mortimer,
heir to the crown?

66
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,947
NORTHUMBERLAND:
He did. Myself did hear it.

67
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,867
Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king that
wished him on the barren mountains starve.

68
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:28,997
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
or fill up chronicles in time to come,

69
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,499
that men of your nobility and power

70
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,335
did gage them both in an unjust behalf ‒

71
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,255
as both of you, God pardon it, have done ‒

72
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,925
to put down Richard,
that sweet, lovely rose,

73
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,344
and plant this thorn,
this canker Bolingbroke?

74
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,512
Peace, cousin.

75
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,514
By heavens, methinks it were an easy leap

76
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,142
to pluck bright honor
from the pale-faced moon

77
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:53,604
or dive into the bottom of the deep where
fathom line could never touch the ground,

78
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,357
and pluck up drowned honor by the locks.

79
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,776
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

80
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,655
Farewell, kinsman. I'll talk to you
when you are better tempered to attend.

81
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:05,575
Why, look, you, I am whipped
and scourged with rods,

82
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:10,580
nettled and stung with pismires when I hear
of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.

83
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,373
In Richard's time ‒

84
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,917
What do you call the place
where I first bowed my knee

85
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,212
unto this king of smiles,
this Bolingbroke?

86
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,382
'Sblood! When you and he
came back from Ravenspurgh!

87
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,093
- At Berkeley Castle.
- Ah! You say true.

88
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:29,348
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
this fawning greyhound then did proffer me.

89
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,935
"Look, gentle Harry Percy."
And "Kind cousin."

90
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,480
Ah! The devil take such cozeners!

91
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,734
(bell tolling, faint)

92
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,446
God forgive me.
Good uncle, tell your tale, for I have done.

93
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,741
Nay, if you have not, to it again.
We will stay your leisure.

94
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,659
I've done, i'faith.

95
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,580
You, my lord, shall secretly
into the bosom creep

96
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:56,125
of that same noble prelate well-beloved,
the archbishop.

97
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,627
York, is it not?

98
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,129
I smell it. Upon my life, it will do well.

99
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,840
And then the powers of Scotland and of York
to join with Mortimer's.

100
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,467
And so they shall.

101
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,304
Brother, farewell. No further go in this
than I by letter shall direct our course.

102
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,765
Farewell, good brother.
We shall thrive, I trust.

103
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:15,269
All studies here I solemnly defy,
save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke

104
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:18,147
and that same sword-and-buckler
Prince of Wales.

105
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,818
But that I think his father loves him not and
would be glad he met with some mischance,

106
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,945
I would have him poisoned
with a pot of ale.

107
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,280
- (bell tolling)
- (whistles)

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,283
(laughing)

109
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,662
(kisses, continues laughing)

110
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,085
Where's Falstaff?

111
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,797
- Fast asleep.
- And snoring like a horse.

112
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,637
I picked his pocket.

113
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,347
- (Falstaff snoring)
- (whispering) What hast thou found?

114
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,432
Nothing but this, my lord.

115
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,896
(snoring continues)

116
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,904
- (Falstaff snorts)
- (laughs)

117
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,490
FALSTAFF: How now, Hal?
What time of day is it, lad?

118
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:13,703
What the devil hast thou to do
with the time of day?

119
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,164
Unless hours were cups of sack,

120
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,834
clocks the tongues of bawds,
dials the signs of leaping houses

121
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,838
and the blessed sun himself
a fair, hot wench in flame-colored taffeta,

122
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,674
I see no reason
why thou shouldst be so superfluous

123
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,801
as to demand the time of the day.

124
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,803
Indeed you come near me now, Hal,

125
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:35,725
for we that take purses go by the moon.

126
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,062
How now! Who picked me pocket?

127
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:43,816
Hostess! Hostess!

128
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,777
- Sir John!
- I fell asleep here and had me pocket picked!

129
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:50,031
- (laughing)
- You think I keep thieves in my house?

130
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,575
My lord, I pray you, hear me!

131
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,702
Go to! I know you well enough!

132
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,079
- I know you, Sir John.
- (grumbles)

133
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,040
You owe me money, Sir John,

134
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:02,293
and now you pick a quarrel with me
to beguile me of it.

135
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,712
FALSTAFF:
This house is turned bawdy house!

136
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,881
- Bawdy house?
- Picked me pocket!

137
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,009
(all laughing)

138
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:13,804
We cannot lodge and board
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen

139
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,474
who live honestly
by the prick of their needles,

140
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,726
but it's thought we keep a bawdy house!

141
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,436
(laughing continues)

142
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,107
Shall I not take my knees in mine inn,
but I shall have my pocket picked?

143
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,318
You owe me money, Sir John!

144
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,070
What didst thou lose, Jack?

145
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,739
Wilt thou believe me, Hal? Some 40 pounds.

146
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,574
- What?
- (grunts)

147
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:39,372
And a gold seal ring of me grandfather's
worth some 40 mark.

148
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:42,083
You owe mine hostess money, Jack.

149
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,377
You lost the reckoning.

150
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,421
Item: a capon, two shillings and tuppence.

151
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:52,260
Item: sauce, fourpence. Item: sack,
two gallons, five shillings and eightpence.

152
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:55,930
Item: anchovies and sack after supper,
two and sixpence.

153
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,640
Item: bread, ha'pence.

154
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,810
- O monstrous.
- Hostess, come.

155
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,854
Thou must not be in this humor with me.

156
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,690

Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing,

being governed as the sea is,

under whose countenance we steal.

being wanted he may be more wondered at.

00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,835
(whispering)
I've removed Falstaff's horse.

309
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,296
(both laughing)

310
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:11,508
(grumbles) If I go four foot further afoot,
I shall break me wind.

311
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,510
(laughing continues)

312
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,721
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further!

313
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,931
Peace, you fat guts!
What a brawling dost thou keep!

314
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,850
- Lie down!
- Lie down?

315
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,020
Lay thine ear close to the ground

316
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,939
and list if thou can hear the tread of travelers.

317
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,442
Have you any levers to lift me up again,
being down?

318
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,862
- (laughing)
- They come! They come!

319
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:36,325
I prithee, good Prince Hal,
help me to my horse, good king's son.

320
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,951
Shall I be your ostler?

321
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,538
Go hang thyself
in thine own heir-apparent garters.

322
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,626
Now, lads. Come.

323
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:50,005
MAN: Come, neighbor.
The boy shall lead our horses.

324
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,717
We'll walk afoot a while
and ease our legs.

325
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,387
(all mumbling nonsense chant)

326
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,310
(mumbling continues)

327
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,479
(both laughing)

328
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,856
- Strike!
- Down with them!

329
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,067
- Cut the villains' throats!
- Down with them!

330
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,027
- MAN: Please stop!
- (horse whinnying)

331
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,780
- Bind them!
- Where are our disguises?

332
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,574
(Falstaff shouting)
Young man must live!

333
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,081
- (shouting continues)
- (horses whinnying)

334
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,087
(laughing) Come. Come.

335
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,560
Come, my masters. Let us share.

336
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,521
The prince and Poins
be not two errant cowards.

337
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,897
There's no equity stirring.

338
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,693
There's no more valor in that Poins
than in a wild duck.

339
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,112
(Hal, Poins shouting)

340
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,501
(shouting continues)

341
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:13,046
(grunting, shouting)

342
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,759
Jesus!

343
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,137
The thieves are scattered!

344
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,222
(Hal, Poins laughing)

345
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,100
- Each takes his fellow for an officer.
- Away, good Ned!

346
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,394
HAL: Falstaff sweats to death

347
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,521
and lards the lean earth
as he walks along.

348
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,231
POINS: How the rogue roared!

349
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,109
HAL: Were it not for laughing,
I should pity him!

350
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,905
(men murmuring)

351
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:41,074
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?

352
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,492
(murmuring quiets)

353
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,953
'Tis full three months
since I did see him last.

354
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:48,040
- My liege!
- Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?

355
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,208
I have, my liege.

356
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:54,504
Then you perceive the body of our kingdom,
how foul it is, what rank diseases grow.

357
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,007
They say young Percy and Lord Worcester
are 50,000 strong.

358
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,508
(murmuring resumes)

359
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,636
Here is Sir Walter Blunt, my lord,
new lighted from his horse.

360
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,262
My liege, Northumberland lies sick,

361
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:05,557
but a great power of English and of Scots
follow young Henry Percy.

362
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,769
Yea, there thou mak'st me sad

363
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,687
and mak'st me sin in envy

364
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:15,275
that my Lord Northumberland
should be the father to so blest a son.

365
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,861
A son that is the theme of honor's tongue.

366
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:22,950
Whilst I, in looking on the praise of him,
see riot and dishonor stain the brow

367
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,660
of my young Harry.

368
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,580
O, that it could be proved
that some night-tripping fairy

369
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:32,542
had exchanged in cradle clothes
our children where they lay.

370
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,337
Then would I have his Harry

371
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,589
and he mine.

372
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,633
Where does the Prince of Wales?

373
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,760
We do not know, my lord.

374
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,846
I would to God, my lords,
he could be found.

375
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:51,311
Inquire at London
'mongst the taverns there,

376
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,439
for there, they say, he daily doth frequent

377
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:57,275
with unrestrained, loose companions.

378
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,320
Even such, they say,
as stand in narrow lanes

379
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,823
and beat our watch and rob our passengers,

380
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:07,035
which he, young, wanton and effeminate boy,
takes on the point of honor

381
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,162
to support so dissolute a crew.

382
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,757
Got with much ease! (laughs)

383
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,595
The virtue of this jest will be
the incomprehensible lies

384
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,973
this same fat rogue will tell us now ‒

385
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,975
how 30 at least he fought with,

386
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,894
what wards, what blows ‒
(laughing continues)

387
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:36,106
what extremities he endured!

388
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,858
(groaning)

389
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,277
A plague on all cowards!

390
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,363
(groaning continues)

391
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,709
A plague on all cowards, still say I.

392
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,377
And a vengeance too.

393
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,962
Give me a cup of sack.

394
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,964
How now, Jack! Where hast thou been?

395
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,550
A plague on all cowards!

396
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,552
FALSTAFF: Go thy ways, old Jack.

397
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,220
Die when I wilt.

398
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,308
If manhood, good manhood,
be not forgot upon the face of the earth,

399
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,268
then I'm a shotten herring.

400
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,854
There lives not three good men
unhanged in England,

401
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,899
and one of them is fat and grows old,
God help the while.

402
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,693
How now, woolsack?

403
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,779
- A king's son.
- (bells pealing)

404
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:27,908
If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom
with a dagger of lath

405
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,203
and drive all thy subjects afore thee
like a flock of wild geese,

406
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:34,956
I'll never wear hair on me face more,
you Prince of Wales.

407
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,919
- Why, you whoreson round man!
- POINS: You fat guts!

408
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,420
What's the matter?

409
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,256
Are you not a coward?
Answer that! And Poins there.

410
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,093
Call me coward? You fat paunch!

411
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,638
I call thee coward? I'll see thee damned
ere I call thee coward.

412
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,808
But I'd give a thousand pounds
if I could run as fast as thou canst.

413
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,518
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

414
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,813
There be four of us here
have ta'en a thousand pound this morning.

415
00:23:57,896 --> 00:23:59,815
A thousand pound? Where is it?

416
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:03,652
- Where is it, Jack?
- Where is it? Taken from us, it is.

417
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:07,155
- A hundred upon poor four of us.
- What, a hundred men?

418
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,908
I was at half-sword with a dozen of them
two hours together.

419
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,576
I have 'scaped by a miracle.

420
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,913
I am eight times thrust through the doublet,
four through the hose,

421
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,998
my buckler cut through and through,

422
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,459
my sword hacked like a handsaw!

423
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,461
<i>Ecce signum</i>. Let them speak.

424
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:24,047
- Speak, sirs!
- We four set upon some dozen.

425
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,465
Sixteen, at least.

426
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,386
And bound them. And as we were sharing,
some six or seven fresh men set upon us.

427
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,430
- What, fought you with them all?
- All? I know not what you call "all."

428
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,517
But if I fought not with 50 of them,
then I'm a bunch of radish.

429
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,645
If there were not 50 upon poor old Jack,
then I'm no two-legged creature.

430
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,231
Pray God
you have not murdered some of them.

431
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,818
Nay, that's... past praying for.

432
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,071
I have peppered two of them.
Two I'm sure I've paid for.

433
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:50,157
Two rogues in buckram cloaks.

434
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,661
I tell thee what, Hal ‒ I tell thee a lie,
spit in me face, call me "horse."

435
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:59,332
Thus I bore me point. Four rogues
in buckram cloaks let drive at me.

436
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,335
- Four?
- Four? Thou said but two even now.

437
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,045
Four, Hal. I told thee four.

438
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,632
These four came all afront
and mainly thrust at me.

439
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:12,429
I made me no more ado but took
all seven of their points in me target, thus.

440
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,682
Seven? Why, there were
but four even now.

441
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:19,603
- Uh, in buckram?
- Aye. Four in buckram cloaks.

442
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,439
Seven, by these hilts,
or I'm a villain else!

443
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,234
(whispers)
Let him alone. We shall have more anon.

444
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,028
Dost thou hear me, Hal?

445
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,489
- Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
- Do so, for it is worth the listening to.

446
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,701
These, uh, nine in buckram
that I told thee of ‒

447
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:35,869
Two more already.

448
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,038
began to give me ground.

449
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,208
I followed me close,
came in, foot and hand,

450
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:45,378
and with a thought,
seven of the 11 I paid.

451
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,380
(murmuring) O monstrous!
Eleven buckram men grown out of two.

452
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:51,760
But as the devil would have it,
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green

453
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,638
came at me back and let drive at me.

454
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,724
For it was so dark, Hal,
I couldst not see the hand.

455
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:01,937
These lies are like their father
that begets them.

456
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,274
Why, thou clay-brained guts,
thou knotty-pated fool,

457
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,818
thou whoreson obscene,
greasy tallow-catch!

458
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,071
Art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?

459
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,782
Why, how couldst thou know
these men in Kendal green

460
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:17,077
when it was so dark
thou couldst not see thy hand?

461
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,913
Come, tell us your reason!
What sayest thou to this?

462
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,498
Come, your reason, Jack. Your reason.

463
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,083
Upon compulsion?

464
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,378
Zounds, and I were at the strappado
or all the racks of the world,

465
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,963
I would not tell you on compulsion.

466
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,340
I'll be no longer guilty of this sin!

467
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,760
This sanguine coward,
this horseback-breaker,

468
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,428
this huge hill of flesh ‒

469
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,555
'Sblood, you starveling,

470
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:41,643
you eel-skin, you dried neat's tongue,
you stockfish!

471
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,312
O for breath to utter what is like to thee!

472
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,691
You tailor's yardstick,
you sheath, you bowcase,

473
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,944
you vile standing tuck!

474
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,822
Well, breathe a while,
and then to it again.

475
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,782
Yet hear me speak but this.

476
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,576
We two saw you four set on four.

477
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,871
Mark now how a plain tale
shall put you down.

478
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,916
And, Falstaff, you carried yourself away

479
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,795
as nimbly, with as quick dexterity
and roared for mercy,

480
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,673
and still run and roared
as ever I heard bullcalf.

481
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,676
What a slave to hack thy sword
and say it was in fight.

482
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,637
What trick, what device,
what starting hole canst thou now find out

483
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,639
to hide thee from this open
and apparent shame?

484
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:22,434
Come, Jack. Let's hear.
What trick hast thou now?

485
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,189
By the Lord, lads,
I know you as well as he that made you.

486
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,859
- (both laughing)
- Was it for me to kill the heir apparent?

487
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,861
Should I turn upon the true prince?

488
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:36,948
Thou knowest I'm as valiant as Hercules,
but beware instinct.

489
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:41,202
The lion will not touch the true prince.
I was now a coward upon instinct.

490
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,122
By the Lord, lads,
I'm glad you have the money.

491
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,999
HOSTESS: My lord the prince!

492
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:49,836
There's a nobleman of the court at the door.
He would speak with you!

493
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,173
- How now, my lady hostess?
- He says he comes from your father.

494
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:57,177
Give him as much as will make him a royal man
and send him back again to my mother.

495
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,554
- (laughs)
- What manner of man is he?

496
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,181
(laughs) An old man.

497
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:04,017
What does gravity out of his bed at midnight?

498
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,894
- Shall I give him his answer?
- Prithee do, Ned.

499
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,355
Clap to the doors.
Watch tonight, pray tomorrow.

500
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:11,191
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold!

501
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:15,028
What, shall we be merry?
Shall we have a play extempore?

502
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,446
A play?

503
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,407
Thou will be horribly cheered when
thou com'st to thy father in the morning.

504
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,326
And thou lovest me, practice an answer.

505
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,244
Do thou stand for my father?

506
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,372
(chuckles) Gents.

507
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:29,209
This chair shall be me state,
this cushion my crown.

508
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,294
(laughing)

509
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:42,055
(laughing continues)

510
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,610
Here was Sir Thomas Bracy from your father.
There's villainous news abroad.

511
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,946
- That same mad fellow of the North ‒
- Percy?

512
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,907
He that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast,

513
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,411
washes his hands and says to his wife,
"Fie upon this quiet life. I want work!"

514
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,746
Hal, could the world pick you out
such an enemy again

515
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,748
as that fiend Percy,
the Hotspur of the North?

516
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,251
Does not thy blood thrill of it?
Art not thou horrible afeared?

517
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,045
Not a whit, i'faith.
I lack some of thy instinct.

518
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:17,090
(laughing continues)

519
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,759
Give me a cup of sack
to make the eyes look red

520
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:22,971
that it may be thought I have wept,
for I must speak in a passion.

521
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,432
- (laughing continues)
- (dogs barking)

522
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,024
(grunting)

523
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,118
Harry!

524
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:51,124
I do not only marvel
where thou spendest thy time,

525
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,460
but also how thou art accompanied.

526
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:58,673
(laughing) He doth it just like one
of these harlotry players, as ever I see!

527
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,843
Peace, good pint pot.
Peace, good tickle-brain.

528
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,846
That thou art my son
I have partly thy mother's word,

529
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,598
partly mine own opinion,

530
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,808
but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye

531
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:13,062
and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip
that doth warrant me.

532
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,941
If then thou be a son to me,
here lies the point!

533
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,486
Why, being son to me,
art thou so pointed at?

534
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,822
There is a thing, Harry, which thou
hast heard of by the name of pitch.

535
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,950
Pitch doth defile.
So doth the company thou keepest.

536
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,535
(whimpers)

537
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:32,457
And yet there is a virtuous man
who I have often noted in thy company,

538
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,167
but I know not his name.

539
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,212
What manner of man,
and it like Your Majesty?

540
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:40,715
A goodly, portly man, i'faith,
and a corpulent,

541
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,802
of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye
and a most noble carriage.

542
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,846
And, as I think, his age some 50 ‒

543
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,140
- (Hal hoots)
- Or by'r lady, inclining to threescore.

544
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,851
And now I remember me, his name ‒

545
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,353
Falstaff!

546
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,939
If that man should be lewdly given,
he deceiveth me,

547
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,608
for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks.

548
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,777
Him keep with!

549
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,363
The rest... banish.

550
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:06,407
Dost thou speak like a king?
Do thou stand for me?

551
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,285
- (laughter, applause)
<i>- I'll</i> play my father!

552
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,371
- Depose me?
- (laughs)

553
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,500
HAL: Here I am set.
FALSTAFF: And here I stand.

554
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,294
- Now, Harry, whence comes you?
- My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

555
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,881
(wails) The complaints
I hear of thee are grievous.

556
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,508
'Sblood, my lord, they are false!

557
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,718
(mutters) Nay, I'll tickle ye
for a young prince.

558
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:29,597
HAL: There is a devil haunts thee
in the likeness of an old, fat man.

559
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,725
A tun of man is thy companion.

560
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,728
Why dost thou converse
with that trunk of humors,

561
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,565
that bolting-hutch of beastliness,

562
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,650
that swollen parcel of dropsies,

563
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:44,153
that huge bombard of sack,
that stuffed cloakbag,

564
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,947
that roasted Manningtree ox,

565
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,659
that reverend Vice, that gray iniquity,
that father ruffian,

566
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,287
that vanity in years?

567
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:56,207
Wherein is he good,
but to taste sack and drink it?

568
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,711
Wherein neat and cleanly,
but to carve a capon and eat it?

569
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:03,506
Wherein cunning, but in craft?
Wherein crafty, but in villainy?

570
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,758
Wherein villainous, but in all things?

571
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,927
Wherein worthy, but in nothing?

572
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,638
(laughing continues)

573
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,682
I would Your Grace would take me with you.

574
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,183
Who means Your Grace?

575
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:17,103
That villainous, abominable
misleader of youth!

576
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,938
- Falstaff!
- Falstaff!

577
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:22,358
That old, white-bearded Satan.

578
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,570
- My lord, the man I know.
- I know thou dost.

579
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,615
But to say I know more harm in him
than I know in myself

580
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,658
- (knocking)
- is to say more than I know.

581
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,952
That he is old, the more's the pity.

582
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,121
His white hairs do witness it.

583
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:40,043
But that he is, saving your reverence,
an old Satan, that I utterly deny!

584
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,794
(knocking continues)

585
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:45,965
If sack and sugar be a fault,
then God help the wicked!

586
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,426
If to be old and merry be a sin,

587
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,137
then many an old host that I know
is damned.

588
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,808
And if to be fat is to be hated,
then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved.

589
00:32:55,892 --> 00:33:00,355
No, my good lord, banish Peto,
banish Bardolph, banish Poins,

590
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:02,815
but for sweet Jack Falstaff,

591
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,026
kind Jack Falstaff,

592
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,028
true Jack Falstaff,

593
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,530
- valiant Jack Falstaff ‒
- (laughing)

594
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:13,242
and therefore more valiant being,
as he is, old Jack Falstaff,

595
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,370
banish not him thy Harry's company.

596
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,331
Banish not him thy Harry's company.

597
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:22,710
Banish plump Jack,
and banish all the world.

598
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:24,962
- (laughter, applause)
- I do!

599
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:28,591
I will.

600
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,678
- O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
- What's the matter?

601
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,680
The sheriff and all the watch
are at the door!

602
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,682
Play out the play. Play out the play!

603
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:39,060
I have much to say
on behalf of that Falstaff.

604
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,895
(women screaming)

605
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,124
(dogs barking)

606
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:15,054
Go hide thee, Jack. Now, my masters,
for a true face and a good conscience.

607
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,598
Both of which I have had,
but their date is out.

608
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,892
Therefore, I'll hide me.

609
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,985
- Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
- (clears throat)

610
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,570
Pardon me, my lord.

611
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,781
A hue and cry have followed
certain men into this house.

612
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,909
- What men?
- One of them is well known, my gracious lord.

613
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,747
- A gross, fat man.
- As fat as butter!

614
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,666
The man, I do assure you, is not here.

615
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,628
And so, let me entreat you leave the house.

616
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,006
I will, my lord.

617
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,551
(laughing)

618
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:54,927
(bells pealing)

619
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:58,431
There are two gentlemen
have in this robbery lost 300 marks.

620
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:01,517
If he have robbed these men,
he shall be answerable.

621
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,270
And so farewell.

622
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,230
Good night, my noble lord.

623
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,447
(dogs barking)

624
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,201
I'll to the court in the morning.
We must all to the walls.

625
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,455
Good night, my noble lord.

626
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,040
(groans)

627
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,502
I think it be good morrow, is it not?

628
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:31,130
Indeed, my lord. I think it be 2:00.

629
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,429
FALSTAFF:
We must all to the wars, eh, lad?

630
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:42,141
- Hostess, my breakfast!
- You owe me money, Sir John!

631
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:45,186
And money lent you, four and 20 pounds.

632
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,979
Oh, you thing.

633
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:50,650
What thing? I am no thing.
I am an honest man's wife.

634
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,778
And setting thy knighthood aside,
thou art a knave to call me so.

635
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:57,532
Setting thy womanhood aside,
thou art a beast to say otherwise.

636
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,867
- (laughing)
- Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?

637
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,870
What beast? Why... an otter.

638
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,498
An otter, Sir John? Why an otter?

639
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:09,085
O, she's neither fish nor flesh.
A man knows not where to have her.

640
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,338
O, thou art an unjust man for saying so!

641
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,967
Thou or any man knows
where to have me, thou knave, thou!

642
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,053
Thou sayest true, Hostess,
and he slanders thee most grossly.

643
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:23,432
So he doth you, my lord,
and said you owed him a thousand pounds.

644
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:26,018
Jack, do I owe thee a thousand pounds?

645
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,938
A thousand pounds, Hal? A million.

646
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,023
Thy love is worth a million.

647
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,568
Thou owest me thy love.

648
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,194
(laughing)

649
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:39,031
Well, my sweet beef,
I must still be good angel to thee.

650
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:42,451
My lord, he called you a jack
and a sneak-cup

651
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:43,995
and said he would cudgel you.

652
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:47,415
- Darest thou be as good as thy word now?
- Well, Hal, as a man I dare.

653
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,208
But as a prince,

654
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:52,628
I fear thee as I fear
the roaring of a lion's whelp.

655
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,674
- And why not as the lion?
- The king himself is to be feared as the lion.

656
00:36:56,757 --> 00:37:00,845
Dost though think that I'll fear thee
as I fear thy father?

657
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:06,559
The money shall be paid back again,
with advantage.

658
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:10,062
I like not that paying back.
'Tis a double labor.

659
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,690
Thou whoreson...

660
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:17,320
- little, tidy Bartholomew boar-pig.
- How now, Doll.

661
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,407
Come.

662
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,993
I'll be friends with thee, Jack.

663
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:26,120
Thou art going to the wars,

664
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,915
and whether I shall ever
see thee again or not,

665
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,958
there's nobody cares.

666
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:34,045
(hoofbeats)

667
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,007
(bell tolling)

668
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,929
Hal!

669
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,973
Farewell, blown Jack!

670
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:48,935
Farewell, All-hallown summer!

671
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:51,270
(bell continues tolling)

672
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:54,565
Percy, Northumberland,
the Archbishop's grace of York,

673
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:56,484
Douglas, Mortimer...

674
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,362
capitulate against us and are up.

675
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,282
But wherefore do I tell this news to thee.

676
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:08,454
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
base inclination and the start of spleen,

677
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,374
to fight against me under Percy's pay,

678
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,585
to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,

679
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:17,296
to show how much thou art degenerate.

680
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,855
Lords, give us leave.

681
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:39,568
The Prince of Wales and I
must have some needful conference alone.

682
00:38:57,086 --> 00:39:00,172
I know not whether God will have it so

683
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,800
that in his secret doom,

684
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:06,512
out of my blood he'll breed revengement

685
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:10,474
and a scourge for me
to punish my mistreadings.

686
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,270
Tell me else.

687
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:18,274
Could such inordinate and low desires,

688
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:22,611
such barren pleasures, rude society,

689
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:24,613
accompany the greatness of thy blood?

690
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:25,865
So please Your Majesty ‒

691
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,659
Had I so lavish of my presence been,

692
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:31,203
so stale and cheap to vulgar company,

693
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:35,291
opinion, that did help me to the crown,

694
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,877
had left me in reputeless banishment.

695
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,296
(bell tolling)

696
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:44,633
The skipping king, he ambled up and down,
with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits

697
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:47,511
mingled his royalty with capering fools,

698
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:50,306
grew a companion to the common streets.

699
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,558
So when he had occasion to be seen,

700
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:56,562
he was but as the cuckoo is in June,
heard, not regarded ‒

701
00:39:56,645 --> 00:40:01,358
seen, but with such eyes
as sick and blunted with community,

702
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,320
afford no extraordinary gaze,

703
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,989
such as is bent on sunlike majesty.

704
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:12,161
And in that very line, Harry, stands thou.

705
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:15,581
For thou has lost thy princely privilege

706
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,084
with vile participation.

707
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:22,421
Not an eye but is aweary
of thy common sight,

708
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,590
save mine,

709
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,468
that hath desired to see thee more.

710
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,097
I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,
be more myself.

711
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,142
Harry, for all the world
as thou art to this hour was Richard then,

712
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:38,270
when I from France
set foot in Ravenspurgh.

713
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:42,483
And even as I was then is Percy now.

714
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:45,444
Now, by my scepter and my soul to boot,

715
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:48,405
he hath more worthy interest
to the state than thou.

716
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,074
Do not think so!

717
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,703
You shall not find it so.

718
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,624
I will redeem all this on Percy's head

719
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:03,587
and, in the closing of some glorious day,
be bold to tell you that I am your son.

720
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,631
And that shall be the day,
whene'er it lights,

721
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:11,303
that this same child of honor and renown,
this gallant Hotspur, this all-praisèd knight,

722
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:14,807
and your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.

723
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,144
Then will I make this Northern youth
exchange his glorious deeds

724
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,146
for my indignities!

725
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,981
This in the name of God...

726
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,024
I promise here.

727
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,153
The Earl of Westmoreland sets forth today.

728
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:30,239
On Wednesday next, Harry,
you shall set forth.

729
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,408
Our hands are full of business.
Let's away.

730
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,494
(bells tolling)

731
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,255
(onlookers gasping)

732
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:50,676
(chattering, laughing)

733
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:53,929
Pish!

734
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,849
"Pish" for thee,
thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland.

735
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,350
We must to the wars together.

736
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:01,353
Why the devil should we keep knives
to cut one another's throats?

737
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:04,023
O viper vile, now Pistol's cock is up.

738
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,733
And flashing fire will follow.

739
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:09,653
Pistol, pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting.

740
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,615
- Base is the slave that pays.
- Shog off!

741
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:22,374
(excited shouting)

742
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:26,962
(cackling, chattering)

743
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:31,717
What's he that goes there?

744
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,054
- Falstaff, an't please Your Lordship.
- He that is in question for the robbery?

745
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:36,263
DOLL: Jack!

746
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,352
My Lord Chief Justice.

747
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:46,190
I heard say Your Lordship was sick.
I hope Your Lordship goes abroad by advice.

748
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:50,069
Your Lordship, while not
clean past his youth, has yet some...

749
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:54,740
smack of age in him,
some relish of the saltness of time.

750
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:59,912
I most humbly beseech Your Lordship
to have a reverent care of your health.

751
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:01,288
Ah, my Lord Westmoreland.

752
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:04,833
I heard say Your Lordship
had already been at Shrewsbury.

753
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:07,753
- 'Tis more than time I were there, and you too.
- What, the king encamped?

754
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,339
He is, Sir John.
I fear we should all stay too long.

755
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:15,177
Sir John, methinks your soldiers
are exceeding poor and bare.

756
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,471
No eye has seen such scarecrows.

757
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:21,016
FALSTAFF: If I'm not ashamed of me soldiers,
I'm a sous'd gurnet.

758
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,769
I've misused the king's purse damnably.

759
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,980
I pressed me none but good householders.

760
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:27,982
They've bought out their services,

761
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,776
and now me whole charge consists
of younger sons to younger brothers,

762
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:34,780
revolted tapsters and ostlers trade-fallen,

763
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:37,783
the cankers of a calm world
and a long peace.

764
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:41,245
- We must away all night, Falstaff.
- The king, I can tell you, looks for us all.

765
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,414
- Goes the prince with you?
- The prince?

766
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,541
You follow him up and down
like his ill angel.

767
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:49,628
- Falstaff, you have misled the youthful prince.
- The young prince has misled me.

768
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:51,463
The truth is, you live in great infamy.

769
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:54,300
Your means are very slender,
and your waste is great.

770
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,635
I would it were otherwise.

771
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,596
I would my means were greater
and my waist slender.

772
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,350
There is not a white hair on your face
but should have his effect on gravity.

773
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:06,312
His effect on gravy, gravy, gravy.

774
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:10,524
My lords, you that are old consider not
the capacities of us that are young.

775
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:11,859
Falstaff!

776
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:14,778
You do measure the heat of our livers
with the bitterness of your galls.

777
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,989
Do you set down <i>your</i> name
in the scroll of youth?

778
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:19,450
You that are written down old
with all the characters of age?

779
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,119
Have you not a moist eye,
a dry hand, a yellow cheek?

780
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,620
- A white beard?
- A decreasing leg?

781
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:26,332
- An increasing belly?
- Is not your voice broken, your wind short?

782
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:27,958
- Your chin doubled?
- Your wit singled?

783
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:32,713
And every part about you blasted with antiquity?
And will you yet call yourself young?

784
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:36,925
My lord, I was born about 3:00 in the afternoon
with a white head and something a round belly.

785
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:40,262
My voice, I've lost it
with hallowing and singing of anthems.

786
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:43,599
Sir John, Sir John,
you loiter here too long,

787
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:46,769
being as we're to take
more soldiers in counties as we go.

788
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,937
On, Corporal Nym.

789
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,734
Well, be honest, be honest,
and God bless your expedition.

790
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,528
Could Your Grace lend me a thousand pound
to furnish me forth?

791
00:44:56,612 --> 00:45:00,032
Not a penny. Not a penny. Fare you well.

792
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,368
- My lord?
- Not a penny.

793
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:05,371
Bardolph, go thee before
and fetch me a bottle of sack.

794
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:07,790
Will you give me money, Captain?

795
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,877
Well, God send the prince
a better companion.

796
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,379
(Falstaff laughs)

797
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:16,048
God send the companion a better prince!

798
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:17,883
How now!

799
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:22,554
The Earl of Westmoreland, 7,000 strong,
is marching hitherwards. With him, Prince John.

800
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,264
No harm. What more?

801
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:26,475
Further, we have learned
the king himself in person is set forth.

802
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,061
He shall be welcome too.

803
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,604
Where is his son,

804
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,899
the nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,

805
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:37,069
and his comrades
that daffed the world aside and bid it pass?

806
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:38,779
All furnished, all in arms.

807
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:42,199
For God's sake, cousin,
stay till all come in.

808
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:45,953
O gentlemen, the time of life is short.

809
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,997
To spend that shortness basely
were too long

810
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,918
if life did ride upon a dial's point,
still ending at the arrival of an hour.

811
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,964
And if we live, we live to tread on kings.

812
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,426
If die,

813
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:03,929
brave death when princes die with us.

814
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:05,264
Justice Shallow?

815
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:09,184
I am Robert Shallow, sir,
a poor esquire of this county

816
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:11,645
and one of the king's
justices of the peace.

817
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,856
My captain commends him to you.

818
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:16,316
My captain, sir, Sir John Falstaff,

819
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,653
a tall gentleman, by heaven,
and a most gallant leader.

820
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:23,490
He greets me well, sir.
He greets me well, sir!

821
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:26,368
- Davy?
- He's come hither.

822
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:29,163
- (stammering)
- Let me see. Let me see. Where's the roll?

823
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:31,290
- The soldiers.
- Mmm!

824
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:35,711
Use these men well, Davy, for they
are arrant knaves and will backbite.

825
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:39,298
No worse than they are backbitten, sir,
for they have marvelous foul linen.

826
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:41,383
Oh, well conceited, Davy!

827
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:44,470
Look. Here comes Sir John.
About thy business, Davy.

828
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:46,138
Give me your good hand!

829
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:49,475
Give me Your Worship's good hand!

830
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:51,185
Welcome, good Sir John.

831
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:54,354
Good master Robert Shallow.
I'm glad to see you well.

832
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:56,857
'Fore God, you have here
a goodly dwelling and a rich, rich...

833
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,484
Oh, barren, barren, barren.

834
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,486
Nay, you shall see my orchard

835
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:04,990
where, in an arbor, we will eat
a last year's pippin of my own grafting.

836
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,658
With a dish of caraways!

837
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:12,414
Have you provided me here
with a half a dozen... sufficient... men?

838
00:47:12,498 --> 00:47:13,999
We have! We have, sir.

839
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,792
Come, sir. Will you sit?

840
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:18,378
Let me see, let me see. Where's the roll?

841
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:20,005
Davy!

842
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,468
Robert Shallow. (chuckles)

843
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:27,804
I remember him at Clement's Inn

844
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,808
like a man made after supper
of a cheese-paring.

845
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:34,728
When 'a was naked, he was,
for all the world, like a forked radish,

846
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:37,105
with a head fantastically
carved upon it with a knife.

847
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:41,318
Was the very genius of famine,
yet lecherous as a monkey.

848
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:45,280
And now is this vice's dagger
become a squire,

849
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,409
and has lands and beeves.

850
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:51,078
Hmm.

851
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,455
Well, I'll be acquainted with him.

852
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,582
I will use him well, Davy,

853
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:59,253
for a friend in the court
is better than a penny in the purse.

854
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,255
Let me see, let me see.

855
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:04,758
(stammering)
Let them appear as you call, cousin.

856
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:08,804
Master Surecard, as I think?

857
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,597
- Silence!
- (stammering)

858
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:14,059
Oh, Sir John, it is my cousin Silence,
in commission with me.

859
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:17,271
Master Silence, it well befits you
should be of the peace.

860
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:20,232
The same, Sir John.
The very same. (chuckles)

861
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:21,984
- (grumbles)
- Your g ‒

862
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:25,404
good... worship is w-w ‒

863
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:28,240
Ah, I see him break Scoggin's head

864
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:29,908
at the court-gate,

865
00:48:29,992 --> 00:48:32,578
when 'a was a crack not thus high.

866
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:34,746
And the very same day did I fight

867
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:38,584
with one Sampson Stockfish,
a fruiterer, behind Gray's Inn.

868
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,919
O Jesu, Jesu!

869
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:43,171
- The mad days that I have seen.
- (Falstaff chuckles)

870
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:48,010
Master Silence.
Let me see your men, Master Silence.

871
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:51,138
Let them appear as you call, cousin.
Let them do so. Let them do so.

872
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:54,266
(stuttering) M ‒ M ‒ M ‒

873
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:57,019
- Moldy.
- FALSTAFF: Moldy?

874
00:48:57,102 --> 00:49:00,188
- Aye, sir.
- 'Tis the more time thou art used.

875
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:03,775
(Shallow laughing) Oh, dear!

876
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:08,989
Things that are moldy lack use.

877
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,949
- Eh, Sir John?
- Prick him.

878
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:13,118
- You could have let me alone!
- O, prick him!

879
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:16,955
My old dame will be undone now for one
to do her husbandry and her drudgery.

880
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,665
- Prick him.
- SHALLOW: O, prick him!

881
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:20,125
SILENCE: P-P-Prick him.

882
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,002
- Thomas Wart.
- Yes, sir?

883
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:27,549
- There are other men fitter to go than I.
- Stand aside, Moldy.

884
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,302
- (objects crashing)
- Shall I pick Wart, sir?

885
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:34,640
It were superfluous.
The whole frame stands upon frames.

886
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:35,891
Prick him no more.

887
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,226
- FALSTAFF: Who's next?
- Simon Shadow.

888
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,812
FALSTAFF: Shadow?
Let me have him to sit under.

889
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:44,232
You can do it, sir. You can do it!

890
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:46,234
Prick him.

891
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:49,988
FALSTAFF: Who's next?

892
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:52,032
F-F ‒ F-F ‒

893
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:54,576
(stuttering)

894
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,496
- Francis Feeble.
- (exhales)

895
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:01,041
- FALSTAFF: What trade art thou, Feeble?
- A woman's tailor, sir.

896
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:03,251
Wilt thou make as many holes
in an enemy's battle

897
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:05,003
as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?

898
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:07,047
I will do my good will, sir.
You can have no more.

899
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,591
Well said, good woman's tailor!

900
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:11,551
Well said, courageous Feeble.

901
00:50:11,635 --> 00:50:16,682
I will be as valiant as the wrathful dove
or most magnanimous mouse.

902
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:19,685
Prick me the woman's tailor well,
Master Silence.

903
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:21,561
Deep, Master Silence.

904
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,148
- (objects crashing)
- FALSTAFF: Who's next?

905
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:27,192
Peter Bullcalf of the green.

906
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:29,736
- O Lord, good me lord ‒
- Dost thou roar before thou art pricked?

907
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,531
O Lord sir, I'm a diseased man.

908
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,534
- What disease hast thou?
- A cold, sir.

909
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:38,537
A cough, sir, which I caught
with ringing in the king's affairs

910
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,205
upon his coronation day.

911
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,832
We will have away thy cold,

912
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:45,210
and I will give such orders
thy friends shall ring for thee.

913
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:49,423
- Prick him. Is here all?
- Here is more called than your number, sir.

914
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:51,883
- Good Master Corporate Captain, sir ‒
- Go to!

915
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:54,594
I had as lief be hanged, sir,
as go to the wars.

916
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:56,722
Good Master Captain.

917
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:59,057
Four Harry 10 shillings
in French crowns for you.

918
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:00,392

I have three pounds

Moldy, stay at home

He presents no mark to the enemy.

who are dead.

to make it too common.

Prince John of Lancaster! Good faith.

This same sober-blooded boy

It ascends me into the brain
and dries me there

1130
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:56,193
all the foolish, dull and cruddy vapors
which environ it,

the tongue, which is the birth,

becomes excellent wit.

The second property of your excellent
sherris is the warming of the blood.

1136

The sherris warms it

he did naturally inherit of his father,

1141

he hath, like lean, sterile, bare land,
manured, husbanded and tilled

01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,328
lie down.

1229
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:27,167
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

1230
01:16:28,835 --> 01:16:30,337
Before God,

1231
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,382
I am exceeding weary.

1232
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,634
Is't come to that?

1233
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:39,888
I had thought weariness durst not have
attached itself to one of so high blood.

1234
01:16:39,972 --> 01:16:41,431
Faith, it does me,

1235
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:45,185
though it discolors the complexion
of my greatness to acknowledge it.

1236
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:49,606
- God save Your Grace!
- Yours, most noble Bardolph.

1237
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,316
How doth thy master?

1238
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,443
In bodily health, sir.

1239
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:55,988
"John Falstaff, knight,

1240
01:16:56,071 --> 01:16:58,573
to the son of the king,
nearest his father,

1241
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:01,118
Harry, Prince of Wales, greeting."

1242
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,619
(chuckling)

1243
01:17:02,703 --> 01:17:04,788
"Be not too familiar with" ‒

1244
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:08,959
You allow this wen to be
as familiar with me as your dog.

1245
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:12,462
"Be not too familiar with Poins,
for he misuses thy favors so much

1246
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:15,132
that he swears thou art
to marry his sister."

1247
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:18,218
My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack
and make him eat it.

1248
01:17:18,302 --> 01:17:20,721
"Repent at idle times as thou mayest,
and so, farewell.

1249
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:24,641
Thine, by yea and no, which is as much
as to say, as thou usest him,

1250
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:27,769
Jack Falstaff with my familiars,
John with my brothers and sisters

1251
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:29,604
and Sir John with all Europe."

1252
01:17:29,688 --> 01:17:32,983
- Is he in London?
- Yes, sir. With Mistress Doll Tearsheet.

1253
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,652
Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?

1254
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:39,406
You, boy, and Bardolph,
no word to your master

1255
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,491
that I am yet come to town.

1256
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:43,160
There's for your silence.

1257
01:17:43,243 --> 01:17:44,995
I have no tongue, sir.

1258
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:48,123
And for mine, sir, I will govern it.

1259
01:17:56,673 --> 01:18:01,720
Doth it now show very vilely in me
to desire small beer?

1260
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:04,598
Tell me, how many
good young princes would do so,

1261
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:08,393
their fathers being so sick as yours
at this time is?

1262
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:12,022
What a disgrace is it to me
to remember thy name

1263
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,524
or to know thy face tomorrow.

1264
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:19,905
Do you use me thus, Ned?
Must I marry your sister?

1265
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:22,366
God send the wench no worse fortune.

1266
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:24,409
But I never said so.

1267
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,121
- Come, Ned.
- I am your shadow, my lord.

1268
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:30,791
I follow you.

1269
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,634
'Sblood.

1270
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:45,514
I'm as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

1271
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:48,475
Sir John, you are so fretful,
you cannot live long.

1272
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:52,229
Well, there it is.

1273
01:18:53,605 --> 01:18:55,315
I'll tell you what I am about.

1274
01:18:55,399 --> 01:18:57,067
Two yards, and more.

1275
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:00,821
Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about,

1276
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:02,948
but I am now about no waste.

1277
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:04,658
I'm about thrift.

1278
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:08,870
I must turn away some of my followers.

1279
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:10,455
There's no remedy.

1280
01:19:10,539 --> 01:19:13,166
I will employ Bardolph.
He shall draw here for me.

1281
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,044
A tapster is a good trade.

1282
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,632
Lads, I am...

1283
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:25,554
almost out at heels.

1284
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:28,974
Hello, Doll.

1285
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:33,437
- Is that all the comfort you give me?
- (knocking)

1286
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,273
Who knocks so loud at door?

1287
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:39,943
- That muddy rascal.
- You make fat rascals, Doll.

1288
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:44,114
I make them?
Gluttony and diseases make them.

1289
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:47,117
If the cook help to make the gluttony,

1290
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,370
you help to make the diseases
we catch of you.

1291
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:52,789
- Hmm?
- Oh!

1292
01:19:52,873 --> 01:19:56,710
We catch of you, for to serve bravely
is to come halting off, you know,

1293
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:59,171
to come off the breach
with his pike bent bravely,

1294
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,047
and to surgery bravely,

1295
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:02,799
to venture upon
the charged chambers bravely.

1296
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:06,219
Hang yourself, you muddy conger!
Hang yourself!

1297
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:08,680
You two never meet
but you fall to some discord.

1298
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,265
(groaning)

1299
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:14,352
You are both, in good truth,
as rheumatic as two dry toasts.

1300
01:20:14,436 --> 01:20:16,730
(Doll retching)

1301
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:19,858
But, in faith, sweetheart,
you have drunk too much canaries.

1302
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:24,696
- How do you now?
- Better than I was.

1303
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:29,242
Oh, why, that's well said.
A good heart's better than gold.

1304
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:30,869
(Doll groaning)

1305
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:33,163
What the goodyear!

1306
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:36,208
One must bear, and that must be you.

1307
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:40,295
- Sir, it's Pistol. He'd speak with you.
- (shouts) Pistol?

1308
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:43,340
The foulest mouth rogue in England!

1309
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:45,967
Hang him, swaggering rascal!

1310
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:48,762
- Swagger?
- Empty the Jordan.

1311
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:50,931
If he swagger, let him not come here.

1312
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:53,934
- He's no swaggerer, hostess.
- A tame cheater, in faith.

1313
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:58,313
You may stroke him as gentle
as a puppy greyhound.

1314
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:01,816
- Pistol!
- God save you, Sir John!

1315
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,862
Pistol, I charge you with a cup of sack.
You discharge upon mine hostess.

1316
01:21:05,946 --> 01:21:09,407
I will discharge upon her,
Sir John, with two bullets.

1317
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:11,326
- (Falstaff laughing)
- (screaming)

1318
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:15,038
She's Pistol-proof, sir.
You shall hardly offend her.

1319
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:18,041
Then to you, Mistress Dorothy,
I will charge you.

1320
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:20,377
Charge me? You filthy bung!

1321
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,128
Get me my rapier, Bardolph.

1322
01:21:22,212 --> 01:21:25,549
I'll thrust my knife in your moldy chaps,
and you play the saucy cuttle with me.

1323
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:28,426
God let me not live,
but I'll bury your ruff for this.

1324
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,720
Pistol, I would not have you go off here.

1325
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,390
- HOSTESS: Not here, sweet captain.
- Captain?

1326
01:21:33,473 --> 01:21:35,892
- Pray thee, go down, good captain.
- You, a captain?

1327
01:21:35,976 --> 01:21:39,145
For what? For tearing a poor whore's ruff
in a bawdy house?

1328
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:44,109
(grunts) Shall hollow pampered jades
of Asia compare with Caesars

1329
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:48,572
and with cannibals and with Trojan Greeks?

1330
01:21:53,034 --> 01:21:56,246
- Come.
- (screams) Nay!

1331
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:57,998
Get here a judge!

1332
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:00,625
PISTOL: What! Shall we have incision?
Shall we imbrue?

1333
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:05,005
Why, then let grievous, ghastly, gaping
wounds untwine the Sisters Three!

1334
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:07,215
Come, Atropos, I say!

1335
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:18,643
Jack! Are you not hurt in the groin?

1336
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:23,273
I thought he made a shrewd thrust
at your belly.

1337
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:25,191
A rascal slave.

1338
01:22:25,275 --> 01:22:27,527
O you sweet little rogue.

1339
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:30,071
A rascal bragging slave.

1340
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:33,116
You whoreson little valiant villain, you.

1341
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,660
Poor ape, how you're sweating.

1342
01:22:35,744 --> 01:22:38,788
The rogue fled from me like quicksilver.

1343
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:41,625
Come, let me wipe thy face.

1344
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,710
Come on, you whoreson chops.

1345
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:45,462
O rogue, i'faith, I love you.

1346
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:49,132
- I will toss the rogue in a blanket.
- Do, and thou darest for thy heart.

1347
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:52,719
And thou dost, I'll canvass thee
between a pair of sheets.

1348
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:57,974
The music is come, sir.

1349
01:22:58,058 --> 01:23:00,060
FALSTAFF: Let them play.

1350
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:04,522
Play, sirs!

1351
01:23:04,606 --> 01:23:06,858
♪♪ (small band: ballad)

1352
01:23:07,776 --> 01:23:10,362
What stuff will have a kirtle of?

1353
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:14,658
I shall receive money Thursday.

1354
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,493
Shalt have a cap tomorrow.

1355
01:23:16,576 --> 01:23:19,954
Come, sing me a bawdy song

1356
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:21,539
to make me merry.

1357
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:28,338
Thou wilt forget me...

1358
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:31,508
when I'm gone.

1359
01:23:31,591 --> 01:23:34,928
You start me weeping, if you say so.

1360
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:36,763
Kiss me, Doll.

1361
01:23:42,477 --> 01:23:46,940
Is it not strange that desire should
so many years outlive performance?

1362
01:23:47,023 --> 01:23:49,025
Thou dost give me...

1363
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:53,655
flattering busses.

1364
01:23:53,738 --> 01:23:57,033
I kiss thee with a most constant heart.

1365
01:23:58,952 --> 01:24:00,745
I am old.

1366
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:06,376
I am old.

1367
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:11,715
I love thee better than I love e'er
a scurvy young boy of them all.

1368
01:24:13,091 --> 01:24:14,634
- Jack?
- Hmm?

1369
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:18,054
What humor's the prince made of?

1370
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:19,723
- The Prince of Wales?
- Mmm.

1371
01:24:19,806 --> 01:24:22,600
(chuckles) A good, shallow young fellow.

1372
01:24:22,684 --> 01:24:25,061
(whispers) Would not this knave
have his ears cut off?

1373
01:24:25,145 --> 01:24:26,938
- They say Poins has a good wit.
- Poins?

1374
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:29,107
(scoffs) A good wit?

1375
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,776
Let's beat him before his whore.

1376
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,903
The prince himself is such another.

1377
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:38,116
The weight of a hair will not turn the scale
between their avoirdupois.

What, a hodge-pudding? A bag of flax?

1383
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:57,969
No abuse, Hal.

1384
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:01,055
Old, cold, withered
and of intolerable entrails?

1385

How vilely did you speak of me even now

1387
01:25:06,394 --> 01:25:09,230
before this honest, virtuous,
civil gentlewoman!

1388
01:25:09,314 --> 01:25:11,775
Why, Hal, I did not think
thou wast within hearing.

1389
01:25:11,858 --> 01:25:16,070
Yea, and you knew me as you did
when you ran away at the robbery.

1390
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:18,281
You spoke it on purpose
to try my patience!

1391
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:22,619
I dispraised thee before the wicked,
that the wicked might not fall in love with thee,

1392
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:25,330
for which thy father is to thank me.

1393
01:25:25,413 --> 01:25:28,333
See now, whether pure and entire cowardice

1394
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:30,960
doth not make thee wrong
this virtuous gentlewoman?

1395
01:25:31,044 --> 01:25:33,713
- Is she of the wicked?
- Is thine hostess of the wicked?

1396

Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal
burns in his nose, of the wicked?

1397

The fiend hath pricked down
Bardolph irrecoverable.

1398

For the women, one of them
is in hell already and burns poor souls.

1399

For the other, I owe her money,

I know not.

1401
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:53,566
But, Hal, am I not fallen away vilely

1402
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:59,030
when my skin hangs about me
like an old lady's loose gown?

1403

Sirrah, you, giant!
What says the doctor to my water?

1404
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,955
He said, sir, the water itself
was a good water,

1405
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:10,875
but for the party who owned it, he might
have more diseases than he knew of.

but the cause that wit is in other men.

1411
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:31,396
I feel me much to blame,
so idly to profane the precious time.

1412
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:38,194

my father is so sick.

And let it be an excellent good thing.

1416

of no higher breeding than thine.

I could be sad, and sad indeed too.

Very hardly upon such a subject.

Thou think'st me as far in the devil's book
as thou and Falstaff.

1424
01:27:17,025 --> 01:27:22,405
An old lord of the council rated me
the other day in the street about you, sir,

Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out
in the street and no man regards it.

It's certain that either wise bearing

"The care on thee depending
hath fed upon the body of my father,

therefore, thou best of gold
art worst of gold.

1692
01:44:33,393 --> 01:44:36,521
- This doth infer the zeal I had to see him.
- It doth so!

1693
01:44:36,605 --> 01:44:38,690
It shows my earnestness of affection.

1694
01:44:38,774 --> 01:44:40,275
- It doth so!
- My devotion!

1695
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:42,235
It doth, it doth, it doth!

1696
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:45,280
As it were, to ride day and night,
and not to deliberate,

1697
01:44:45,364 --> 01:44:47,908
not to remember,
not to have patience to shift me,

1698
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:51,662
but to stand stained with travel
and sweating with desire to see him,

1699
01:44:51,745 --> 01:44:55,290
thinking of nothing else,
putting all affairs else in oblivion,

1700
01:44:55,374 --> 01:44:59,544
as if there were nothing else to be done
but to see him.

God save thee, my sweet boy!

01:45:30,117 --> 01:45:33,161
Have you your wits?
Know you what 'tis you say?

1706

My king! My Jove!

1707
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:41,670
I speak to thee, my heart.

1708
01:45:41,753 --> 01:45:43,714
I know thee not, old man.

1709
01:45:43,797 --> 01:45:45,799
Fall to thy prayers.

1710

How ill white hairs
become a fool and jester.

1711
01:45:56,143 --> 01:45:59,730
I have long dreamed of such a kind of man,

1712
01:45:59,813 --> 01:46:04,526
so surfeit-swelled, so old and so profane.

1713
01:46:04,609 --> 01:46:08,572
But being awak'd, I do despise my dream.

1714

Make less thy body hence

thrice wider than for other men.

- (laughing)
- Reply not to me with a fool-born jest!

1718
01:46:26,381 --> 01:46:30,093
Presume not that I am the thing I was,

1719
01:46:30,177 --> 01:46:33,680
for God doth know,
so shall the world perceive,

1720
01:46:33,764 --> 01:46:36,558
that I have turned away my former self.

01:46:36,641 --> 01:46:38,769
So will I those that kept me company.

1722
01:46:39,436 --> 01:46:42,731
When thou dost hear I am
as I have been, approach me,

1723
01:46:42,814 --> 01:46:46,401
and thou shalt be as thou wast,
the tutor and the feeder of my riots.

1724
01:46:47,486 --> 01:46:51,114
Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,

1725
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:53,825
as I have done the rest of my misleaders,

1726
01:46:53,909 --> 01:46:58,163
not to come near our person by 10 mile.

1727
01:47:04,211 --> 01:47:07,422
For competence of life, I will allow you

1728
01:47:07,506 --> 01:47:11,009
that lack of means
enforce you not to evil,

1729
01:47:11,093 --> 01:47:14,179
and as we hear you do reform yourselves,

1730
01:47:15,305 --> 01:47:18,892
we will, according to
your strength and qualities,

1731
01:47:18,975 --> 01:47:20,936
give you advancement.

1732
01:47:23,021 --> 01:47:26,942
Be it your charge, my lord,
to see performed the tenor of our word.

1733
01:48:10,152 --> 01:48:12,487
Master Shallow?

1734
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:15,657
I owe you a thousand pound.

1735
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:19,077
Yes, Sir John, which I beseech you
to let me have home with me.

1736
01:48:19,161 --> 01:48:22,080
That can hardly be, Master Shallow.

1737
01:48:24,416 --> 01:48:26,960
Do not you grieve at this.

1738
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:31,756
Look you, he must seem thus to the world.

1739
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:37,220
I shall be sent for in private to him.

1740
01:48:40,098 --> 01:48:42,350
Fear not your advancements.

1741
01:48:42,434 --> 01:48:47,063
I shall be the man yet
that shall make you great.

1742
01:48:47,147 --> 01:48:49,232
I cannot well perceive how

1743
01:48:49,316 --> 01:48:53,695
unless you should give me your doublet
and stuff me out with straw.

1744
01:48:55,322 --> 01:48:58,200
I beseech you, Sir John,

1745
01:48:58,283 --> 01:49:00,619
let me have 500 of my thousand.

1746
01:49:00,702 --> 01:49:02,204
Sir.

1747
01:49:03,205 --> 01:49:05,582
I will be as good...

1748
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,586
as my word.

1749
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:14,549
This that you have seen was but a color.

1750
01:49:14,633 --> 01:49:16,801
A color that I fear you will die in.

1751
01:49:16,885 --> 01:49:18,720
Fear no colors.

1752
01:49:18,803 --> 01:49:21,723
Come. Go with me to dinner.

1753
01:49:34,819 --> 01:49:37,822
I shall be sent for soon...

1754
01:49:39,824 --> 01:49:41,493
at night.

1755
01:50:04,182 --> 01:50:07,936
- I like this fair proceeding of the king's.
- But all are banished.

1756
01:50:08,019 --> 01:50:11,940
Until their conversations appear
more wise and modest to the world.

1757
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:15,193
He hath intent his wonted followers
shall all be very well provided for.

1758
01:50:15,277 --> 01:50:20,198
Thou damned tripe-visaged rascal!
Jack! Jack Falstaff!

1759
01:50:20,282 --> 01:50:22,659
Go! Carry Sir John Falstaff to the fleet.

1760
01:50:22,742 --> 01:50:24,661
- The fleet?
- Come quickly!

1761
01:50:24,744 --> 01:50:27,163
You must come to my master!

1762
01:50:27,247 --> 01:50:30,709
O poor heart, sweet man,
come to him! He is very sick!

1763
01:50:32,294 --> 01:50:35,755
The king is a good king,

1764
01:50:35,839 --> 01:50:38,550
but it must be as it may.

1765
01:50:39,301 --> 01:50:43,471
Now, lords, for France.
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war.

1766
01:50:43,555 --> 01:50:45,473
Then forth, dear countrymen!

1767
01:50:45,557 --> 01:50:47,726
The signs of war advance!

1768
01:50:48,435 --> 01:50:52,314
No king of England if not king of France!

1769
01:50:52,397 --> 01:50:54,816
(crowd cheering, shouting)

1770
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:59,487
My lord chief justice,
enlarge the man committed yesterday.

1771
01:50:59,571 --> 01:51:00,572
Falstaff?

1772
01:51:00,655 --> 01:51:02,782
Let him be punished, sovereign,

1773
01:51:02,866 --> 01:51:06,661
lest example breed, by his sufferance,
more of such a kind.

1774
01:51:06,745 --> 01:51:10,540
If little faults proceeding on distemper
shall not be winked at,

1775
01:51:10,623 --> 01:51:13,501
how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes,

1776
01:51:13,585 --> 01:51:16,671
chewed, swallowed and digested,
appear before us?

1777
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:25,388
We consider it was
excess of wine that set him on.

1778
01:51:48,953 --> 01:51:50,246
Falstaff?

1779
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:54,125
Falstaff is dead.

1780
01:51:55,293 --> 01:51:57,879
The king has killed his heart.

1781
01:51:57,962 --> 01:52:01,966
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is,

1782
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:04,803
either in heaven or in hell.

1783
01:52:04,886 --> 01:52:07,138
HOSTESS: Nay, sure, he's not in hell.

1784
01:52:08,056 --> 01:52:10,225
He's in Arthur's bosom,

1785
01:52:10,308 --> 01:52:13,311
if ever a man went to Arthur's bosom.

1786
01:52:14,646 --> 01:52:16,981
He made a finer end

1787
01:52:17,065 --> 01:52:20,735
and went away
and it had been any Christian child.

1788
01:52:21,903 --> 01:52:25,865
'A parted even just between
12:00 and 1:00,

1789
01:52:25,949 --> 01:52:29,077
even at the turning of the tide,

1790
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:32,122
for after I saw him fumble with the sheets

1791
01:52:32,205 --> 01:52:34,124
and play with flowers

1792
01:52:34,207 --> 01:52:36,334
and smile upon his finger's ends,

1793
01:52:36,418 --> 01:52:38,878
I knew there was but one way,

1794
01:52:39,754 --> 01:52:42,340
for his nose was as sharp as a pen

1795
01:52:42,424 --> 01:52:45,051
and he babbled of green fields.

1796
01:52:46,428 --> 01:52:48,179
"How now, Sir John?" quoth I.

1797
01:52:48,263 --> 01:52:50,682
"What, man, be of good cheer!"

1798
01:52:52,016 --> 01:52:55,186
So he cried out, "God, God, God!"

1799
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:57,856
Three or four times.

1800
01:52:57,939 --> 01:53:02,652
Now I, to comfort him,
bid him he should not think of God.

1801
01:53:02,735 --> 01:53:07,157
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself
with any such thoughts yet.

1802
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:12,370
So 'a bade me lay more clothes
on his feet.

1803
01:53:13,955 --> 01:53:17,167
I put my hand into the bed and felt them,

1804
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:19,711
and they were as cold as any stone.

1805
01:53:20,795 --> 01:53:25,216
Then I felt to his knees,
and they were cold as any stone.

1806
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,969
And so upward and upward,

1807
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:30,847
and all was cold as any stone.

1808
01:53:39,439 --> 01:53:42,275
- He cried out of sack.
- And of women.

1809
01:53:42,358 --> 01:53:44,611
Nay, that 'a did not.

1810
01:53:48,573 --> 01:53:50,992
He said once the devil
would have him about women.

1811
01:53:51,075 --> 01:53:55,163
He did in some sort, indeed, handle women.

1812
01:53:55,246 --> 01:53:59,626
BOY: Do you not remember 'a saw a flea
once stick upon Bardolph's nose,

1813
01:53:59,709 --> 01:54:02,754
and 'a said it was a black soul
burning in hellfire?

1814
01:54:02,837 --> 01:54:07,425
BARDOLPH: Well, the fuel is gone
that maintained that fire.

1815
01:54:07,509 --> 01:54:10,929
That's all the riches I got in his service.

NARRATOR:
<i>The new king, even at first appointing,</i>

1817
01:54:18,269 --> 01:54:22,649
<i>determined to put on him
the shape of a new man.</i>

1818
01:54:22,732 --> 01:54:27,695
<i>This Henry was a captain
of such prudence and such policy</i>

<i>that he never enterprised anything</i>

1820

<i>before he had forecast the main chances
that it might happen.</i>

1821
01:54:34,869 --> 01:54:39,874
<i>So humane withal,
he left no offense unpunished,</i>

01:54:39,958 --> 01:54:42,335
<i>nor friendship unrewarded.</i>

1823

<i>For conclusion, a majesty was he</i>

<i>that both lived and died
a pattern in princehood,</i>

<i>a lodestar in honor</i>

<i>and famous to the world alway.</i>
