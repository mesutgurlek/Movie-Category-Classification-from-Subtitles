1
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,751
I write this, so it can be remembered.

2
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,030
But I don't know who will read it.

3
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:15,150
Denmark was under the sun...

4
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:19,429
and no one could,
in their wildest dreams, imagine...

5
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:25,389
that the country would soon experience
its heaviest and most bloody defeat.

6
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,028
It is the story of a forgotten time
and a forgotten war.

7
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:33,828
About Laust and Peter, Johan and Didrich...

8
00:01:33,947 --> 00:01:39,388
...Sofia and mother Karen Dinesen,
Einar, Erasmus and Alfred...

9
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:41,707
...and the destiny of others...

10
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:47,747
...who were victims of euphoric
folly of mad people.

11
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:51,466
And our own faith in them.

12
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:58,546
I am Inge.
I am a freight manager's daughter...

13
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:02,625
...Laust's and Peter's love.

14
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:06,105
I am the last living witness.

15
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:10,104
I have the time, that disappeared.

16
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:24,063
If we just gather over here,
before we move on to the history center.

17
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:27,823
Okay. It was here...

18
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:32,862
...April 18, 1864, the Danish army
fought against the Prussian supremacy.

19
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:37,542
Karoline, hello.
Tap Karoline on the shoulder.

20
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:40,181
Today, there is not much to see.

21
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,341
There are some grooves in the ground,
trays, and the hint of redoubts.

22
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:52,941
But imagine if you can...

23
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,860
...that the Prussian army was over there...

24
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:02,100
...and the Danish defense fortifications
were located in the countryside here.

25
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,979
Is anybody listening?
Now we run all the way over there.

26
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:10,019
Dybboel Mill.

27
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:16,698
Young Danish soldiers struggled here...

28
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:20,697
...in a completely impossible
and hopeless battle...

29
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:24,258
...against a giant Prussian army.

30
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,416
Dybboel Mill.

31
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:37,016
These are the finest top leaves.
I have a pound.

32
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:40,936
I will piss rich. Try it.

33
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:48,655
You'll never get rich, Zlatko.

34
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:09,773
On 18/04/1864, in redoubt, here fell
Kaptsur Lundbye...

35
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:15,453
...of the 2nd Regt
and many of the rank and file...

36
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:19,012
...whose names are not recorded.

37
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:23,612
How stupid!
There is a monument because they fell.

38
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,852
Oh, I fell. Give me a monument.

39
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:30,771
Idiot!

40
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:34,485
Good morning.

41
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:52,604
Noah did, just as God had commanded him.

42
00:05:54,802 --> 00:06:02,003
Now, if there were two animals of
everything, there were also two lice?

43
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:08,322
Noah took two of each.
All living creatures.

44
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:12,522
- But what would you do with lice?
- All creatures are God's work.

45
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:17,041
- But lice?!
- You are happy when you are "lice free".

46
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,441
So without lice
there would not be any "lice free".

47
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,320
- Damn!
- That's enough!

48
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:41,958
- Are you coming, Peter?
- Come on.

49
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:51,197
Peter.

50
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:59,517
And so Denmark is at war.
And so they rally...

51
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:04,157
...for no soldier is so brave
as the Danish soldier.

52
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:10,637
The german is on the run,
and Schleswig would bend your neck.

53
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:14,435
Yes, children.
Many of your fathers are down there...

54
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:17,356
...and you should be proud...

55
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:21,395
...that they defended Denmark
to the last drop of blood.

56
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:26,795
Peter's father is also included. Isn't
that true, Peter, who chose to be late.

57
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:31,354
The german is currently
eating Schleswig up like the wolf...

58
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:36,834
...enticing the lost sheep.
Come on. Come with me.

59
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:40,313
But no. For here is the Kingdom of Denmark.

60
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:45,153
And it goes all the way down here.
So Schleswig is in the fold.

61
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:49,233
They think that they are outside,
but we'll have to change that.

62
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:52,952
- Yes, Einar.
- Isn't German Schleswig the most spoken language?

63
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,351
Yes, but it must stop...

64
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,391
because we do not have other languages
than Danish in Denmark...

65
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,672
...and that's why God gave us the flag.

66
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,870
- Did it really fall from the sky?
- Yes.

67
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,111
The good God let the danish flag
with the white cross...

68
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,710
...drop down to us Danish...

69
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,829
because He loves us more
than all the others.

70
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,869
- Hooray.
- Hooray.

71
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:25,429
Are you sure?

72
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:30,389
Yes, if you just do it long enough,
something will come out.

73
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:36,108
I do it at least once a day
and bring it into the jar over there.

74
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:41,507
Here it comes.

75
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:00,905
See.

76
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:15,064
It's what you do for children.

77
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,783
Damn, I can not. Damn.

78
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:26,384
Don't worry. It will come.

79
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:31,503
Why are they ringing so many times?

80
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:34,782
It is Didrich.

81
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:37,182
You are home.

82
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:43,222
I was 12 years old in 1851,
when the soldiers returned home.

83
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:49,341
They had defeated the Prussians
and the Schleswig rebels...

84
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,901
...and now the country was
overtaken with excitement.

85
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:07,940
I still remember the women crying,
as they revisited their sons and men.

86
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,779
I remember clearly
how brilliant Didrich looked...

87
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:17,219
...when he rode on his
high horse and looked like a prince.

88
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:24,338
How I ran barefoot along side
and looked admiringly at him...

89
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:29,057
...and the fine company,
who received him with enthusiasm.

90
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:31,897
See my son. Look at him.

91
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:34,416
There we have the hero.

92
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:38,737
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

93
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:41,456
Didrich.

94
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,775
And... Yes, it's great.

95
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:53,775
Come on. Cognac. Cognac for my son.

96
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:56,935
Come on, boy.

97
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:01,414
- Bang! Bang!
- Don't shoot me!

98
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:07,294
- Satan's German!
- Bang!

99
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,611
Mother?

100
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:37,171
Father?

101
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,210
Come on, boys.

102
00:11:57,808 --> 00:12:01,049
How many did you kill?

103
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:08,128
We won't talk about it, ok?

104
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:11,567
You definitely beat more
to death than Didrich.

105
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:15,288
- You made the fence?
- Yes, yes.

106
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:18,887
Your hands are well screwed on.

107
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:24,847
Peter reads books. He goes to school.
He can already read and write.

108
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:28,446
You will go to Copenhagen
and study one day, perhaps?

109
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,606
Yes, maybe.

110
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:33,566
We might have a priest in the family.

111
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:38,245
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

112
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:41,485
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

113
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:53,164
- How many did you whack?
- 120.

114
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:14,962
How are you?

115
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:21,322
Could you ensure respect?
So your people look up to you?

116
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,360
If you continue
your career in the military?

117
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,240
If you had seen what I saw...

118
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,639
...I saw grown men
being ripped apart.

119
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:43,639
Yes.

120
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,879
I stood with my lieutenant...
Then poof...

121
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:51,599
...his face disappeared.

122
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:54,678
- It disappeared father.
- Yes, it's war.

123
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:58,637
Yes, but it could
as well have been me.

124
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:03,117
War's bloody mess.

125
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:14,716
You know how it is
to see themselves die every day?

126
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:17,836
You're alive. If your mother had lived...

127
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:21,195
she would have been
happy to see you here.

128
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:24,955
Yes, back in one piece. Healthy.

129
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:27,715
In one piece.

130
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:36,714
I am not healthy.

131
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,034
Pull yourself together!

132
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:48,953
Not many could see
Didrich's scar on the soul...

133
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:53,232
...for who knows what sort of human
hides behind the facade.

134
00:14:57,552 --> 00:15:00,232
Is even the strongest of us...

135
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,712
not sometimes alone in front of the mirror
a weak, sobbing child...

136
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:09,791
...with strange demons?

137
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,190
Denmark is great.

138
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,510
Large as the largest.

139
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:27,990
Bigger yet, but the reactionaries...

140
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:35,550
...conservatives and aristocrats
have the power.

141
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,908
Ditlev?

142
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,787
Can't you see that I am working, woman?

143
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:48,707
Dearest Ditlev,
we have to go to the theater.

144
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:52,387
Thank you, Emilie. Thank you.

145
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:57,466
Monrad, It's you, who is the rhetorician.

146
00:15:57,585 --> 00:16:01,426
If we are to expand the Conservatives,
then I must have your help.

147
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:04,586
Then you must pull yourself together.

148
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:08,426
- What's up with you?
- Where are you pregnant, Bishop Monrad?

149
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:12,745
We alone are responsible for collecting
this country together.

150
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:18,385
Our leader procures instruments.
They play music.

151
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:22,864
But right now you're as silent
as an empty orchestra pit. Damn, man?

152
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:28,464
- Then you must speak up in parliament.
- Do not call the devil in my presence.

153
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,984
We have a wonderful project.
Therefore, we call upon all...

154
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:36,063
...what it takes to close
the mouths of the conservative forces.

155
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:38,702
Even they love democracy.

156
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:42,142
Denmark is flag waving
throughout Europe...

157
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:47,182
...showing that we are a modern,
democratic kingdom for and with the people.

158
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:51,542
Should we unite as one people
in one collected kingdom, we need...

159
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:55,101
Their rhetoric, Monrad.
It's the devil in hell...

160
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,701
They are so damn good.
They and Grundtvig.

161
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,061
Is not God himself,
speaking through priests like you?

162
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,700
- Please, Lundbye...
- Well, pull yourself together.

163
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,780
They're the champion.

164
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:20,220
- What do we have to watch?
- Mrs. Heiberg. "Macbeth".

165
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:23,738
What thou art promised,
yet do I fear thy nature..

166
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:27,578
It is too full...

167
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:33,538
...of the milk o' human kindness.

168
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:36,697
To catch the nearest way:

169
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:39,617
Thou wouldst be great;

170
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:42,696
Art not without ambition,

171
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:47,376
but without the illness should attend it.

172
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:51,255
What thou wouldst highly,
that wouldst thou holily;

173
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:57,216
Wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win,

174
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:04,015
That which cries 'thus thou must do,

175
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:06,654
if thou have it.

176
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:12,294
Art thou afeard to be the same
in thine own act and valor...

177
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:18,614
As thou art in desire.
Wouldst thou have that.

178
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:24,414
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life.

179
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:29,092
And live a coward in thine own esteem.

180
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:33,732
Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would".

181
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:38,571
Like the poor cat i' th' adage?
It would have the fish...

182
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,291
...but not wet feet.

183
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:58,729
Bravo.

184
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:05,449
Bravo.

185
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:11,888
Because it is your birthday,
you can have this.

186
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:18,647
- And...
- Save some for Laust.

187
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:28,286
Thank you, Peter.

188
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:35,406
- There you go.
- Thank you.

189
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:46,406
Linnaeus:
"Flora and fauna in Scandinavia".

190
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:55,085
Yes, it is...
I got it from a Swede.

191
00:19:55,204 --> 00:20:00,244
Yes, it is in Swedish.
Swedish is not that hard to learn.

192
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:06,803
- I have no books for you, Laust.
- I do not use any.

193
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:09,003
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

194
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:13,003
Maybe you can get away with it here.

195
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:23,521
It should be clean, but look for
the presence of a Prussian at the end.

196
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,161
Come on, Peter.

197
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,360
That day God shone rays of sun
on our world...

198
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:41,000
...still infinitesimal.

199
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,519
I see only two dirty boys.
And they just look at me...

200
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:52,399
...as a pillar that rose out of the sea.

201
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:58,119
But the day must be a day
we will never forget.

202
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:03,437
It is not a place for girls.
This is our secret place.

203
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:07,358
- And you have nothing to do here.
- That's right.

204
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:11,997
You do not have anything to do here
at our place.

205
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:17,196
Shit heads! Huge...

206
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:22,477
...filthy fucking shit pig heads!

207
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:28,715
- Who are you?
- I am Inge.

208
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:32,155
The new land agent's daughter.

209
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:38,675
And this place is as much
my place as it is your place.

210
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:41,634
It's everyone's place.

211
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:50,633
And what are two such shitheads called?

212
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:54,113
- Laust.
- We go to school together.

213
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,912
Was it you who was slapped?

214
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:08,672
What would you do? This guy Egeus has the
kingdom's most beautiful daughter, Hermia...

215
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,471
...that all young guys want to marry.

216
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,951
In particular, the two young noble men
Lysander and Demetrius...

217
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,551
...and then Egeus forces Hermia
to marry the wrong one...

218
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,510
...namely Demetrius,
even though she is loves Lysander.

219
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:27,510
But the father decides
and he does not like Lysander.

220
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:33,389
And they tell Hermia,
that she can choose one of three options.

221
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:39,189
Either marry Demetrius,
enter a monastery or die.

222
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:44,028
What would you choose then?

223
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,227
What do you choose?

224
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:52,588
- What to choose?
- What are you doing?

225
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:55,707
What do you choose then?

226
00:22:57,106 --> 00:23:00,547
Death, of course.

227
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:08,946
Come on, shit heads. Come on.

228
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:12,265
It's so nice.

229
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:16,265
Come on.

230
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:21,345
Can you blow the clouds back to
where they came from?

231
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:29,104
And can we not just
remain here forever?

232
00:23:29,223 --> 00:23:33,624
I remember the space,
as if time had stopped completely.

233
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:37,944
Could we just.. stop time...

234
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:41,943
...and live forever.

235
00:23:56,101 --> 00:24:01,261
You can stay here a while,
if you really want to.

236
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,260
But you know how it is.

237
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:16,059
You know that the door
should not be locked...

238
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:19,460
...but you always put the latch on.

239
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:23,499
If Sebastian were to come home...

240
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:30,179
...standing there outside
and can not get in...

241
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:33,898
...while we are sleeping...

242
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:39,738
and he goes away again.
You know I can't stand the thought.

243
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:44,057
Mother... Sebastian is not coming home.

244
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:47,656
Sebastian's dead.

245
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:57,535
- Can I have some money?
- No.

246
00:24:57,655 --> 00:25:03,136
- Why not?
- Because I do not have any money.

247
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:12,414
It was then the third school.

248
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:21,813
I know that your mother has difficulty,
but everyone is struggling.

249
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:24,973
So what are you, Claudia?

250
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,092
I could...

251
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:40,732
I would like to...

252
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:45,651
...my own TV show.

253
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,610
Go find yourself a job.

254
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,411
To stagger around the bottom.
But if you like it down there, go ahead.

255
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,930
Bye.

256
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:08,209
So what?
What do you want me to do?

257
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:12,609
Try to look at me.
I will fucking get some help.

258
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:18,848
Do you know the goods by Hagen Feldt?

259
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:21,968
I only say this,
because I know your mother.

260
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:25,927
You're too young for a job offer.
So this is not a job offer.

261
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:30,287
The Baron is old and can not manage by
himself. And he does not want help.

262
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:35,767
We will have to forcibly remove him.
Unless...

263
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:41,486
- Wipe the ass of an old fool?
- Perhaps you have something in common.

264
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:46,766
- What would that be?
- You don't have a future either.

265
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:51,445
What then?

266
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:54,205
- What then?
- Do you have money?

267
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:58,124
You know that you
have smoked for 2000, right?

268
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:06,683
What are you doing? Hey, Claudia.

269
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,322
When I went off...

270
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:15,843
...then I went off...

271
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:20,802
...my girl wanted to go,
yes, my girl wanted to go.

272
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:25,482
You can not, my friend
go to war.

273
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:30,041
If I fall, I will probably come back home.

274
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,281
Yes, there was no danger,
then I was here with you.

275
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,560
Clematis vitalba.

276
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,040
Dad, I think I've found it,
this can make your bones healthy.

277
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,119
Clematis Vitalba, clematis.

278
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:49,720
It helps wounds
that do not heal.

279
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,399
- What did you say its name was?
- Clematis vitalba.

280
00:27:56,518 --> 00:28:01,278
- Clematis.
- Should I find it?

281
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:06,358
Yes, yes. That's ok.

282
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,837
- Me?
- Yes, yes. Both of you.

283
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:35,115
Plants can cure everything.
It all exists in nature.

284
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:43,114
Most just think only of what
you can see and touch.

285
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:45,514
Especially men.

286
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,953
In the old days they burned women...

287
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:54,794
...who knew all about the plants
and the secrets of nature.

288
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:56,593
Witches?

289
00:28:57,712 --> 00:29:03,353
It is unfortunate that you are men,
for men are all quite silly.

290
00:29:03,472 --> 00:29:06,672
Father says that Peter will become
a priest in Copenhagen.

291
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:11,072
Then we will follow. I will also go
to Copenhagen and be wise.

292
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:15,952
But a priest! I can not
be with a priest...

293
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:19,151
...so you should therefore
read something else.

294
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,870
- Come on.
- What are we doing?

295
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,991
Finding a lot of secrets.

296
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,270
Come.

297
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:37,069
Should we?

298
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:40,910
I don't want to.
What if the Baron...

299
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,469
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes.

300
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:47,909
Mum says that all property belongs to God.

301
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:51,628
So all this is just something
the Baron borrowed.

302
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:55,027
- Do you...
- Come on.

303
00:29:59,627 --> 00:30:03,187
Oh...

304
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:09,826
- Laust, keep him in front.
- Why?

305
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:12,986
Cover his eyes.

306
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:19,345
Peter, see.

307
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:31,144
Have you ever seen so many books?

308
00:30:34,943 --> 00:30:37,824
Isn't it amazing?

309
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:44,144
And the most amazing thing is
that they do not even read them.

310
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:47,863
They have them just
because it's great to have them.

311
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:51,062
One has Dickens and one has Shakespeare...

312
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:54,182
...and one has Homer.

313
00:30:56,101 --> 00:31:01,782
But they do not know who they are.
Fine people think it is fine to have them.

314
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:06,821
Well, Count Slaskeballe. Are you ready
for a battle to the death?

315
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,580
Badly hit. Bang!

316
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:19,380
It's not just the antics.
I stick it up her ass for you...

317
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:24,380
if you do not behave properly.
I'll kick your ass now. Boom!

318
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:27,459
What the hell is going on here?

319
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:32,058
What is this?

320
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:36,098
Are you completely insane?!
It is a real gun.

321
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:41,538
- Inge, you get out of here right now.
- It was my fault.

322
00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:45,017
- Out of here!
- No, it was my fault.

323
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:48,297
Didrich it was me, that lured them here.

324
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:51,257
Get the fuck out of here.

325
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:06,975
- What do you have there?
- My book.

326
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:10,095
Give me the book.

327
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:14,935
- Give me that book when I say that.
- It's Peter's book.

328
00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:19,454
You keep your mouth shut.
It is also your gun, right?

329
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:23,894
The rules are clear. You can
not be here, if you steal.

330
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:26,573
You know well.

331
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:28,613
Laust...

332
00:32:31,013 --> 00:32:32,933
Peter...

333
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:44,892
What is this?

334
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:49,812
It happens when you are long gone.
Good boys turn into thieves.

335
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,371
- Will you stop?!
- We're done here.

336
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:04,530
Now I have washed and rolled for you,
since I could walk.

337
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:11,210
And Thøger has harrowed and ploughed
and sown and harvested land...

338
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:16,849
all his life and he knows
every rock and root on the estate.

339
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:22,808
And you have always been a good
and righteous man, Baron.

340
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:28,488
And you can say if you
are unhappy with our work.

341
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:33,928
But thieves in our fucking...

342
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:37,327
...fucking in our family.

343
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:42,367
And the book was Peter's book.
And we must get it back...

344
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:45,486
...before we go.

345
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:54,605
Baron apologizes.
It was obviously a misunderstanding...

346
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:57,205
...so I...

347
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:15,403
...boys...

348
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:22,243
It is important to say sorry.

349
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:27,122
Sorry. I should have trusted you.

350
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:30,402
So now, slap me on the face.

351
00:34:30,522 --> 00:34:33,882
I put one on your face.
One I did not deserve.

352
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:38,322
Now give me one back.

353
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:40,801
Come.

354
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,840
You just strike. Everything you can.

355
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:54,120
You only get one chance. Come on.

356
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,599
Come on.

357
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:04,239
What was that? Was it a zephyr?

358
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:10,359
You can do better.
Just before the lever all the way through.

359
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:13,038
There you go.

360
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:18,997
It's fine. It's fine.

361
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,357
Laust.

362
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:25,356
Now do not be gentle.

363
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:33,917
I think it was a little too much
puff of wind. Can I try again?

364
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:36,315
Yes.

365
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:46,235
Bishop Monrad. It is truly an honor.

366
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:50,955
- No, that's me who...
- I thought that Joanna was joking.

367
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:53,714
She's really good at it.

368
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:58,914
But when she insisted on coming,
so we were a little proud.

369
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:02,273
- Is it...
- Yes.

370
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:07,953
Johanne is sometimes
attacked by a fit of popular culture.

371
00:36:08,072 --> 00:36:11,312
She is moved by the song.
It's a clue...

372
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:16,752
A song of good Danish spirit.
A Danish song for the Danish.

373
00:36:16,871 --> 00:36:21,671
National Fresh,
full of courage and optimism.

374
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,351
- No wonder people love it.
- Just my words.

375
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,911
I hope that it does something,
that I kind of steal your wife.

376
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:38,951
I'm terribly presumptuous,
but it is an artistic concern.

377
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:42,469
I understand.

378
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:05,867
Do you think that art alone can win a war?

379
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:09,867
That it can awaken the spirit
so strongly in a human...

380
00:37:09,986 --> 00:37:14,227
...that you get almost supernatural powers?

381
00:37:14,346 --> 00:37:17,986
That it can be as strong as guns?

382
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:22,186
If guns defend us externally,
then surely art...

383
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:25,785
is defending us against the smooth,
it is simply...

384
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:30,985
against stupidity an eternal attempt
to take control of the interior.

385
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:42,064
I am a great admirer of yours. You have
helped to transform the country.

386
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:49,264
Yes, the king signed the Constitution,
but your work was paramount.

387
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,103
Thanks, Monrad.

388
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:58,983
- Do I get my hand again.
- I'm sorry.

389
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:02,462
What can I do for you?

390
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,661
Mrs. Heiberg...

391
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:10,342
...when you get a text like "Macbeth"...

392
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:14,462
...so one reads all these words on paper...

393
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:18,661
...and it's great art,
but they're not living...

394
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,820
...until you say the words.

395
00:38:21,939 --> 00:38:26,260
And they recite them with such a
glow and such conviction...

396
00:38:26,379 --> 00:38:28,899
...which is quite impressive.

397
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:31,579
It comes out with a clarity...

398
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:36,339
...which not only makes people listen,
but also makes them...

399
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:41,259
...feel it, Mrs. Heiberg, here. Right here.

400
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:46,898
They have even lost the glow.

401
00:38:51,257 --> 00:38:54,297
Is it really that obvious?

402
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:59,497
One of the country's leading politicians
meets up with me and talk passion.

403
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:03,857
Where have you misplaced yours?

404
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:07,816
Mrs. Heiberg...

405
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:12,816
...what's wrong, I do not know...

406
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:17,935
...but it is and I do not feel anymore.

407
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:24,414
They feel no more.

408
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:31,374
You think you feel?

409
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:41,212
There must be something
they are passionate about.

410
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:46,933
I am passionate about the motherland.
I am passionate Denmark. Of course.

411
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:51,932
We are the most visionary country in Europe
with the world's best constitution.

412
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:56,811
The people spoke, and the king listened.
And the conservatives are silent.

413
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,091
It is the people's Denmark. God's people.

414
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,890
I have spoken with Grundtvig about it,
and the Danes are something special.

415
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:12,170
Therefore, we gather Denmark
in one kingdom...

416
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:16,050
...one people in a united Denmark.

417
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:21,449
The conservatives joined to settle
with a ridiculous peace...

418
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:24,369
...with Schleswig-Holstein
and Germans.

419
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,728
The Treaty says
that we should not touch Schleswig.

420
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:32,609
Treaties that the British
and Russians have forced.

421
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:38,487
Basically, all conservatives,
and they do not change.

422
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:42,047
They oppose all new trends,
and they are against us...

423
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:45,886
...who would like to create a new world.

424
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:53,207
- And to hear Schleswig.
- Schleswig should be included in the new world.

425
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:57,606
Down with the reactionary!
Now it is God, king and the people.

426
00:40:57,725 --> 00:41:00,485
Exactly, Mrs Heiberg.

427
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:06,645
When I went off...

428
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,844
...my girl wanted to go.

429
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:12,204
My girl wanted to...

430
00:41:12,324 --> 00:41:15,084
...yes, my girl wanted to go.

431
00:41:15,203 --> 00:41:19,564
You can not, my friend.
I am going to war.

432
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:24,448
Here he is, your Majesty.

433
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,218
Your Majesty.

434
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,670
Everyone says that you are so talented.

435
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:34,126
What is that talent exactly?

436
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:40,562
Europe is dissolving.
The Liberals are revolting across Europe...

437
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:45,424
...and threatening to set
the continent on fire.

438
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:51,387
The Democrats claim that
they have the people on their side

439
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:55,354
and will abolish the monarchy.

440
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:59,052
We must do everything to avoid...

441
00:41:59,502 --> 00:42:03,702
...being strangled by this liberal
and democratic nonsense.

442
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:10,965
Think of what will happen in Denmark...

443
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:14,644
...when the liberals get
more and more power...

444
00:42:14,954 --> 00:42:18,154
...and the king is sidelined
as a parade horse.

445
00:42:19,986 --> 00:42:24,586
A jovial man who has married
a woman from the bourgeoisie.

446
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:32,945
Who and what are the people?
The people will decide.

447
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:37,031
People want to work, eat and drink.

448
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:43,717
- What is your name?
- Bismarck

449
00:42:45,547 --> 00:42:47,747
Otto von Bismarck, your Majesty.

450
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:33,391
Anybody here?

451
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:51,349
Hello?

452
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:07,388
Stop there or I'll shoot.
Are you a fucking thief?

453
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:11,788
Crazies from the social services
sent me down here.

454
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:14,747
You had some food,
on the stairs.

455
00:44:14,866 --> 00:44:17,427
Food. Adr!

456
00:44:19,186 --> 00:44:22,426
Can you get out. Out!

457
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,745
- Are you blind?
- I'm not blind.

458
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:34,666
- You are blind.
- Below the castle is one Des.

459
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:37,545
You have no framework
when you're blind.

460
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:40,264
- I'm not blind.
- No.

461
00:44:40,383 --> 00:44:44,784
And I'm Anastasia,
Tsar's missing daughter.

462
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:54,983
Yes.

463
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:03,662
Who are your parents?

464
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:10,222
- Parents?
- Your parents.

465
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:14,302
- You mean mine?
- Yes, your parents.

466
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,181
- They are crying.
- Why?

467
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,380
- Because my brother died.
- How did he die?

468
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,301
- In the war.
- What war? Where?

469
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:35,500
- Some dry place out there.
- Yes... yes.

470
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:42,659
War today... yes.

471
00:45:42,778 --> 00:45:48,139
- At the time when it was something else.
- Were you?

472
00:45:48,258 --> 00:45:52,218
I am 170 years this Easter, yes.

473
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:55,218
What do you think?

474
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:06,816
Now I think you should go.

475
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,416
- The flea market at the wall...
- Flea?

476
00:46:12,535 --> 00:46:17,776
Flag and sables.
It might be worth a lot.

477
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:22,495
- Is it family?
- Yes.

478
00:46:24,294 --> 00:46:29,135
- So. Now you might as well go.
- I could make a cup of tea.

479
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:34,295
- Tea?
- I really want to hear about it.

480
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:37,494
All about the old people
in the old days.

481
00:46:37,613 --> 00:46:40,693
They all had lice in their hair
and rats in the attic.

482
00:46:40,812 --> 00:46:46,973
And they could only afford salted herring.
I find it very interesting.

483
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:51,052
Where is your kitchen?

484
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:54,692
Out there. Find it yourself.

485
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:34,928
Thanks for the effort, Jensen.

486
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:47,848
Mr. Baron, about my boys...

487
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:51,086
I'm sorry if you...

488
00:47:51,206 --> 00:47:55,447
It was not your sons.
It was my son.

489
00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:59,726
It's me, who owes you an apology.

490
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:02,566
Brandy.

491
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:17,124
Denmark! We are Denmark's sons.

492
00:48:17,243 --> 00:48:22,404
And the violence
we see them come up against us...

493
00:48:26,723 --> 00:48:34,404
...stormy, madness in their eyes,
furious with bayonets lowered...

494
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:41,162
...while they scream "Tod! Tod!"...

495
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:47,002
...again and again as a living wall,
tumbling up against us. "Tod".

496
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:52,602
But the Prussians do not know
their ridiculous little war cry...

497
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,360
...is a pure pleasure to listen to
for we Danes...

498
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,161
...because we have painted "Tod"
with blood across the face...

499
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:07,960
...silent and to tear their
hearts out and eat their guts.

500
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,839
Then I get up lift my sword and scream:

501
00:49:24,277 --> 00:49:28,517
"Then die, fucking German.

502
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:31,517
Die!"

503
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:34,837
So I cut myself down among the Prussians...

504
00:49:34,956 --> 00:49:39,517
...and it's raining blood
down over me. And then suddenly...

505
00:49:39,636 --> 00:49:43,076
...suddenly I am alone.

506
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:49,556
And there are hundreds of
dead Prussians around me.

507
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:39,311
- Good evening, Inge.
- Good evening.

508
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,350
Did you really kill so many Germans?

509
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:59,350
- It was nothing.
- I do not understand.

510
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:02,829
What do not you understand?

511
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:10,028
Surely it must have been hell for you.

512
00:51:21,786 --> 00:51:25,187
Are you okay?

513
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:45,624
- Do you like to dance?
- Yes.

514
00:51:45,744 --> 00:51:49,785
- You shall soon go to Copenhagen?
- I think so.

515
00:51:49,904 --> 00:51:55,185
- Then I will come and visit you.
- It might be nice.

516
00:51:55,303 --> 00:51:58,063
And maybe...

517
00:52:01,102 --> 00:52:05,383
...will you home with me afterwards.

518
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:20,502
There is something special about you, Inge.

519
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:23,941
I'm just a child.

520
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:46,699
Can you keep a secret?

521
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:50,138
I am a frog.

522
00:52:50,257 --> 00:52:53,098
Yes, that's right.

523
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:55,938
I am a frog.

524
00:52:57,497 --> 00:53:02,498
And if you kiss me,
I might be your prince.

525
00:53:06,336 --> 00:53:09,257
You're drunk.

526
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:16,376
Quack-Quack.

527
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,296
Where have you been?

528
00:53:26,815 --> 00:53:30,415
Is there something wrong?

529
00:53:30,534 --> 00:53:33,175
Then come.

530
00:53:45,612 --> 00:53:51,253
Condemned German.
Getting into the dungeon.

531
00:53:51,372 --> 00:53:54,532
Peter? Peter?

532
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:04,372
No, don't shoot.

533
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:28,530
- It's just something we play.
- Don't die.

534
00:54:28,689 --> 00:54:32,049
I'm watching over you, Peter.
