1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,063
On Neretva in occupied Europe,
we have fought one of the most famous

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,046
and most human battles -
battle for saving the wounded.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,635
The fate of the revolution was
at stake here,

4
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:14,179
and here the brotherhood and unity of
our nations won. (Tito)

5
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:21,374
In the beginning of 1943 in
the free partisan republic.

6
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:24,981
Long live our shock workers!

7
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,702
Long live comrade Tito!

8
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:46,993
That's right, closer, closer.
Put you hands on the sister, that's right.

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,278
Hey, photographer!
-What is it?

10
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:51,590
Shall I bow down so you don't
cut off my head? - Stand straight!

11
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:53,913
Smile!

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,075
Brothers!
Nations of Yugoslavia.

13
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:07,747
Serbs, Macedonians, Croats,

14
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:10,933
Slovenians, Montenegrins
and Muslims.

15
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:15,211
Let's unite to defend our republic.

16
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:19,698
Long live our allies, the Soviet
Union, England and USA.

17
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,311
Long live AVNOJ (Anti-Fascist Council
of National Liberation of Yugoslavia).

18
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,213
Mr. general, 3. squad is ready.

19
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:49,756
Is everybody here? - Yes, Mr. general,
only general Morelli hasn't arrived yet.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,636
Make sure no one will be bothering
us!

21
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:54,518
When the Italians come, let them
wait a bit.

22
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,092
Maybe they will be more punctual
next time.

23
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:58,133
I understand, Mr. general.

24
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:04,028
Gentlemen, general.
Attention!

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,037
Mr. general,
the division commanders are waiting

26
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,374
to be given duties.
-Good morning, gentlemen.

27
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:18,291
Gentlemen!

28
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:23,240
You all know the "Weiss" plan
very well.

29
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:27,605
The Fuhrer's headquarters have
given orders to start the military
operations.

30
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:30,679
We only have 24 hours.

31
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:33,183
We will attack tomorrow morning.

32
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:37,398
So gentlemen, here in the middle
is the partisan area.

33
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:40,581
Let's start on the east.

34
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:45,215
You, colonel Reichtal,
attack with the division in the middle.

35
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:48,945
The Anacker platoon and the 717. division
will be with you.

36
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:53,042
Colonel Mülleneisen, your division
will attack from the west.

37
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,199
The objective of the attack is
here and here.

38
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:58,965
The Italian divisions and 18.000 Chetniks
will come from the south.

39
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:04,710
You, colonel Kränzer, will strike with the
division and the Ustashas from the north

40
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:07,973
directly into the middle of
Tito's state.

41
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:10,485
I understand,
Mr. general.

42
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:14,181
Are your squads ready?
-Not yet, Mr. general.

43
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,728
We will take the positions
till 20.30.

44
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:19,917
That is all. Do you want
to smoke a cigarette?

45
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,264
Tito will have to defend himself on
four front lines,

46
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,774
if he will want to save several
thousand wounded.

47
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:31,353
That's why he will try to
retain his position.

48
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,793
Which is good for us.

49
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:37,604
Now we have the final opportunity
to get rid of all the partisans.

50
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,617
You mean an invasion?
-That's right.

51
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:46,249
You all know about the British and American
plans for the invasion on the Balkan.

52
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:51,129
When we get rid of the partisans
all of the Balkan will be in German hands

53
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,200
and the allies will have to
think twice.

54
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:59,097
Thank you very much.
Yes, my dear gentlemen!

55
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:01,891
This war is not about soldier
against soldier.

56
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,629
This is...

57
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,495
How do you call it,
Kränzer?

58
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:12,470
War into the back.
-That's right, war into the back.

59
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,335
War against
children and civilians.

60
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:19,975
Fuehrer's order is there should be no
indulgence and no captives!

61
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:24,446
Mr general, the Italians...
-Yes, let the Italians come.

62
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,618
Another thing, gentlemen.

63
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:29,795
Don't forget that each partisan's life
that you spare,

64
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,260
can avenge against you next time with a
hand grenade

65
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:36,399
or a shot from a gun.

66
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,864
That is all. I wish you luck
gentlemen!

67
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:45,676
Kränzer, it will be the toughest for you.
Do what you can.

68
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:53,816
Oh, general!
How are you, fine?

69
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,671
If you want I can repeat the
operation plan for you.

70
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,761
Good day,
friends!

71
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:50,137
Machine guns on the mules!
Quick!

72
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:55,198
Faster, boys!

73
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:56,495
Commander!

74
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,390
Excuse me, commander. Where are
they taking us? This doesn't look good.

75
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,737
Good?
The worst is yet to come.

76
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:08,839
We will be the first attacking the
partisans on their own territory.

77
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:11,084
Excuse me, but why?

78
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:14,734
That's how it will be.
It won't be easy.

79
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,319
This war means more to them then life
and we are strangers here.

80
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,850
There is the colonel!

81
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:25,428
Captain Riva!
Come here please.

82
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,736
Commander!

83
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:34,226
Hurry up, we're late.
We must be in Prozor before night falls.

84
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,509
General Morelli
is already there.

85
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:38,903
I understand, sir!

86
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,119
Why are you resting?
Who is the commander?

87
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:48,658
Over here, Mr. colonel!

88
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,449
What are these people doing?
The trucks are waiting.

89
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:55,218
There is no time to rest now.
Get back to work, immediately!

90
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:15,500
Horst, report our positions!

91
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:22,134
Anton one, Anton one,
come in!

92
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:28,155
Lion two speaking. We have reached
position 4.

93
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:42,660
May God be with you, Chetniks!

94
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,911
Brother Chetniks,
listen to me!

95
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:55,228
The time has come for us to
draw the swords.

96
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,418
Yes, the moment of decision is
before us.

97
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:02,103
My soul is groaning and shivering
when i think about the victims,

98
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:06,000
but it is a honorable thing to
fight to the last drop of
blood for the king and the homeland.

99
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:11,150
With the help of the German forces we
will deal a lethal blow to them.

100
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:16,061
To these jackals and fake patriots!

101
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:21,051
Tanks, divisions of a mighty army
are with us.

102
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,828
With God's help,
brother Chetniks,

103
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:32,175
let us get ready to ram a hawthorn pole
into their savage hearts.

104
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:38,465
Soon Tito's head will fall down
to my feet.

105
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:42,160
Slaughter!
- Attack!

106
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:01,694
Fight, fight!

107
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:05,574
The congress of partisan doctors
has ended!

108
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,842
Two more brigades founded in Slovenia!

109
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:15,208
General fight against typhus!

110
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:37,963
Doctor Marija,
take a picture with us!

111
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,669
Don't move!

112
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:58,055
Now children, read aloud!

113
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:02,021
AVNOJ

114
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:42,460
Run!

115
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,093
They will kill us all!

116
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:29,427
Comrades, open up!
-Help!

117
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,556
Run for your lives!

118
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:42,519
Follow me, typhus people!
Flee from the city!

119
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:01,421
Follow my voice.
Over here!

120
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,623
Here!

121
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,125
Lie down!
Hide yourself!

122
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,577
Stretchers, over here!

123
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:49,133
Fire!

124
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:55,612
Forward!

125
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:12,079
Forward!

126
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:20,851
Horst, infantry into assault!

127
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:42,345
Horst. -They're not responding.
-Call them again!

128
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,941
Berta, come in.
Berta, come in.

129
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,838
Tell the 2nd regiment to
reinforce the left wing.

130
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,310
Tanks forward!

131
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,649
The 2nd regiment should reinforce
the left wing.

132
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:02,825
The left wing, at once!

133
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,623
Martin, shorten the effective range!
The tanks approaching.

134
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,744
Fire with the artillery without a break.

135
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:35,084
I understand!
There is no retreat!

136
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:38,748
We musn't withdraw, not even for
a single meter.

137
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,638
On enemy tanks and
infantry...

138
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:56,307
Fire!

139
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,948
Put me through to the general in
person.

140
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:14,581
Yes, colonel Kränzer speaking.

141
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:19,455
Not yet, general.
The resistance is very strong.

142
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:24,727
We can't break the resistance today
but we will break through tomorrow.

143
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,895
Thank you.
Over.

144
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,350
Fire!

145
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,066
For homeland, forward!

146
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:46,417
Fire!

147
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:51,290
Load!

148
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,112
Vuko, Vuko!

149
00:18:57,431 --> 00:19:01,434
Call my brother,
Novak.

150
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,713
Fire!

151
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:30,592
Ivan!
Headquarters.

152
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:38,023
Brigade commander Ivan speaking.

153
00:19:42,826 --> 00:19:44,311
I understand!

154
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:48,875
I understand!

155
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:53,584
The headquarters are giving an order
to retreat towards Bihac.

156
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,517
Which means that the Germans have
broken through the front line.

157
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:58,348
Somewhere in the other sector.
-Yes.

158
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,732
Hello!
Call Martin!

159
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,247
Martin!

160
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:11,666
The headquarters are ordering a retreat
do you understand?

161
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:16,426
That we should retreat!
-I will not retreat, don't you understand!

162
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,238
I don't want to! Go into counterattack.
Attack!

163
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:23,102
What counterattack?
-In counterattack!

164
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,997
Martin!
Hello, Martin!

165
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:35,717
I am going to the Slovenian
because he doesn't want to fulfil the order.

166
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:39,610
You should prepare the brigade retreat!
- And you should stay with the artillery!

167
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:55,328
Have patience!
-Don't tell sister Dana.

168
00:20:56,517 --> 00:21:01,378
Don't tell her! - Vuko.
-Don't tell, Damir...

169
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,709
Vuko, brother.

170
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,617
I'm sorry Novak.
I must get to Martin as soon as possible.

171
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:49,609
We can't fight head-on,
because our forces would quickly evaporate.

172
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:53,297
The enemy has technical, numerical superiority
and is superior in general.

173
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,363
The headquarters have reached a decision,
comrades,

174
00:21:56,492 --> 00:21:59,430
that we leave the free territory together
with the wounded and the people.

175
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,619
We will do what the enemy least
expects;

176
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,780
we will move into counterattack,

177
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,685
continue towards the Neretva river
and forward to the east.

178
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,654
In other words - we will move
into a several hundred kilometer run.

179
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:16,882
One who has 4.000 wounded along
doesn't run, comrade Vuka.

180
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,264
Doesn't run,
but ties his own hands.

181
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,954
What will happen to the partisan mobility
if we burden ourselves with

182
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,830
the typhus people,
women and children?

183
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:30,483
But Vuka, we must act primarily
as humans.

184
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,194
Who of us, has the right to
to jeopardize the fate of our fight

185
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:35,825
because of the wounded?

186
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:40,461
I only ask you that.
-The human inside us has that right.

187
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,116
You must understand, the path to freedom
must be pure.

188
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:47,384
I'm not in favor of mercy
that leads the revolution to suicide.

189
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:50,528
Ask the wounded that question,
revolution or them?

190
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,471
They will all say that the revolution
is more important.

191
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:57,559
That's the reason why they're going
with us and we will defend them till the
very end.

192
00:22:57,802 --> 00:22:59,679
There is no dilemma for me here.

193
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:02,902
Stole will explain to you the basic
plan of the operation.

194
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:05,071
Comrades.

195
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,941
By order of the headquarters
and comrade Tito

196
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,117
my division and your self-dependent brigade Ivan,

197
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:14,613
with the assistance of the striking divisions,
that are covering our flanks,

198
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:17,447
we will move towards the city of Prozor.

199
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:20,791
Stevo, you will stay in the north
and defend the central hospital

200
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,952
and the population.
-I understand!

201
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,249
Vlado, Vlado.
Wake up!

202
00:23:27,593 --> 00:23:29,706
This concerns your
engineers.

203
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:32,545
You must mine all the roads that
lead to Bihac as soon as possible.

204
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:35,412
You must stop the Germans.
-Ok, agreed.

205
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:39,850
The artillery should also immediately
head towards Neretva.

206
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:44,248
Comrades. We are starting with the counterattack
far across Neretva.

207
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,666
Get to work!

208
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:54,585
Dr. Marija.

209
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,966
Will this medical bulk ever get off?

210
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:01,305
These are seriously wounded people, not a brigade.
We can't do it faster.

211
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,465
Call the head surgeon!

212
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:08,935
Why is the hospital late?
-We are doing our job. We cant work faster.

213
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:12,269
The city must be emptied till the evening, hurry up.
-I understand.

214
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:18,052
Comrade commander!
Order them to untie me!

215
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:20,842
I'm not crazy.

216
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:23,513
Comrade commander,
tell dr. Marija to

217
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:27,600
remove the bullet from my head.
I want to be in command.

218
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:30,899
Stop!
The attack is getting started!

219
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:35,229
Bosko. Calm down. We will take
the bullet out later.

220
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:38,962
Everything will be fine. You will
be riding a white horse.

221
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:43,907
I want that.
I like riding a white horse very much.

222
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:48,664
You're heavy as lead. - If I had legs
I would be even heavier.

223
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:53,230
Take the Sumadin man over here.
Over here, on the carriage!

224
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:59,786
Thank you.

225
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:03,599
Now I will play till
Sumadija, Nada.

226
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,481
I will.

227
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:55,083
Everything ready, boys?
-Ready. -To shelter!

228
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:45,092
Comrade Nazor,
I have come for you.

229
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,870
I am ready Stole,
I am ready for a long journey.

230
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:52,558
I only have this suitcase and
these books.

231
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:55,467
I have ordered fighter Zika to take
care of you.

232
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,690
We have even provided you a cow so you
will have milk.

233
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:01,408
During the battle you will be in the
column where the head hospital will also be.

234
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,058
Thank you, Stole.

235
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:07,964
Where are you from Zika? - From the village of
Koracica in Sumadija.

236
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:14,133
Take your suitcase and the books.
They will come with us.

237
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:19,636
Who ever saw so many books being
lugged along during battle!

238
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:24,585
Listen, Zika. These books are written
in my language and in yours.

239
00:28:25,147 --> 00:28:27,740
In our language.
In mine and your language.

240
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:31,627
They were written by great men.
There are some of mine among them.

241
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:34,417
I can't separate from the books.

242
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,284
I have nothing against books and poems.

243
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:40,109
But I didn't join the partisans to drag along
a cow, books and...

244
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:44,404
Enough of the foolish talk! You're responsible
for the books and comrade Nazor.

245
00:28:44,602 --> 00:28:47,351
I understand.
-I'll tell you something else, Zika.

246
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,333
A nation without poets and a language,

247
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,911
cannot win freedom by fighting.
-I understand comrade commander.

248
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,675
Farewell, poet!
-Thank you for your hospitality!

249
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:05,937
Goodbye.
-Good luck.

250
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:28,772
Let's go daughter-in-law,
don't cry!

251
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:33,174
We will return one day.

252
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:18,657
Fire!

253
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:19,187
Stop, stop!

254
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:24,292
Cattle! You're stopping in the middle
of the slope! What is it?

255
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:26,609
Can we come in?

256
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:30,587
I have been dragging them along for 15 days,
they're hardly standing any more.

257
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:36,008
There is no more room. It's full,
don't you see? Get lost!

258
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:39,779
I won't because of them.
Even the headquarters ordered,

259
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:42,373
that we shouldn't leave even old women
behind.

260
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:45,480
Out of the way! -Jordan, Jordan.
We should at least take the child to Prozor.

261
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,876
How are we going to do that
if there is no room, Nada.

262
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:50,704
There is, that machine gunner
died a while ago.

263
00:32:50,908 --> 00:32:54,595
What machine gunner?
- That only son, the schoolboy...

264
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:57,387
The red haired?

265
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,231
Don't come near! You won't do it,
I'm not moving from here.

266
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:18,023
Don't shout, put the child into the car.
And you give us a help.

267
00:33:26,317 --> 00:33:28,430
Get him, Nada.
That's right.

268
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:34,052
May his soul rest.
-Stop crossing yourself, help out!

269
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:37,313
I'm going.

270
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:40,856
Come on, children!

271
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:45,806
Sit on the back seat!

272
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:10,917
Division,
prepare for battle!

273
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:39,742
Set the horses!

274
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:44,691
Put through the headquarters!

275
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:47,836
It's ruined.

276
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:53,457
Battery commanders,
come to me!

277
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:58,053
You help the wounded.

278
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:00,652
My commander was killed.

279
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:03,003
You command.
-I understand.

280
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:07,921
Put the dead on the carriages.
Put the wounded on the gun-carriages.

281
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:11,105
Tonight we will breaking through to Prozor.

282
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:13,660
It's starting to snow
so we must hurry up.

283
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:15,465
Hurry up.
-I understand!

284
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:32,367
Where is the commander, boys?
-Somewhere over here.

285
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,767
Hello, Stole.
-Hello, Ivan.

286
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:38,102
Were the air crafts pursuing you too?
-No, they just flew over me.

287
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:42,747
Immediately assemble all the commanders to the
meeting. -Ok.

288
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,337
Battalion commanders,
to the meeting.

289
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:46,835
Ivan.

290
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,464
Ivan.

291
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:56,973
How are you, Ivan?
-Good.

292
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,025
Novak.

293
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:11,944
Get up you lazy bum,
if the sister is coming!

294
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:15,476
I managed to get ours photos
from Bihac. They were still wet.

295
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:18,629
For you, for me... I'll give this
one to Vuk.

296
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:20,784
Such brothers!

297
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:25,226
Give me Vuk's photo.
I'll probably see him before you.

298
00:37:27,436 --> 00:37:29,950
They have transferred him to
security.

299
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:35,918
Would you like to eat?
-Come on!

300
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,716
My questions is seemingly simple,
but it isn't.

301
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:44,013
Should we attack tonight Prozor
without the artillery with which

302
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:46,525
we can't establish
contact?

303
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,298
If we have set out to do this
we must attack immediately.

304
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,295
If we surprise the Italians tonight,
we still have a chance,

305
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,517
to break through up to Neretva.
-I agree with you.

306
00:37:56,794 --> 00:37:58,906
We must reach Neretva as
soon as possible.

307
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:02,325
We all know that a surprise is better
then any artillery.

308
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,059
Good, I agree.
-To conclude;

309
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,109
we will attack the city from
all sides.

310
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,547
Mark the exact positions of your
forces on the map.

311
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,824
Stipe, bring me the map when
they finish. - I will.

312
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,981
Marking or no marking,
there will some fuss in any case..

313
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:26,740
Well comrade commanders,
show me this map.

314
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:29,565
Everyone get up!
-Prepare for departure!

315
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:32,943
Brigade, depart.
-Faster, faster.

316
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,905
Stipe.

317
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,486
When does the attack start?
-When the shooting stats.

318
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,436
Those who have to may stay.

319
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:54,478
Ivan, come.

320
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:02,820
Let's sit down.

321
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,633
Let's stay here a bit as though as
nobody is here.

322
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:12,523
It will be wonderful when we will be
together forever once.

323
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:19,679
But look, soon we will be dying
for Prozor.

324
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:29,620
Come!

325
00:39:40,432 --> 00:39:43,104
Who is the brigade commander?
Call him!

326
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:46,946
Let's go, Danica!
Hurry!

327
00:40:05,075 --> 00:40:07,589
Don't, there are only two or three days
till we reach it.

328
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:11,235
Just wait three days.
Three days, do you understand?

329
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:15,599
I personally set up the
defense.

330
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,928
We can hold out on these positions
till the end of the war and longer.

331
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,526
You, Mr. general,
you must try harder.

332
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:29,041
You must put more pressure on them on the north,
and we will wait for them here.

333
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:32,187
Where are your tanks now?

334
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:36,945
No, Morelli, please understand me.
We're closing the hoop.

335
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:41,420
You general,
must only wait.

336
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:44,050
Good bye, general,
farewell.

337
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:51,605
Major, prepare yourself!
The partisans will attack.

338
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:56,047
We'll show these scum! -I understand!

339
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:03,111
General Morelli's headquarters
here.

340
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:05,588
On the alert!

341
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:20,059
2nd battery ready.
-Excellent, captain.

342
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:43,209
Slowly, carefully!
-I know, I'm being careful!

343
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,802
Carefully camouflage.

344
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,439
Good luck, good luck!

345
00:42:57,963 --> 00:43:00,434
Heroic blood was shed tonight,
uncle Nazor.

346
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:03,771
You will have a lot to chant.
-My dear Zika. When will the time come

347
00:43:03,976 --> 00:43:06,884
when i won't have to write about
human slaughterhouses?

348
00:43:07,316 --> 00:43:10,414
Everything will be fine. As long as
we cross Neretva.

349
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,575
That's the most important thing!

350
00:43:16,631 --> 00:43:20,523
Let's go, forward comrades,
to Prozor!

351
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,177
Stop, hold still!

352
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:55,963
Where are you going? Where is the
head surgeon? Hurry up, doctor.

353
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,387
Where? We all know where.
To Prozor.

354
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,262
What Prozor,
if we didn't conquer it.

355
00:44:08,118 --> 00:44:09,839
Hasn't it fallen?

356
00:44:13,895 --> 00:44:15,616
They were not able...

357
00:44:17,314 --> 00:44:19,505
.... to attack, those whores.

358
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:32,598
What will the headquarters
do will all this misery,

359
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:37,706
when the German is putting pressure on us from behind ,
and the Italian doesn't allow us to move ahead?

360
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:41,200
Where? Go back!
-Back where, tell us?

361
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:44,625
I don't know. I do know that you can't
go through Prozor. -Back where?

362
00:44:47,223 --> 00:44:49,894
Doctor,
take over the new wounded.

363
00:44:50,092 --> 00:44:53,469
Comrade fighters, hand over the wounded
to the hospital, quickly .

364
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,644
We had such hopes last night,
and today this...

365
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,857
What will we do now,
Martin?

366
00:45:30,454 --> 00:45:34,972
I don't' know. Ivan and Stole shouldn't
attack without the canons.

367
00:45:40,634 --> 00:45:43,183
Division, to the barracks.

368
00:46:17,146 --> 00:46:19,616
You have fought greatly.
Well done, boys!

369
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:30,310
Attention!

370
00:46:38,408 --> 00:46:41,627
You were excellent. You have fought
bravely and firmly.

371
00:46:42,063 --> 00:46:46,769
You have dealt the resistance a big blow.
-Vacation, Mr. general!

372
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:52,044
Who said that?
-I did.

373
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:57,232
We will speak about that soon, too.

374
00:46:57,391 --> 00:47:00,879
I promise you that we will talk about
that on Easter.

375
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:04,148
We have prevented the enemy of crossing
Neretva.

376
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:10,516
No we must completely destroy all
the partisans together with the Germans.

377
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,716
The sooner we destroy them,
the sooner we will have vacation.

378
00:47:17,316 --> 00:47:20,536
I give you my word for that.
-Long live the general!

379
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:29,656
You don't feel well?
-Get lost!

380
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,661
Don't follow me like some loyal dog.

381
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:36,886
I don't want you to serve me or
pity me. Get lost!

382
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:40,144
Or I will transfer you.
Now go.

383
00:47:41,802 --> 00:47:44,506
I don't need anyone, do you understand?
Not even you.

384
00:47:48,524 --> 00:47:52,055
Nobody can help me.
Leave me alone.

385
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:54,765
I understand,
Mr. captain.

386
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,560
Hello, comrades!
-Hello!

387
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:32,067
We shouldn't have attacked without
the artillery.

388
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:35,054
You got beaten on your heads, now they're
bombing the wounded.

389
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:38,431
There must be a way out. I think..
-We will not think now,

390
00:48:38,907 --> 00:48:41,890
we will act.
-Stole, this is an order.

391
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:45,823
I'm going to the position of the neighbouring
division, bye.

392
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:56,663
Let all the fighters see the order!

393
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:48,545
PROZOR MUST FALL TONIGHT.
TITO

394
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,536
It's cold!
A real wolfish country!

395
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,518
Fire!

396
00:52:37,273 --> 00:52:39,542
Fire!

397
00:52:51,776 --> 00:52:56,760
Aim your fire to the crossings!
Move the tanks to the city center!

398
00:52:58,418 --> 00:53:00,294
Fire!

399
00:53:15,043 --> 00:53:17,199
Fire!

400
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:42,942
First squad to the bunkers!
-Second squad to the left wing!

401
00:54:45,634 --> 00:54:47,790
Follow me!

402
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:51,251
Forward to the city center!

403
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,079
Follow me!

404
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:17,192
Forward!
Follow me!

405
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,472
Here you are!
What is it, why are you shivering?

406
00:55:22,498 --> 00:55:25,248
Are you afraid, you wuss?
Fire, fight!

407
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:28,275
Fight.
I'm commanding!

408
00:55:30,281 --> 00:55:33,969
Why are you changing his nappy?
Let him die if he wants to!

409
00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:36,647
I'm commanding!

410
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:04,977
Fire, Mate,
fire, Jure!

411
00:56:07,066 --> 00:56:08,520
Forward!

412
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:14,288
To the bunkers,
forward!

413
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,601
Faster, faster!

414
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:23,684
Hello! I must speak with general Lohring
immediately.

415
00:56:25,145 --> 00:56:26,867
Lohring, immediately!

416
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:33,396
Where is he?

417
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:37,399
Sleeping? Wake him up!
The enemy is entering the city.

418
00:56:51,596 --> 00:56:52,491
Hurry up!

419
00:56:52,696 --> 00:56:54,418
Fire!

420
00:57:49,526 --> 00:57:50,733
Wait!

421
00:57:50,862 --> 00:57:52,552
Look at Bosko.
Don't shoot, Ana.

422
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:55,219
Bosko!
-Bosko!

423
00:57:57,938 --> 00:58:00,407
Bosko is diving!

424
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:11,801
Over here, you cowards,
here!

425
00:58:14,562 --> 00:58:17,503
That's how you fight!
-Bosko, over here!

426
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:22,776
Who gave you the weapon? -Bosko
seized it, Bosko took it

427
00:58:23,406 --> 00:58:26,892
Ana, we must bind him up.
To the hospital, immediately!

428
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,351
You won't tie me.
-Get away!

429
00:58:35,824 --> 00:58:38,172
I'll kill you!

430
00:58:38,576 --> 00:58:41,874
Vuka, what is it?
What, this fool will kill us.

431
00:58:47,105 --> 00:58:49,061
Take aim at him!

432
00:58:53,313 --> 00:58:56,098
Bosko!
Where are you, my commander!

433
00:58:57,558 --> 00:59:00,073
Where are you, my hero!

434
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,155
I am here. I killed everyone.

435
00:59:04,398 --> 00:59:07,616
Comrade commander,
I killed everyone for freedom.

436
00:59:07,816 --> 00:59:11,114
My best commander!
Give me your hand!

437
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,179
Let's shake hands.

438
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,444
I told you not to touch the weapons.
Tie him!

439
00:59:19,371 --> 00:59:20,936
Hold him.

440
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,741
What will we do now,
Mr. captain?

441
00:59:30,062 --> 00:59:32,330
Don't be afraid, let's go!
-Where to?

442
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:35,914
I have made a decision.
I'll return to Prozor.

443
00:59:35,996 --> 00:59:40,276
Mr. captain! I would like to stay
with the Italians because I want to go home.

444
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:42,903
With the partisans we will be far
from home.

445
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,384
I don't care about the rest.

446
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:48,996
Please Mr. captain,
don't leave me!

447
00:59:50,615 --> 00:59:55,646
I'm not leaving you, Mario.
You don't want to go with me. Good luck!

448
01:00:01,385 --> 01:00:07,231
Comrade fighters.
We have opened the path for the wounded.

449
01:00:48,862 --> 01:00:50,895
Danica, Dana.

450
01:00:52,123 --> 01:00:55,455
Are you looking for Novak?
He's alive, alive.

451
01:00:58,412 --> 01:01:01,709
Vuko was a far better
comrade and fighter.

452
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:04,851
I feel bad about him.

453
01:01:14,998 --> 01:01:17,109
Don't make that up,
you're lying Bosko.

454
01:01:17,552 --> 01:01:21,240
I never lie. They found
him dead at a canon.

455
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,125
Don't make that up, you're lying.

456
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:26,587
He was looking for me, and the comrades
were nowhere, nowhere.

457
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:30,438
Don't make it up,
you're lying, lying!

458
01:02:22,714 --> 01:02:24,826
And where are you?

459
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:28,765
Up there they all think you
fell in action.

460
01:02:30,732 --> 01:02:33,592
Don't cock,
just sit down and eat.

461
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:37,678
Come on Novo, get up! I heard we
are immediately leaving for Neretva!

462
01:02:37,845 --> 01:02:39,567
Let's go, get up!

463
01:02:39,732 --> 01:02:43,028
Prozor has fallen.
You have to make a toast. Drink, brother!

464
01:02:44,646 --> 01:02:47,070
You know, I was really worried
about you.

465
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:10,259
Take, people!

466
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:37,426
Brigade, attention!
-Novak.

467
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:42,181
Get lost!

468
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:47,084
Stipe, go.
-I understand, comrade commander.

469
01:03:47,842 --> 01:03:50,266
I understand!
-Come on, let's go.

470
01:03:54,995 --> 01:03:56,761
Squeeze girl,
I feel cold!

471
01:03:56,882 --> 01:03:59,038
I haven't seen you for a long time uncle!
-Where do we know each other from?

472
01:03:59,122 --> 01:04:01,000
From the faculty, uncle.

473
01:04:08,082 --> 01:04:09,648
Welcome, comrades!

474
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,990
Long live Churchill,
Stalin and Roosevelt!

475
01:04:13,585 --> 01:04:16,413
And you too, aunty.
-Help yourself, please.

476
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,998
Thank you, aunty
-And stay alive.

477
01:04:35,477 --> 01:04:38,024
Why didn't you tell me
about Vuk?

478
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:20,672
Dana, what would Vuko say,
if he saw you?

479
01:05:21,616 --> 01:05:24,400
You promised not to cry, if...

480
01:06:43,326 --> 01:06:45,751
Let's join the round dance,
come on.

481
01:06:51,854 --> 01:06:54,168
Come on, Stipe!
-I don't want to.

482
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,626
Come on, Stipe.

483
01:07:04,272 --> 01:07:07,448
Come, commander.
-Just go.

484
01:08:26,177 --> 01:08:27,743
What's wrong with him?

485
01:08:35,806 --> 01:08:37,417
Nikola.

486
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,013
You have typhus.
Go to the hospital, immediately!

487
01:08:50,232 --> 01:08:52,824
I can still dance.

488
01:08:54,357 --> 01:08:55,654
Nikola!

489
01:08:56,795 --> 01:09:00,997
You have to go to the hospital. -Ok,
if you give me my pigeons.

490
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:05,872
You'll get your pigeons.

491
01:09:07,013 --> 01:09:11,372
Listen, take him to Marija.
Tell her to give him an injection .

492
01:09:11,532 --> 01:09:12,707
I understand!

493
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:20,059
Hello!

494
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:30,708
Hey Italian, should I shorten
your head?

495
01:09:41,912 --> 01:09:43,320
Comrade commander.

496
01:09:43,485 --> 01:09:46,391
I have brought these two.
An officer and this fascist.

497
01:09:47,218 --> 01:09:50,751
I'm not a fascist.
I'm a simple poor man.

498
01:09:51,423 --> 01:09:55,471
You fascist and you officer,
how many partisans killed?

499
01:09:56,022 --> 01:09:59,084
Mr.  commander, explain to them
that you think like they do,

500
01:09:59,284 --> 01:10:02,380
otherwise they will kill us
without any reason.

501
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:06,864
Did you shoot at us?
-Yes, I did.

502
01:10:09,464 --> 01:10:13,668
But I came to you
voluntarily. They didn't capture me.

503
01:10:14,966 --> 01:10:18,733
You shot, therefor you are a fascist
like the rest of them.

504
01:10:20,036 --> 01:10:25,100
Why didn't you come yesterday instead
of today, when Prozor fell?

505
01:10:25,735 --> 01:10:27,265
Why?

506
01:10:29,154 --> 01:10:32,720
And you say you can distinguish
a friend from an enemy?

507
01:10:33,909 --> 01:10:37,363
I came, because I want to fight for
Italy without fascism.

508
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:41,336
If you accept me as one of yours, I will
loyally fight for your side.

509
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:46,753
I can't act anymore against my beliefs

510
01:10:47,233 --> 01:10:49,389
and from now on I also won't.

511
01:10:49,551 --> 01:10:53,196
Let's take him. We'll see...
Let's test him.

512
01:10:54,426 --> 01:10:57,252
I don't want him in my unit.
You take him!

513
01:10:57,767 --> 01:11:01,096
Do you speak French?
-Yes.

514
01:11:03,818 --> 01:11:07,071
What's your name?
-Michele Riva.

515
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:13,993
What kind of weapon do you have?
What kind of cannons do you know?

516
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:17,606
Mostly light
artillery.

517
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:22,523
I'll take him into my division.
I need him.

518
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:24,920
Go ahead and take him.

519
01:11:25,985 --> 01:11:29,002
Return the coat and the shoes to the captain!
-Comrade Martin.

520
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,899
But I have already been without shoes for
three months. -Take them off!

521
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:37,724
I am giving you the opportunity to
prove yourself in battle.

522
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:43,041
Thank you!

523
01:12:19,671 --> 01:12:22,610
Venice? Florence?
Rome?

524
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,361
No, Parma.

525
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:30,311
And your occupation?
-I'm an engineer. And you?

526
01:12:31,304 --> 01:12:36,369
Me, theater,
drama, Dalmatia...

527
01:12:39,873 --> 01:12:41,325
Lovely.

528
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:46,119
Very pretty. - You Italians are
all Don Juans.

529
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:52,330
No, we're comrades.
And I also have a wife... married.

530
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:59,835
I'm married too.
Me... one child... four years.

531
01:13:31,082 --> 01:13:33,788
General Lohring,
General Lohring!

532
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:40,003
General, strong partisan units are
advancing towards Jablanica.

533
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,176
They have cut me off from the back
part of my units.

534
01:13:43,738 --> 01:13:47,113
I demand that our army attacks
from Konjic.

535
01:13:48,099 --> 01:13:50,726
Immediately!
-On no account, Morelli!

536
01:13:51,755 --> 01:13:54,851
There is no reason to panic,
calm down!

537
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:58,197
Their objective is not Jablanica.
They are coming after me, to Konjic.

538
01:13:58,632 --> 01:14:02,355
Here they will set up a bridge
and get the wounded over the river.

539
01:14:03,742 --> 01:14:06,167
I must tell you something
else.

540
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,324
Morelli, the "Weiss"
plan is not feasible anymore.

541
01:14:12,154 --> 01:14:15,171
You must defend Jablanica by yourself.
I can't help.

542
01:14:15,376 --> 01:14:16,750
And above all stay calm!

543
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:20,954
Over.

544
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:24,683
General Lohring,
general Lohring!

545
01:14:59,236 --> 01:15:00,488
Comrade commander!

546
01:15:00,652 --> 01:15:02,843
This fighter says that on the other side
of the fortress

547
01:15:02,971 --> 01:15:05,162
there is an Italian ammunition warehouse.
We moved a cannon over there.

548
01:15:05,564 --> 01:15:07,050
Excellent!
Let's go. -Follow me.

549
01:15:15,705 --> 01:15:17,972
Ivan, Ivan,
here is the commander!

550
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,751
Novak, Danica.
Tell the fighters,

551
01:15:19,909 --> 01:15:22,458
to withdraw from the fortress.
Quickly! -Ok, let's go!

552
01:15:22,622 --> 01:15:26,107
Captain, fire on the ammunition
warehouse. Fire.

553
01:15:30,912 --> 01:15:32,635
I can't.

554
01:15:37,437 --> 01:15:41,328
I can fire on the Germans, I can't on
the Italians. They are my compatriots.

555
01:15:43,294 --> 01:15:45,215
Fire, quickly!

556
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,655
Immediately!

557
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:53,782
Fire!

558
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:03,998
Get lost!

559
01:16:05,499 --> 01:16:06,796
Get lost!

560
01:16:20,198 --> 01:16:22,043
Get lost!

561
01:16:25,071 --> 01:16:28,448
You're carrying your wounded, I don't
fire upon my soldiers.

562
01:16:28,608 --> 01:16:32,654
Our morale is the same. Kill me,
if you want to, but I think like you do.

563
01:16:33,954 --> 01:16:36,659
Get out of my sight!

564
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:41,295
What is it, Ivan?

565
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:44,171
There is no way I can hit the
window on the fortress.

566
01:16:44,448 --> 01:16:46,326
The ammunition is there.

567
01:16:47,946 --> 01:16:49,979
Give me a grenade!

568
01:16:53,054 --> 01:16:54,900
Ivan, a grenade.

569
01:17:43,519 --> 01:17:47,129
Comrade commander, this is...
He has golden trimmings.

570
01:17:49,413 --> 01:17:52,320
Colonel, why didn't your surrender
immediately?

571
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:56,364
Danica, tell him that he is personally
responsible for the death of these soldiers.

572
01:18:06,196 --> 01:18:08,744
I'm a general, not a colonel.

573
01:18:08,906 --> 01:18:11,848
If the warehouse didn't explode,
you wouldn't have captured us.

574
01:18:12,837 --> 01:18:15,152
I know what I can expect.

575
01:18:16,531 --> 01:18:19,750
You think, we will shoot you?

576
01:18:21,917 --> 01:18:24,263
Mr. general,
like all prisoners of war

577
01:18:24,431 --> 01:18:27,025
you will also be carrying the wounded,
do you understand!

578
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:30,595
I'm a general,
not a beast of burden.

579
01:18:30,877 --> 01:18:33,738
I would have your officer shot.

580
01:18:34,258 --> 01:18:37,398
I don't expect anything else for myself.
Shoot me!

581
01:18:38,737 --> 01:18:41,330
Novak, take him and keep an
eye on him!

582
01:18:41,449 --> 01:18:43,998
And this handsome shall carry the
typhus people.

583
01:18:44,161 --> 01:18:47,067
I understand, commander!
General...

584
01:18:50,723 --> 01:18:54,134
Drago, maybe we can exchange
them for medicaments. -I understand!

585
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:25,538
Here.

586
01:19:27,315 --> 01:19:28,611
Coat!

587
01:19:29,986 --> 01:19:33,520
Take off your coat.
Faster!

588
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,113
For the partisans.
