1
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:28,148
Why must you be this way?

2
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:31,413
Why is there always a problem?
It's a good question.

3
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:35,255
Do you want to go home?
Do you want to turn around?

4
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:38,656
- Yes!
- It's the Himalayas!

5
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:41,422
How long have I been talking
about the Himalayas?

6
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,760
- How long?
- Far too long.

7
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:48,733
Horst, when we get there,
can you give me a hand, please?

8
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,897
- Yes, of course.
- Ingrid, stop it.

9
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:13,694
Let's try to make the best of this.

10
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,357
Where's thls idiot
who's supposed to meet us?

11
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:21,459
Move!

12
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,971
Mr. Harrer.

13
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,702
I have your tickets.

14
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:32,644
- I'm late. Take me to my train.
- No, you don't understand.

15
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:36,114
I am Peter Aufschnaiter.
I am leading the expedition.

16
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:38,277
- How do you do?
- Here's our celebrity!

17
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:40,286
Mr. Harrer?

18
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:44,313
May I say, Mr. Harrer,
on behalf of the Reichssportsfuhrer...

19
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:47,589
we are honored to have
such a great German hero on the team.

20
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,130
Thank you, but I'm Austrian.

21
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:52,564
Yes. but I'm sure that
as a distinguished member...

22
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,659
of the National Soclalist Party,
you would be proud to plant...

23
00:04:55,736 --> 00:05:00,730
our country's flag on the summit
of Nanga Parbat when you reach it.

24
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,776
Hans Lobenhoffer.

25
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,436
Lutz Chicken.

26
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,976
And a picture with your lovely wife.

27
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,789
And Mr.--

28
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,792
Horst lmmendorf. Family frlend.
No plcture necessary.

29
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,130
When is the little one due.
Mrs. Harrer?

30
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,689
About the time my husband
reaches the base camp.

31
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,634
Thank you.

32
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,333
Why don't you tell the entire
stinking country our troubles?

33
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,509
I'm getting on that traln.
Do you have anything you want to say?

34
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,607
Fine.

35
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,752
Go. Leave.

36
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:50,146
I'll see you in four months.

37
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,391
- Take good care of her, Horst.
- I will. Heinrich .

38
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,406
We will travel 5,000 miles.

39
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,073
When we reach lndia,
we will head for the Hlmalayas...

40
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:24,083
and the ninth highest peak
on Earth, Nanga Parbat.

41
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:27,643
Germany calls it "Unserberg--
Our Mountain. "

42
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:31,858
Before us, four German expeditions
attempted it.

43
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:33,484
All failed.

44
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:37,224
Eleven climbers were killed
in storms and avalanches.

45
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:41,860
By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat
is a national obsession--

46
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:44,302
a matter of German pride.

47
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,235
July 29, 1939.

48
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:56,147
We have already made Camp Four
at 22.000 feet.

49
00:07:56,217 --> 00:08:01,211
Overhead is the Reklak Glacier
and a difficult climb up the icefall.

50
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,919
The baby must be
at least one month old now.

51
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:11,861
I have been
so confused and dlstracted.

52
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:14,730
I can 't climb
with my usual confldence.

53
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,523
Are you all right?

54
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,461
Shit!

55
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:55,902
- Are you al I right?
- Shall we come down?

56
00:08:58,212 --> 00:09:00,009
Lost a crampon !

57
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,810
Go ahead!

58
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:27,135
The weather's getting bad.
We should rope up.

59
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:34,180
- Did you hurt yourself back there?
- Just a scratch. I'll lead.

60
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,642
Rocks!

61
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,045
Look out below!

62
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,758
Hold me!

63
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,239
Have you got me?

64
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:44,217
Hold me!

65
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,412
You should have told me
how bad that wound was.

66
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:52,152
I should take a look at lt.
I could sew it up.

67
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:58,886
It's not your problem.

68
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,829
Actually, it is my problem.

69
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:07,025
- It's my life.
- What?

70
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,730
When you conceal a serious injury
and put my life at risk...

71
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:12,772
I consider th at my problem.

72
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,934
No, you put your life at rlsk.
I saved it, so shut up !

73
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,205
Please, it is not your place--

74
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,871
Shut up !

75
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,345
The next time you lle
about an lnjury, Heinrich...

76
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,253
you're off the team.

77
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,388
Try it.

78
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:56,637
August 4th, Camp Five.
Some fierce storms have passed.

79
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,702
My teammates are nervous
about the avalanches...

80
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,248
so we 've been holed up for days.

81
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:06,548
Aufschnalter should take advantage of
this lowland weather to make high camp.

82
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,283
But he disagrees with me. Fool.

83
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,328
It seems the others don 't mind
sitting here waiting...

84
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,160
hoping, doing nothing.

85
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:22,965
So much time to question
one 's self is not good.

86
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,531
I am beginnlng to think
this whole expedition was a mistake.

87
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,061
Run ! Avalanche! Get out!

88
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:55,362
Leave everything!

89
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,084
Put that down !

90
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,049
We are going down now!

91
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,989
If they're frightened of a storm,
send them down to Camp Two.

92
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:21,391
I could summit on my own !
Always give the best man his shot!

93
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,953
He's trying to tell us
he's the best man.

94
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:26,261
Give me two Sherpas.
I can make Camp Six by tonight...

95
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,267
and my final attack tomorrow!

96
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:31,304
- We are going down now as a team!
- I've earned that peak!

97
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,305
- I want th at peak!
- As a team! That's an order!

98
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:36,934
That is an order! An order!

99
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,737
Follow me!

100
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:45,103
Dalai Lama photo. Good protection.

101
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,045
Take it. Si Hib.
It will protect you.

102
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:51,482
No, that means nothing to me.

103
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,180
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama photo.

104
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:56,017
Si Hib, take it.

105
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:58,023
Good protection for you.

106
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:14,332
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.

107
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,569
Well, let's hope that Germany
retreats from Poland...

108
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,838
as quickly as you did
from your mountain.

109
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,380
It might save you some prison time.

110
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,084
What is this? Who are you?

111
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:30,180
- I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
- What charge? Failure to summit?

112
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,724
I'm afraid not.

113
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:37,057
You see, war has been declared between
Hls Majesty's Government and Germany.

114
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,193
So all enemy aliens on British Empire
soil are now prisoners of war.

115
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,914
- Stop, or I'll shoot!
- Hands up!

116
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,644
No, you don't understand!
I'm Austrian ! I'm a cllmber!

117
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:34,949
I have nothing to do
with your silly war!

118
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,055
I can walk myself.
This is an insult!

119
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:48,925
You think you have the last word,
but you don't!

120
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,766
Pigs! All of you, pigs!

121
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:07,186
October 15, 1939.

122
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:12,857
Reaching prison camp,
I make a promise to myself.

123
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:18,960
I will be lying beside lngrid before
the summer solstice of the new year.

124
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,392
The Hlmalayas are right in front of us.

125
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,439
It will be easy to escape
and get lost in them.

126
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,880
My fourth escape attempt
brings me no closer to my goal.

127
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:46,323
How far did you get this time?

128
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,329
All I have achieved is a certaln
dubious celebrity among the prisoners.

129
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,988
If only my hand could express
what is ln my heart.

130
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:35,771
I hear the guards
are mailing letters for you.

131
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:38,171
Yes.

132
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:40,713
Would you mail these?

133
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,683
Thank you.

134
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:48,118
Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?

135
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:50,554
It was checked out to you.

136
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,765
- We need to talk to you.
- What about?

137
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,299
About this.

138
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,710
Impressive. When do you plan to leave?

139
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,803
After monsoon season. And you?

140
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:19,711
I see you've chosen
my route through Tibet.

141
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:23,722
The few foreigners who have tried
never came back. So, good luck.

142
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,055
- Would you like to come with us?
- Why?

143
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:30,290
After all, you are the authority
on jailbreak around here.

144
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:33,924
- We could benefit from your experience.
- Please.

145
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,833
Stop this embarrassing charade.

146
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:43,140
Every time you escape,
the patrols are doubled and tripled.

147
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,475
It is making life very difficult
for the rest of us.

148
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:49,606
I prefer to travel on my own,
but thanks for thinking of me.

149
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,225
The mailman has come.

150
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:40,624
Dear Heinrlch:

151
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,397
Please sign the enclosed dlvorce papers
and send them to my lawyer.

152
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:48,532
Horst and I intend to be married
as soon as the divorce is flnalized.

153
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,542
As for your letter, yes.

154
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,569
Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born
while you were climbing the mountain.

155
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:58,584
He is now two years old
and calls Horst "papa. "

156
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,847
When he is old enough,
I will tell him...

157
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,549
his real father was lost
in the Himalayas.

158
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:05,682
It seems the kindest thing
to say consldering...

159
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,227
you never wanted the child anyway.

160
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:10,855
Needless to say,
I have no intention...

161
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,662
of "resolving our differences "
as you suggested.

162
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:18,192
They were resolved
the moment you left Austria.

163
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,434
I'm sorry you have been
imprisoned ln lndia...

164
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:25,706
and hope this dreadful war will soon
be over for everyone's sake.

165
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,371
Ingrid.

166
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:56,833
I'm coming with you.

167
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:07,079
This is your plan?

168
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:14,245
In my humble opinion,
this is ridiculous.

169
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,187
Then since you are so humble,
we won't ask your opinion.

170
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:05,032
Open the charts. Turn around.

171
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,007
Keep your back to the gate.
Open the charts!

172
00:26:24,324 --> 00:26:27,521
Keep talking. Wait for my signal.

173
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,653
We are clear. Okay.

174
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,702
Open the gates!

175
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:56,947
See to this. Open the gates!

176
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,093
I'm going off on my own.

177
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,219
So, good luck.

178
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:17,701
First escape from prlson camp,
November 18, 1939.

179
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,898
Rolf Harrer--
three and a half months old.

180
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:27,270
My 30th birthday, July 6, 1941.

181
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:32,182
Rolf Harrer-- exactly one year,
11 months and 26 days.

182
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:38,022
Last escape from Dehra Dun.
Rolf Harrer--

183
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:10,504
Take two and sleep it off.
I'll send you a bill in the morning.

184
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,514
What are you doing here?

185
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:21,747
I missed you so much.
I thought I'd pay you a visit.

186
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:28,159
What about the others?

187
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:30,855
The ltalians were caught
outside Nelang.

188
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,990
Lutz and Hans got sick
and had to turn back.

189
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:39,027
- Sorry to hear that.
- I'm sure you're heartbroken.

190
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:45,633
May I impose upon your generous nature
and camp here tonight?

191
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:47,645
Be my guest.

192
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:50,910
Thank you.
It is very gracious of you.

193
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,304
- Good.
- What else do you have in there?

194
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:15,602
A ten-piece orchestra?

195
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:20,078
By the way, I heard
the Japanese have retreated...

196
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:24,173
all the way back to Shanghai so even
if you make it to the Chinese border...

197
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,241
you may have dlfficulty
catchlng up with them.

198
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,947
I don 't care if they're repelled
all the way back to Tokyo.

199
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:31,012
You should if you want
to get back to Austria.

200
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,152
- But I don't.
- Don't what?

201
00:32:36,462 --> 00:32:39,158
- Plan to go back.
- Why not?

202
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:45,336
No particular reason.

203
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:47,201
When you get there, tell my wife...

204
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:51,300
that two years in prison camp is roughly
equivalent to four years of marriage.

205
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:53,937
And I'm glad to be free of them both.

206
00:32:56,949 --> 00:33:01,181
I'm not golng back either,
not until this shameful war is over.

207
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:03,984
- And where are you headed?
- Tibet.

208
00:33:04,056 --> 00:33:08,652
Then on to China.
see if I can find some work there.

209
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,194
And you ?

210
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:15,724
By my calculations, the Chinese border
is 2,058 kilometers away.

211
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,395
Tibet is 68.

212
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:22,635
It's a long way to travel
with such a heavy load.

213
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:26,109
No, just full of food.

214
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,976
- Precisely.
- Mine.

215
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,308
That's too bad.

216
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,219
Those mountains are treacherous.
There are glaciers to be crossed.

217
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,484
If you had roped up to me,
I could have kept you alive.

218
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,890
Considering your performance
the last time we roped up...

219
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,155
I think I'm safer without you.

220
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:48,728
Of course.

221
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:57,405
But I think you are wrong about
that Tibetan border calculatlon.

222
00:33:57,476 --> 00:34:00,673
By my measurements,
it is 65 kilometers.

223
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,850
Care to wager a kilo of food on that?

224
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:12,690
All you've got is some stale crackers.

225
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,856
But I'm right. I'll win.

226
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:01,270
Tibet, the roof of the world.

227
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,468
It feels as though we have
ascended a medieval stone fortress...

228
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:07,376
towering above the center of Asla.

229
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:09,937
This ls the highest country on Earth.

230
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:11,950
And the most isolated.

231
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,484
There it is.

232
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:25,429
Tibet.

233
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,262
- Exactly 68 kilometers.
- Congratulations.

234
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:33,935
Unfortunately, you've eaten
all your winnings.

235
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:53,286
Yes.

236
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,328
Just smile and say yes.
It's better that way.

237
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:02,127
It's amazing what you learn
in prison, isn't it?

238
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:13,569
Tibet.

239
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:18,876
- No foreigners allowed in Tlbet.
- Oh, please!

240
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:20,475
No foreigner!

241
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,544
Oh, please!

242
00:36:29,695 --> 00:36:32,858
Yes. Thank you. Of course.

243
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,394
No translation needed.

244
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,257
Some people are glad to see us.

245
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:38,626
Don't let it get to your head.

246
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:42,827
When the Tibetans clap hands, it means
they are driving out evil forces.

247
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,908
We need to find food.

248
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,953
It is the prophecy. It says here...

249
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:13,226
in the final testament
of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.

250
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:17,065
"It may happen that, in Tibet,
religions and government...

251
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:19,900
will be attacked by outside forces.

252
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:23,271
Unless we can guard our own country...

253
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,573
monks and their monasteries
will be destroyed.

254
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:30,411
The lands and property
of government officials will be seized.

255
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:34,316
The Dalai Lama an d all
the revered holders of the faith...

256
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:36,911
will disappear and become nameless."

257
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:40,686
Now you understand why we are not
welcome to forelgners here?

258
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:44,855
Yes, but you must understand
we're not here to threaten or harm.

259
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,160
We just need food,
and then we'll be on our--

260
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:49,258
His Excellency, the Garpon.

261
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:59,303
Your Eminence, we're happy to see you.

262
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,279
We wanted to apologize.

263
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:03,940
Apologize.

264
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:09,945
And give you this really special gift.

265
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,718
Please, from us.

266
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:18,058
Long live the Dalai Lama,
Hi s Holiness.

267
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,964
Thank you for the picture.
Go back to lndla!

268
00:39:34,446 --> 00:39:38,849
Two days into Tibet 's western frontier
and we are graciously klcked out.

269
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:42,182
Our guides have strict orders
to escort us...

270
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,417
to the lndian border
some 40 kllometers away...

271
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:48,324
and to shoot us
if we attempt escape.

272
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:24,187
Must mean hello.

273
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:26,527
As long as they don't try to kiss me.

274
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:33,294
We have to stock up. I'm broke.

275
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,674
Don't look at me.

276
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:40,109
We have to eat. Peter.
Know what time it is?

277
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,846
It is not negotiable.

278
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,407
My father gave it to me
when I climbed Mount BI anc.

279
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,612
Everyone's climbed Mount Blanc.

280
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:50,882
If I had a watch like this,
I would trade it.

281
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,034
- Where did you get this jacket?
- North Tibet.

282
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:39,627
Communlsm soldier come from Chin a.
Very nice.

283
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,674
They give food, money. Very nice.
Communism soldier.

284
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,710
You like military uniforms, yes?

285
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:52,681
I have German army boots.
For you. Yes?

286
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,116
Wait.

287
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,356
Give me these, for the guards.

288
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:06,898
Look!

289
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:15,132
Like this. You like?

290
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:19,310
Very good. They're tough.

291
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:23,144
My friend, shall I show you
how German soldiers march?

292
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,584
You must make this face.

293
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:42,130
Come! Yes.

294
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,793
Stop!

295
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,899
Excellent. Yes.
You, with practice.

296
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:53,438
Now, I will show you
how German soldiers run.

297
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,850
Stand like this.

298
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:50,067
Guess what?

299
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:53,534
All clear.

300
00:44:16,428 --> 00:44:19,090
Know what time it is?

301
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:26,002
You think I'm so happy
to be traveling with you...

302
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:28,631
I should foot the bill?

303
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:32,108
You are such a blg man
you don't need to contribute?

304
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:34,870
You have a problem?

305
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:36,380
Remind me...

306
00:44:37,516 --> 00:44:40,610
what you said at the bazaar back there.

307
00:44:40,686 --> 00:44:46,022
"If I had a watch like that,
I would trade it."

308
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,193
You do not have one.

309
00:44:51,263 --> 00:44:54,562
You cheap, lying bastard!
You have three!

310
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:09,113
This is junk
from some ltalian prisoners.

311
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:11,581
I don't give a shit!

312
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,777
Haven't you ever heard of a principle?

313
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:16,343
What principle?

314
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:19,413
You want a watch?
Go ahead. Pick one.

315
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:21,982
- And keep your principles.
- Look at you !

316
00:45:23,495 --> 00:45:26,589
Caught being a selfish brat
and you're gloating !

317
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:29,566
You're acting like an old woman.
What do you want?

318
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:33,002
Try apologizing.

319
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:35,130
Try feeling a little remorse.

320
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:38,699
And if all else fail s,
try wiping that smirk off your face!

321
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,211
Take your stinking watch
and shut up!

322
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:46,746
I don't need another boring sermon from
some frustrated glorified tour guide.

323
00:45:56,428 --> 00:45:58,794
No wonder you are always alone.

324
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:02,061
No one can stand
your miserable company.

325
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:36,466
Please, take them.

326
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,876
It was wrong of me to hide them.

327
00:46:59,157 --> 00:47:01,489
- Keep this.
- No.

328
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:10,558
I didn't deserve It either.
Go ahead.

329
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:30,354
He'll be three and a half years old now.

330
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,127
Pretty soon, she'll tell him
I was lost in the Himalayas.

331
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:42,966
Which is fine.

332
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,495
Why?

333
00:47:49,608 --> 00:47:52,702
Better a dead father
than a lousy father.

334
00:47:54,546 --> 00:47:56,480
Write him a letter.

335
00:47:57,983 --> 00:48:00,144
Let him know you're still alive.

336
00:48:08,994 --> 00:48:11,258
New York.

337
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:17,393
Venice.

338
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:26,304
- Paris.
- Your Holiness, where are you?

339
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:28,471
It ls time for your lesson.

340
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:38,755
Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.

341
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:43,451
Dear Rolf Harrer:

342
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:46,793
I'm a person you don 't know...

343
00:48:46,865 --> 00:48:49,663
a man you 've never met.

344
00:48:49,734 --> 00:48:52,464
But you are someone
who occupies my mind...

345
00:48:52,537 --> 00:48:54,437
and my heart...

346
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:56,599
in this dlstant land
where I have gone.

347
00:48:58,743 --> 00:49:02,702
If you can imagine a hidden place
tucked safely away from the world...

348
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:06,182
concealed by walls
of high, snowcapped mountains--

349
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,846
a place rich with all the strange
beauty of your nighttime dreams--

350
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:13,457
then you know where I am.

351
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:18,395
In the country
where I am traveling, Tibet...

352
00:49:19,297 --> 00:49:22,664
people believe if they walk
long distances to holy places...

353
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:25,567
It purifles the bad deeds
they've committed.

354
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:28,162
They believe
the more difficult the journey...

355
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,868
the greater the depth
of purification.

356
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:38,046
I've been walking from one faraway
place to the next for many years--

357
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:41,378
as long as you have lived.

358
00:49:42,554 --> 00:49:46,081
I have seen seasons change
across the high plateaus.

359
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:49,388
I have seen wild kiangs
migrate south in winter...

360
00:49:49,461 --> 00:49:52,396
and sweep back across the fields
when spring appears.

361
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,857
In this place,
where time stands still...

362
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,869
it seems that everything is moving...

363
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:01,703
including me.

364
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,078
I can 't say I know where I'm going...

365
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:10,171
nor whether my bad deeds
can be purified.

366
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:14,777
There are so many things
I have done which I regret.

367
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:19,687
But when I come to a full stop,
I hope you will understand...

368
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:23,387
that the distance between us
is not as great as it seems.

369
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,894
Wlth deep affection...

370
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:30,457
your father, Heinrlch Harrer.

371
00:50:31,436 --> 00:50:33,028
Get up.

372
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:44,606
My God!

373
00:50:49,354 --> 00:50:51,219
I'll give you these.

374
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:14,008
Yellow head!

375
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,014
- No! Wait! We have nothing!
- Give me money!

376
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:18,515
We have no money!

377
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,483
Give me watch !

378
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:23,077
- Give me clothes!
- We have nothing for you !

379
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,454
Wait!

380
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,095
Where are you headed?

381
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:45,398
I have permit.

382
00:52:56,848 --> 00:52:58,782
Lhasa. I have permit.

383
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,326
It is unseemly for the spiritual leader
of Tibet to spy on people.

384
00:53:54,372 --> 00:53:58,331
Only a month ago, we were certain
of death at the hands of bandits.

385
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:04,177
And today, we have reached the gates
of the forbidden city of Lhasa.

386
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:07,047
It is as difficult a goal as Mecca...

387
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:11,885
and preclsely as attractive
because it ls closed to all foreigners.

388
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,725
Even in our miserable condition...

389
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,786
we feel the lure
of Tlbet 's holiest city...

390
00:54:18,863 --> 00:54:21,263
home of the Dalai Lama.

391
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,035
Only a few foreigners
had penetrated its mysteries.

392
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:33,264
Oh, my God!

393
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:48,008
- Is It over?
- No. it is not over.

394
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:32,329
You are invited to stay
for lunch, if you like.

395
00:56:33,531 --> 00:56:35,123
We'd like that very much.

396
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:39,599
I am Tsarong. Welcome to my home.

397
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:42,071
I am Peter.

398
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:48,741
Lord Chamberlain, may I request...

399
00:56:48,813 --> 00:56:52,476
an audlence with the regent
and ministers of the cabinet?

400
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,919
It's about two foreigners
who came to Lhasa.

401
00:57:01,993 --> 00:57:03,927
With respect, Rinpoche...

402
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:07,990
If your intention is to stop the Chinese
from recruiting political allies...

403
00:57:08,066 --> 00:57:13,470
then demanding that they stop
trying to bribe monks...

404
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:15,938
is not the most effective tactic.

405
00:57:18,209 --> 00:57:22,509
I asked the opinion of the ministers,
not that of a mere secretary.

406
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,344
Of course. Forgive me.

407
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,285
You may leave now.

408
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:34,848
Start translating the letter
as written .

409
00:57:34,926 --> 00:57:37,486
Of course.

410
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:58,078
Do you realize how many men
could survive such an ordeal?

411
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,051
We should respect them.

412
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,180
If we return them to lndla,
they'll surely go back to prison.

413
00:58:05,256 --> 00:58:08,589
But they have no purpose here,
Kungo Tsarong. No place to live.

414
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:12,493
I have invited them to stay
at my guest quarters...

415
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:16,897
assuming you would grant them permission
to remain in Lhasa, of course.

416
00:58:16,968 --> 00:58:19,835
Invited them to stay at your place?

417
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:21,895
But why?

418
00:58:21,973 --> 00:58:24,999
Must one have reason
to help those in need?

419
00:58:28,146 --> 00:58:29,636
Beast.

420
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:36,419
I think she said you stink.

421
00:59:11,522 --> 00:59:14,389
You do not need
to introduce yourselves.

422
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:16,393
I know who you are.

423
00:59:17,228 --> 00:59:19,526
I am Pema Lhaki.

424
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:23,397
Ngawang wishes to make a gift to you,
so please take your clothes off.

425
00:59:27,572 --> 00:59:29,767
Let's get started.
I don't have all day.

426
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:35,143
Well, this is most kind
of Ngawang Jigme.

427
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:37,681
Who is he to be so thoughtful?

428
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:40,216
Secretary to the ministers
of the government.

429
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:42,946
He wished to make you
a gift of new clothes.

430
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:46,046
Please select your preferred
article of clothing.

431
00:59:48,693 --> 00:59:50,320
You're a seamstress?

432
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:54,455
I am a tailor, sir,
the only tailor in Lhasa...

433
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:58,366
who has been to Calcutta and
can reproduce these silly costumes.

434
01:00:01,072 --> 01:00:03,973
So, I pick?

435
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,509
Yes, choose whichever you like.

436
01:00:10,348 --> 01:00:12,543
- And you can make any of these?
- Yes.

437
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:16,386
- Very good.
- Did you make this?

438
01:00:16,454 --> 01:00:19,685
- Yes.
- Beautiful.

439
01:00:19,757 --> 01:00:21,452
- Th ank you.
- Do you like this?

440
01:00:21,526 --> 01:00:23,460
Whichever you like.

441
01:00:26,531 --> 01:00:29,227
I will have this handsome tweed jacket.

442
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,963
And this pair of sporting
woolen trousers, please.

443
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:35,403
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

444
01:00:35,473 --> 01:00:37,407
And you, sir?

445
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:43,707
- Perhaps you could choose for me.
- Thank you.

446
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:51,344
Please, sir, take off your chu-pa.
I would like to measure.

447
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:05,930
Stand still, please.

448
01:01:10,141 --> 01:01:12,075
Thls way, please.

449
01:01:16,614 --> 01:01:18,548
- Stand still.
- Sorry.

450
01:01:27,525 --> 01:01:30,221
- No moving, please.
- I'm sorry.

451
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:42,134
That way, you will never fall.
It's perfect.

452
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:45,869
Still, walking up mountain s
is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich.

453
01:01:45,943 --> 01:01:48,309
Not so foolish, really.

454
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:54,373
Look at this.

455
01:01:56,854 --> 01:01:58,412
Go ahead.

456
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:06,357
That's after I climbed
the Eiger North Face.

457
01:02:10,868 --> 01:02:16,272
That's Olympics.
Gold medal. Not important.

458
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:21,300
Then this is another great difference
between our civilization and yours.

459
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:23,142
You admire the man...

460
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:27,378
who pushes his way to the top
in any walk of life...

461
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:30,818
while we admire the man
who abandons his ego.

462
01:02:33,557 --> 01:02:36,856
The average Tibetan wouldn't think
to thrust himself forward this way.

463
01:02:53,778 --> 01:02:55,837
Gentlemen.

464
01:02:59,183 --> 01:03:01,743
- I'm sorry. Have we met?
- No, we have not.

465
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,379
I am Ngawang Jigme.

466
01:03:08,526 --> 01:03:11,518
- Yes, of course.
- Forgive us.

467
01:03:11,595 --> 01:03:14,291
Thank you for your generous gift.

468
01:03:14,365 --> 01:03:16,560
It's wonderful. Thank you.

469
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:23,399
You are most welcome.
I am sure we will meet again.

470
01:03:34,652 --> 01:03:38,520
Perhaps you could help us explain...

471
01:03:38,589 --> 01:03:40,682
why the min isters...

472
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:44,558
demand that the Chinese government...

473
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:48,530
"...cease making generous
financlal contributions...

474
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:52,763
to Tibetan monasteries."

475
01:03:52,837 --> 01:03:57,171
Do our gifts displease your government?

476
01:03:57,241 --> 01:04:01,439
I cannot speak for the regent
nor the ministers, Excellence.

477
01:04:01,512 --> 01:04:03,844

479
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,563

482
01:04:27,304 --> 01:04:30,102
would be richly rewarded here.

483
01:04:33,344 --> 01:04:37,007
Serving my country faithfully
is reward enough, Excellence.

484
01:04:40,284 --> 01:04:42,252
I ask permission to take my leave.

485
01:05:52,857 --> 01:05:55,553
It looks like we're both in need
of a good tailor today.

486
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,018
Yes, there's a--

487
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:01,327
Please, take a seat.
