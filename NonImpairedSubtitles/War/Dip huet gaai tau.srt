1
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:40,713
Mom
Have you washed your hair?

2
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,153
Always trying to be Elvis,
you'll never make it!

3
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:52,098
Yeah, just fooling around,
don't tease me!

4
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:41,216
Isn't it pretty?
Ellen! Take a look! Ellen!

5
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,988
Hey man!

6
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,451
Frank! Still pissing around?

7
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:57,962
Told you to watch out for cops!
Your dad got arrested!

8
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:01,295
Mom! I'm your son!

9
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:47,715
Dad, quit this sweeping job.

10
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:49,648
When I get a real job...

11
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,415
It's destiny, I'm a nobody. It's OK.

12
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:55,547
But my son
won't be sweeping streets.

13
00:03:55,892 --> 00:04:00,386
It's a cruel world, money talks.
Without it you're shit!

14
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,427
Remember! If you get a break,
hang on in there!

15
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:31,549
All workers, come join in our strike.

16
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,525
Come on!

17
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:47,101
Here comes Prince Charming.
Here for Jane?

18
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:49,842
Here's an orange to shut you up!

19
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:56,474
You too! The work OK ?
It's OK !

20
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:58,677
Are you sure it's okay?
Let's go.

21
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:21,609
Wash up those glasses!
So slow! Hey! Watch out!

22
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,071
Hey! What's up!

23
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,009
Hong Kong sucks!

24
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,311
We'll get nowhere
in this place.

25
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:34,684
I don't want to be a nobody

26
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,987
for the rest of my life.

27
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:39,355
Wherever you go,

28
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:41,760
count us in!

29
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:45,532
Yeah, we're just like windflower;

30
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:50,801
settling down
wherever the wind takes it,

31
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:52,969
we're all orphans here.

32
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,609
One day,
I'll come back in a Mercedes.

33
00:05:57,881 --> 00:06:01,578
Let's not wait,
we'll go drive a Mercedes now.

34
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:12,626
Whoever loses, buys!

35
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:14,786
It is a deal!

36
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:16,297
You'll lose!

37
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:42,914
You're gonna lose, Paul!

38
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,059
No way, I'm winning!

39
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,624
Don't fall in the sea, Frank!
No sweat, watch out.

40
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,630
You watch out!

41
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:55,297
Frank, go get it!

42
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:00,336
I won!

43
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:06,074
Grab me, Ben. Help me up

44
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:09,274
Punk fell in the gutter...

45
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:13,149
His girl's gonna cry.

46
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:20,190
His body's so stinky,
she doesn't find it kinky.

47
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,694
Smells like ammonia.

48
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:25,165
He's mad that he fell, ah!

49
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:27,701
Gutter smells ain't so swell.

50
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:33,835
I'm scared by the mob.
What will happen?

51
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:37,171
Let's get married.
Now? When we have no money?

52
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:40,439
Poor people can get married.
I don't care about the future.

53
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:43,916
Just want to be a bird
and be free to fly around.

54
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,819
Go places, see the world.

55
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,016
I know there are
great places out there!

56
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:53,790
I want you to come too.

57
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,030
Are you dreaming?

58
00:07:56,265 --> 00:08:00,964
It's not a dream.

59
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,558
Offer tea to your in-laws.
Mind the knees!

60
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:32,893
Make room, Marilyn Monroe's here!

61
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:41,137
Going down, careful!

62
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:47,973
Frank!
What are you doing here?

63
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:51,311
Is the banquet money OK ?
No problem, trust me, don't worry!

64
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,421
Are you sure?
No problem! Get inside!

65
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:54,850
Frank,
remember to change out of the suit.

66
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:57,084
Go inside, go on!
Try and get there early!

67
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:12,898
Cheers!

68
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:16,100
Thanks for coming,
help yourselves, drink up.

69
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,874
The bride and groom, photo time.

70
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:44,566
Mr. Kwai, take a seat!

71
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,103
Is the money OK ?

72
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,800
Your guarantee?

73
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:54,741
You sure you can pay?

74
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,511
No problem! My dad makes
that much in one session!

75
00:09:57,954 --> 00:09:59,148
Right! I trust you.

76
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,257
Thanks Mr. Kwai!

77
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:05,824
What time is it?

78
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,327
Ten Thirty!
Thanks!

79
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,235
Frank baby.

80
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:21,742
Ringo!

81
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:23,036
You're stepping on my turf!

82
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,874
Really? Sorry, sorry man!

83
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:26,606
Let me through,
it's important, please.

84
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:27,977
Son of a bitch

85
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,219
Bastard, don't run!

86
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,430
Punk,
I know you've been seen Kwai.

87
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:44,863
Give me the cash.

88
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:48,696
That's enough, Ringo.
You've made a fool out of me.

89
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:51,739
If you want more.
We'll fight again one day!

90
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,967
But this money is staying with me!

91
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,908
Shithead, you ain't got no choice!

92
00:10:57,146 --> 00:11:00,240
No... You can't.

93
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:03,314
No? Come on!
Bastard!

94
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:04,983
Give it back.

95
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:13,989
You bastard!

96
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,361
Mr. Shing,
show me how to make a buck.

97
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,701
You gotta take risks!
Take my word for it.

98
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:28,240
The more chaos,
the easier the cash.

99
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,403
Vietnam's at war,
there's no law and order.

100
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:36,883
Smuggling, drugs,
anything goes to make a buck.

101
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,281
What's bugging you?

102
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:42,681
Frank's not here,
hope nothing's wrong!

103
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:46,489
Don't worry, he's always like this.

104
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:54,899
Thanks for coming.
Let's see the guests out.

105
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,407
Thank you!

106
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:08,640
Hey, Frank!

107
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:13,614
Here I come! Ben, Ben!

108
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,519
You're late, everyone's going!

109
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,094
Scared you shitless, Huh?
Only if you didn't show up!

110
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,492
You can trust me man.

111
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:29,532
The boss is getting impatient, got it?

112
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,798
Yeah, let's go!

113
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:34,099
Frank is late, drink!

114
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:36,575
Let's wait for Paul!
Yeah!

115
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:37,677
Paul!

116
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,178
Hey come on! Booze time!
This one's for you!

117
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:44,479
It's your wedding,
drink to the fool.

118
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:58,695
Let's see the bride!
Yeah the bride!

119
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,493
What happened?

120
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:04,562
Nothing, what?

121
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:12,438
Oh that? Fell in the gutter,

122
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:14,674
I was rushing, fell down!

123
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:15,909
In a gutter?

124
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:23,720
Yeah, yeah, 'Punk fell in the gutter'

125
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:35,734
'His girl's gonna cry'

126
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:37,395
You're terrible!

127
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:41,771
'Smelly like stale fish'

128
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:54,784
'And his girl's gonna fry'

129
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:02,162
Hey, as your pal,
can I kiss the bride?

130
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:04,698
No sweat, only her hand,
she's safe

131
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,390
He's really coming!

132
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:10,237
Congratulations, all the best.

133
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:11,500
Don't let him kiss you!

134
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:13,006
I've asked Ben,
he said your hand's OK .

135
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:15,370
Right Ben?
Jane, don't let him!

136
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:22,173
He cheated, he kissed my face!

137
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:28,148
You guys are always the boss.

138
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:30,519
What's this boss crap?
We're all just trying to make a buck.

139
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:33,253
We're buddies, right?
And buddies are all equal.

140
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:48,473
Punk, spineless worm,
you only know how to fight.

141
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:50,134
Got beaten again!
Dad, forget it!

142
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:53,838
Please stop making a scene!
So what?

143
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:58,610
Bastard!
You good for nothing!

144
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:02,756
Get lost!
I don't care! You're not my son!

145
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:22,936
It's you? What's the matter?

146
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,050
What happened to your head?
Nothing! I fell in a gutter.

147
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:34,588
It's nothing! Only a bit of blood.

148
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:38,051
I'm used to getting beaten up by mom.
Nothing new!

149
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:47,432
Hey!

150
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:51,767
You crazy!

151
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:58,605
If it's only bruised
it won't hurt so much.

152
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,410
You've been bleeding all night,
it must hurt.

153
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,980
Now will you tell me who did it?

154
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:10,918
Ringo! He wanted to take it.

155
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:16,423
I wouldn't let him, so he did this.

156
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,193
With what?

157
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:19,733
A glass bottle.

158
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,805
Hey! What are you doing?

159
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,922
What are you doing? Stop!
Stop!

160
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:54,766
Stop! Get him.
Stop!

161
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:00,369
Ringo!

162
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:04,742
Did Frank cross you?
He made me mad!

163
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:07,814
Go to hell!

164
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:56,492
Die, die!

165
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,791
Ben... Ben...

166
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:07,702
Paul, open up!

167
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:11,575
What happened?
We killed Ringo.

168
00:18:11,814 --> 00:18:14,908
What now?
I don't know, run I guess.

169
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:21,587
Wait a second.

170
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:31,663
Sorry! I really got you screwed,

171
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:33,700
and Jane too.

172
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,695
We owe you so much.

173
00:18:57,393 --> 00:19:00,294
Is Ben there?
What's the matter?

174
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:03,190
He's wanted for murder,
we're looking for him.

175
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:32,656
Ben, Frank, Paul!

176
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:36,253
Fatso?
I brought you lots of food. Come on!

177
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,989
Were you followed?
No, I was smart this time.

178
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:40,223
Change your clothes.

179
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:41,859
Change your look,
then no one will know.

180
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,265
Lots of people on your back!

181
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:46,533
The police, Ringo's boss

182
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:48,904
and Mr. Kwai's out for you, Frank.

183
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:51,671
Yeah?

184
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,445
How's Jane?

185
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:57,508
She's OK , the cops talked to her,
she's scared!

186
00:19:57,686 --> 00:20:00,484
Don't worry, I'll look after her.

187
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:14,628
I got your passports.
Thanks Mr. Shing!

188
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,667
I've got a friend
called Luke over there.

189
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,931
He'd help you to solve problem.

190
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:22,066
Take these two boxes of penicillin,
Rolexes and medicine.

191
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:27,271
To the Saigon coast,
hand it to Mr. Y.S.Leong.

192
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,112
No tricks, he's dangerous.

193
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:35,517
OK, Mr. Shing!

194
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,961
Overthrow the government,
we want liberty.

195
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,563
Long live Communism!

196
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:46,156
Overthrow the British government,
we want liberty,

197
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:47,562
Jane, this way.

198
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,831
The mob's here again.
I'm scared.

199
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:58,978
Jane, watch out.

200
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:58,099
Jane.
What are you doing here, go

201
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:06,405
I want to talk to you!
I don't want to hear it!

202
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:10,574
It is dangerous here, follow me!
Run, what's the matter, run!

203
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:38,902
Feel hard?!

204
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:47,616
Run, or you'll be recognized
by the police.

205
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:49,555
I have to leave Hong Kong
for a while.

206
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,050
You do whatever you want to do,
as usual.

207
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:55,959
You even killed somebody
on your wedding night.

208
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:03,167
Don't worry, Jane.
I'll be back for you.

209
00:23:03,272 --> 00:23:07,072
Forget it, everywhere is the same.

210
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:10,277
The future cannot be foreseen,
God knows!

211
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:18,815
Anyway I'll take care of myself.
Take care!

212
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:20,814
No matter what, the goods come first.
It's our lifeline.

213
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:23,076
It's so peaceful,
doesn't seem to be at war.

214
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:24,980
Who gives a shit,
the war's their problem.

215
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:26,884
They're killing Vietnamese,
nothing to do with us.

216
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:29,947
We're here to get rich!
Then move on to Thailand!

217
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:31,753
Will we make it?

218
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:34,521
No sweat! Smugglers -
they're all millionaires.

219
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,632
With a new place there's new hope.
And this is our new hope.

220
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:41,165
Guess how I'm gonna spent
my first million!

221
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,362
Buy yourself a Mercedes!
That's obvious!

222
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:47,067
Dummy! Would I risk my life
for a friggin' Mercedes?

223
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:50,007
Either I don't go back,
or I go back loaded!

224
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:52,706
If I make a fortune, first,

225
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:54,213
I'd buy my mom
loads of embroidered slippers,

226
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:56,374
Then she can't hit me
with her wooden clogs!

227
00:24:56,485 --> 00:24:58,476
I only want to go back for Jane.

228
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:02,556
Then I'll get you your ticket!
You better mean it. I'll remember

229
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:31,708
Wow! What a scene!
Hey! What's happening?

230
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:00,113
Get out.
Hey! What's happening?

231
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:01,641
Bomb!

232
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:13,989
Grab the goods!
Forget it!

233
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,224
My stuff!
Come on! Let's run!

234
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:35,138
My stuff, Oh no! It's over!
It's your life! Run!

235
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:43,289
Officer. Run! Run!

236
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:56,403
Forget it! Let's split! Run!

237
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,858
Don't fire! Don't fire!

238
00:28:05,974 --> 00:28:08,374
No! I'm Chinese, Chinese!

239
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,974
Don't move!

240
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:22,448
Look up!

241
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:27,627
Did you plant the bomb?
No!

242
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:28,961
Denying huh?

243
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,932
If he gets it wrong, we're in hell!

244
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:37,032
I won't let him shoot me!

245
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,002
It's gonna be OK ! We're not local!

246
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:42,542
Shut up! No talking! Don't move!

247
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:45,311
Did you plant the bomb! Speak up!

248
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,678
No! Sir, I didn't!

249
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:55,683
Look up!

250
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:58,224
Sir, I'm HK people...Sir!

251
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:06,290
No! I'm HK people!
No! No sir, I'm HK people!

252
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:12,403
We're HK people!
Please, don't hit...

253
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:15,599
It's him! Grab him!

254
00:29:23,518 --> 00:29:24,610
Are you OK ?

255
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,712
We wanna take some pictures.

256
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:31,419
Who are your accomplices?
Pig.

257
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:34,222
Move on! No photos!

258
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:37,392
Bastard! Who's behind it?
Come on talk!

259
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,131
Tell me where your accomplices
are hiding?

260
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,061
We have the right to know!

261
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:47,333
Bastard! So you won't talk!
Right? Well die!

262
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:48,901
Go inside!

263
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,222
In our business,
we can't be running scared.

264
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,497
With a gun in our hands,
this world is ours.

265
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:54,169
This is Y.S. Leong's hole
Wow! It's impressive!

266
00:30:56,845 --> 00:31:00,042
It's the first time
I've been in a place like this!

267
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:01,547
Well, time to broaden your mind!

268
00:31:30,145 --> 00:31:31,339
Excuse me!

269
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,141
Excuse me!

270
00:31:39,187 --> 00:31:40,586
Excuse me! You...

271
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:52,193
You should take Mr. Leong
as an example!

272
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,630
He's really a big shot, his nose
is in the air!

273
00:31:56,671 --> 00:32:02,166
How come Hong Kong singer is here?

274
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:11,310
Excuse me, I want...
Are you from Hong Kong?

275
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:12,747
You're Chinese? Great!
Yes

276
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:15,319
You know a guy called Luke?
I'd like to talk to Luke.

277
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:18,048
Hey! That Frenchman?
Is he a foreigner?

278
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,350
He's a Eurasian. Take a seat!

279
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:22,860
If he knows his friends are coming,
he will look for you!

280
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:24,328
Thanks!

281
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:28,263
Sweet heart, come over here!
Oh no...!

282
00:32:28,536 --> 00:32:29,935
Be good!
Stop it!

283
00:32:32,107 --> 00:32:34,098
Mr. Leong, would you please ask them
to behave themselves!

284
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:36,640
I'm here just to drink with them,
no hanky-panky!

285
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:42,246
I'm sure you're used
to being caressed by strangers.

286
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:47,246
Are you Sally?

287
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:53,292
Any problem?

288
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:59,055
There are tons of girls like her!
Oh my God!

289
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:03,627
Can I be of any help to you?
Why should you help me?

290
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:05,437
Because we are Chinese!

291
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,305
Wait for me at the bridge tomorrow!

292
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,880
Promise to come. It's a deal!

293
00:33:20,522 --> 00:33:22,319
Shit, I've got to go!

294
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:32,963
I told you not to talk to strangers,
go back to your seat!

295
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:39,967
You're looking for me?

296
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:41,969
Are you Luke?

297
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:45,342
I'm so happy to see you!
Take a seat!

298
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,973
I'm tied up with something,
see you later!

299
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:58,655
Good night, my friend!
Good night!

300
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:02,018
Havana

301
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:04,428
Thank you!

302
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:31,655
Mr. Chan, our goods
were being hold up by your customs.

303
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,657
Mr. Leong,
these goods are so important!

304
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:38,797
Currently my boss
wants to visit the States.

305
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:42,534
I'd like to buy him
a return air ticket.

306
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:47,269
How much is the ticket!
U.S.$100,000!

307
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:52,871
So you're a greedy person!

308
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:56,639
Fine with me U.S.$100,000!

309
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,043
Have you been waiting long?
It's alright!

310
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:07,847
Luke, let me introduce you!

311
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:10,553
Have we met?
How are you!

312
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,560
What now? Anything I can do?

313
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:23,398
Originally, we brought some goods
to be exchanged with Mr. Leong.

314
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:25,664
Unfortunately we ran into trouble,
everything's gone!

315
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:28,068
What now?
Get something out of Leong!

316
00:36:28,343 --> 00:36:30,038
But this is not our original plan!

317
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:31,770
You want to be in jail in HK?

318
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:33,904
You want me to lead
a dog's life forever?

319
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:36,913
I've forgotten I have a father
who is a sweeper.

320
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:38,510
What you want?

321
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:40,348
Today I saw some soldiers
killing people,

322
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:41,752
I learned something!

323
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,756
In this world if you have guns,
you have everything!

324
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:45,951
Tell me what's the value of human life!

325
00:36:47,895 --> 00:36:50,193
I'm a bit worried
you'll get involved!

326
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:52,960
Leong is so powerful
because he's got weapons.

327
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:57,831
I need a gun!

328
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,237
I'm not sure it's right or wrong,
but anyway I'll try my best!

329
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:22,222
Wait! What is going on?

330
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:25,154
I want to prove something!

331
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:28,200
Two cokes, please!

332
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:30,164
Two cokes!
Yes!

333
00:37:32,974 --> 00:37:34,168
$14

334
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:35,906
We have no money!

335
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:40,937
You must pay me!
Don't mess around!

336
00:37:41,149 --> 00:37:43,447
I have none...
Hurry up! Give me the money!

337
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:45,618
Don't do that, you'll hurt somebody!
Let's go!

338
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,809
Look, such an easy job!

339
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:48,148
Let's go, we'll be in deep shit
if the cops are around.

340
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:50,722
Give it to me!
Hurry up, you bastard!

341
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:54,019
Give me the money to get lost!
Don't shoot... don't...!

342
00:37:54,295 --> 00:38:00,200
You! Don't move! Don't mess around!
Oh shit!

343
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:05,735
Got the money! Let's go!

344
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,142
I'll shoot you bastards!
Get back!

345
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:13,340
Shit, the soldiers are coming!

346
00:38:15,516 --> 00:38:18,508
Don't shoot!

347
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:24,221
Lie down, lie down...

348
00:38:25,193 --> 00:38:27,286
Don't shoot! Don't... I surrender...!

349
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:29,295
Lie down!

350
00:39:11,873 --> 00:39:13,067
Get it! Let's go!

351
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:18,070
Let's get in!

352
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,547
Wow, what a fucking world!

353
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:24,912
This is really a fucked up world!

354
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:27,987
There are big robberies and there
are smalltime crooks. You scared?

355
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:38,162
Peace no war! Peace no war!

356
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:54,507
We want the governor
respect our peaceful desire.

357
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:57,514
Stop the war, respect human rights.

358
00:39:57,685 --> 00:39:59,676
Peace no war! Peace no war!

359
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:05,258
Peace. No war!

360
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:22,407
Stop!

361
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:25,802
Peace no war! Peace no war!

362
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:31,351
Peace no war! Peace no war!

363
00:42:11,585 --> 00:42:14,281
Don't worry, Jane.
I'll be back for you.

364
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:18,085
Forget it, everywhere is the same.

365
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:21,956
The future cannot be foreseen.

366
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:30,163
I'm sure I can't get away.

367
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:33,534
A year ago, Leong signed me
up to sing in the nightclub.

368
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:36,302
He told me I'd make a lot of money!

369
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:40,843
At that time, I was only dreaming...

370
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:43,609
The moment I arrived in Saigon,
he took my passport

371
00:42:43,784 --> 00:42:45,081
and did not allow me to go away...

372
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:46,914
He even forced me to deal
in drug-trafficking,

373
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:48,911
and made me a whore.

374
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:55,751
I don't want to see you dead,
you're my little moneymaker.

375
00:42:55,896 --> 00:43:00,094
In 10 years time
you'll forget everything.

376
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:05,229
Forget you've been in Saigon,
forget you were a whore,

377
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:06,838
won't that be swell?

378
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:18,748
There's no one to help you?

379
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,517
Yes...

380
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:45,602
Please get me out of this shit,
please...

381
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:51,743
We snuck out
to see the boats here,

382
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,120
We wished one day we'll get on one
of these boats and sail away.

383
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:57,582
Let's go!

384
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:00,923
I just wanted you to kill people!

385
00:44:01,028 --> 00:44:02,620
I didn't tell you to take her away.

386
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:19,007
Don't worry!
We traveled here by boat!

387
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,270
We'll travel back by boat too!

388
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:36,862
Are you sure there will be guns?

389
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:41,763
Don't worry, just stick with the plan.

390
00:44:42,036 --> 00:44:43,435
We've gotta trust him.

391
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:46,071
Yeah, that's what friends are for!

392
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,437
This lot is better than the last.
It's here.

393
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:49,836
Check it out!

394
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:59,781
Have you got the gold leaves?
Yes.

395
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:10,660
Havana.
Thanks.

396
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:20,031
The same one?
Yes.

397
00:45:29,984 --> 00:45:33,886
This contains a list of names
and contacts of CIA agents.

398
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:38,154
You'll make big money selling guns
to North Vietnam for us.

399
00:45:38,425 --> 00:45:42,225
Right, no problem,
we'll split the profits.

400
00:45:57,044 --> 00:45:57,942
Come in!

401
00:46:02,316 --> 00:46:04,011
Hello, Luke!

402
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:10,885
My friends, Paul, Ben and Frank.

403
00:46:11,091 --> 00:46:12,388
They're friends of Mr. Shing.

404
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:13,820
Mr. Leong, nice to meet you.

405
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,422
Mr. Leong!

406
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,868
Well, the youth of today, huh!

407
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:29,365
Well, What do you have for me?
Penicillin.

408
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,805
Great! The North needs that stuff.

409
00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:33,173
Check it out!

410
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:35,609
It's OK !

411
00:46:37,117 --> 00:46:39,813
I trust you
since you're Luke's friends.

412
00:46:46,961 --> 00:46:49,452
Relax downstairs, have a drink,
have some fun, OK ?

413
00:46:54,668 --> 00:46:56,966
Help yourself.

414
00:46:57,137 --> 00:46:58,434
Luke, go have a drink, too.

415
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:01,030
I won't, someone's waiting for me!

416
00:47:01,842 --> 00:47:04,640
Still the Don Juan, huh?

417
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,515
I hope no one gets killed.

418
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:17,546
I don't give a damn,

419
00:47:18,325 --> 00:47:19,917
I'll kill anyone who gets in my way.

420
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:26,960
Ben!

421
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:29,001
I'm worried.

422
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:32,635
Don't worry!

423
00:47:44,284 --> 00:47:46,582
Miss Yen, are you all right?

424
00:47:49,523 --> 00:47:51,320
I like that song you sing
'Windflower'

425
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:53,323
Will you sing it for me?

426
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,418
Mr. Leong!

427
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:22,512
Sit down, how is it?
Had something to drink?

428
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,688
A bit.

429
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:26,089
A bit isn't enough! Come,
get some more glasses.

430
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:28,286
You all gotta drink.

431
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:32,428
Do you know her?

432
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:39,328
You Hong Kong boys are real Romeos!

433
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:44,872
Got your eyes on my girl
before the deals even done!

434
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:47,307
Mr. Leong, you got it wrong,
we didn't mean it like that.

435
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:49,414
We just like her singing.

436
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:52,608
I also heard,
you wanted to take her with you!

437
00:48:58,258 --> 00:48:59,953
She's my trump card,

438
00:49:00,794 --> 00:49:02,591
I spent a lot grooming her.

439
00:49:04,131 --> 00:49:05,428
Mr. Leong, you got it wrong.

440
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,296
We already liked Sally
when we were in Hong Kong.

441
00:49:09,837 --> 00:49:11,634
Loved her singing.

442
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:14,801
We were staring at her
because it was strange.

443
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:17,533
She seems to have changed!

444
00:49:18,745 --> 00:49:20,337
She's not beautiful anymore.
Ben!

445
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:25,177
She's lost her innocence,
she's not happy anymore.

446
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:29,184
What sort of grooming is that?

447
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:32,483
Are you accusing me?

448
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:38,463
No one dares to talk
to me like that!

449
00:49:41,301 --> 00:49:44,202
Young man, you've got guts!
Bring the booze!

450
00:49:49,643 --> 00:49:51,838
Let's empty the bottle.

451
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:08,025
I made the screwup, it's my fault!
I'll drink!

452
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:30,973
Right! Real buddies!

453
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:32,582
Since you're buddies,

454
00:50:32,686 --> 00:50:34,176
all three of you drink!

455
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:41,750
Ben, what's wrong with you?

456
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:43,726
You call yourself our pal?
Don't let him step on us!

457
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:46,932
Aren't you being selfish?
Don't let him step on us!

458
00:50:47,234 --> 00:50:48,531
What did you say?

459
00:50:48,702 --> 00:50:51,102
You screwed up,
don't drag me into it!

460
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:58,970
That's what the fuck you think.
Stop it!

461
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:02,339
What are you two fighting about?

462
00:51:06,086 --> 00:51:09,180
Serves you bleeding right!
Stop it!

463
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:21,999
Ben!

464
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:25,029
You traitors!

465
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:29,865
Bastard!
Look after Ben.

466
00:51:33,046 --> 00:51:36,038
Old shithead! Pull him up!
Run!

467
00:51:51,265 --> 00:51:53,961
Go back, quickly!
Let me go, let me go...

468
00:51:54,468 --> 00:51:56,766
Don't come over!
Don't move! Or I'll kill him!

469
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:03,074
One more step and I'll shoot!
Help!

470
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,607
Don't come over!
Kill them!

471
00:52:14,388 --> 00:52:16,083
Let me go or you'll die!
Watch him.

472
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:18,087
Ben, where are you going?
Ben!

473
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:23,789
Bitch! You're not going anywhere!

474
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:33,197
Sally!

475
00:52:34,408 --> 00:52:37,002
Ben?
Frank is back!

476
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:44,947
Don't move!

477
00:52:45,252 --> 00:52:47,743
Sally, Sally!

478
00:52:51,591 --> 00:52:53,388
Will me make it?

479
00:52:54,795 --> 00:52:56,092
Let's go now.

480
00:52:58,065 --> 00:52:59,157
Watch out!

481
00:53:26,259 --> 00:53:28,659
Are you guys crazy?
Stuck with this dame.

482
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:30,126
Do you wanna get us killed?

483
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:33,289
I promised her I'd take her away.

484
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,595
That's your damn business,
leave me out of it.

485
00:53:35,702 --> 00:53:36,896
Stop it, Paul!

486
00:53:37,003 --> 00:53:39,597
If we're still buddies.
It's not important.

487
00:53:39,806 --> 00:53:40,704
Let's get the hell out first!

488
00:53:40,874 --> 00:53:42,364
No way! You'll never leave!
Stop fighting!

489
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:49,344
Get down!

490
00:53:52,853 --> 00:53:57,847
Where are the gold leaves?
Luke! Where is the gold?

491
00:53:57,991 --> 00:53:59,982
Where's Sally's passport?
I don't know.

492
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:02,684
You said it was here!
Where's the gold?

493
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:04,524
In the safe.

494
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:06,028
Where is Sally's passport?

495
00:54:06,133 --> 00:54:07,430
You'll get it over my dead body.

496
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:22,807
Where 's Sally's passport?
Speak up!

497
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:24,746
You'll have to kill me first!
I bet it's in the safe.

498
00:54:25,018 --> 00:54:27,213
Bastards!
You won't get out of here alive.

499
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,756
Sally, don't worry! Ben will help
you, even without your passport.

500
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:39,659
We could be refugees,
sneak in Hong Kong.

501
00:55:00,687 --> 00:55:01,881
Sally!

502
00:55:08,195 --> 00:55:10,891
You see! I told you not to worry.

503
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:12,828
We'll get back to Hong Kong, right!

504
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:16,129
Hey! Release Mr. Leong!

505
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:33,346
Take your clothes off.

506
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,088
Boss!...

507
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,116
Not Mr. Leong, he's our brother.

508
00:56:05,452 --> 00:56:06,350
Go to hell!

509
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,914
Where's my passport?

510
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:46,884
My passport's gone!

511
00:56:47,127 --> 00:56:48,321
Sally keep cool!

512
00:56:56,303 --> 00:56:57,998
Bitch!

513
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:02,965
Sally!
Stay away!

514
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,600
Help!

515
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:08,112
Bastard! Don't touch my gold!

516
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,050
How dare you take my gold! My gold!

517
00:57:12,252 --> 00:57:15,346
You can't, give it back...

518
00:57:15,555 --> 00:57:16,453
Let her go!

519
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:20,115
You're a dead duck!
You want her, right?

520
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,852
Sally!

521
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:29,090
Sally!

522
00:57:46,786 --> 00:57:49,380
Don't move!
Stay away!

523
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:51,215
Stop stalling for time.
Or I'll kill them.

524
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,490
Don't move! Wanna die?

525
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:03,193
This is Vietnam,
you won't get out alive!

526
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:05,698
You Shut up!

527
00:58:07,374 --> 00:58:11,470
Punks, you won't get out of Saigon!

528
00:58:12,646 --> 00:58:15,444
Drive, just go on! Go on! Quickly!

529
00:58:16,983 --> 00:58:18,280
Come on!

530
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:20,509
Drive!

531
00:58:29,596 --> 00:58:32,497
Ben, get in, quick, quick!

532
00:58:35,935 --> 00:58:37,732
Get in, quick, quick!

533
00:58:51,685 --> 00:58:53,482
You'll be OK, don't be afraid.

534
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:10,329
What do we do?

535
00:59:13,073 --> 00:59:15,871
Don't worry, I used to work
for the CIA, I'll handle it.

536
00:59:19,779 --> 00:59:20,973
What are you doing here?

537
00:59:21,047 --> 00:59:25,143
Sorry sir, I have a pass!
What happened?

538
00:59:25,385 --> 00:59:27,979
We're being attacked by Vietcong,
it's dangerous here.

539
00:59:28,121 --> 00:59:29,315
You better get out of here.

540
00:59:29,422 --> 00:59:32,016
One of our friends
is seriously hurt!

541
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:34,649
OK , but take care.
Thanks!

542
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:35,850
Let them pass!

543
01:00:06,726 --> 01:00:09,524
Can't turn back now!
Let's just get through! Quick!

544
01:00:29,516 --> 01:00:31,814
Please, let me in the car!
Help me, take me...

545
01:00:31,885 --> 01:00:35,878
Go away, Bastards...

546
01:00:47,834 --> 01:00:49,131
They're so pitiful!

547
01:01:09,489 --> 01:01:11,184
Move, move! Bastards!

548
01:01:14,294 --> 01:01:15,386
Drive on, faster!

549
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,480
Frank, start from there,

550
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,422
plant a mine every three steps,
just in case.

551
01:01:47,594 --> 01:01:48,993
Right!
Quickly!

552
01:02:09,682 --> 01:02:10,774
You OK ?

553
01:02:21,194 --> 01:02:24,095
Hang on. You'll be OK .

554
01:02:25,732 --> 01:02:28,530
Will we make it?

555
01:02:29,135 --> 01:02:33,128
We'll get away! The boat
will leave soon, don't worry.

556
01:02:34,107 --> 01:02:35,404
Really?

557
01:02:36,609 --> 01:02:38,600
Really! Believe me.

558
01:02:40,213 --> 01:02:42,613
I told you,
once we'd have the chance to leave.

559
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:44,477
We'll go back to Hong Kong together.

560
01:02:47,253 --> 01:02:48,345
Be strong.

561
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:52,285
You'll make it back to Hong Kong.

562
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:55,257
I've got a record of yours at home.
Waiting to be autographed.

563
01:03:02,535 --> 01:03:05,527
Hey! Luke, is the boat coming?

564
01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:08,298
If those Vietnam bastards get here,
we'll be dead!

565
01:03:08,508 --> 01:03:09,702
Is the boat coming?

566
01:03:11,511 --> 01:03:15,311
Hey! What do you want?
Answer me OK ?

567
01:03:15,448 --> 01:03:20,044
Are you human?

568
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:21,413
Spare a thought for us.

569
01:03:22,055 --> 01:03:23,955
You only care about your gold,
what about us?

570
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:26,014
Are you blind? Can't you see?

571
01:03:30,563 --> 01:03:34,260
Frank! What are you doing?

572
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:36,526
I feel like shit!

573
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:54,079
Ben, the boat's here!
