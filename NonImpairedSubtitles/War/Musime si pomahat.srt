1
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,606
Well, friends, my wife's waiting.

2
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:28,246
My dad believes it won't
last longer than a few months.

3
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:30,654
We won't intrude for
very long, Herr 'iek.

4
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:33,655
It's terrible, David.

5
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,898
We must be hopeful.

6
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:38,982
Herr 'iek.

7
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,759
There's jewelry in my dad's study.
You know where.

8
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:45,628
Just in case.

9
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,466
- Do you need some help?
- Hi.

10
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:52,529
This is Mr. Imaek.
The younger Mr. Wiener.

11
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,804
- Imaek.
- He's my neighbor Franta.

12
00:03:57,678 --> 00:03:59,703
He's a good man.

13
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:34,276
Something small for the journey.

14
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,125
Well, good-bye.

15
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:53,634
- We're very sorry.
- It's not your fault.

16
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:57,364
Aunt Frieda wrote that
it's okay in Theresienstadt.

17
00:04:57,438 --> 00:04:59,702
Children go to school.

18
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:03,608
There's an orchestra,
food, even hot water.

19
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:08,877
Maybe better than squeezing
in the kids' room here, eh?

20
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,047
We just don't know why
she mentioned Uncle Otto's cough.

21
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:16,612
We're all getting sick now.

22
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:21,287
It's just that Uncle Otto's
been dead for 15 years.

23
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:34,736
Good luck.

24
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,506
Al'ik!

25
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:17,373
Come here.

26
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,242
Herr imaek.

27
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,272
Oh, my God.

28
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,511
Mr. Wiener,
what are you doing here?

29
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,416
I need help.

30
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,547
If somebody sees you,
they'll execute the whole street.

31
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:33,582
I don't have a choice.
I have to hide.

32
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:39,124
Good God! Get out of here!

33
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,191
We have children.

34
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,235
Jew!

35
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,302
AJew is here!

36
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:51,743
AJew is here! Help!

37
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:32,142
DIVI DED WE FALL

38
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:02,538
Can't those bastards be quiet?

39
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:07,678
Bastard means
a child out of wedlock...

40
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,280
and these are
our neighbors' children.

41
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:12,348
Exactly.

42
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,419
I don't know what drives
people to keep breeding...

43
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:18,795
and multiplying.

44
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:22,393
Must be some twisted
self-preservation instinct.

45
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:31,238
Even if you could have
a child, you know...

46
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:36,141
I still wouldn't bring it
into this world.

47
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:39,652
But it's not like that.

48
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,121
Oh, please,
don't believe in miracles.

49
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,715
- Don't pray to her for a kid.
- I don't pray to her.

50
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,591
- Oh, you do.
- I do not.

51
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:52,496
Then pray.
Don't you think I know you?

52
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:58,334
You always get
that holy expression.

53
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:01,772
Your eyes get moist...

54
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:05,778
and then things
start happening inside.

55
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,780
You're nuts.

56
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:15,481
Well, and now
your Nazi friend is here.

57
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:17,524
United we stand...

58
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:21,322
My friends, good morning.

59
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:33,869
- God damn your jokes.
- I've got something for you.

60
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,573
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

61
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:43,541
I have a surprise for you.

62
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:50,480
Shall we have some
real coffee, Josef?

63
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,583
You shouldn't have.

64
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,595
You can't tell me what
I should and shouldn't do.

65
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:59,360
If I can, I give.
I was never stingy.

66
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:03,802
By the way, Josef, I arranged
papers allowing you to drive.

67
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,304
Thank him.

68
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:10,139
- Thank you, Mr. Prohaska.
- Horst.

69
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,506
You're in a good mood today,
aren't you?

70
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,278
Why not?

71
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:20,809
Don't trust London, Josef.

72
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,379
Hey, I see through you, Boss.

73
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:25,618
Relax. I'm not petty,
and I was in the Patriots' Club.

74
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:28,685
Come, madam. Have a look.

75
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,723
- Josef, you're not interested?
- But, of course.

76
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:36,201
Don't say a thing.

77
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,568
Your head is full
of Stalingrad...

78
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,301
and the never-ending siege
of Leningrad, right?

79
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,778
I will straighten out
your errors and illusions.

80
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:49,179
Imagine this is Moscow.

81
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,549
These are our armies
on the eastern front.

82
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,319
The retreat back to Rzhev
and Vyazma was a brilliant move...

83
00:11:57,391 --> 00:12:01,794
by our offensive
headquarters, understand?

84
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:06,822
They created an amazing
maneuvering space, right?

85
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,030
And as spring follows winter,
the Fuhrer renews his forces.

86
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:16,065
And he will pound this space
with all his crushing might.

87
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:20,671
And by the by,
it's about 250 divisions.

88
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,340
And not only German.

89
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:28,487
And Bolshevism will suffer
at the hands of Hungarians...

90
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:30,489
Italians, Spanish...

91
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:33,185
volunteers from
France and Belgium...

92
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,353
and even the Slovaks.

93
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,155
Cigarette?

94
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,428
I wouldn't deprive you
of 15 crowns.

95
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:42,867
Well, actually 20.

96
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:49,735
Incidentally...

97
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,610
a new family is moving
into Wiener's villa tomorrow.

98
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:59,310
The house has been cleaned
and sterilized.

99
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:02,248
It could be worse.

100
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,316
So tomorrow they're moving
into Wiener's villa.

101
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,789
I hope you're not going
to keep on pitying them?

102
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:14,459
He wasn't just our employer.
He was also...

103
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,162
our acquaintance, wasn't he?

104
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,726
Careful.

105
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:24,873
He was your superior,
and you were my superior. That's all.

106
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:27,379
Today my superior is Herr Kepke.

107
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:31,407
Okay, but he was
a decent man, wasn't he?

108
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:34,045
He did things for you, too,
didn't he?

109
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:39,855
Look, you can't expect me
to show sympathy to some Yid...

110
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:42,418
or any other enemy of the Reich.

111
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:47,433
Come and have a look, madam,
at this husband of yours.

112
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:51,904
He used to be the energetic boss
of the sales department.

113
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,142
And now he's sitting here
like this, sipping coffee.

114
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,580
Maybe you'd better start
working before they notice.

115
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:07,918
Maybe you all might have
found out that while...

116
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:11,389
building the border
fortifications...

117
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:17,294
a transom fell and broke my leg
in three places.

118
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:19,924
So for your information
that means I'm disabled.

119
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,195
I know, a loser... A hero.

120
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,931
I almost forgot.

121
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:29,102
Look at this. Perfect work.

122
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:31,337
Our Leni embroidered this.

123
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,936
Isn't she clever?

124
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:36,346
She said it was for the uncle
who always sleeps.

125
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,749
I have one just like it, but...

126
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:41,879
I never have time to use it,
so much work...

127
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:49,153
- What are you pretending to be?
- Why, you, you sleepyhead.

128
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:52,127
And you laugh.

129
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,894
Come lie down.

130
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:58,134
Lie here and rot.

131
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,071
You're also a hero.

132
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,008
Goddamn it. This...

133
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,917
You have it in your pocket.
Let me see.

134
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,922
Come on. I'm not a child.
What about my head?

135
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,958
Wear this cap.

136
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,359
- I look like a beetle.
- But it suits you.

137
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:29,629
It doesn't really matter,
does it?

138
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:34,834
- Is that good-bye?
- No.

139
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:37,775
It's risky, isn't it?

140
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:40,575
And all of a sudden,
we understand each other.

141
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,911
Just a hint is enough for me.

142
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,609
So don't go. Who's making you?

143
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,553
Haven't we done enough for them?

144
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:56,027
Who knows if
they'll ever come back.

145
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:59,463
- Let me.
- Oh, please.

146
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:03,663
Please, I can tie
my own shoelaces, huh?

147
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:08,265
I can't leave them
to those Nazis.

148
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,003
Understand?

149
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:15,344
I made a promise,
and I need to keep it.

150
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,948
It works.

151
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:44,393
Mr. 'iek...

152
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:50,871
David!

153
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,708
Can you take the light
out of my eyes?

154
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,012
- What are you doing here?
- I escaped from Poland.

155
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,387
I needed something valuable.

156
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:12,227
- But you can't stay here.
- I'm off tomorrow night.

157
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,894
But you don't understand.
You can't stay for even a minute.

158
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,699
Germans are coming
tomorrow morning.

159
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,041
- And with you?
- Where with us?

160
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,049
Oh, you mean at our place.

161
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,704
God, what are you doing here?

162
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,146
I was afraid.

163
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,979
- Come on. Let's go.
- Who is it?

164
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,324
Good evening, Mrs. Marie.

165
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,824
David.

166
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,794
Let's go.

167
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:27,900
What is that?

168
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:32,737
I shit my pants. Turn it off.

169
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,515
Take my hand.

170
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,859
You want some jam on it?

171
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,528
- Close the door.
- I am.

172
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:10,310
You know, this is no longer
exactly a safe area.

173
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:14,719
A safe place.

174
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:20,586
It's full of collaborators
and finks.

175
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,993
You wouldn't believe...

176
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:31,633
what abnormal times
can do to normal people.

177
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:36,808
The swine.

178
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,579
I would.

179
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:44,879
What about your family?

180
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:49,354
I don't know.
They're probably dead.

181
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:58,824
You wrote that conditions
in Theresienstadt were okay.

182
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:05,504
No one could write the truth
from there.

183
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:09,542
It's just a transfer station...

184
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:12,635
to the camps in Poland...

185
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:16,545
and nobody there is supposed
to survive.

186
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:18,743
Nobody at all.

187
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:25,288
I was lucky to work where
they sort confiscated goods.

188
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:29,124
Clothes and valuables.
And after 18 months I was able...

189
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:31,562
to bribe one of the SS men.

190
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:35,766
Two of us escaped.

191
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,004
And what do you plan
to do here?

192
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,845
I lived here all my life...

193
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:54,580
so I thought maybe
someone here might help me.

194
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,324
But what are you
going to do now?

195
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:07,796
Tomorrow I'm meeting a friend
at a set place out of town.

196
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:12,168
I promised to get some money
and then we'll move on.

197
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:19,734
Well, I'll give you a lift there.
I have papers.

198
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:24,547
And I have a car
borrowed from...

199
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,979
an ex-coworker.

200
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:33,119
He worked in your warehouse.

201
00:22:33,193 --> 00:22:36,594
- Before the war.
- Obviously.

202
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:56,665
Maybe your friend
waited somewhere else.

203
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:58,938
No.

204
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:04,609
They probably got him.
I'll go on myself. You go back.

205
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:08,916
- Thank your wife again.
- Maybe he'll still come.

206
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,481
Something might have kept him.

207
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,992
Maybe.

208
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,500
Halt! Come here.

209
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,266
Oh, my God.

210
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,449
Good morning.

211
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:14,976
Excuse me, please.
We're having car trouble.

212
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:19,014
- How can I help you?
- A number 13 wrench.

213
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:23,256
- A number 13 wrench.
- Yes, I understand.

214
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:27,894
- Number 14.
- 13.

215
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:32,802
14. I'm familiar with Tatras.
It's a Czech car.

216
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:34,806
Oh, right.

217
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:39,973
Number 14, wrench number 14.

218
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:42,776
You've saved our lives.

219
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:46,046
We've been getting soaked here
for an hour already.

220
00:25:53,193 --> 00:25:57,687
- Do you have enough gas?
- Just a moment.

221
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,495
Do you have enough gas?

222
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:04,166
Shit!

223
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:08,832
I'm all thumbs.

224
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:14,736
You are very helpful and kind,
and very funny.

225
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:17,180
Number 14.

226
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,772
Start it up, please.

227
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:52,852
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

228
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,055
Thanks a lot.

229
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,935
Oh, my God.

230
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,111
David.

231
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,915
Thank you.

232
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:46,236
- What are you doing?
- What?

233
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:49,002
I'm darkening the windows,
and you turn on the light.

234
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:52,636
- But you're already done.
- Damn it. We must be careful.

235
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,771
Good heavens.

236
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:57,782
- That's mine.
- Let go.

237
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,148
Thanks a lot.

238
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,986
I know how risky it is for you.

239
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,184
This is for you.

240
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,160
- What is it?
- Oh, no.

241
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:13,996
David, you're not serious.
Keep them.

242
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,332
Come on. Let's go.

243
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:20,963
Go, go.

244
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,509
You're afraid, aren't you?

245
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:35,677
Before the war
many people had these made.

246
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:41,455
They suspected what was to come...

247
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,428
and made these shelters.

248
00:28:44,497 --> 00:28:48,934
Now they're used
as safes or pantries.

249
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:54,531
I even helped to make
the one at your father's.

250
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:03,011
Below here are the stairs.

251
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:06,882
You can hear what's happening
in the house.

252
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,820
And here bars were torn out.

253
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:13,017
Now it leads to the rain gutter.

254
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:17,461
Here's a mattress. Heat will
come in from the next room.

255
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,691
The pig must go.

256
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,972
I'll take care of it.

257
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,076
At night you can come out
if you want, okay?

258
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,669
Well, we'll have to see.

259
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:36,442
But he has to wash himself,
doesn't he?

260
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:40,179
Yeah, but mainly
he has to be quiet.

261
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:43,586
If something happens,
scratch softly...

262
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:47,693
like a mouse, okay?

263
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:52,822
Here are some blankets
and a kerosene lamp.

264
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:55,026
Good night.

265
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:56,898
Good night.

266
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:02,673
I'll bring you a warmer blanket.

267
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,277
David...

268
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:12,316
Good night.

269
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:31,935
We have to do something
immediately.

270
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,404
About what?

271
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:36,999
About getting rid
of this problem.

272
00:30:39,178 --> 00:30:41,840
We have to eat it.

273
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:44,712
- We'll simply eat it, right?
- Oh, God.

274
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,646
But what about him?

275
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,453
What? Do you want
to send him away?

276
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:58,828
Come on. Want. Don't want.
Does it depend on what I want?

277
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:03,795
Could I have imagined
I'd be left out of all this?

278
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,035
We watched from the window...

279
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:11,304
and told ourselves
it was just passing by.

280
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:15,370
Today it's after us.

281
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:21,818
I expected something like this,
but I'm still shaken up.

282
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:26,787
Look, nothing changes
if you send him away.

283
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:29,623
They catch him around
the first corner and then...

284
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:32,493
they'll find out he was here.

285
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:37,867
That he was here
and that you didn't report him.

286
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:41,373
So, what are you saying?
That makes it easier then.

287
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,068
You want to turn him in?

288
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,074
- What?
- You want to report him?

289
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,106
- Oh, please, really, Marie.
- You decided for him...

290
00:31:51,184 --> 00:31:54,551
for you, for me
and for everyone on this street.

291
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:59,187
- And are you blaming me or what?
- No.

292
00:31:59,258 --> 00:32:01,658
I'm not blaming you.

293
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:05,424
It's just good
that we have no children.

294
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:07,932
You're so right.

295
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:34,418
What an awful smell.

296
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,986
It's soap.

297
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:40,555
It's really waking me up.

298
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:45,196
He has to help us with it.

299
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:49,274
You think he'd allow pork
past his lips?

300
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:54,974
In the circumstances,
he should eat what he gets.

301
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:59,950
Oh, it was hard
and risky work...

302
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,953
getting it here.

303
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:06,049
Hands up!

304
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:12,955
- That'd surprise you, eh?
- What an idiot.

305
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,830
Josef, you're asking for trouble.
What is all this?

306
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,731
Marie, you can smell these
shenanigans down the street.

307
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:24,970
You're asking to be searched.
Show me.

308
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,147
It's not tough yet,
just like the times themselves.

309
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,514
But they will be.
My hat, please.

310
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:36,213
I hope you didn't get
my car all greasy.

311
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:44,494
Josef, you're really
asking for trouble.

312
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,727
And what are you
going to do with it?

313
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,167
We'll eat some.
You can have some.

314
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:55,537
Something I'll take.
Something I'll give.

315
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:59,806
Marie, come have a look.

316
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:03,007
- Look at this beauty.
- Where did you get it?

317
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,313
We confiscated it yesterday.
They won't need it anymore.

318
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:11,015
And here it will add
a certain flair.

319
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:17,624
So, have you decided?
The position with us is still open.

320
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,908
I feel so good here with you.

321
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:35,872
Josef always had class.
He knew how to live.

322
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:42,545
And he got me the job
at the warehouse, right?

323
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,251
TheJew Wiener was stingy,
but good during the crisis.

324
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:50,055
I fed three kids.

325
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:56,760
Bastards. Now they're used to it
and can imagine nothing else.

326
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:02,502
Josef, do you still remember
the boy that everyone called...

327
00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:05,009
Wurst instead of Horst?

328
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:08,513
- You know, Wurst like sausage.
- I know what wurst means.

329
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,677
Wurst, fetch me a beer.

330
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,949
Get out of here, Wurst.
Back to the Reich.

331
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,420
Back where? My home is here.

332
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,931
You mean with us?

333
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,927
Certainly.

334
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:35,235
Josef accepted me
almost like a son.

335
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:41,975
He sent all those jokers packing.

336
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:44,414
- By the way, is there any beer?
- No.

337
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:50,547
Come on. Accept. Didn't accept.
That was long ago.

338
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:54,922
I can remember once...

339
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:57,588
Today we all just
laugh about it.

340
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:01,895
Today, I've simply accepted you.

341
00:36:03,636 --> 00:36:08,505
We need to help each other.
I was in trouble yesterday.

342
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:12,133
Tomorrow it might be you.

343
00:36:14,246 --> 00:36:19,081
Especially, if you treat
the law on hoarding like you do.

344
00:36:19,151 --> 00:36:23,110
That'd mean prison, Marie.
But it's delicious.

345
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:31,761
- Nothing will be forgotten.
- Hey, cut it out. Kindly stop it.

346
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,322
See how he stares at me?

347
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:38,695
Don't stare.

348
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:42,537
- Please, Wurs... Horst.
- Thanks. I've had enough.

349
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:52,517
You think I don't notice
how some people avoid me?

350
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:58,779
How they cross to
the other side of the street?

351
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:01,656
That's their business.

352
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:08,900
What have I done to them?
To anybody?

353
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,504
I'm helping decent people.

354
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:17,032
Is that a sin?

355
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,510
No, it's not a sin.

356
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:26,611
Everybody just talks about
helping, gabs and gabs.

357
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:30,052
This means helping to me.

358
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:35,484
- So you're actually a hero.
- What do you mean hero?

359
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:39,793
Who would be foolish enough
today to act like a hero?

360
00:37:42,368 --> 00:37:44,097
What about you?

361
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,901
You sit here either
stuffing yourself with pork...

362
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:50,999
or wallowing on the couch.

363
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,773
We have to survive.

364
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:04,255
Every lovely thing
should survive, be saved, eh?

365
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:34,877
What are you doing here?

366
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:37,684
You have to come home, Dad.
Herr Kepke is waiting.

367
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:41,817
Is that how you knock on the door
of nice people? Idiot!

368
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:48,030
- This is Karl. Say hello.
- Good afternoon.

369
00:38:49,435 --> 00:38:51,096
Good afternoon.

370
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,661
I delivered him with
my own hands. Wait outside.

371
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:58,874
Get rid of everything.
Properly. People are pigs.

372
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:01,879
You might be turned in,
and what could I do about it?

373
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:05,974
To be safe, skin a rabbit
to be able to show the bones.

374
00:39:35,814 --> 00:39:39,807
Since we're
in this situation...

375
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:44,822
we must follow certain rules.

376
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:52,094
He drops by whenever he wants.
Do you understand?

377
00:39:52,164 --> 00:39:54,564
- Please.
- Well, what?

378
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:59,093
He comes by to see you.
I'm just...

379
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,507
an excuse.

380
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:12,013
Well, deprive him of it.
Take that job he's always offering.

381
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,548
Oh, Marie, it's not...

382
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:22,853
You think l...

383
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:25,260
I should...

384
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,958
What?

385
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:29,762
Do you know where
you're pushing me?

386
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:33,498
- What's that look?
- Do you know what you're asking?

387
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:38,100
You brought David here,
so do what you have to do.

388
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,615
What are you doing?
Why are you setting it there?

389
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:50,246
We agreed on some rules, right?

390
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,257
And you're playing
restaurant here.

391
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,351
Take it to him there
immediately.

392
00:40:56,428 --> 00:40:59,625
Rules will be observed.
Take it to him there.

393
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:03,031
This is not a roadside inn
for fugitives.

394
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:05,764
But it's dark outside,
and it's locked.

395
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,706
He can't be locked
in that hole day and night.

396
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:12,403
- Give them to me.
- Listen.

397
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:17,074
There is nowhere dark enough
to hide us, darling, eh?

398
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:21,176
So take it and bring it
to him there. Go!

399
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:24,188
- Josef, please.
- Please.

400
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:28,921
Don't say please. Go.

401
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:31,292
- Why are you pushing me?
- Sorry.

402
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,888
Wish him bon appetit.

403
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:42,640
Goddamn it!

404
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,677
Thank you.

405
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,773
You're welcome.

406
00:41:55,487 --> 00:41:58,979
- Your husband is right.
- I know.

407
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,420
But it's one thing to be right...

408
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:09,729
and another to be able
to stand such things.

409
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:16,805
Do you need anything?

410
00:42:20,612 --> 00:42:23,103
Aren't you cold here?

411
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:33,156
Did you finish the book?

412
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:37,722
I can't read much.

413
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:46,131
Are you thinking about
what happened to your family?

414
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,215
Kaje, my sister...

415
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:05,823
could have saved herself...

416
00:43:05,891 --> 00:43:08,257
at least for a while.

417
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:17,667
After arriving at the camp,
she was offered to be a kapo...

418
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,068
provided she'd be hard enough.

419
00:43:31,216 --> 00:43:33,309
She was given a club...

420
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:39,649
and told to beat
our parents to death.

421
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:50,367
I could see
my father and mother...

422
00:43:50,435 --> 00:43:53,893
kneeling there,
begging her to do it.

423
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:42,982
Come.

424
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,917
Nice.

425
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:50,724
I haven't seen your wife
for a long time. How is she?

426
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:54,027
Oh, yeah. She's started
studying French.

427
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:56,124
- With whom?
- What?

428
00:44:56,201 --> 00:45:00,137
- Who's she taking lessons from?
- By herself.

429
00:45:01,206 --> 00:45:03,470
By herself?

430
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:08,411
Well, when such
a beautiful woman has no kids...

431
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,972
she never knows
what to do with herself.

432
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,611
She's been ill a lot lately.
I never see her.

433
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:18,383
No, no, Josef.
You can't refuse medicine.

434
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:20,584
- Well, thanks then.
- Just take it.

435
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:23,355
I know a good doctor.
You could go to him.

436
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:27,228
Confidential information:
They're sniffing everywhere.

437
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,961
They no longer trust anyone.
Anything can be an excuse.

438
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:35,132
That some Czech starts
with French before knowing German.

439
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:38,233
- Oh, come on...
- Don't underestimate it.

440
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,835
You also need to train
your facial expression.

441
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:44,370
The Germans read faces.
They are excellent typologists.

442
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:50,354
Every day you must practice
that irreproachable loyal expression.

443
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:54,915
It's easy for you.
You were born with it.

444
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:57,791
No, I wasn't. Try it.

445
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:02,564
Relax the muscles.

446
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,165
Now!

447
00:46:08,273 --> 00:46:10,571
Now I don't know what
you're thinking about at all.

448
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,873
- Neither do I.
- Don't laugh.

449
00:48:11,129 --> 00:48:16,965
This was my son Andreas'
favorite composition.

450
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:23,198
The one who fell, a hero...

451
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,211
at the defense of Kharkov.

452
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:31,948
Go to your room, Willy.

453
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,592
You know, gentlemen...

454
00:48:44,663 --> 00:48:48,656
of course it saddens me greatly.

455
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:52,362
But pride is stronger.

456
00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:58,002
And I'm aware of
the significance for us...

457
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:03,537
of the loss of
a single young German life.

458
00:49:05,884 --> 00:49:08,114
Lately I read...

459
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:12,680
a fascinating article about this.

460
00:49:13,892 --> 00:49:19,694
Somebody exactly calculated
that the life of one German...

461
00:49:19,764 --> 00:49:22,756
a soldier...

462
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,361
is worth 20 Slavs and 100 Jews.

463
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:29,430
- A hundred?
- Yes.

464
00:49:40,785 --> 00:49:45,722
I brought you something.
Vitamins and a sunlamp.

465
00:49:49,394 --> 00:49:54,127
A big empty house and
you're stuck in this hole, huh?

466
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,600
I feel so sorry about it.

467
00:49:57,669 --> 00:50:02,072
I'm afraid our neighbors
will figure something out.

468
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,200
I don't trust anyone anymore,
and them least of all.

469
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:15,583
I have no one
to speak to anymore.

470
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:19,021
It's enough to speak
to you sometimes.

471
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:25,255
Thanks to that I can stand it.

472
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,592
Me too.

473
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:31,533
We just have a bigger
and lighter cell.

474
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,634
What is it?

475
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:38,866
Do you need anything?

476
00:50:41,112 --> 00:50:43,478
Well, I think I caught a cold.

477
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,316
That's too bad.

478
00:50:58,797 --> 00:51:01,391
Here's a pillow.

479
00:51:13,511 --> 00:51:15,479
Well, good night.

480
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:19,608
So that old Kepke
isn't a bad boss, eh?

481
00:51:19,684 --> 00:51:21,481
'Night.

482
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:24,886
What about Marie?

483
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,186
She's alone all day.

484
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:31,456
Perhaps a visit from me
would cheer her up.

485
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:35,659
Like I said, she doesn't
feel well, Horst. 'Night.

486
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:25,806
I am in Paris.
I visit the museums...

487
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:34,318
The Louvre is very nice.

488
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:50,133
I visit it three times.

489
00:53:01,886 --> 00:53:04,582
You must be crazy.
I thought you were sleeping.

490
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:07,557
Did you get the medicine?

491
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:12,927
Of course, but Prohaska
walked me all the way here.

492
00:53:12,997 --> 00:53:15,488
What if he'd come up?

493
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:19,526
You once called him a snoop,
didn't you?

494
00:53:29,114 --> 00:53:30,513
Horst...

495
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:34,518
Careful about darkening
the windows, Josef.

496
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,848
'Night.

497
00:53:38,857 --> 00:53:44,523
I just don't want you going
in there when I'm not home.

498
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,531
- He's not well.
- So give him another blanket.

499
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,662
I already did. I gave him
a fur coat and the sunlamp.

500
00:53:52,737 --> 00:53:54,705
- What?
- What?

501
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,434
My sun?

502
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:02,143
I don't feel well either,
and you give him my sun.

503
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:04,841
Go to bed.
I'll make you some tea.

504
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:07,441
If there's any left.

505
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,920
Don't you want to wall him
in there so you can relax?

506
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:19,922
Josef, he's really sick.

507
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:24,332
Exactly. You might catch
something from him.

508
00:54:27,605 --> 00:54:29,197
What are you doing?

509
00:54:29,274 --> 00:54:31,708
I'm going to sleep here
in case he needs anything.

510
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:35,234
No, I'm sleeping on the couch.
Go to bed.

511
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:40,945
Don't worry. I'll stick
a slipper in the door.

512
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,180
You're such a...

513
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,204
This life is for shit.

514
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,640
Good night.

515
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:43,045
I stand beneath the carob tree

516
00:55:44,182 --> 00:55:49,518
And it's not easy

517
00:55:50,355 --> 00:55:55,019
I sit beneath the fig tree

518
00:55:56,628 --> 00:56:02,692
And all is green and free

519
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:09,263
I lie beneath the almond tree

520
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:15,040
And it's like a dream

521
00:56:30,695 --> 00:56:34,495
My gorilla

522
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:37,500
Has a villa in the zoo

523
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:40,298
My gorilla

524
00:56:40,371 --> 00:56:43,465
Lives contentedly and true

525
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,509
He can't speak of politics

526
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:49,910
But if his wife has got the itch
he can scratch it

527
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:23,269
- Good afternoon.
- Agata, come on home!

528
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:31,513
I need to buy a briefcase...

529
00:57:56,114 --> 00:57:57,479
Thank you.

530
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:05,155
Excuse me.

531
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:10,992
Gestapo, Marie.

532
00:58:11,062 --> 00:58:13,690
Cut it out, you fool.

533
00:58:33,017 --> 00:58:37,852
- Hi. We have visitors.
- Josef, please...

534
00:58:38,956 --> 00:58:41,322
Josef, come here.

535
00:58:43,194 --> 00:58:44,923
Please.

536
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:51,793
- I need to buy a briefcase.
- Yes.

537
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:55,635
- What do you mean yes, you fool?
- Sit down, Herr Kepke.

538
00:58:55,706 --> 00:59:00,871
Marie, you look terrible.
Isn't the medicine working?

539
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:04,813
You must excuse me.
The old man's middle son got killed.

540
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:08,242
To Paul!

541
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,117
Don't give him any more.
He's had enough.

542
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:14,955
He should speak German
if that's his native tongue.

543
00:59:15,026 --> 00:59:19,190
I'm sorry.
Well, then, to the hero Paul.

544
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:23,859
Don't you say Paul's name.

545
00:59:29,707 --> 00:59:30,608
Josef. Please...

546
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,633
Josef. Please...

547
00:59:34,645 --> 00:59:40,083
Who's calling us from here?
Who is that calling like that?

548
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:44,286
Why don't you air the room
a bit, Marie?

549
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:49,184
Let it go. My Paul.

550
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:58,899
This is your fault too.

551
01:00:06,277 --> 01:00:10,714
Have you tried compresses
on your chest?

552
01:00:14,552 --> 01:00:17,146
Careful you don't
catch something.

553
01:00:17,221 --> 01:00:20,987
People like me rarely
catch anything. I'm Nordic.

554
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:23,288
Nordic race.

555
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:27,998
Marie, maybe
the time will come...

556
01:00:28,065 --> 01:00:30,363
when from the union
of people like you and me...

557
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:34,202
What are you afraid of?

558
01:00:35,706 --> 01:00:39,164
That time and that human...

559
01:00:39,243 --> 01:00:41,973
may be closer than you think.

560
01:00:42,046 --> 01:00:45,277
Well, Marie,
let's not fight about it.

561
01:00:49,287 --> 01:00:54,418
Josef, your wife is burning up.
Come and see.

562
01:01:08,472 --> 01:01:11,032
My gorilla

563
01:01:11,108 --> 01:01:15,010
Has a villa in the zoo

564
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:27,609
Bye-bye.

565
01:02:29,253 --> 01:02:33,121
You're Czechs.
You should be ashamed.

566
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,491
- Good afternoon, Marie.
- You startled me.

567
01:04:52,563 --> 01:04:55,259
Healthy, agile, beautiful,
just like I like you.

568
01:04:55,332 --> 01:04:57,926
- Where's Josef?
- Who's that?

569
01:04:58,002 --> 01:05:01,563
He's still at Dr. Fischer's.

570
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:05,973
I think it'll come out that
you're not the problem.

571
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:08,102
Look.

572
01:05:08,179 --> 01:05:11,671
What's that? For your wife?

573
01:05:11,749 --> 01:05:15,913
If she weighed 50 kilos less.
I know your size exactly.

574
01:05:17,221 --> 01:05:21,089
No, I can't accept it.
Thank you. Take it.

575
01:05:21,158 --> 01:05:24,559
On the contrary,
you'll try it on now.

576
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:28,029
I have a car and some
Moselle wine and cold chicken.

577
01:05:28,098 --> 01:05:30,259
- Let's take a little trip, huh?
- No, no.

578
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:32,268
That's an order!

579
01:05:33,337 --> 01:05:35,669
Josef jealous of a gift
from a friend?

580
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:40,403
Was he jealous of sausages
or medicine? Try it on.

581
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,248
It's for someone
much younger, isn't it?

582
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:50,719
Well, that's true,
but it will fit you too.

583
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,514
I'll try it on...

584
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:57,527
but I won't go
anywhere with you.

585
01:05:58,796 --> 01:06:01,128
- It will be our little secret.
- What?

586
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:03,894
The test might last
for two or three hours...

587
01:06:03,968 --> 01:06:07,734
and we can wait for
the results together.

588
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:09,830
We can wait here if you like.

589
01:06:11,275 --> 01:06:15,473
No, I don't want to. Excuse me.

590
01:06:24,922 --> 01:06:26,856
- What now?
- I forgot something.

591
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:35,597
Good?

592
01:06:40,671 --> 01:06:44,505
And after all, Marie...

593
01:06:44,575 --> 01:06:46,907
we're all as young as we feel.

594
01:06:46,977 --> 01:06:50,378
And today I feel 21.

595
01:07:03,961 --> 01:07:06,361
I need to be home early.

596
01:07:07,431 --> 01:07:10,798
Perhaps you forgot
to feed your pets?

597
01:07:12,303 --> 01:07:14,737
As far as I know
you killed all the rabbits.

598
01:07:14,805 --> 01:07:17,467
If I leave out that woodworm
in the wardrobe...

599
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,011
Am I right?

600
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,605
There'd be no danger from me...

601
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:27,981
even if you had a buffalo
in that closet.

602
01:07:35,759 --> 01:07:38,353
- Horst!
- Did I hear you right?

603
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,330
- Pay attention.
- I am, Marie.

604
01:07:42,399 --> 01:07:44,060
I am.

605
01:07:44,134 --> 01:07:46,295
But you relax a bit.

606
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:50,136
You're so high-strung.

607
01:07:51,008 --> 01:07:53,101
As tense as a bow.

608
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:13,563
Ah, my old acquaintance.
Please.

609
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:17,600
What a lucky coincidence.

610
01:08:18,669 --> 01:08:21,365
Is it anything serious?

611
01:08:21,438 --> 01:08:25,169
No, just a routine checkup.

612
01:08:26,243 --> 01:08:30,543
Dr. Fischer is
a great specialist...

613
01:08:30,614 --> 01:08:33,845
a true professional.

614
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:38,377
During 100 sterilizations
of Gypsy trash...

615
01:08:48,198 --> 01:08:52,828
I betJosef hasn't taken you
anywhere since the war began.

616
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:57,907
Just a minute, please.

617
01:09:00,811 --> 01:09:03,302
Try it. Just a minute.

618
01:09:16,393 --> 01:09:19,590
- And two cognacs, please.
- No, I don't want one.

619
01:09:21,065 --> 01:09:24,728
Why? You're always
afraid of something.

620
01:09:24,802 --> 01:09:27,703
And of what? Of yourself?

621
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:29,500
Of you.

622
01:09:29,573 --> 01:09:33,339
Of me? For God's sake, why?

623
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:37,479
I don't know.

624
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,982
I suffer just like you.

625
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:46,017
Really, I'm not the one
for such trips. I'm married.

626
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:51,255
To a burnt-out wick.
You voluntarily live in a tomb.

627
01:09:52,696 --> 01:09:54,721
All of us do.

628
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,292
You're married, too,
and have children.

629
01:10:01,872 --> 01:10:03,305
Exactly.

630
01:10:04,775 --> 01:10:08,506
I have a wife,
and the children you long for.

631
01:10:10,147 --> 01:10:13,116
Look, I'll tell you
something, Marie.

632
01:10:13,183 --> 01:10:16,277
I have a very ambitious wife.

633
01:10:16,353 --> 01:10:19,015
She's persistent, enduring...

634
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:24,527
and with her constant persuading
and working on me...

635
01:10:26,396 --> 01:10:28,694
she completely changed me.

636
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,030
My roots are here.

637
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,127
She's from Germany.
I'm from Bohemia.

638
01:10:34,204 --> 01:10:39,005
You don't really think
I believe in all that stuff?

639
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:43,274
- Then why did you marry her?
- Because I loved her.

640
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:48,809
And now you don't
love her anymore.

641
01:10:48,886 --> 01:10:52,014
No. Not anymore.

642
01:10:54,024 --> 01:10:57,084
And do you still loveJosef?

643
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:01,163
Yes.

644
01:11:04,668 --> 01:11:06,898
I didn't want it.

645
01:11:14,745 --> 01:11:17,043
- Do you know what she wants?
- Who?

646
01:11:17,114 --> 01:11:19,548
That fanatic of mine.

647
01:11:19,616 --> 01:11:23,848
For us to move to the Reich,
to, allegedly, a safe place.

648
01:11:23,921 --> 01:11:26,583
So go.

649
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,717
But they bomb them every day.

650
01:11:29,793 --> 01:11:32,921
She's obsessed with the idea
that after the war...

651
01:11:32,996 --> 01:11:36,432
Czechs will skin us alive.

652
01:11:39,036 --> 01:11:40,731
- Anyway...
- Sorry.

653
01:11:48,946 --> 01:11:50,379
Sir.

654
01:12:02,025 --> 01:12:04,687
A drop is enough.

655
01:12:04,761 --> 01:12:08,527
Perhaps she could lend a hand.

656
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:31,744
Marie, come and see.

657
01:12:32,823 --> 01:12:35,587
- Come and have a look.
- What is it?

658
01:12:37,027 --> 01:12:39,518
Hey, I got it.

659
01:12:40,631 --> 01:12:43,429
- That's poaching.
- That's a crawfish.

660
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,266
A bit of danger should always
accompany such a trip, eh?

661
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:50,363
How about if I catch a few
and we cook them for dinner?

662
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,738
They're a great delicacy.

663
01:12:52,809 --> 01:12:55,369
- If it's worth it to you.
- It is, Marie.

664
01:12:55,445 --> 01:12:58,881
You're so beautiful.
Just a parasol and it's...

665
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:02,749
Beautiful Bohemia, Bohemia mine.

666
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:06,755
My rising soul is ever thine.

667
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:08,848
Are you switching to
the resistance because of me?

668
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,860
No, Marie,
I'm preparing an offensive.

669
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,862
- That's not necessary.
- But it is.

670
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,364
I don't like it.

671
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:18,094
But you are
an intelligent woman.

672
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:20,500
- Leave me alone.
- Marie...

673
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,038
There's an easy solution
to your problem...

674
01:13:23,106 --> 01:13:27,042
without any experiments
or operations.

675
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:30,443
- Get away from me.
- I know you want it.

676
01:13:30,514 --> 01:13:35,816
Your solution is just
to rape me!

677
01:13:35,886 --> 01:13:40,323
What rape? Nobody's here.
We're here alone, Marie...

678
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:43,052
Leave me alone.

679
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:52,067
- Take a deep breath.
- Thanks for the advice.

680
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:57,431
I didn't mean to hurt you.

681
01:13:58,709 --> 01:14:03,874
I might be pregnant,
and I don't want to lose it.

682
01:14:03,947 --> 01:14:09,283
Right. Marie, I'm not 20.

683
01:14:09,353 --> 01:14:13,221
Don't try to make a fool of me.
Such a lie.

684
01:14:15,058 --> 01:14:16,992
I want to go home.

685
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,392
So go. I can't right now.

686
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:28,429
I have bad news for you.

687
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:35,144
Unfortunately, the tests
prove that it's you.

688
01:14:36,546 --> 01:14:39,447
You can't have children.

689
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:45,353
I understand.
Thank you, Doctor.

690
01:14:48,759 --> 01:14:52,695
Don't mention it, Mr. 'iek.

691
01:14:57,634 --> 01:14:59,932
- Let's cross to the other side.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Imaek.

692
01:15:00,003 --> 01:15:04,599
Don't run away. I can explain.

693
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:09,771
Libushka, you don't know
the truth about me.

694
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:13,273
I'm a Czech just like you.

695
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:17,286
Unluckily, I have a problem
I can't explain just now.

696
01:15:17,354 --> 01:15:19,845
Josef, I don't know why, l...

697
01:15:19,923 --> 01:15:24,587
I'm a decent man with nothing
in common with those swine.

698
01:15:24,661 --> 01:15:28,461
Hello, hello. My friend.

699
01:15:28,532 --> 01:15:30,557
- Would you like a lift?
- No, thank you.

700
01:15:30,634 --> 01:15:33,228
Too bad.

701
01:15:33,303 --> 01:15:34,600
Good-bye.

702
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:37,139
Come, children.
Let's leave this friend.

703
01:15:37,207 --> 01:15:39,004
Libushka...

704
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:02,622
Jesus! What are you doing here?

705
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:06,066
Sorry I startled you.

706
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:09,105
- I've decided to leave.
- What?

707
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:12,403
We might not survive
the next visit.

708
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:16,936
Have you gone crazy?

709
01:16:18,348 --> 01:16:22,682
Dear 'ieks, your reward...

710
01:16:22,752 --> 01:16:25,721
is in the drawer on the left.

711
01:16:28,925 --> 01:16:32,622
David, it's not...

712
01:16:34,064 --> 01:16:39,092
Understand? You leave today,
and we're dead tomorrow.

713
01:16:39,169 --> 01:16:41,364
Where would you go?

714
01:16:41,438 --> 01:16:45,772
Don't worry.
They won't get me alive.

715
01:16:45,842 --> 01:16:51,747
Alive or dead, you think
they won't trace this sweater?

716
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,977
David.

717
01:16:56,052 --> 01:16:58,714
This is just great.

718
01:16:58,788 --> 01:17:02,485
The whole city can see me...

719
01:17:02,559 --> 01:17:07,053
walking around with Nazis...

720
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:09,257
collaborators!

721
01:17:11,101 --> 01:17:14,696
I took a job at their office...

722
01:17:14,771 --> 01:17:17,740
and now you want to leave.

723
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:23,369
Where were you?

724
01:17:24,581 --> 01:17:27,982
- Are you going someplace?
- Yeah, of course, Marie.

725
01:17:30,353 --> 01:17:34,551
This guy here got bored, you know.
He needs a bit of air.

726
01:17:34,624 --> 01:17:36,558
Don't shout like that!

727
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:48,027
David, get immediately
back where you belong.

728
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:05,749
I know but
if you understand, Horst.

729
01:18:05,822 --> 01:18:08,814
Just a minute, please.
I'll be back.

730
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:16,959
We must wait a bit.

731
01:18:18,034 --> 01:18:19,592
I heard.

732
01:18:29,346 --> 01:18:31,439
Here we go!

733
01:18:34,351 --> 01:18:38,014
Kepke must leave
the Wieners' villa.

734
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,749
Why?

735
01:18:39,823 --> 01:18:44,283
He's no longer the father
of heroes, but of a deserter.

736
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:46,693
Deserter?

737
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:51,996
The little one, that squirt,
was shot deserting.

738
01:18:53,336 --> 01:18:55,964
By his own people, the Germans.

739
01:18:57,841 --> 01:19:01,572
His wife had a breakdown.
She's in a mental hospital...

740
01:19:01,645 --> 01:19:03,806
and Kepke had a stroke.

741
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,144
What is that to us?

742
01:19:06,216 --> 01:19:09,413
- What? You don't understand.
- What?

743
01:19:09,486 --> 01:19:13,081
Prohaska wants to move him
into our place.

744
01:19:13,156 --> 01:19:15,317
- Here?
- Yeah.

745
01:19:15,392 --> 01:19:18,054
- Where here?
- Don't shout.

746
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:27,158
Horst, could we have
a word alone?

747
01:19:27,237 --> 01:19:32,402
No, no. No cajoling, no bribing.
It's been registered.

748
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:37,936
This is a solution.
A broken man is no danger to you.

749
01:19:38,014 --> 01:19:40,312
- United we stand.
- Horst...

750
01:19:42,218 --> 01:19:44,015
Come.

751
01:19:44,087 --> 01:19:48,251
- Frau 'iek. Herr Kepke.
- I know.

752
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:52,727
Please accept my condolences.

753
01:19:56,132 --> 01:20:00,569
A... How do you say terrible?

754
01:20:00,637 --> 01:20:03,629
- Terrible what?
- A terrible tragedy.

755
01:20:03,707 --> 01:20:06,175
A terrible tragedy.

756
01:20:06,242 --> 01:20:10,008
Yes, we're very sorry...

757
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,844
about what happened.

758
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:17,216
We'd like to help you, but...

759
01:20:18,288 --> 01:20:21,086
unfortunately it's not possible.

760
01:20:21,157 --> 01:20:23,125
Why not, may I ask?

761
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,785
We've spoken about it already.

762
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:28,490
Yes? I don't remember
that at all.

763
01:20:29,566 --> 01:20:32,194
I'm pregnant.

764
01:20:34,804 --> 01:20:36,772
What?

765
01:20:39,509 --> 01:20:42,444
We'll need the children's room.

766
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:45,810
Translate that.

767
01:20:47,617 --> 01:20:49,585
I am pregnant...

768
01:20:52,322 --> 01:20:56,952
and we need a room
for the child.

769
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:03,931
Then that's another matter.

770
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,596
In that case no one
can be accommodated here.

771
01:21:08,671 --> 01:21:12,300
Congratulations, Josef.

772
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,138
Thanks.

773
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:18,044
I hope you know what
you're doing, dear lady.

774
01:21:18,114 --> 01:21:22,710
And I'll need a certificate
from Dr. Fischer.

775
01:21:24,687 --> 01:21:28,145
Let's go, Albrecht.

776
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:35,962
Can you forgive me, Herr 'iek?

777
01:21:39,302 --> 01:21:42,999
I apologize to you.

778
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:53,807
Here you go.

779
01:21:53,883 --> 01:21:57,182
Come here, my little...

780
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:04,783
Are you crazy?
Wait. I can explain.

781
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:06,453
Good night.

782
01:22:21,411 --> 01:22:24,346
Why are you here?
Where's the key to that door?

783
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:31,577
- I made it all up.
- Come on.

784
01:22:31,654 --> 01:22:36,921
You can lie so persuasively
with your upbringing?

785
01:22:40,597 --> 01:22:44,397
That time with Prohaska...

786
01:22:44,467 --> 01:22:47,595
was much worse than I told you.

787
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:50,605
He acted like a pig.

788
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:55,868
I never thought he'd try
to get revenge like this.

789
01:22:58,047 --> 01:23:02,711
I couldn't have known
that you'd believe it.

790
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:09,123
You surprise me.

791
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,022
How can I trust you now?

792
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:16,998
I've never been with anybody...

793
01:23:20,036 --> 01:23:21,970
except you.

794
01:23:36,753 --> 01:23:41,486
I believe you. I have to.

795
01:23:44,027 --> 01:23:46,052
I want to.

796
01:23:55,471 --> 01:23:59,066
It's only that... Wait.

797
01:23:59,142 --> 01:24:01,110
- What?
- Marie.

798
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:05,476
This is a terrible problem.

799
01:24:05,548 --> 01:24:08,142
What are we going to do now?

800
01:24:08,217 --> 01:24:09,809
About what?

801
01:24:13,222 --> 01:24:17,955
The whole neighborhood knows
we can't have children.

802
01:24:18,027 --> 01:24:20,052
I have a paper from the doctor.

803
01:24:20,129 --> 01:24:25,328
It's nothing for them
to check it.

804
01:24:25,401 --> 01:24:27,733
Prohaska won't stop.

805
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:32,032
And if it comes out...

806
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:36,807
then not even your Madonna
can help us.

807
01:24:36,879 --> 01:24:39,040
- What about the doctor?
- What?

808
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:40,605
The doctor?

809
01:24:40,683 --> 01:24:45,177
Come on. He's their man.
He's a swine.

810
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:49,848
Oh, God.

811
01:24:58,434 --> 01:25:01,995
- There's only one thing to do.
- What?

812
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:07,204
You've got to get pregnant
as fast as possible.

813
01:25:09,278 --> 01:25:11,644
Otherwise, we go to the gallows.

814
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:22,814
Our only hope...

815
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:26,519
is David.

816
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:30,064
David?

817
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:34,936
David.

818
01:25:40,843 --> 01:25:45,177
You can't ask me for that.

819
01:25:46,582 --> 01:25:48,743
I'll never do it.

820
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:52,850
Never, Josef.

821
01:27:01,023 --> 01:27:04,891
Are you crazy?

822
01:27:04,961 --> 01:27:07,987
David, come here.

823
01:27:08,064 --> 01:27:11,898
- Someone is ringing.
- I'll take care of it.

824
01:27:11,968 --> 01:27:15,165
Get back in there.
I'll take care of it.

825
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,174
Just be calm.

826
01:27:27,717 --> 01:27:29,480
Well, hi.

827
01:27:30,553 --> 01:27:32,817
I came to speak openly with you.

828
01:27:32,889 --> 01:27:37,189
If you think I'll cover for you,
you're kidding yourself.

829
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:39,922
Everything has its limit.
I'll never betray myself.

830
01:27:40,997 --> 01:27:44,626
- So don't.
- Look at yourself.

831
01:27:46,235 --> 01:27:51,366
Well, we're celebrating,
you know.

832
01:27:53,676 --> 01:27:56,338
Such big news, right?

833
01:27:56,412 --> 01:27:59,438
So it was news to you, too, huh?

834
01:27:59,515 --> 01:28:02,313
I was lucky to be there
at just that moment.

835
01:28:02,385 --> 01:28:06,378
By the way,
when did she see a doctor?

836
01:28:06,455 --> 01:28:09,515
- What?
- When did she see a doctor?

837
01:28:11,227 --> 01:28:15,664
You mean my wife? Well, she...

838
01:28:16,732 --> 01:28:20,293
didn't want to scare me,
you know?

839
01:28:20,369 --> 01:28:22,929
She's terribly...

840
01:28:24,273 --> 01:28:26,901
She wanted to be
absolutely sure.

841
01:28:26,976 --> 01:28:29,877
For years you were childless...

842
01:28:29,946 --> 01:28:34,679
and now when we need help,
a miracle happens.

843
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:38,652
- Everyone will be suspicious.
- Don't yell at me.

844
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:43,818
But it's easy to disprove
unfounded suspicion, right?

845
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:50,722
Yes, of course.
We're already working on it.

846
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,893
I hope so.

847
01:28:52,969 --> 01:28:56,132
The times are cruel,
so don't play games with anyone.

848
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:59,140
- Want a drag?
- Do you understand?

849
01:29:09,819 --> 01:29:12,583
Jesus Christ!

850
01:29:19,862 --> 01:29:21,830
So come on.

851
01:29:24,267 --> 01:29:26,201
Let's go.

852
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:28,931
David...

853
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,937
Sit here. I know it's terrible.

854
01:29:36,012 --> 01:29:39,971
I understand you
very, very well.

855
01:29:42,451 --> 01:29:45,477
Shall we remove the pictures?

856
01:29:45,554 --> 01:29:49,991
- Crying won't help.
- But I can't.

857
01:29:50,059 --> 01:29:53,222
This is a matter of life and death,
and you say you can't.

858
01:29:53,296 --> 01:29:58,359
- I don't say I can't.
- David, it's not against you.

859
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:01,767
David, come here.

860
01:30:01,837 --> 01:30:04,362
Calm down.

861
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,874
Lie here nicely.

862
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:10,674
You can't leave us now.
It must be.

863
01:30:10,746 --> 01:30:14,045
We have to. We simply have to.

864
01:30:14,116 --> 01:30:17,051
Damn it. It's our lives.

865
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:21,446
And stop crying.

866
01:31:26,322 --> 01:31:29,951
How is Mrs. 'iek?
I haven't seen her for a long time.

867
01:31:30,926 --> 01:31:35,363
So you finally made it, huh?

868
01:31:36,298 --> 01:31:41,326
One would have thought
it was a hopeless case.

869
01:31:41,404 --> 01:31:44,339
Fanda, stop fighting!

870
01:31:44,407 --> 01:31:46,534
And, hey...

871
01:31:48,177 --> 01:31:51,408
I'd be afraid to show my face.

872
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:04,916
I'm terribly ashamed.

873
01:32:06,495 --> 01:32:09,055
I wanted to finally
apologize to you.

874
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:12,498
I behaved unacceptably that time.
Like an animal.

875
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:19,034
I'd be grateful if
you'd just forget about it.

876
01:32:21,844 --> 01:32:27,282
I took the liberty of
getting a little something.

877
01:32:27,349 --> 01:32:32,719
Have a look.
I don't need these anymore.

878
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:36,615
These are for a girl.

879
01:32:37,493 --> 01:32:40,860
And these for if it's a boy.

880
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,660
Are you hungry?

881
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:47,429
No one's cooked for me
for a half year.

882
01:32:47,503 --> 01:32:51,303
- Hi.
- Josef, where were you?

883
01:32:51,373 --> 01:32:53,967
You haven't come around
for a long time.

884
01:32:54,043 --> 01:32:58,810
So you've been designing
V2s in there?

885
01:33:00,516 --> 01:33:04,418
No, no, I usually listen
to the radio there.

886
01:33:04,487 --> 01:33:07,820
- Have a hotcake.
- Thanks.

887
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:10,825
- Music?
- Music.

888
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:15,556
The music some will
have to face.

889
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:19,158
Stalin's organ concerto? Do you
long for the tyranny of muzhiks?

890
01:33:19,235 --> 01:33:22,830
Come on, Horst.
Don't believe that radio of yours.

891
01:33:22,905 --> 01:33:26,363
I'll show you something. Look.

892
01:33:28,077 --> 01:33:32,070
This is the Red Army.
This is our allies.

893
01:33:34,216 --> 01:33:36,514
And this...

894
01:33:38,187 --> 01:33:42,385
This is your wehrmacht.
And now look.

895
01:33:52,568 --> 01:33:55,594
Don't jump the gun.

896
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:57,696
I envy your tranquility...

897
01:33:57,773 --> 01:34:00,469
but don't fully understand
your tingling happiness.

898
01:34:00,543 --> 01:34:03,535
And I don't know what you mean
by tingling happiness.

899
01:34:03,612 --> 01:34:05,580
You must have an ace
up your sleeve.

900
01:34:05,648 --> 01:34:08,617
Horst, you act like
you don't know me.

901
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:13,121
Josef, someone might come here
and investigate a bit...

902
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:16,158
and begin to unravel
the whole story.

903
01:34:16,225 --> 01:34:19,388
Of course I'm joking,
but now is the time of blunders...

904
01:34:19,461 --> 01:34:22,692
nervousness, errors
and quick solutions.

905
01:34:22,765 --> 01:34:25,029
You know what I mean.

906
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:27,591
You know that saying
about one boat?

907
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:30,901
- That we're all in the same boat?
- Yes.

908
01:34:33,742 --> 01:34:37,644
- We're afraid, right?
- Who's we? The two of us?

909
01:34:39,381 --> 01:34:42,509
Not me, I'm not afraid.

910
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:46,817
Let me put it this way.

911
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:50,882
I just thought there might be
an urgent need to hide...

912
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,452
something or somebody
in a safe place.

913
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:58,364
And I know such a place.
My place.

914
01:34:58,434 --> 01:35:02,336
Nobody would look for
anything or anybody there.

915
01:35:02,404 --> 01:35:05,999
Yeah, of course, maybe in
a few weeks not even for you.

916
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:10,409
If so, I have relatives
in the south, so then there.

917
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:15,781
Okay, but I don't need
to hide anything or anybody...

918
01:35:15,851 --> 01:35:18,752
with your relatives
in the south.

919
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:21,085
Goddamn it!

920
01:35:21,156 --> 01:35:25,388
- I'm sorry.
- I'm going to lie down.

921
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:28,453
You're like a child.
Who will the kid take after?

922
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:31,931
- Think no one will find out?
- You know what?

923
01:35:33,135 --> 01:35:38,163
Have a hotcake, Wurst,
and then beat it.

924
01:35:39,675 --> 01:35:43,771
- We shouldn't talk like this.
- But we will talk like this.

925
01:35:43,846 --> 01:35:48,146
You can't be serious!
We're not in Paris, out of danger.

926
01:35:48,217 --> 01:35:53,678
Every day here it's life and death.
Let's not pretend.

927
01:35:53,756 --> 01:35:56,156
Where are you going?
The door is over there.

928
01:35:56,225 --> 01:35:59,661
- But I'm interested in this one.
- Damn it.

929
01:35:59,728 --> 01:36:01,923
What's going on?

930
01:36:02,998 --> 01:36:04,966
This is it.

931
01:36:18,947 --> 01:36:22,212
My God, what will we do? Josef?

932
01:36:22,284 --> 01:36:25,117
- Stay calm.
- Do something.

933
01:36:26,388 --> 01:36:30,290
- I'm afraid.
- Just wait.

934
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,519
Dear Mary, help me, please.

935
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:40,362
Please protect my child.

936
01:37:00,222 --> 01:37:02,554
- What is this?
- Al'ik, come here.

937
01:37:05,127 --> 01:37:07,721
Meat.

938
01:37:32,621 --> 01:37:34,452
There's nothing here.

939
01:37:34,523 --> 01:37:37,617
You are at the house
of a citizen of the Reich.

940
01:37:37,693 --> 01:37:40,457
We've fulfilled our duty.

941
01:37:42,364 --> 01:37:44,059
- Horst Prohaska.
- Yes.

942
01:37:44,133 --> 01:37:47,159
Okay. Move on, move on.

943
01:37:55,911 --> 01:37:57,970
They're gone.

944
01:38:07,322 --> 01:38:11,816
You saved our lives, Horst.
Thanks.

945
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:17,960
Perhaps three of you.

946
01:38:21,537 --> 01:38:23,971
You mean the child.

947
01:38:46,628 --> 01:38:49,597
Divided we fall.

948
01:40:18,787 --> 01:40:22,018
Andulka. For Al'ik.

949
01:40:23,926 --> 01:40:27,157
Me too. Me too.

950
01:40:27,796 --> 01:40:30,390
Bastards.

951
01:40:51,153 --> 01:40:53,849
That was in our street.

952
01:40:57,259 --> 01:40:59,659
- This is it.
- What?

953
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:04,592
Wait. I'll get Mrs. Imaek.

954
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:06,964
No, you better get the doctor.

955
01:41:07,035 --> 01:41:09,970
What? Go out? To town?

956
01:41:10,038 --> 01:41:14,532
David, it's bad.
I've got to go to the hospital.

957
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,771
Take care of her, please.

958
01:41:16,845 --> 01:41:19,405
Marie, be careful.

959
01:41:21,883 --> 01:41:26,377
- Come and sit down.
- No, it's better to walk.

960
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,219
Hey!

961
01:41:46,441 --> 01:41:47,908
My wife's having a baby.

962
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:52,003
Can't you see
what's going on here?

963
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,481
My wife's having a baby.

964
01:42:23,612 --> 01:42:25,876
Doctor!

965
01:43:37,185 --> 01:43:40,621
I'd like to speak
to the commander.

966
01:43:42,357 --> 01:43:45,588
Good afternoon.
I'd like to speak to the commander.

967
01:43:47,896 --> 01:43:50,729
Good afternoon. I need help.

968
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:55,601
- Hi, Franta.
- Do you know him?

969
01:43:55,670 --> 01:44:00,801
Yeah. He's my neighbor,
Comrade Captain.

970
01:44:00,876 --> 01:44:05,438
He worked for the Germans,
confiscated Jewish property.

971
01:44:06,548 --> 01:44:09,073
Was close to the collaborators.

972
01:44:09,151 --> 01:44:11,984
He was a friend
of the SS commander.

973
01:44:12,053 --> 01:44:14,521
- Take him away.
- But why?

974
01:44:14,589 --> 01:44:19,219
- You ask why?
- But, Franta...

975
01:44:19,294 --> 01:44:22,092
I wouldn't have come here
if that were true.

976
01:44:22,164 --> 01:44:24,257
Can you disprove
the accusations?

977
01:44:24,332 --> 01:44:27,062
- Of course I can.
- How?

978
01:44:27,135 --> 01:44:30,571
The smell of pork
came from your house...

979
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:33,437
while you sang German songs.

980
01:44:33,508 --> 01:44:37,911
I hid a fugitive, a Jew.

981
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:42,507
We couldn't be conspicuous.
I didn't want to arouse suspicion.

982
01:44:42,584 --> 01:44:47,578
I had to be careful in front
of our people too.

983
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:52,389
Captain, the son of a Jewish
industrialist, David Wiener.

984
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:56,191
He lived for two years
in our pantry.

985
01:44:57,599 --> 01:45:00,591
You must remember David Wiener.

986
01:45:08,443 --> 01:45:14,143
Today every swine suddenly finds
a Jew or a partisan...

987
01:45:14,216 --> 01:45:16,275
one usually gone
or dead long ago.

988
01:45:16,351 --> 01:45:18,285
But mine...

989
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:23,950
Mine is sitting on my wife's bed,
and she's giving birth.

990
01:45:24,025 --> 01:45:26,357
Do you understand?

991
01:45:26,428 --> 01:45:31,365
And the doctor is here, Captain.

992
01:45:31,433 --> 01:45:34,664
You're his neighbor.
Is his wife pregnant?

993
01:45:36,304 --> 01:45:39,000
It'll be easy
to see for ourselves.

994
01:45:39,074 --> 01:45:41,542
You say that the doctor
is here somewhere?

995
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:44,807
- Yes, here, Captain.
- Well, okay.

996
01:45:54,055 --> 01:45:57,218
Suicide. He had poison with him.

997
01:46:00,929 --> 01:46:02,954
Just a minute.

998
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:31,916
So is your doctor here
somewhere?

999
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:37,162
Him.

1000
01:46:38,633 --> 01:46:41,033
That's our doctor.

1001
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:47,499
Come here. Yes, you.

1002
01:46:54,883 --> 01:46:58,979
- What is your specialization?
- General practitioner.

1003
01:46:59,054 --> 01:47:02,421
Goddamn it. Did anyone ask you?
No, they didn't.

1004
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:06,927
Captain, my wife's giving birth,
and I need a doctor.

1005
01:47:06,995 --> 01:47:09,395
Well, you don't
look like a doctor.

1006
01:47:09,464 --> 01:47:12,365
You look more like
a collaborating swine.

1007
01:47:12,434 --> 01:47:16,495
Please, Captain. Doctor...

1008
01:47:18,773 --> 01:47:22,140
Any complications, Mr. 'iek?

1009
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:25,008
Has the baby dropped?

1010
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:28,174
- Has labor started?
- It's premature.

1011
01:47:28,249 --> 01:47:32,743
It's Mrs. Marie's first.
At her age it could be serious.

1012
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:36,313
Captain, we have
no time to waste.

1013
01:47:36,391 --> 01:47:40,691
We'll see. I,
representing the army in exile...

1014
01:47:40,762 --> 01:47:42,855
Sergei, representing
the Soviet army...

1015
01:47:42,931 --> 01:47:47,425
and you, as a member
of the resistance, let's go.

1016
01:48:05,653 --> 01:48:10,681
We have enough water.
Please bring some sheets.

1017
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:02,732
Still, even at the very end...

1018
01:50:01,636 --> 01:50:06,539
No funny stuff.
And where's thatJew of yours?

1019
01:50:17,719 --> 01:50:20,711
Josef, who are these people?

1020
01:50:20,788 --> 01:50:23,188
- Friends.
- Did you bring the doctor?

1021
01:50:23,258 --> 01:50:26,022
I'm here, Marie. I'm the doctor.

1022
01:50:26,094 --> 01:50:30,588
- What?
- Don't yell. Calm down.

1023
01:50:38,439 --> 01:50:40,202
And now show us
thatJew of yours.

1024
01:50:40,275 --> 01:50:43,210
- Pardon?
- ThatJew of yours.

1025
01:50:43,278 --> 01:50:45,269
It's coming.

1026
01:50:50,151 --> 01:50:53,484
Marie, relax. David?

1027
01:50:53,555 --> 01:50:57,355
Calm down. Where's David?
It's important.

1028
01:50:57,425 --> 01:50:59,359
It's coming, Josef.

1029
01:50:59,427 --> 01:51:04,524
I'm afraid it's already started.
I'm going to need help.

1030
01:51:04,599 --> 01:51:08,194
Well, you're the doctor.
We came on different business.

1031
01:51:08,269 --> 01:51:10,430
That must wait.
This is a matter of life and death.

1032
01:51:10,505 --> 01:51:14,134
Don't ever doubt it.
Stay here and help him.

1033
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:16,769
- But, Captain...
- That's an order.

1034
01:51:16,844 --> 01:51:20,280
And you come with me.

1035
01:51:20,348 --> 01:51:25,047
I'm going to need hot water,
some scissors...

1036
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:26,882
and string for that...

1037
01:51:26,955 --> 01:51:29,822
- For sealing the umbilical cord.
- I know, for tying it off.

1038
01:51:33,127 --> 01:51:36,722
David! He was...

1039
01:51:36,798 --> 01:51:39,562
David! He's gone. He was here.

1040
01:51:41,636 --> 01:51:46,164
Please, don't be afraid.
I delivered all of my kids.

1041
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:50,143
Don't be afraid of me, Marie.
I beg you.

1042
01:51:51,613 --> 01:51:56,915
- Don't push. Not now...
- Horst.

1043
01:51:57,986 --> 01:52:02,821
Captain, I wouldn't tell
such a stupid lie. Believe me.

1044
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:05,916
And now my wife's delivering.

1045
01:52:05,994 --> 01:52:07,791
I can't have children.

1046
01:52:14,902 --> 01:52:18,497
Leave if you feel sick.

1047
01:52:18,573 --> 01:52:20,666
Get out.

1048
01:52:36,824 --> 01:52:39,952
Look, Captain, this was his.

1049
01:52:40,028 --> 01:52:42,861
Where would I get it?

1050
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:46,764
You're trying to bribe me, you pig.
Get up and move.

1051
01:52:50,305 --> 01:52:52,034
Be human.

1052
01:52:53,007 --> 01:52:56,966
- Get moving.
- Captain.

1053
01:52:57,045 --> 01:53:00,811
These are not my jewels.
He hid them.

1054
01:53:00,882 --> 01:53:04,249
- Captain, on my knees I beg...
- On your knees, swine.

1055
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:08,085
You're going to shoot me
here like a dog?

1056
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:12,058
- And who are you?
- This is our David.

1057
01:53:17,799 --> 01:53:20,597
- Who are you?
- This is our David.

1058
01:53:20,668 --> 01:53:23,000
- David Wiener.
- Do you have any papers?

1059
01:53:26,407 --> 01:53:30,343
What about this?
Show him your arm.

1060
01:53:30,411 --> 01:53:32,436
What about this?

1061
01:53:40,822 --> 01:53:45,521
Sorry, but nowadays
we can't just believe anyone.

1062
01:54:26,367 --> 01:54:29,131
Do you know the man
in the next room?

1063
01:54:29,203 --> 01:54:32,104
Who doesn't know him?

1064
01:54:32,173 --> 01:54:35,267
Is he really a doctor?

1065
01:54:37,879 --> 01:54:42,816
Mainly, he's a man who knew
about me the whole time.

1066
01:54:42,884 --> 01:54:46,251
He brought me medicine and food.

1067
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:51,383
He never betrayed us.
He's a decent man.

1068
01:54:53,828 --> 01:54:56,319
He's one of us.

1069
01:55:17,652 --> 01:55:20,485
We have a boy.

1070
01:55:27,028 --> 01:55:29,360
The picture of his mother, eh?

1071
01:55:30,431 --> 01:55:32,422
Good afternoon, Mr. Wiener.

1072
01:55:33,568 --> 01:55:35,229
Little one.

1073
01:57:46,334 --> 01:57:49,770
Al'ik!
