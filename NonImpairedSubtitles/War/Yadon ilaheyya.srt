1
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:36,849
DIVINE INTERVENTION

2
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:17,648
What a fucked morning

3
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,775
What a pimp

4
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:36,375
What an asshole

5
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:43,614
Son of a bitch

6
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,329
Bald prick

7
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,248
Collaborator, husband of a whore

8
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,647
Fuck the sister
of your children's father

9
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:01,654
Fuck your mother's sister

10
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,890
Fuck your father's sister's cunt

11
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:10,687
Go and get fucked
and get paid for it

12
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:14,529
A Chronicle of Love and Pain

13
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,534
There is no bus

14
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:32,215
Tell me when you're through,
then I'll send a contractor

15
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:54,494
Come down so we can talk

16
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:57,924
What's wrong with you?
I just want to have a coffee

17
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,048
Wait! Let's talk!

18
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:35,531
Easy!

19
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,649
-Orli?
-I'm listening

20
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,927
Call a doctor,
the road-digger has chest pains

21
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,366
He's acting up again.
Don't pay any attention to him

22
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:44,454
I'm calling in a paediatrician

23
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:02,729
Watch now, he won't say a sentence
without the word "six" in it

24
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,611
I was just passing,
I thought I'd say hello

25
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:09,572
Hello

26
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:12,775
How's work?

27
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:15,809
Slow

28
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:19,168
It'll pick up, God willing

29
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,644
How are the guys?

30
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,130
Getting by

31
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:14,654
By the way, yesterday, around 6,
I had 66 Shekels on me

32
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:18,247
I saw a friend, we played a game
of cards, I got a full series

33
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:20,413
I won 666 Shekels and got out

34
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:24,534
What's a full series?

35
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,689
When you get 6666, four sixes

36
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:54,409
There is no bus

37
00:15:59,696 --> 00:16:00,970
I know

38
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,650
Your car is blocking my garage.
Can you move it?

39
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,653
Which brand?

40
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:33,966
Seat

41
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,613
-White?
-Yes. White

42
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:41,691
-What type?
-I don't know, but it's brand new

43
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:43,614
Which year?

44
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:45,529
Brand new

45
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:48,968
What's the numberplate?

46
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:45,369
Come on guys, go for the valuables.
Get moving

47
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:47,495
Neighbour, why do you throw
your garbage into my yard?

48
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:49,005
Aren't you ashamed?

49
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:53,571
Yes, neighbour! But the garbage
I throw in your yard...

50
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:56,370
...is the garbage you throw
in our garden

51
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:59,651
So what? It's still shameful

52
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:02,246
After all, neighbours
should respect one another

53
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:04,527
Why didn't you raise the matter
with me first?

54
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:07,364
Isn't that why God gave us tongues?

55
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:17,768
I am crazy because I love you

56
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,613
Kineret to Shemtov... Send the
welding machine to Kiryat Motzkin

57
00:25:37,976 --> 00:25:40,490
The car goes straight
to the auction. Got it?

58
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:31,814
Hit the motherfucker!

59
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,855
Move back!

60
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:21,533
Make a U-turn. Get out of here

61
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:28,892
It's closed. Do you hear me?
No arguments

62
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:30,894
Go on! Get out of here!

63
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:59,095
Get lost!

64
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,170
Get out of here!

65
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:57,292
Igal

66
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:58,532
What?

67
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:44,370
Go away!

68
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:18,934
(between Ramallah and Jerusalem)

69
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:21,164
Open the door

70
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:23,730
Show me your ID

71
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:28,975
Where are you going?

72
00:40:33,656 --> 00:40:34,805
Everybody out

73
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,092
I said go

74
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:02,329
32 to 24, are you still
in front of the tree?

75
00:44:02,696 --> 00:44:04,652
-Yes
-Stay where you are

76
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:08,167
-No problem
-Wait for instructions. Don't move

77
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:09,605
Got it

78
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:50,606
Father Falls Sick

79
00:51:22,216 --> 00:51:24,093
Eject the tape

80
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:27,253
Put the car into neutral

81
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:29,493
Show me your papers

82
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:32,811
Go

83
00:53:14,616 --> 00:53:19,007
I Am Crazy Because I Love You

84
00:53:46,736 --> 00:53:49,967
I am crazy because I love you

85
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:52,131
Come and see this...

86
00:55:52,536 --> 00:55:53,525
Where?

87
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:55,164
Over there!

88
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:14,845
What do you say?

89
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:17,172
Ronen!

90
00:56:17,936 --> 00:56:18,891
Look at this

91
00:56:25,656 --> 00:56:26,725
Check this out...

92
00:56:30,936 --> 00:56:32,085
They're making an ass of us!

93
00:56:32,376 --> 00:56:34,332
Are you crazy? Put it down

94
00:56:37,536 --> 00:56:39,606
-Calling 24
-I'm listening

95
00:56:40,016 --> 00:56:42,655
There's a balloon
trying to get through

96
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:45,172
Can we take it down?

97
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:46,855
Stand by for instructions

98
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:57,932
Milk and honey, we've reached
our man in the East. Over

99
00:58:59,056 --> 00:59:00,375
No Arabic coffee this time

100
00:59:00,736 --> 00:59:03,728
We gave him a new Mitsubishi
with all the options

101
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:14,328
-So everything is arranged?
-Now it is

102
00:59:14,696 --> 00:59:16,971
I heard they came down this way

103
00:59:20,656 --> 00:59:22,533
They got as far as here

104
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,966
They sprayed the house
with a machine gun...

105
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:43,972
But you got the new car anyway?

106
00:59:44,336 --> 00:59:46,486
Yes, it's nice

107
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:48,653
It's a good car

108
00:59:49,016 --> 00:59:51,814
It's all electric

109
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:53,211
Look

110
00:59:57,856 --> 01:00:00,416
-The windows...
-They're automatic

111
01:00:00,776 --> 01:00:03,370
It's got an alarm

112
01:00:16,136 --> 01:00:17,933
Guys, have some Arabic coffee

113
01:05:00,216 --> 01:05:01,092
Ronen!

114
01:05:01,456 --> 01:05:03,651
Go on home.
I'll deal with them

115
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:08,924
Stop! Come here!

116
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:16,128
You there, stop!

117
01:05:17,576 --> 01:05:20,170
Turn off your engines

118
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:28,567
Attention everyone...

119
01:05:28,936 --> 01:05:30,927
Get your IDs out

120
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:37,684
Your IDs!

121
01:05:47,296 --> 01:05:48,570
You, get out!

122
01:05:48,936 --> 01:05:50,164
Come here...

123
01:05:52,976 --> 01:05:54,250
Go away!

124
01:05:55,936 --> 01:05:57,335
You get out. Come here!

125
01:05:57,696 --> 01:06:01,166
Open your jacket!

126
01:06:01,536 --> 01:06:03,766
Nice. Imported

127
01:06:04,136 --> 01:06:05,854
Let's see some ID

128
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,773
Take the jacket off

129
01:06:13,456 --> 01:06:15,174
Get lost!

130
01:06:19,216 --> 01:06:20,934
Let's see what we have here...

131
01:06:23,776 --> 01:06:25,653
Mohammed Abed Rabbo

132
01:06:27,176 --> 01:06:28,894
Wanted man no. 4

133
01:06:29,256 --> 01:06:31,611
What does wanted man no. 4 want?

134
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:34,410
He wants to get laid in Jerusalem?

135
01:06:34,776 --> 01:06:38,007
Jerusalem reunited!

136
01:06:38,376 --> 01:06:40,526
But it's Ramadan, no?

137
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:43,126
During Ramadan, there's no fucking

138
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:46,169
So you come to eat
in Jerusalem, Mohammed?

139
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:50,575
There's no food
in Ramallah, Mohammed?

140
01:06:50,936 --> 01:06:52,494
Where's Mohammed?

141
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:55,284
Where did he go?

142
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:01,534
What are you doing?

143
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:03,409
Get out

144
01:07:04,496 --> 01:07:06,214
Get in this car

145
01:07:07,496 --> 01:07:09,054
You, come here!

146
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,966
Go on, get in there!

147
01:07:16,056 --> 01:07:18,650
You! Out of there!

148
01:07:19,016 --> 01:07:21,371
Don't be scared. Stand next to me

149
01:07:21,736 --> 01:07:23,169
Stand straight!

150
01:07:30,136 --> 01:07:31,854
Long live the people of Israel!

151
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:40,375
Sing, fucker!

152
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:10,369
Start your engines!

153
01:08:26,176 --> 01:08:27,689
Get out of here!

154
01:10:48,576 --> 01:10:52,091
Come Shoot If You're Ready

155
01:15:33,816 --> 01:15:35,727
Load... arms!

156
01:15:42,616 --> 01:15:43,810
Attention!

157
01:15:44,176 --> 01:15:45,245
Aim!

158
01:16:44,096 --> 01:16:45,165
Assume your positions!

159
01:16:51,496 --> 01:16:52,531
Attention!

160
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:54,690
Aim!

161
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:03,692
Fire!

162
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:30,886
Father Dies

163
01:23:02,736 --> 01:23:06,695
What do you expect? This neighbourhood
is the sister of a pimp

164
01:23:07,056 --> 01:23:09,445
Yesterday,
I wanted to get my car out...

165
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:11,772
...and someone was blocking my way

166
01:23:12,136 --> 01:23:16,493
We are a decent lot,
parking is a real problem

167
01:23:16,856 --> 01:23:21,088
I got this kid and told him
"See if the driver is at your place"

168
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,370
I lit a cigarette and waited

169
01:23:28,696 --> 01:23:30,926
Waited and waited and waited

170
01:23:33,016 --> 01:23:33,971
No one came

171
01:23:34,336 --> 01:23:37,134
I thought,
"He must be sipping an arak"

172
01:23:38,816 --> 01:23:41,728
And then he shows up.
He sees me

173
01:23:42,096 --> 01:23:46,135
He opens his trunk. He takes
a Hoover, a dustpan and brush...

174
01:23:46,496 --> 01:23:48,054
...he starts cleaning his car

175
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:50,407
I said, "This is not good timing"

176
01:23:50,856 --> 01:23:53,575
Let's see how far he goes

177
01:23:53,936 --> 01:23:57,212
He cleaned his car front,
back and front again

178
01:23:57,576 --> 01:24:02,604
He started to back out with the carpets,
his ass like it was in reverse

179
01:24:03,176 --> 01:24:04,165
I got out

180
01:24:04,536 --> 01:24:09,849
I waited till his head was level with
the door and banged it and banged it...

181
01:24:10,216 --> 01:24:12,684
...till his head was as red
as a monkey's ass

182
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:14,735
"You want to clean your car?"

183
01:24:15,096 --> 01:24:16,131
My brother heard the noise

184
01:24:16,496 --> 01:24:19,135
"What's happening?"
"Nothing, he wants to clean his car"

185
01:24:19,496 --> 01:24:21,930
The family came to help him out

186
01:24:22,296 --> 01:24:24,491
My brother said, "Stay where you are"

187
01:24:24,856 --> 01:24:29,213
He grabbed the guy and said, "Want
to clean your car, brother of a whore?"

188
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:33,249
He beat the shit out of him
and knocked him flat

189
01:24:33,616 --> 01:24:36,255
Now the guy is in hospital,
his ribs are all broken

190
01:24:38,256 --> 01:24:41,214
He wanted to clean his car,
the son of a whore!

191
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:09,411
That's enough. Stop it now

192
01:25:36,176 --> 01:25:39,327
In memory of my father
