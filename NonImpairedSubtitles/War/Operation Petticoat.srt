1
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:55,766
Good morning.
- Good morning, Sir.

2
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:58,561
Good morning.

3
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,558
Good morning. I just came to look around.

4
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,274
Yes, sir.
- All right if I go below?

5
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,224
Certainly, sir. Can I get you some coffee?

6
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:06,889
No, I'll just go below and wait
for the captain. Maybe later.

7
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,097
Well, sir.
- Chief.

8
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,640
Who's he?

9
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:14,768
That's Sherman.
- Yes?

10
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,731
And what is he doing here at six in the morning?

11
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:21,436
He came to make sure that you were comfortable.

12
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:24,270
Don't you know anything about submarines?

13
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:27,646
Yes, sure. I know Sherman. He's the boss of Submarines Pacific.

14
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,985
He was the first captain of this boat.
- Yes, I know that.

15
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:34,070
Then you should be able to figure out what he is doing here.

16
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,020
If you were the first skipper of the "Sea Tiger"…

17
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,649
… and you ordered her sent to the junkyard at nine…

18
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,147
... what would you be doing at six?

19
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:33,333
USN SEA TIGER
CAPTAIN'S JOURNAL

20
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:36,163
December 10, 1941.

21
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,619
Moored starboard side to Machina Wharf. Cavite Navy Yard…

22
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:42,662
… Philippine Islands, for provisions and fuel.

23
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:45,284
Directive received from Commander Asiatic Fleet…

24
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:48,461
"You will sink or destroy all enemy ships wherever encountered. "

25
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:52,039
Have advised Commander Submarine Force, Asiatic Fleet... .

26
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:53,411
that "Sea Tiger"…

27
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:57,002
…will be ready for sea at 19:00, 10 December 1941.

28
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,458
Captain! Captain!

29
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,292
Enemy planes over.

30
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:15,963
Ready on engines?
- The best we can, Sir.

31
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,292
Cut those lines!

32
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,383
Take cover!

33
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:20,725
I'm not denying we suffered minor damage, Sir, but…

34
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:21,727
Minor damage??

35
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:24,773
What does it take to convince you? You've been sunk!

36
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:27,805
You ought to read your own report.
- Yes.

37
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,018
“Bulkheads, main ballast tanks and pressure hull...

38
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,566
… ripped by bomb fragments.

39
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,768
Engine room flooded, main induction and ventilation wrecked…

40
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:40,317
… torpedo tubes, motor controls and reduction gear inoperable…

41
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:44,687
… electrical equipment, wiring, gauges, gyro, radio. "

42
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:46,265
All you've got out there…

43
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:50,226
… is a periscope sitting on a couple of thousand tons of scrap metal.

44
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:52,855
What do you suggest, sir?

45
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:56,064
Should we underwater weld to jury patch the hull before pumping her out…

46
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,775
… or should we raise her first and then work on the hull?

47
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:01,354
Matt, with major repairs
and a complete overhaul

48
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:03,523
maybe Sea Tiger could be put back in commission.

49
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:06,366
A functioning Navy yard might do it.
- Sir.

50
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:10,479
My chiefs are pretty good hands.
They know they're on their own.

51
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:13,147
and what we're up against. But we think we
can get " Sea Tiger " back in the war.

52
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:14,818
Yes, on who's side?

53
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:19,368
We're due to evacuate back to Bataan on the 26th...

54
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:23,530
... two weeks to do a job a yard couldn't do in two months.

55
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,608
We don't think we can get her into
fighting trim right away...

56
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:31,449
repair it... just enough to
reach the nearest sub tender.

57
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,111
That would be the "Bushnell", in Darwin.

58
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,534
... almost two thousand miles of ocean...

59
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,993
with the Japanese Navy roaming over it.

60
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:42,861
And you're going to make it in a sub
held together with spit and bailing wire?

61
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:44,077
Sir...

62
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,998
... the " Sea Tiger " deserves
a better epitaph than...

63
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,950
... "commissioned 1940,
sunk, 1941.

64
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:52,081
Engagements: none.
Shots fired: none. "

65
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,620
You can't let her go that way, it's like...

66
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:58,290
... a beautiful woman dying an old
maid, if know what I mean...

67
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,739
... by an old maid.

68
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:03,119
Did you ever sell used cars?
- No, sir.

69
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:05,533
I think you missed your calling.

70
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,368
Okay, Matt. You've got two weeks
to get her out or we blow her up.

71
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:10,576
Fair enough.

72
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:12,869
By the way...

73
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:16,294
... three of my officers and eighteen
men have been transferred...

74
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:18,787
... How soon can I can get them back?
- You don't.

75
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:21,001
You'll have to get by with a skeleton crew.

76
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,127
I'll get you what replacements I can.

77
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,462
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

78
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,134
All done.

79
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,511
Men, clean up later.
That's all we can do now.

80
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,509
An odd job but might hold alright.

81
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:15,465
Yes, sir.

82
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:35,469
Do you think the No. 2 tank will hold?

83
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:38,393
All that we can do is try, sir.

84
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:41,062
Which one are you holding?
- The left.

85
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,179
Well hang on.

86
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:44,182
Okay, give her some air.

87
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,817
I found it, I found it!

88
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:24,269
Found it. Look.
- I give up. What is it?

89
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:25,906
The cake that my mother sent me.

90
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:29,486
Isn't that nice. Take it to the
cook, maybe he'll warm it up.

91
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,313
Mothers.

92
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,356
Why couldn't she send
something we need?

93
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:38,571
Like a universal coupling joint.

94
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:47,987
What is it, Molumphry?

95
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:49,743
I do not know, sir.

96
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,150
Have a look.

97
00:10:56,661 --> 00:10:58,487
Looks like the Good Humor man.

98
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:01,412
I wonder if he left his tie off.
- What's going on?

99
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,744
Take a look, sir.
- Okay.

100
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,196
Holy moly.

101
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,958
What is it?

102
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:24,073
I hope I'm wrong, but with that suitcase
I'd say he was one of the replacements.

103
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,084
Don't tell me that!

104
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,828
Oh, for heaven's sake!
- Do you know anything about him?

105
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:32,204
Only from the society pages
of the Honolulu newspapers;...

106
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:35,295
His name is Lieutenant Nick Holden.
- Holden.

107
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,666
He's the darling of the
high-class social set.

108
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:40,706
I'll bet he is.
- He and the Admiral's wife...

109
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,748
won the rumba championship
two years in a row!

110
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:11,051
Okay, fellows. Come on,
knock it off. Back to work.

111
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,171
Lieutenant Nick Holden,
reporting for duty, sir.

112
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:27,838
Excuse the misunderstanding,
Mr. Holden...

113
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,884
It's unusual to see an Admiral's
aide without the Admiral.

114
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:34,387
He was scheduled to be transferred. I was
sent to make arrangements...

115
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:36,881
then the war broke out...
- And you're stranded?

116
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:39,593
Yes, sir. Captain Henderson
assigned me to you...

117
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:42,337
He said to hurry...
before you left.

118
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:44,135
The bearings are okay sir...

119
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:47,641
but if we don't come up with
an oil pump shaft we will only...

120
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:50,893
... get out of here by rowing.
- Didn't Hunkle follow up the requisition?

121
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,811
Requisition? That's all we do.
But we never get anything.

122
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:56,347
We might as well write
a letter to Santa Claus.

123
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,808
Ya. Well, thank you, Tostin.

124
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:03,594
Have you ever been in a submarine?
- No, sir.

125
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:07,601
We need a torpedo and gunnery
officer. Any experience?

126
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:10,309
Guns? I'm afraid not, sir.
- How about navigation?

127
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:12,188
Terribly sorry.
- Communications?

128
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,767
Wish I could help, sir.

129
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,138
Tell me.

130
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:18,349
Before becoming an Admiral's aide
What did you do in the navy?

131
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:20,811
Well, sir, I was primarily an
idea man.

132
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:22,357
I see. Well...

133
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:25,100
Tell me - what does
an idea man do?

134
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:28,271
I coordinated the Navy day
parade in Milwaukee...

135
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:32,316
... and I was the special liaison officer
for the Eleventh Naval District.

136
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:34,227
Liaison? With what?
- Hollywood.

137
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:38,146
I coordinated the design
of admission posters.

138
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,235
From there I transferred to
Fleet Headquarters Honolulu.

139
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,396
Is that where they gave you sea duty?

140
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:48,104
No, sir. I was the Recreation Officer
at the Royal Arms Hotel.

141
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:50,781
Just for my information...

142
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:53,566
... What does an idea man
do in a hotel?

143
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,859
The Navy took over the hotel
for officer's training...

144
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,107
and I saw that
entertainment was provided.

145
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:02,234
Have you ever been to sea?
- Yes, sir, destroyer duty.

146
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,988
How did you find time for it?
- It was a mistake, sir.

147
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,070
A week after I left Honolulu
they got it straightened out.

148
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:11,448
Who, the Admiral or
the Admiral's wife?

149
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,775
She must be upset
with you out here ;...

150
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,655
that will cost her the rumba
championship this year.

151
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:17,942
Holy!

152
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:24,823
Here you go, my man. Will you take
this bag and clubs to the submarine?

153
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:26,027
Thank you, son.

154
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,155
Hunkle.

155
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,952
What about that oil pump?

156
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,952
Well, I put in four requisitions.

157
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:47,793
Did you put stamp them urgent?
- I put a requisition in for one, sir.

158
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,626
For what?
- An urgent stamp, we haven't got one.

159
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:52,700
Haven't we received anything
from supplies?

160
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:54,500
The only requisition
that's been filled

161
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,659
is the requisition
for more requisition paper.

162
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,497
Captain, I got the trim pump broken
down. Want to look at it?

163
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,211
Yes.
- All right, Hunkle.

164
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,159
Can I help you, sir?

165
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,452
No, not really. My name
is Lt. Nick Holden.

166
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,918
I'm Ernest Hunkle.
- Pleasure to meet you.

167
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:11,667
Would care for some coffee?

168
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:14,246
Yes, thank you.
- Follow me.

169
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:25,043
Who is that?
- It's " The Prophet ", sir.

170
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,342
His he always that cheerful?

171
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,383
That's just the way he is, sir.
Don't mind him.

172
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:33,293
Cream and sugar?
- Yes, thank you.

173
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,791
"Why even try?...

174
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:39,418
If you're lucky enough...

175
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:43,127
to live through today...

176
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,093
tomorrow... ...

177
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:51,093
... you will die. "

178
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:53,175
I don't know...

179
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:57,380
From the looks of things around here
he knows what he's singing about.

180
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:59,305
Your coffee, sir.
- Thank you.

181
00:15:59,473 --> 00:16:01,929
Excuse me, I must get back to my work.
- Certainly.

182
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,129
Thank you.

183
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,388
Sir.

184
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:16,467
Sir. Look at this.
- What?

185
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:19,679
Last June, when we were
here, I requisitioned toilet paper.

186
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,306
Every time we've been back
I sent through a follow up...

187
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:26,557
... according to the book through channels
I even submitted a sample.

188
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:27,761
So what happens?

189
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:32,097
They responded : " Cannot identify,
requisition cancelled ".

190
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:36,303
Not that I'm complaining, sir,
but this what I've been going through.

191
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:38,603
All right, Hunkle.
Relax...

192
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,393
... Take a letter.

193
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:42,472
Let's see.

194
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:45,182
Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:48,102
From Commanding Officer
" USS Sea Tiger "...

196
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:51,689
To Supply Officer, Navy Yard,
Cavite, Philippines...

197
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:55,518
Dear Commander Submarine
Forces, etc...

198
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:58,984
Subject : Toilet paper.

199
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,101
One:. .

200
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,484
... on 6 June, 1941...

201
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:08,690
... this vessel submitted a requisition
for 150 rolls of toilet paper...

202
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:12,609
... On 16 December, 1941...

203
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,441
the requisition was returned
with stamped notation...

204
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,447
"can not identify material required".

205
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,528
Two :. .

206
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,573
The Commanding Officer of the
" USS Sea Tiger "...

207
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,154
can not help but wonder
what is being used...

208
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:30,401
at Cavite as a substitute for
this unidentifiable material...

209
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:32,566
once so well known
to this command.

210
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,611
Three :. . 
- Excuse me, sir.

211
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:38,239
What?
- Excuse me for interrupting.

212
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,239
Have you ever been to Las Vegas?
- Why?

213
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:44,114
The boys up there would say you're
trying to make your point the hard way.

214
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:47,119
Putting in requisitions,
going through channels...

215
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,410
You've got to sneak up
a few back alleys.

216
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,111
You need a Supply Officer to
help you find those back alleys.

217
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,658
You, Mr. Holden?
- Yes, sir.

218
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:57,320
You'd ruin your manicure.
- Here.

219
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:00,786
Don't let my manicure
fool you, sir.

220
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,617
I grew up in a neighborhood
called " Noah's Ark ".

221
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,329
If you didn't travel in pairs,
you didn't travel.

222
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,830
Why don't you make out a shopping list
and I'll see what's left at the market?

223
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,327
You're not the volunteering
type. What's your angle?

224
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,577
Same as yours. We both want
to get the submarine...

225
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:21,621
... out of here. You so you
can fight your war...

226
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:22,992
... and me...

227
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,162
Well, let's say I'm an optimist.

228
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,082
Wherever we're headed I am sure
I can get a better deal.

229
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,915
Mr. Holden, I may regret this...

230
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,957
... but you've just been
made my Supply Officer.

231
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,039
Get your list from Hunkle.
- Thank you, sir.

232
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:44,126
I am going to need a couple
of men. May I pick my own?

233
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:47,173
Right.
- Thank you, sir.

234
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:51,629
Hunkle...

235
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:54,753
... I've got a list for you. We're
going shopping tonight.

236
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:06,834
Turn on the lights.

237
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:23,677
Look, gentlemen, I think
we hit pay dirt.

238
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:25,094
Do you have the list?
- Yes, sir.

239
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:28,134
Take the stuff we
need to the door.

240
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:31,011
Let's go, we don't have much
time. Come on, guys.

241
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:32,635
You grab the wire.

242
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:35,217
I forgot something, sir.
- What did you forget?

243
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:38,142
I never wrapped up my belongings
for my kinfolk...

244
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,597
... if we don't get back.
- Will you stop talking like that?

245
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,344
They're going to find us and
shoot us down like a dog.

246
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,393
Will you shut up?
- Alright, Hunkle.

247
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:49,228
He's got the right idea;
so be very careful.

248
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:53,057
Get it to the door.
- Don't forget what you promised ;...

249
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:57,893
When the shooting starts turn your back
so Gertie won't get splattered.

250
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:01,351
Who is Gertie?

251
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:03,431
You don't know about Gertie?
- Shut up.

252
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,349
Get moving with that thing.

253
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:09,976
Hunkle, who is Gertie?

254
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:12,852
Molumphry will be
happy with this wiring.

255
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,726
Hunkle, I asked you a question.

256
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:26,560
Who is Gertie?

257
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:28,726
The truth is that she's nobody.
- Hunkle.

258
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:35,562
Well, sir, when my enlistment
was up last year, the boys...

259
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:37,481
... gave me a farewell party.

260
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:41,189
I do not usually drink, sir,
but that night I must have.

261
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:43,490
The last thing I remember...

262
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,443
... is standing in front of
a tattoo parlor...

263
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,492
May I?

264
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:04,858
They ought to hang you in the Louvre.
- I came home to marry...

265
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,035
... but when I saw myself
in the mirror, I reenlisted.

266
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,990
I never could explain
Gertie to my fiancée.

267
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:13,947
No. I can see you've
got a problem.

268
00:21:15,498 --> 00:21:17,073
But look on the bright side ;...

269
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:20,115
You've probably got the
sexiest chest in the Navy.

270
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:21,452
Sir.
- Yes.

271
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,158
I am not one to worry when
there's no need but...

272
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,699
... after we get this stuff to the door,
how do we get it to the boat?

273
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:32,406
Don't worry about that, just keep
your stuff... The police!

274
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,115
<i>- Check the warehouses. </i>

275
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:55,202
Halt!

276
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,870
What's your business here?

277
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:04,462
I stepped out for a breath of air.
- Let's see your identification.

278
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:07,202
Certainly. Here you are.

279
00:22:08,382 --> 00:22:09,661
Lieutenant.

280
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,120
Why black face, sir?

281
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:14,501
Don't you know the penalty for
breaking blackout regulations?

282
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:17,876
Blackout regulations?
- You read the order from Admiral Nimitz?

283
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:20,836
No. What order?
- Regulation 4-1-9-8-2 :. .

284
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,341
"... no navy personnel shall appear
at night without face camouflage. "

285
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:28,800
A plane comes over, you look up,
give away our position.

286
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:31,335
Sergeant, a face like that could
cause a lot of damage...

287
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,254
... I'll have to put you on report.

288
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,634
Honestly, sir, no
one told me about it.

289
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:37,549
Alright, you've been told.

290
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:40,761
Black out that face, Sgt.

291
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:43,135
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

292
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:00,591
Admiral Nimitz?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:14,516
Hey that was close.
- It's a trap...

294
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,513
we used to take possums like that...

295
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,355
you fool them so they feel
safe and then, bang!

296
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,430
We are three possums waiting...
- Come on, Prophet. Just...

297
00:23:24,273 --> 00:23:27,224
We've only got a couple of
minutes. Get the stuff.

298
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:56,528
Hey Chief!
- Yes, Dooley?

299
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:58,279
Your shaft's here.

300
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,645
Thanks, Dooley.

301
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:07,151
Look, Molumphry, brand
new oil pump shaft.

302
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:09,776
Congratulations, look's like you, Tostin.

303
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,320
What is that?
- Your refrigerator unit.

304
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:17,612
That?
- We were lucky to get it.

305
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:19,656
Man, it was cold in
that ice house.

306
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:24,158
Look, sir, new oil pump shaft.
- Fine, fine.

307
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:26,863
Where is Mr. Holden?
- Keeping an eye on the truck.

308
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:28,149
Mr. Holden!

309
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:34,738
A decent night for shopping, sir.
- Yes

310
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:36,453
Could be something saved.

311
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,449
I know where you got the Navy
supplies but what about the truck?

312
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:44,484
I can't take credit for the
truck, sir. Ramon got it.

313
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,370
Ramon??
-Ramon!

314
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:49,865
Smile, sir. He's very sensitive.

315
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:52,701
What?
- Captain Sherman, Sergeant Gillardo.

316
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:55,407
I'm happy to be a member
of your crew, sir.

317
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,038
What do you mean,
member of my crew??

318
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:00,036
Well, sir...

319
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:03,249
I promised the sergeant that if he
helped us out, you'll take him on.

320
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,120
But he's a marine.

321
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:08,706
Well, he's open to a better offer.
You'd better get back to work.

322
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:12,408
I'll handle this.

323
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,540
That man is a prisoner.

324
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:19,711
Well, it was. You see, the prison
stockade was bombed...

325
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,450
... you have no idea how
hard it was to find him.

326
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,792
You mean you actually
went looking for him?

327
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:27,370
Of course. He's the greatest
operator around here...

328
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:30,416
... shortly after he became
General Warren's chef...

329
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,830
... he went into business for himself.
- I'll bet.

330
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:35,295
He was sole owner of
best restaurant in Manila.

331
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,791
And what about the
" P " on his back?

332
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,295
The " P "?
- Yes

333
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:41,502
Oh, that...
Let's start there.

334
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:45,923
You see, someone started prying and
found that the Marines...

335
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:50,253
supplying all the meat and silverware...
But he's a man who can get a job done.

336
00:25:50,803 --> 00:25:54,632
There isn't a burglar, swindler,
pickpocket or fence on the island...

337
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,960
that doesn't love, know,
and respect him.

338
00:25:57,137 --> 00:26:00,384
That's probably a glowing
recommendation, Mr. Holden...

339
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:02,925
I have no intention of taking
a thief on my crew...

340
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:05,668
He's an escaped prisoner,
a deserter.

341
00:26:06,014 --> 00:26:08,882
True, but he is also one other thing.
- What?

342
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:11,345
He's also an informer...

343
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,506
... and if we don't take him
he will tell everybody everything.

344
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:16,631
Yeah.

345
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,681
And you're in too deep
for than now, sir.

346
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:22,004
We don't have a sales slip
for all this merchandise.

347
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,636
It seems I'm boxed in,
Mr. Holden.

348
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:29,757
You've made a wise decision, sir. I will
tell him, he will be so happy.

349
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:32,883
Ramon!

350
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:41,264
You have to give him credit, sir...

351
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:43,475
... that's what I call a Supply Officer.
- What?

352
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:45,472
I wonder where he got everything.

353
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,262
There's only one way to live with the
situation. It's like watching a stripper...

354
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:52,640
... do not ask how she does it,
just enjoy what's coming off.

355
00:26:55,607 --> 00:26:59,388
19 December, 1941.
The repairs are progressing.

356
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,723
Morale is high, except
for their concern that...

357
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:04,270
... our supply officer might
be caught and shot.

358
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:06,349
I have mixed feelings ;...

359
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:09,359
Lt. Holden and Sgt. Gillardo
are undoubtedly...

360
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,482
the world's greatest thieves.

361
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:13,731
Scavengers.

362
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:16,228
To paraphrase Mr. Churchill ;...

363
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:20,019
... " never have so few
stolen so much from so many. "

364
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,774
And what they can not find
in warehouses...

365
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:24,319
... they improvise.

366
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:49,774
Mr. Sherman, I'm aware that there has been
wholesale scavenging...

367
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:52,193
No, up to now I overlooked it,
knowing the position.

368
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:55,073
Yes, sir.
- But this time you've gone too far.

369
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:56,691
Mr. Sherman...

370
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,113
I want my wall back.

371
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:07,116
I'm not sure we have it.
- You must have it. You've got everything else.

372
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:09,992
I do not mind a bit of
initiative but you...

373
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:11,991
Sir, I have to get back to my boat.

374
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:16,287
Wait a minute, I'll go with you!

375
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,332
Any damage?
- No direct hit, sir.

376
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:12,592
Concussion may have sprung some plates
in the tanks, Mr. Watson's checking.

377
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,633
Or camouflage caught fire,
we cut it down.

378
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:16,461
Were we spotted?
- Yes, sir.

379
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:18,543
A couple gave us a close-up
look we could spit at...

380
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:21,209
without the. 50 that's
all we could do.

381
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:29,762
Well, I guess that does it.

382
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:33,628
Now they'll know where to find us.
- I'm sorry, Matt.

383
00:29:34,057 --> 00:29:36,510
Sir, request permission
to get underway.

384
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:38,091
Get underway?
- Yes

385
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:39,177
In that?

386
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:41,803
I can get as far as Cebu and
complete repairs.

387
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:43,930
Cebu??
- That's only 400 miles.

388
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,217
You'd be in trouble if it was 400 feet.
You're in no condition to go out.

389
00:29:47,393 --> 00:29:50,391
We've made amazing progress.
- You can not even submerge...

390
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,724
If you try running on top in
the daylight you're a dead duck.

391
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:55,846
Molumphry!
- Yes, sir?

392
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,101
Can this boat go down?
- Like a rock, sir.

393
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:02,471
Mr. Watson, how are the plates?
- Tight as a drum, sir.

394
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:05,763
And the engines, Tostin?
- Factory fresh, sir.

395
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:07,390
What do you say, sir?

396
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,853
Take your scavengers and
these liars and get out.

397
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,765
Yes, sir.
- But one stipulation.

398
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,475
You will engage no enemy shipping,
including lifeboats.

399
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:19,772
If you see someone swimming
in the water avoid him.

400
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,137
Yes, sir.
- Good luck.

401
00:30:21,315 --> 00:30:22,346
Thank you, sir.

402
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,311
Matt.

403
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:27,773
Is this what's left of
my wall?

404
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:29,104
I wouldn't know, sir.

405
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:31,066
I would appreciate at least...

406
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:33,309
... getting my window back.
- Yes, sir.

407
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:40,318
Can we make it?

408
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:42,810
Well, we have No. 1
engine in shape.

409
00:30:42,987 --> 00:30:45,392
No. 2 I'll tell you about
when it's put back together.

410
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,649
How about three and four?

411
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:49,108
I've been using them for
parts for one and two.

412
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,896
I am a religious man, Captain, I
believe God will get us through.

413
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,274
Of course, He'll have to give
us his undivided attention.

414
00:30:57,698 --> 00:30:58,860
Mr. Watson!

415
00:30:59,032 --> 00:31:01,900
Be ready to get underway when
Mr. Holden and his gang get back.

416
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:03,651
Aye, sir.
- Any idea where they went?

417
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:06,147
No, sir. When the air raid
started they took off.

418
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:10,611
All Mr. Holden said was:
" in confusion there is profit. "

419
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:25,778
Obviously the same
guys who...

420
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,741
Sir, we just got a call from the
Security Officer, and he's furious.

421
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,162
Why? What's wrong?

422
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,570
Apparently someone
stole his safe.

423
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,911
What happened, sir?

424
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:55,203
Douglas, I think we've been victims
of Sherman's march to the sea.

425
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:58,989
Make all preparations
for getting underway.

426
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:00,117
Aye aye, sir.

427
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,918
Station the watch.

428
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:03,877
Lookouts to posts for sea.

429
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:11,460
Ready to get underway?
- Ready, sir.

430
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:15,166
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

431
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:17,745
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

432
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:39,010
Ready on No. 1 engine.

433
00:32:39,177 --> 00:32:41,381
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Get ready on No. 1 engine.

434
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,089
Any time they're ready.

435
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:10,305
Maneuvering, Bridge.
Any time you're ready.

436
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,887
Mr. Holden! What
the devil is that?

437
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:44,348
A witch doctor, sir. Ramon found
him in the hills. We hired him.

438
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,220
You hired him?

439
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,685
To ward off evil spirits
and wish us a safe journey.

440
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:52,312
I figured we could use all
the help we could get, sir.

441
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:07,892
Hey hey hey hey.

442
00:34:09,154 --> 00:34:10,185
Cut that out.

443
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:13,609
Mr. Holden! Will you tell
this fella...

444
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,651
I can't hear myself think!

445
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:18,154
Go away, please!

446
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:23,570
Get away from my boat!
Get away from my... !

447
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:34,361
Single up all lines.

448
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,529
Single one.

449
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,065
Single four.

450
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,988
Right full rudder.

451
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:48,285
All ahead one third,
starboard back one third.

452
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:50,279
All ahead one third,
starboard back one third.

453
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:51,450
What a character.

454
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,409
All stop. Shift your rudder.

455
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:11,076
All stop. Shift your rudder.

456
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,953
All ahead two thirds.
Ease your rudder.

457
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,870
All ahead two thirds.
Ease your rudder.

458
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:57,717
You'll never make it.

459
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:17,924
Tostin is still fighting with
the No. 2 engine, sir.

460
00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:19,424
Sounds like he's losing.

461
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:21,638
How's the battery charge?

462
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,963
Just enough for
a trim dive.

463
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,546
Okay to try it?

464
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:28,972
Not now, wait for the dawn,
we have to take it down then.

465
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,340
We will have to try it sometime.

466
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:34,387
I'm not complaining, sir.
I had my choice.

467
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:35,339
Of what?

468
00:36:36,016 --> 00:36:37,558
I could have gone
to West Point.

469
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,382
Careful, sir.

470
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:52,887
Well, now is the time.

471
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:54,259
Let's take her down.

472
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:55,594
Aye, sir.

473
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:57,680
Clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge.

474
00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:59,134
Number one.
- Aye.

475
00:36:59,313 --> 00:37:00,511
Number Two.
- Aye.

476
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:02,349
Number Three.
- Number Four.

477
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:13,513
Make depth five-eight feet.
- Aye, sir. Five-eight feet.

478
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,182
Five-eight feet.

479
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:26,980
Check your bubble.

480
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:41,602
Close all vents.

481
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:53,611
All ahead one third.

482
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:55,062
All ahead one third.

483
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:04,405
Periscope depth.

484
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:08,737
Let's check for leaks.
Take her down to 100 feet.

485
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:14,240
All ahead two-thirds.

486
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:15,526
All ahead two-thirds.

487
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:17,244
6 degrees down bubble.

488
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,826
All departments check
for leaks. Report to control.

489
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,116
All departments check
for leaks. Report to control.

490
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,745
Close watertight doors.
Close bulkhead flappers.

491
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,288
Close watertight doors.
Close bulkhead flappers.

492
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,076
She creaks a bit.

493
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:58,785
She's sure moaning
and groaning, sir.

494
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,744
Cycle all vents.

495
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:11,881
I doubt if Sam Sneed would approve
of using irons that way.

496
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:14,581
We were lucky that Mr. Holden
had a set of golf clubs.

497
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:15,705
Aren't we?

498
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,164
Guess we didn't bleed all the air
out of the hydraulic system.

499
00:39:27,928 --> 00:39:29,337
100 feet.

500
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,888
You can't win, my friend.

501
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,758
You can't win.

502
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,224
You can't win, so
why even try?

503
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:00,714
If you're lucky enough...

504
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,425
to live through today... ...

505
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:08,840
Tomorrow you will die.

506
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,468
All compartments report
tight, sir.

507
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:16,260
Thank you.

508
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,393
Open the watertight doors.

509
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,766
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

510
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:27,641
If you're ready for breakfast, sir,
I'll be in the wardroom.

511
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:29,728
What is that?
- Orange juice, sir.

512
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:30,928
Where are you taking it?

513
00:40:31,106 --> 00:40:33,560
For Mr. Holden. He's
having breakfast in bed.

514
00:40:34,524 --> 00:40:36,561
Wait a moment, Sgt.

515
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,271
I'll take it down.
- Yes, sir.

516
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,066
May I come in?

517
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,432
Please do.

518
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,435
Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Holden.

519
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,562
I've got a bad neck from too much tennis.
- Really?

520
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,313
Well. Did you get a good night's sleep?

521
00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:01,611
Not too good; it was a little damp
and noisy. Strange surroundings.

522
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:03,238
I'm sorry to hear that.

523
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:04,935
Thank you.

524
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:07,022
Well, how's the food?
Satisfactory?

525
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:09,231
Excellent, thank you.

526
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:11,734
Would you like a cigar?
- No, no thanks.

527
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,029
I suppose after you
digested breakfast...

528
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,984
you'll want to get up on deck and play
a little shuffleboard, right?

529
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:25,026
This war must be inconvenient
for you, Mr. Holden?

530
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:26,901
I try to make the best of.

531
00:41:27,076 --> 00:41:30,277
Yes, and you do, indeed you do.

532
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:33,944
I know you're not familiar with
the way the functions at sea.

533
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,027
Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

534
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,152
But here we all...

535
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:41,949
We all eat and work together... ...

536
00:41:42,121 --> 00:41:45,535
and so you won't upset that system,
You will have to do it our way.

537
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:49,115
You've got three minutes to get off
your fat mattress...

538
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:51,327
and report to Mr. Watson!
- Yes, sir.

539
00:41:51,498 --> 00:41:54,781
You are going to learn something
if I have to poor it into you!

540
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:58,999
Another thing : here we dress alike,
Got any regulation trousers?

541
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:02,250
No, sir. I had all my clothes made
at " Saks " Fifth Avenue.

542
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:05,037
I can't to do anything about the
uniform, but don't want you to think...

543
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:08,076
I'll expect breakfast
in bed every morning.

544
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,538
Scuttlebutt is that we will
submerge at daybreak...

545
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,784
... and if you gotta go,
you might as well go big.

546
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,409
It is past daybreak
and we are submerged.

547
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:20,876
We are?
- Yes.

548
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:23,920
You mean we're under??
- Yes

549
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:29,459
But it isn't a permanent
situation?

550
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,836
I mean, we can
up if we'd like to?

551
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:35,290
Well, I'd like to think we can.
But I'm an incurable optimist.

552
00:42:38,008 --> 00:42:39,880
What happens, sir, if... ?

553
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:42,337
What happens if we can not... ?

554
00:42:44,884 --> 00:42:46,376
If we can not...

555
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,748
Then...

556
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:53,007
What kind of answer is that?
- Why? Nervous, Mr. Holden?

557
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:54,583
Yes.

558
00:42:55,136 --> 00:42:57,885
Tell me something :
Why did you join the navy?

559
00:42:58,512 --> 00:43:00,633
because I needed
an officer's uniform.

560
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:04,675
As a kid I was a victim of the
most vicious propaganda;...

561
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:07,845
people told me... that money
was not everything, and I believed it.

562
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,256
Until I found out that
people saying...

563
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:12,717
... "money is not everything "
were the ones who had it.

564
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:15,426
I figured they were trying
to hide a good thing.

565
00:43:15,848 --> 00:43:17,127
Sir, please sit down.

566
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:18,802
Yes.

567
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:25,135
Now there are two simple
ways to make money :. .

568
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:27,429
You can steal it,
or you can marry it.

569
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,012
To marry it, you have to
travel in the right circles...

570
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:32,761
... on the right side of the tracks.

571
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:34,014
Two things I learned:

572
00:43:34,186 --> 00:43:37,516
One : A uniform can take you
to the best places, and two :. .

573
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,852
no one ever checks Dun and
Bradstreet in a bedroom.

574
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,220
It sounds like a
winning combination.

575
00:43:43,395 --> 00:43:44,889
Would you like to see the jackpot?

576
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:49,355
That the girl from
the right side of the tracks?

577
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:51,306
She owns the tracks...

578
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:55,724
... or 5. 2 % of all the
railroad stock in America.

579
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:57,596
Isn't she lovely?

580
00:43:58,066 --> 00:44:02,013
We had a dinner date one night, and
I was a few minutes late...

581
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:03,732
and she didn't want it to happen again.

582
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:07,269
Have you ever seen
a two thousand dollar watch?

583
00:44:07,483 --> 00:44:08,811
My, my, my.

584
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:13,105
When the minister says " will you take
this woman? " he won't be kidding.

585
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:16,694
When is the happy occasion?
- The day I get back.

586
00:44:17,277 --> 00:44:20,727
You see that I get back and I'll
see you have a private submarine.

587
00:44:20,904 --> 00:44:22,101
For heaven's sake.

588
00:44:27,488 --> 00:44:29,029
Excuse me.

589
00:44:29,363 --> 00:44:32,065
Is this normal or should
I be nervous again?

590
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:33,945
Captain!
- Yes

591
00:44:34,115 --> 00:44:36,153
One of our connections
carried away, sir...

592
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:38,480
We're rigging a patch,
but I don't think it will hold.

593
00:44:40,616 --> 00:44:43,779
Prepare to surface.
- Stand by to surface. Lookouts to conning tower.

594
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,229
Stand by to surface.
Lookouts to conning tower.

595
00:44:45,408 --> 00:44:47,612
How much time for repairs?
- About six hours...

596
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:49,989
... if we can work over the side.
- Six hours...

597
00:44:50,575 --> 00:44:54,156
The nearest place with a
sheltered anchorage is

598
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:55,904
Marinduque island. We better head there.
- Okay.

599
00:44:56,078 --> 00:44:57,108
Watch your fault.
- Yes, sir.

600
00:44:57,285 --> 00:44:59,242
All free, sir. Sound the alarm.

601
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,026
22 December, 1941.

602
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:07,825
Arrived Marinduque two hours
after enemy air raid.

603
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,197
Repairs have to be completed
before their next visit.

604
00:45:11,372 --> 00:45:13,577
To get Lt. Holden out
from underfoot...

605
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:17,362
I sent him and his men
to scout the island.

606
00:45:22,332 --> 00:45:24,157
Captain.
- Yes

607
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,493
Mr. Holden is coming back, sir.

608
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:29,416
War is hell,
Mr. Watson.

609
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:32,659
Not only that, sir.

610
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:35,244
Wait until you see
what he's got with him.

611
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,169
Women!

612
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:04,505
Wow! That's what
I call scavenging!

613
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:08,756
I... What I meant sir is...

614
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:11,794
... I'm sure there will be something
they can be used for.

615
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:15,215
I can think of many uses,
but not here and now.

616
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:19,921
Mr. Stovall, the influence of
Lt. Holden is beginning to worry me.

617
00:46:20,094 --> 00:46:23,424
I suggest you "Wow!" less and
"Tsk Tsk Tsk" more...

618
00:46:44,557 --> 00:46:46,928
Mayor Heywood.
- Major Heywood.

619
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:51,554
Lieutenant Duran.
- Lieutenant Duran.

620
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,466
Lieutenant Reid.
- Lieutenant.

621
00:46:57,227 --> 00:46:58,768
Lieutenant. Colfax.

622
00:46:59,728 --> 00:47:00,757
Lieutenant.

623
00:47:02,644 --> 00:47:04,186
Lieutenant Crandall.

624
00:47:07,395 --> 00:47:09,885
If anyone asks what
you're fighting for...

625
00:47:10,521 --> 00:47:11,849
... there's your answer.

626
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:19,356
Lt. Holden invited us
to go with you.

627
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:20,560
What?

628
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:22,978
The Major and her unit
were stranded, sir.

629
00:47:23,148 --> 00:47:25,519
We were en route to Manila
and heard it was being bombed...

630
00:47:25,691 --> 00:47:27,932
... and we had to land here.
- Oh.

631
00:47:28,108 --> 00:47:30,313
The Japanese strafed
the airstrip and...

632
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:33,054
our plane took off to keep from
being destroyed on the ground.

633
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:34,693
He was supposed to
come back for us.

634
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,269
Alright.
- it didn't make it.

635
00:47:36,443 --> 00:47:39,276
They were the only Americans
on the island, sir...

636
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:41,350
You could not possibly
leave them there.

637
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:42,559
Thank you.

638
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,902
It's an emergency, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Holden.

639
00:47:46,612 --> 00:47:50,820
Now, Major, obviously we have to
get out of here as fast as we can, so...

640
00:47:51,279 --> 00:47:53,947
if you'll get your party below,
I'll get you to Cebu...

641
00:47:54,113 --> 00:47:55,940
... where you can
rejoin an Army unit.

642
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:59,238
Escort the Major to the wardroom.
- Yes, sir.

643
00:47:59,407 --> 00:48:00,271
Thank you, Lieutenant.

644
00:48:00,448 --> 00:48:02,403
Thank you, ma'am.
- This way, ladies.

645
00:48:07,116 --> 00:48:09,238
I guess I'm stuck.
- Yes

646
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:12,490
Just a minute. Come on. That's right.

647
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:16,528
Thank you very much.
- Suggest you take the other one off.

648
00:48:23,828 --> 00:48:24,858
Sir.

649
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:26,572
Mr. Holden, just a minute.

650
00:48:26,745 --> 00:48:28,985
Mr. Watson!
- Yes, sir?

651
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:32,030
Please assemble the crew.

652
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:35,992
Instruct them to ignore that
our passengers are women.

653
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,866
That may require some...

654
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,404
readjustment... but I want
every man to understand...

655
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,786
our objective is Cebu
and then Darwin.

656
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:46,619
If any man has any
other objective in mind...

657
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:48,159
he'd better forget it.

658
00:48:48,332 --> 00:48:50,075
You will put on report...

659
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:51,780
Collision!

660
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,284
Collision, sir!
- Really...

661
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,118
we're not even moving.

662
00:49:03,877 --> 00:49:06,081
Who hit the collision button?
- I do not know, sir.

663
00:49:06,252 --> 00:49:09,501
Everything has a reason
for being here...

664
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:12,667
What happened?
- I'm very sorry.

665
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:16,454
I was coming down the ladder and
accidentally touched that button.

666
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:17,454
She grabbed the collision alarm.

667
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,123
Just a minute.

668
00:49:18,962 --> 00:49:22,128
Please, ladies, there is one primary rule
you must observe:. .

669
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:24,621
keep your hands...
and... you're, uh...

670
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,045
Just do not touch anything.

671
00:49:27,257 --> 00:49:31,122
The ladies will occupy the Chief's quarters
and my cabin.

672
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,591
The Chiefs move out with the men. Move my gear
with Watson and you stay with Holden.

673
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,587
Now, uh...

674
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:41,882
For the next few days we'll
be living in close contact...

675
00:49:42,052 --> 00:49:43,675
and you being women... and...

676
00:49:43,844 --> 00:49:48,004
the crew being men,
being confined could...

677
00:49:48,763 --> 00:49:51,132
could create situations...
not usually...

678
00:49:51,303 --> 00:49:53,710
consistent with normal
submarine operations.

679
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,503
What I mean to say.
- We know what you mean, Captain.

680
00:49:57,681 --> 00:49:59,552
We're well acquainted
with the facts of life.

681
00:49:59,722 --> 00:50:03,052
So are the men. I'm just trying to
avoid any exchange of information.

682
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:07,135
You must...

683
00:50:07,766 --> 00:50:09,092
You must realize that...

684
00:50:09,265 --> 00:50:12,468
submarines are not designed
to be coeducational.

685
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,840
... That is to say...

686
00:50:16,184 --> 00:50:19,265
Mr. Stovall, take the
ladies to the wardroom.

687
00:50:19,435 --> 00:50:21,805
I'll try to work out a schedule.
- Yes, sir.

688
00:50:25,353 --> 00:50:27,094
You'll eat in the officers' mess.

689
00:50:27,811 --> 00:50:32,101
Mealtimes are
7:00, 12:00 and 18:00.

690
00:50:33,271 --> 00:50:35,428
Now, this is the shower.

691
00:50:35,605 --> 00:50:36,387
Excuse me.

692
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,138
Instructions are on the bulkhead.

693
00:50:39,396 --> 00:50:42,844
Your shower period
will be 6:30 to 6:50.

694
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,310
You will each have
a minute and a half.

695
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:46,808
A minute and a half?

696
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:50,397
Captain 's orders, there are
problems with fresh water supply.

697
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:52,224
How can you shower in
a minute and a half?

698
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:55,233
What you miss one day you
can get the next time around.

699
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:59,188
In here is what we
in the Navy call...

700
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:05,014
It's operated by means of
the air compression levers...

701
00:51:05,193 --> 00:51:07,812
What do they call it?

702
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:12,230
The head.

703
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:17,654
I've drawn a complete diagram.
I'm sure you will have no trouble.

704
00:51:27,408 --> 00:51:29,196
Why do they call it the head?

705
00:51:30,325 --> 00:51:31,522
Doesn't say.

706
00:51:33,618 --> 00:51:35,820
A woman on board
is bad luck, sir...

707
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:38,279
... and if one is bad luck,
imagine five.

708
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:41,532
Alright, what do you want me to do?
Throw them overboard?

709
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:43,366
It 's something to think about.

710
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:48,408
Do what you can, okay?

711
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,620
Hunkle, what 's going
on in there?

712
00:51:51,787 --> 00:51:53,777
It's a raffle, they're
drawing for the women.

713
00:51:53,953 --> 00:51:55,032
They're drawing for the women?

714
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:58,155
Mr. Holden organized it. They're
picking the five lucky men now.

715
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,278
Kraus.

716
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:05,824
Congratulations.
What did you give away?

717
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,575
What's going on?
- A raffle, sir.

718
00:52:07,748 --> 00:52:08,911
What kind of raffle?

719
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:12,200
For clothing.
- Clothes?

720
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,615
Yes. The men are donating
their clothes to the women.

721
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:17,157
Have you men finished chow?
- Yes, sir.

722
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:20,284
Then back on the job. We
have to get out of here.

723
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:22,327
Mr. Holden.
- Yes, sir.

724
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,701
How did all that get started?

725
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,535
I thought I was boosting
the men's morale, sir...

726
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:32,868
... after all there's a practical side ;...

727
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:35,367
these women have been
on an island for quite a while...

728
00:52:35,546 --> 00:52:37,203
... their clothes are all messed up.

729
00:52:37,379 --> 00:52:40,378
Sooner or later they will
have to wash them...

730
00:52:40,547 --> 00:52:44,494
With everything hanging on
the line and nothing hanging on the...

731
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,711
You see, sir, it could
be rather awkward.

732
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:52,663
Yes.

733
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:57,335
Carry on, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

734
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:10,089
I wish I had a decent mirror.

735
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:14,797
Why the Navy still use
that silly clasp?

736
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,794
We just found out
it's tradition...

737
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:19,969
... each button represents one of
the original thirteen states.

738
00:53:20,138 --> 00:53:22,129
Well you better
button up New Jersey.

739
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:25,673
How's the shirt?
- A little tight.

740
00:53:26,056 --> 00:53:29,090
I'd better reinforce those buttons
before you take a deep breath.

741
00:53:29,765 --> 00:53:32,006
The Navy's got to have
some thread, come on.

742
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:44,131
Hello.
- Hi.

743
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:48,514
What's wrong?

744
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:51,139
Kraus does absolutely
nothing for you.

745
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,974
You don't put the crown jewels
in a paper bag. Come.

746
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:56,307
Where are we going?

747
00:54:01,813 --> 00:54:03,851
But I 'm happy
with these pants.

748
00:54:04,022 --> 00:54:05,680
Barbara, they just won't do.

749
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:07,052
Let me see.

750
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:10,728
They're not uncomfortable.
- Barbara, will you stop being nervous?

751
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:13,139
I'm not nervous.
- Well, of course you're nervous.

752
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:16,184
This is part of my job;
I'm your Supply Officer.

753
00:54:16,358 --> 00:54:19,356
But I do not need...
- 35-22-34?

754
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,890
Then you've got
these supplies before.

755
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,352
Let's see...

756
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:27,068
" Shorts ". Do you play tennis?

757
00:54:27,235 --> 00:54:30,269
Well, I...
- Here's a tennis sweater...

758
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:31,766
... a shirt...

759
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:34,192
... a nice robe, clean...

760
00:54:34,652 --> 00:54:36,727
... and also a pair of pyjamas.

761
00:54:36,904 --> 00:54:38,609
Well, I...
- Excuse me.

762
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:40,108
Hello.

763
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,603
Stovall, aren't you on watch?

764
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:47,563
Yes. I was just
on my way up.

765
00:54:48,072 --> 00:54:49,187
Excuse me.

766
00:54:49,781 --> 00:54:50,695
Good night.

767
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,863
Now where were we? Oh yes.

768
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:56,606
I think you ought to
try these on for size.

769
00:54:57,283 --> 00:55:01,147
Lieutenant, I appreciate the offer
but I can not take your pyjamas.

770
00:55:01,325 --> 00:55:02,439
Why not?

771
00:55:02,616 --> 00:55:05,983
Well frankly, it's
a little embarrassing.

772
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,193
A girl does not get
into any man's pyjamas.

773
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:12,067
If the man's not in them,
what's the harm?

774
00:55:12,245 --> 00:55:13,866
And what are you
going to sleep in?

775
00:55:16,162 --> 00:55:18,318
All right, we'll compromise:. .

776
00:55:18,496 --> 00:55:20,238
I'll take the bottoms...

777
00:55:20,953 --> 00:55:22,116
And you can have the tops...

778
00:55:22,288 --> 00:55:25,038
unless you prefer... ...
- The top will be fine.

779
00:55:27,663 --> 00:55:29,406
What else can I give you?

780
00:55:32,748 --> 00:55:33,742
Champagne.

781
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:37,116
Under the heading of supplies, too?
- No.

782
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:40,829
You see, I am also
Morale Officer.

783
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:44,876
You know, it's against regulations
to have this on board

784
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:47,496
If we do not drink it,
I will have to pour it out.

785
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:51,454
All we need is a couple
of glasses and some ice.

786
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:53,498
Now look, we can't...
-Ramon!

787
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:54,699
Yes, sir?

788
00:55:56,378 --> 00:55:57,373
Thank you.
- Hello.

789
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:00,118
Good night.

790
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:03,080
I'm ready to relieve you, sir.

791
00:56:03,588 --> 00:56:05,295
You're an hour early, Mr. Stovall.

792
00:56:05,547 --> 00:56:08,000
I couldn't sleep and figured
I might as well come up.

793
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:10,714
Where are your binoculars?

794
00:56:11,215 --> 00:56:12,327
In my room.

795
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:15,290
Okay, carry on. I'll send them up.
-No, I'll go get them, sir.

796
00:56:16,298 --> 00:56:19,499
You've just relieved Mr. Watson.
- But you can't do that.

797
00:56:20,049 --> 00:56:21,459
And why can't I do that?

798
00:56:22,175 --> 00:56:24,878
Well, because...
- Just what can't I do?

799
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:28,046
Go to the room.
- Why I can't I go to the room?

800
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:31,301
Because Mr. Holden
is sleeping.

801
00:56:31,468 --> 00:56:35,462
I'll try not to wake him.
-No! I mean, is, that he...

802
00:56:35,969 --> 00:56:39,419
He has company.
- He's sleeping and he has company?

803
00:56:53,597 --> 00:56:55,340
Hello.
- Hello.

804
00:56:56,098 --> 00:56:57,342
What are we celebrating?

805
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:01,345
Lieutenant Holden was just
giving me his clothes.

806
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:06,426
That's worth drinking to,
but unfortunately regulations...

807
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:09,389
Right. I think I'd better be going.

808
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:13,382
Thank you.
- Certainly.

809
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,386
Good night, sir.
- Good night.

810
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,268
Where did you pick up the champagne?
- Captain Henderson's office.

811
00:57:22,437 --> 00:57:24,973
I thought it was better that
he keep a clear head.

812
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:26,769
Very thoughtful of you.

813
00:57:27,938 --> 00:57:31,719
Now I have this unreasonable
desire to get back in the war.

814
00:57:31,897 --> 00:57:32,762
Yes, I know, sir.

815
00:57:32,939 --> 00:57:36,353
I'd prefer to do it as captain of a
fighting ship not a cocktail bar.

816
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:37,518
As of this moment the
cocktail lounge...

817
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,268
... is closed, sir.
- Yes.

818
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:42,144
No customers after hours.
- Absolutely not.

819
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:43,644
Fine.

820
00:57:55,735 --> 00:57:57,358
That's the idea.

821
00:58:03,403 --> 00:58:04,269
Kraus.

822
00:58:05,446 --> 00:58:06,192
Yes?

823
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:08,272
Which one touched your clothes?

824
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:12,230
I don't know. But I sure hope
it's the one with the big...

825
00:58:12,404 --> 00:58:15,356
Knock it off.
- What's the matter with you?

826
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,273
Quit talking about her that way.

827
00:58:17,447 --> 00:58:19,190
She's a woman.
- So?

828
00:58:21,074 --> 00:58:23,196
Well my mother is a woman.
- So?

829
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:27,820
I do not know, it just
all seems to tie in somehow.

830
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:43,905
Good morning.
- Good morning.

831
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,485
I'm having a little trouble.
I can't get it to work...

832
00:58:46,663 --> 00:58:48,903
I think there is something wrong
with that shower head.

833
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:53,361
Try this.
- Captain...

834
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:56,869
I'd like to apologize for
setting off the collision alarm.

835
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:00,158
That's all right. Tell me,
did you follow the instructions?

836
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:02,572
Yes, I turned this knob

837
00:59:02,749 --> 00:59:04,030
... and this one...

838
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:06,117
... and then this.

839
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:14,120
At least I think that's what I did.
- Yes, that's what you did.

840
00:59:14,293 --> 00:59:16,202
Oh dear.
- That's okay.

841
00:59:16,377 --> 00:59:19,127
let me dry you off.
- No, please.

842
00:59:20,752 --> 00:59:23,243
Good morning.
- Good morning.

843
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,910
That's a clever shower schedule
you've got worked out, sir.

844
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:27,711
... Conserves water, too.

845
00:59:28,172 --> 00:59:31,334
Lt. Crandall was having difficulty.
- Sir, it's your boat.

846
00:59:31,755 --> 00:59:32,834
Excuse me.

847
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:39,871
It's just as well it didn't work. I left
my dusting powder in my room.

848
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:43,248
Your dusting powder.
- Would you hold that for me? Be right back.

849
00:59:43,591 --> 00:59:45,332
Terrible.

850
00:59:48,425 --> 00:59:49,420
Good morning, sir.

851
00:59:49,592 --> 00:59:50,920
Good morning.
- Can I get you anything?

852
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:52,835
Yes, anything.
- Yes, sir.

853
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,297
My dusting powder.
- I see.

854
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:01,460
Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

855
01:00:02,428 --> 01:00:05,214
Wait, Captain. Sir!
- What is it?

856
01:00:05,387 --> 01:00:07,094
There's a woman in
my engine room.

857
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:09,794
You have to get her out.
- Who?

858
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:13,751
The Major. She washed her clothes and
hung them there to dry.

859
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:16,882
It's bad luck to have
a woman in the engine room.

860
01:00:17,057 --> 01:00:18,928
Tostin, what harm can their clothes do?

861
01:00:19,474 --> 01:00:21,677
That's when they're dangerous,
like snakes...

862
01:00:21,848 --> 01:00:23,389
when they shed their skin... look out.

863
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:25,595
Can I have my scrubber please?

864
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:27,054
Yes, here you go.

865
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:29,132
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

866
01:00:30,475 --> 01:00:32,929
Tostin, they have to dry
their clothes somewhere...

867
01:00:33,101 --> 01:00:35,590
... and yours is the most logical place.
Deal with it as best you can.

868
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:37,973
Yes, Captain.
- Carry on.

869
01:00:52,022 --> 01:00:54,807
Sailor.
- Yes, ma'am.

870
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:58,812
Tell me when these are dry.

871
01:00:59,065 --> 01:01:01,470
I'm a machinist mate, I ain't a...

872
01:01:02,024 --> 01:01:03,767
... laundry sailor.

873
01:01:04,108 --> 01:01:06,644
Sailor.
- Yes, ma'am.

874
01:01:06,817 --> 01:01:08,642
Please try not to knock
anything down...

875
01:01:08,817 --> 01:01:11,305
... I wouldn't want it to land
on this dirty floor.

876
01:01:11,776 --> 01:01:15,142
What's dirty?
- The whole engine room.

877
01:01:19,528 --> 01:01:20,902
Look at that grease.

878
01:01:21,153 --> 01:01:24,354
If you was bombed and sunk
and pulled up by your stern...

879
01:01:24,529 --> 01:01:26,400
you'd be a little greasy too.

880
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:42,897
Sailor.

881
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:45,195
Lady!
- You'll never get it to work that way.

882
01:01:45,366 --> 01:01:48,197
Why don't you go and
roll some bandages?

883
01:01:48,365 --> 01:01:51,199
What do you know about machinery?
- I was raised with it.

884
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:54,693
My father was Chief Engineer at
the Seattle power plant.

885
01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:00,237
That would work if you'd
install a new valve spring.

886
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,235
My father was a Chief Engineer... .

887
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:06,274
I'm trying to make do with something
that doesn't belong on a submarine...

888
01:02:06,452 --> 01:02:10,614
... and you can't install a new
valve spring if you ain't got it.

889
01:02:10,954 --> 01:02:12,744
Now, will you get out of here?

890
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,117
You're talking to an officer.

891
01:02:15,288 --> 01:02:18,702
Maybe Congress made you an
officer, but God made you a woman...

892
01:02:18,873 --> 01:02:21,741
... and a woman shouldn't mess around
with a man's machinery.

893
01:02:21,915 --> 01:02:24,072
For the last time,
get out, will you?

894
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,531
Good morning, sir. Can I
pour you a cup of coffee?

895
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:33,664
Never mind, I'll attend to it. Go and shower.
- Yes, sir.

896
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,323
Have the women finished breakfast?
- Yes, sir.

897
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:05,709
Pardon me.

898
01:03:09,424 --> 01:03:12,957
I left my cigarette here.
Have you seen it?

899
01:03:15,802 --> 01:03:16,963
Perhaps?

900
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:21,718
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

901
01:03:21,886 --> 01:03:24,753
Oh, that's alright, Lieutenant.
I enjoy a cigarette with my coffee.

902
01:03:31,095 --> 01:03:32,755
Oh, thanks.

903
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:39,422
Is that all you're having
for breakfast?

904
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:42,301
I'm a little nervous.
I don't feel much like eating.

905
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:46,797
Captain, I hope you do not mind a
little professional advice but...

906
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:49,553
when a person
is nervous and irritable...

907
01:03:50,058 --> 01:03:52,345
you can be assured that something
is missing in their life.

908
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:55,178
Vitamins and minerals.
- Vitamins and minerals.

909
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:58,883
With an appropriate nutritional balance,
you wouldn't have any gray hair.

910
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,473
I like having gray hair, so I can
worry without it showing.

911
01:04:02,686 --> 01:04:05,387
I used to be just like you.
- What, gray hair?

912
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,141
No. I was run down and poor appetite.
- Yes?

913
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:12,061
Then I started taking these
pills that I have here...

914
01:04:12,229 --> 01:04:14,765
... and they really built me up.
- No question about it.

915
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,142
All you have to do is take
one every three hours.

916
01:04:17,313 --> 01:04:20,430
You are very kind,
I appreciate the offer...

917
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,688
... but I'm busy man and would forget.
- I'll remind you.

918
01:04:23,857 --> 01:04:26,475
You're the Captain and it would
be bad if you got sick too.

919
01:04:26,649 --> 01:04:27,679
Sick too!

920
01:04:27,857 --> 01:04:29,314
Who's sick?

921
01:04:29,525 --> 01:04:32,937
Most of the men. Lieutenants Colfax
and Reid are taking care of them.

922
01:04:34,692 --> 01:04:37,015
Lt. Crandall, excuse me.

923
01:04:40,652 --> 01:04:42,974
You look pretty good to me.
- I don't feel so good.

924
01:04:43,151 --> 01:04:45,984
Stomach, and I feel dizzy.
- Hold still.

925
01:04:46,444 --> 01:04:48,732
Lie down over there.

926
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:50,397
Keep that under your tongue.

927
01:04:51,069 --> 01:04:53,560
All right.
- Just go over there.

928
01:04:55,196 --> 01:04:56,737
Right. Now, what's the matter with you?

929
01:04:56,905 --> 01:04:59,442
Williams.
- I've got a headache and my back hurts...

930
01:04:59,656 --> 01:05:00,982
What's wrong?

931
01:05:01,322 --> 01:05:04,404
I don't know, sir. I feel terrible.

932
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:05,852
You smell good.

933
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,271
What about you, Harmon?

934
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:11,064
I have shooting pains
in my head, sir.

935
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:14,275
Probably fumes from that hair tonic.
- Yes, sir.

936
01:05:16,284 --> 01:05:18,951
And you, Fox. What
have you got on?

937
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:21,573
It's called " Surrender ", sir.

938
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,318
My mother sent it to me.

939
01:05:24,535 --> 01:05:28,697
Break it up. Neutralize that cologne
with a some perspiration.

940
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:39,783
Even our pharmacist's mate.

941
01:05:39,955 --> 01:05:41,662
What's the matter, Dooley?

942
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:43,322
He seems to have...
- Just a minute.

943
01:05:43,497 --> 01:05:44,778
I don't know, sir.

944
01:05:45,205 --> 01:05:47,411
I only hope I can
last the day out.

945
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,122
Up, Dooley!

946
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,740
Thank you, ladies. We won't be needing
you any more. The epidemic is over.

947
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,076
Lieutenant Crandall.
- You forgot your vitamins.

948
01:06:05,105 --> 01:06:05,887
Thank you very much.

949
01:06:06,064 --> 01:06:08,055
I'll remind you when
it's time for the next one.

950
01:06:08,357 --> 01:06:09,187
Yes.

951
01:06:12,857 --> 01:06:13,852
Sir.

952
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:24,476
Lieutenant Crandall, I...

953
01:06:28,403 --> 01:06:29,944
Mr. Watson.
- Yes, sir?

954
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:33,358
Pass the word to the crew. When
Lt. Crandall - you know Lt. Crandall?

955
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:37,738
When Lt. Crandall walks through any
part of the boat, give clear passage.

956
01:06:37,905 --> 01:06:40,903
Right, sir.
- How's Mr. Holden coming with the torpedoes?

957
01:06:41,072 --> 01:06:44,568
I decided he would make better headway
if he read the basic submarine manual first.

958
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,778
It's in his cabin reading.
- Good.

959
01:06:47,616 --> 01:06:49,737
Am I going down right?
- That's right.

960
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:51,945
Is she going down right?
- She sure is.

961
01:06:52,491 --> 01:06:54,197
Good morning.
- Good morning.

962
01:06:54,366 --> 01:06:57,898
Mr. Holden is explaining
how everything works.

963
01:06:59,451 --> 01:07:02,781
He's been explaining?
- We're just on our way to the engine room.

964
01:07:03,158 --> 01:07:06,111
I 'm afraid Mr. Holden won't be
able to maneuver this morning.

965
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:09,899
Don't you have a book to read?
- Yes, I'm on Chapter Five:. .

966
01:07:10,077 --> 01:07:12,282
... "Care and Operation of the Bilge Pump"
- All right.

967
01:07:12,453 --> 01:07:13,862
I can't wait to see how it turns out.

968
01:07:14,036 --> 01:07:17,070
You'll like it. It turns out happily;
they get each other in the end.

969
01:07:17,247 --> 01:07:18,704
Engine Room to Captain.

970
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:19,985
What is it, Tostin?

971
01:07:20,164 --> 01:07:22,829
Either her or me in this engine room!

972
01:07:22,996 --> 01:07:24,371
I'll be right there.

973
01:07:27,206 --> 01:07:30,205
It works. You're just to
stubborn to admit it.

974
01:07:30,374 --> 01:07:32,779
Get that thing out
of my engine room!

975
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:40,290
Look, Major - enough is enough...
- What's going on?

976
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:41,954
Look at what she did, sir.

977
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:44,449
It's only temporary until
we make a valve spring.

978
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:48,159
We?? What do you mean we??
- I will design it and you can make it up.

979
01:07:48,377 --> 01:07:50,119
Excuse me.
- Sure.

980
01:07:50,294 --> 01:07:52,036
What are you going to do, sir?

981
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:53,959
I don't know. It works, doesn't it?

982
01:07:54,128 --> 01:07:56,997
But I'm here all day and that
thing going up and down...

983
01:07:57,171 --> 01:07:58,747
... that's indecent.
- Well.

984
01:08:00,296 --> 01:08:03,211
Engine room. Is the Captain there?
- What is it, Molumphry?

985
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,332
Better come up to the yeoman's office, sir.
- What's wrong?

986
01:08:06,507 --> 01:08:09,173
Lieutenant Reid
just hit Hunkle.

987
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:12,373
Hit Hunkle? I'll be right there.
Hit Hunkle.

988
01:08:13,048 --> 01:08:16,332
What are you to do about her?
- Keep an eye on it, Tostin.

989
01:08:17,216 --> 01:08:19,123
I'm sure it wasn't intentional, ma'am.

990
01:08:19,301 --> 01:08:22,667
I know, but I've never
seen anything like that in a man.

991
01:08:25,175 --> 01:08:26,421
Mr. Hunkle?

992
01:08:29,134 --> 01:08:30,380
I'm sorry.

993
01:08:30,969 --> 01:08:32,379
That's all right, Lieutenant.

994
01:08:32,553 --> 01:08:34,545
Sir.
- What happened?

995
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,794
It was nothing, really.
- Then why did you hit him?

996
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:39,258
It was my fault, sir ;
I was changing my shirt...

997
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:43,091
I went to borrow the typewriter.
- I had my shirt off and she hit me.

998
01:08:43,263 --> 01:08:47,423
It was a reflex action.
I was embarrassed and I...

999
01:08:48,223 --> 01:08:49,679
If you'll excuse me.

1000
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,923
Hunkle, keep that pinup covered,
I've got enough troubles.

1001
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:57,505
Yes, sir.
- Captain, torpedo room calling the Captain.

1002
01:08:57,682 --> 01:09:00,006
What is it, Harmon?
- What do I do with Lt. Colfax?

1003
01:09:00,183 --> 01:09:01,344
What's wrong?

1004
01:09:01,516 --> 01:09:05,132
She's dizzy, sir. I think she's getting seasick.
She insists she's got the bends.

1005
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:06,683
I'll be right there.

1006
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:19,558
Excuse me, please.
- Yes

1007
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:31,053
It's amazing how compact
everything is.

1008
01:09:32,524 --> 01:09:35,854
On a sub you have to
operate in close quarters.

1009
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:40,060
I think we better be going.
- Going where?

1010
01:09:40,983 --> 01:09:43,307
Well, Nick, haven't you
got some reading to do?

1011
01:09:44,733 --> 01:09:46,310
How old are you, Barbara?

1012
01:09:46,484 --> 01:09:47,763
Twenty-four.

1013
01:09:47,943 --> 01:09:52,187
A very nervous twenty-four.
Look at yourself. You're tense.

1014
01:09:52,652 --> 01:09:55,356
Your pulse is beating fast
and your hands are cold.

1015
01:09:55,903 --> 01:09:57,942
We've got to do something
about all this tension.

1016
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,142
I'm afraid that the cure might
be worse than the disease.

1017
01:10:01,778 --> 01:10:04,862
Barbara, you're a nurse,
you know it is with people.

1018
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:08,233
They're like that teapot;...

1019
01:10:09,156 --> 01:10:12,024
... build a fire under it,
pressure builds...

1020
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,697
... and has to be relieved.

1021
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:30,774
Mr. Holden, return to your quarters.
- Yes, sir.

1022
01:10:33,953 --> 01:10:36,109
Captain, it wasn't his fault...

1023
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:37,987
... I encouraged him.

1024
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:39,401
Lieutenant...

1025
01:10:39,578 --> 01:10:42,908
... the last thing the men on this
boat need is encouragement.

1026
01:10:44,871 --> 01:10:48,202
Major, if you can't control your
women, lock them up.

1027
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:53,993
What happened?

1028
01:10:54,915 --> 01:10:55,910
He caught us.

1029
01:10:57,082 --> 01:10:58,161
Doing what?

1030
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:00,453
Nick kissed me.

1031
01:11:01,874 --> 01:11:03,249
Oh?
- And I kissed him back.

1032
01:11:06,293 --> 01:11:08,368
Don't you think
you're rushing things?

1033
01:11:09,085 --> 01:11:11,656
Love underwater is
fine for a fish, but...

1034
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,458
... shouldn't you wait
until you come up for air?

1035
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:20,413
Major, my mother had a very
simple outlook on life.

1036
01:11:21,254 --> 01:11:24,003
She always said : "never
worry about getting married...

1037
01:11:24,171 --> 01:11:26,873
someday you'll turn the right corner
and meet the right man. "

1038
01:11:27,671 --> 01:11:28,951
It isn't that easy.

1039
01:11:29,797 --> 01:11:32,085
I've been turning corners
for twenty-four years.

1040
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,792
You know, I think I
finally turned the right one?

1041
01:11:36,382 --> 01:11:39,748
Why go back out in that crowd
and get lost again?

1042
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:44,169
Baby, if you're right, I'm
in more trouble than I figured.

1043
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:46,214
You're 24 and I'm 38.

1044
01:11:46,842 --> 01:11:49,380
You know, I might not be
able to make it to the next corner?

1045
01:11:50,093 --> 01:11:50,958
Mister...

1046
01:11:51,135 --> 01:11:55,046
You've used that uniform for everything but
what the government intended.

1047
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:57,377
Why you got the uniform
is your concern...

1048
01:11:57,552 --> 01:11:59,839
... but what it does on this boat
is my business.

1049
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:03,792
From here on, if that uniform leaves
this cabin, don't be in it.

1050
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:05,299
You're confined to quarters.

1051
01:12:07,305 --> 01:12:09,591
Battle stations!
- Goodbye!

1052
01:12:22,807 --> 01:12:25,049
Boy oh boy.

1053
01:12:28,226 --> 01:12:30,016
A sitting duck, sir.

1054
01:12:33,518 --> 01:12:34,798
A tanker.

1055
01:12:35,394 --> 01:12:36,424
A beaut.

1056
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:38,345
Eight thousand tons at least.

1057
01:12:38,519 --> 01:12:41,470
She's riding low, sir.
That means she's still loaded.

1058
01:12:41,854 --> 01:12:43,928
Number three tube
is operable, sir.

1059
01:12:44,271 --> 01:12:46,061
All we need is one shot.

1060
01:12:46,688 --> 01:12:49,722
This boat wasn't meant
to be a virgin, sir.

1061
01:12:54,815 --> 01:12:57,220
Eight thousand tons.

1062
01:13:00,357 --> 01:13:03,059
Let's go duck hunting.
Down scope.

1063
01:13:04,274 --> 01:13:08,055
Load torpedo tube three.
- Load torpedo tube three.

1064
01:13:18,985 --> 01:13:21,984
Bearing. Mark.
- Zero-two-six.

1065
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:29,482
Range. Mark.
- Two-three-double-oh.

1066
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,483
Down scope.

1067
01:13:32,322 --> 01:13:34,361
Fire at 1500 yards.

1068
01:13:34,863 --> 01:13:37,104
Tube number three ready, sir.
Outer door closed.

1069
01:13:37,281 --> 01:13:39,273
Generated range: two-one-double-oh.

1070
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:42,815
Open outer door tube three.
- Open outer door tube three.

1071
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:44,732
Open outer door tube three.

1072
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:53,567
Tube number three ready, sir.
- One-nine-double-oh.

1073
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:55,237
Final range.

1074
01:14:06,162 --> 01:14:08,651
Mark.
- One-eight-double-oh.

1075
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:16,198
Stand by tube three.
- Stand by tube three.

1076
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:23,822
Captain, it's time for your vitamin.
- Lieutenant, get below.

1077
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:25,457
Damn it, get below!

1078
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:35,245
Have I done anything wrong?

1079
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,670
What happened, sir?

1080
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:54,914
We sunk a truck!

1081
01:15:04,883 --> 01:15:06,505
Let's get the hell
out of here!

1082
01:15:11,092 --> 01:15:12,123
Right full rudder.

1083
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,790
All ahead two thirds.
-Take her down to 100 feet.

1084
01:15:22,177 --> 01:15:25,011
23 December, 1941.

1085
01:15:25,179 --> 01:15:28,094
Sighted tanker, sank truck.

1086
01:15:28,471 --> 01:15:32,252
For the first time in my life, I
came close to hitting a woman.

1087
01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:34,551
Perhaps I'm giving
way to hysteria...

1088
01:15:34,722 --> 01:15:38,551
... but can Lt. Crandall possibly
be a Japanese agent?

1089
01:15:39,224 --> 01:15:42,754
Tomorrow we'll be in Cebu and
they'll be the Army's problem.

1090
01:15:42,931 --> 01:15:45,800
I'm sorry, Commander.
They are your problem.

1091
01:15:46,016 --> 01:15:48,931
I can not take
responsibility for those women...

1092
01:15:49,101 --> 01:15:50,925
... not without the proper orders.

1093
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:54,099
Couldn't we forget
regulations this once, Colonel?

1094
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:58,427
Commander, any time the Japanese are
ready, they can overrun this island.

1095
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:01,803
We've been ordered to coordinate
guerrilla action in the hills.

1096
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:03,850
We may be up there for years.

1097
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,758
Do you really want
us to take those women?

1098
01:16:14,521 --> 01:16:15,931
We'll keep them.

1099
01:16:17,396 --> 01:16:20,230
Sir, we will need to see your
Quartermaster to get these...

1100
01:16:20,397 --> 01:16:22,140
... supplies to make our repairs.

1101
01:16:22,397 --> 01:16:26,061
Supplies? Let me give you
a picture of the situation;...

1102
01:16:26,566 --> 01:16:29,767
this cigar... belonged to my
aide, Captain Hopkins.

1103
01:16:30,316 --> 01:16:32,521
I stole it while he was sleeping.

1104
01:16:32,692 --> 01:16:36,023
Everything worth saving
has been taken up into the hills.

1105
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:38,018
Can I can send some men
into the hills then?

1106
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:41,026
You couldn't get a paper clip with
a requisition from the President.

1107
01:16:41,193 --> 01:16:45,106
Without those supplies we won't get out of here.
- Sorry, I wish I could help.

1108
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:46,851
Alright.

1109
01:16:47,987 --> 01:16:49,231
Good luck, gentlemen!

1110
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:55,395
We've got to get those supplies!
- I know, I know.

1111
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:00,065
Sorry!

1112
01:17:06,408 --> 01:17:10,024
Oh boy!
- Give him a hand.

1113
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:15,481
Major, you and your friends
will remain aboard.

1114
01:17:20,243 --> 01:17:22,530
Sir! Sir!

1115
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:26,658
There is only one man who can
do the job, you know who.

1116
01:17:27,037 --> 01:17:29,157
Yes, yes. I know.

1117
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:37,443
Mr. Holden.

1118
01:17:37,622 --> 01:17:38,700
Yes, sir?

1119
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,907
I'm restoring you to duty.

1120
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:47,406
We're having difficulty, I have
to have those supplies.

1121
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,165
That's quite a list, sir.

1122
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:53,620
I won't bore you with the problems of command;
I doubt you'll ever have one.

1123
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:56,826
It's inconsistent with the philosophy
of "every man for himself".

1124
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:59,075
"Dog-eat-dog. "
- Exactly.

1125
01:17:59,251 --> 01:18:01,158
The most unfortunate thing
about command...

1126
01:18:01,335 --> 01:18:03,907
is that responsibilities
outweigh the privileges.

1127
01:18:04,086 --> 01:18:07,250
If it was just myself, I would tell
what to do with that list.

1128
01:18:07,628 --> 01:18:09,536
But my responsibility
is this boat.

1129
01:18:09,713 --> 01:18:12,331
To get it out of here
I'd make a pact with the devil.

1130
01:18:12,504 --> 01:18:14,246
That's where I come in.
- That's right.

1131
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:17,254
Unless you get these supplies, you'll never
get back to that girl with the railway stock.

1132
01:18:17,421 --> 01:18:19,959
That's a pretty good argument.
- I thought it would convince you.

1133
01:18:20,131 --> 01:18:21,375
Okay.

1134
01:18:31,925 --> 01:18:36,463
Auxiliary induction gear;
generator coils; red lead... Ramon!

1135
01:19:07,516 --> 01:19:08,630
Hunkle!

1136
01:19:11,182 --> 01:19:12,261
Do you need this?

1137
01:19:12,474 --> 01:19:14,265
A priming pump?
- Is that what it is?

1138
01:19:14,434 --> 01:19:18,130
Worth a hundred fifty dollars.
- For this?

1139
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:22,016
Here's two hundred dollars.
- Oh, thank you.

1140
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:42,309
What do you want for this?

1141
01:19:42,481 --> 01:19:44,389
Twenty.
- Take twenty-five. Hunkle!

1142
01:19:44,565 --> 01:19:46,188
You'll have to get in line
like the rest of the guys.

1143
01:19:46,356 --> 01:19:48,596
But I have gray paint
in the truck outside.

1144
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:51,396
Twenty-four five-gallon cans.

1145
01:19:51,565 --> 01:19:54,730
What about the red lead?
- Two cans. That's all there is on the island.

1146
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,104
We need at least twenty.

1147
01:19:57,316 --> 01:20:00,684
I can get them white lead.
- We'll take it. How much?

1148
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:03,397
Not a nickel less
than three hundred.

1149
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:07,144
Three hundred?
He drives a hard bargain!

1150
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:10,851
Here's three hundred, and fifty
dollars on the house. Kraus!

1151
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:13,109
Unload the paint and
steal the truck.

1152
01:20:13,361 --> 01:20:15,233
Excuse me, sir.
- Wait a minute.

1153
01:20:15,404 --> 01:20:18,936
We don't have any money, how
will we pay if someone wins?

1154
01:20:19,112 --> 01:20:21,484
With those tables
and those dealers?

1155
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:27,943
Master inverted reducing valve.

1156
01:20:29,155 --> 01:20:30,530
Two hundred and fifty dollars.

1157
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,270
Next!

1158
01:20:32,615 --> 01:20:33,730
What you have you got, son?

1159
01:20:38,117 --> 01:20:39,231
Carry on.

1160
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:43,153
31 December, 1941.

1161
01:20:43,326 --> 01:20:47,321
Holden has reached new heights
in the art of scavenging.

1162
01:20:47,493 --> 01:20:49,781
Like a spider in a web,
he sits there...

1163
01:20:49,953 --> 01:20:52,905
... and their victims come to him
like flies bearing gifts.

1164
01:20:53,078 --> 01:20:54,736
He is the only man I know...

1165
01:20:54,913 --> 01:20:58,574
who will probably be presented
the Navy Cross at his court martial.

1166
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:17,207
Chief, this is a terrible color.
- It makes me kind of sick.

1167
01:21:24,586 --> 01:21:26,126
More canned fish.

1168
01:21:26,294 --> 01:21:29,244
Yes. What a way to celebrate
New Year's Eve.

1169
01:21:30,294 --> 01:21:31,206
Sir...

1170
01:21:31,378 --> 01:21:34,495
We're mixing those paints...
but I don't think you're going to like it.

1171
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:36,247
We don't have much choice.

1172
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:39,253
We haven't enough of either
one to do the whole job.

1173
01:21:39,421 --> 01:21:41,626
It's a pretty strange color
to paint government property.

1174
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:43,076
Don't let it throw you, Mo.

1175
01:21:43,256 --> 01:21:45,710
We're going to color gray anyway.
- Yes, sir.

1176
01:21:48,506 --> 01:21:50,627
Mr. Holden wasn't
at the casino.

1177
01:21:50,964 --> 01:21:52,162
Mr. Stovall...

1178
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,500
hereafter you will refer to
the casino as the supply depot.

1179
01:21:56,967 --> 01:21:58,080
Where did he go?

1180
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:01,625
He and Hunkle took off in the truck,
They're not expected back until late.

1181
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:05,004
Boy, that casino is really...

1182
01:22:05,176 --> 01:22:06,634
I mean...

1183
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:11,210
... seems to be a lot of activity
at the supply depot, sir.

1184
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:28,918
Hunkle, did you see
what I saw?

1185
01:22:29,098 --> 01:22:30,424
I don't know, sir.
What?

1186
01:22:30,848 --> 01:22:32,045
Come on.

1187
01:23:06,063 --> 01:23:09,015
That's New Year's dinner.
- That?

1188
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:11,974
We're going to shop around.
Come on.

1189
01:23:25,693 --> 01:23:26,889
What do we do?

1190
01:23:30,736 --> 01:23:32,644
No, that's not quite right.

1191
01:23:33,777 --> 01:23:34,808
The white one!

1192
01:23:35,903 --> 01:23:38,107
That's what I call
a pig.

1193
01:23:38,278 --> 01:23:41,894
I'll go around the back. Go
in the front and distract him.

1194
01:23:42,489 --> 01:23:43,733
And how do I do that?

1195
01:23:43,946 --> 01:23:47,229
Talk pig talk.
- How do you talk pig talk?

1196
01:23:47,406 --> 01:23:49,397
Didn't you talk pig
when you were a kid?

1197
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:53,688
No, too high.
Low, deep in your throat.

1198
01:23:55,282 --> 01:23:57,523
That's too deep.

1199
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,525
Right in the middle.

1200
01:24:00,242 --> 01:24:01,404
Now with affection.

1201
01:24:05,242 --> 01:24:07,031
Okay, call the pig.

1202
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:12,903
Look, there he is.

1203
01:24:18,037 --> 01:24:19,944
Get behind him.
Behind him!

1204
01:24:31,456 --> 01:24:33,328
Hurry!

1205
01:24:33,498 --> 01:24:36,166
Open the cab!

1206
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:39,789
Open the door, come on!

1207
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:47,697
Come on!
- Looks like a wheelbarrow.

1208
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,452
Come on, Hunkle, grab him!

1209
01:24:58,711 --> 01:24:59,742
Lift him up!

1210
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:04,409
Grab him!

1211
01:25:04,962 --> 01:25:06,834
Get in! Get in!

1212
01:25:09,464 --> 01:25:11,916
Grab him!
- Okay.

1213
01:25:43,678 --> 01:25:45,088
What are they stopping for?

1214
01:25:45,262 --> 01:25:47,420
It's a roadblock.
What are we going to do?

1215
01:25:47,805 --> 01:25:48,835
I don't know.

1216
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,171
Let's take a look. Cover us, Bayle.

1217
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:56,840
They're shooting looters, you know?
- I know. Let's not panic.

1218
01:25:57,015 --> 01:25:58,343
What about the pig?

1219
01:26:01,016 --> 01:26:03,090
What pig?
- What pig? This pig!

1220
01:26:03,266 --> 01:26:05,257
I don't see any pig.
- You don't see any pig?

1221
01:26:05,433 --> 01:26:06,381
Take off your coat.

1222
01:26:06,559 --> 01:26:08,763
Take off my coat?
- Take off your coat.

1223
01:26:08,934 --> 01:26:10,213
Are you out of... .

1224
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:13,845
Put it on the pig.

1225
01:26:14,018 --> 01:26:16,223
Put it on the pig??
- Put it on the pig!

1226
01:26:16,727 --> 01:26:19,216
Do you have a cap? Do you have a cap?
- Yes, sir.

1227
01:26:19,395 --> 01:26:20,853
Take it off!

1228
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,556
Give me the cap! Give it to me!

1229
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,396
Hold him!

1230
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:34,271
Stay here, Bill, and
keep me covered.

1231
01:26:46,899 --> 01:26:49,436
Good evening, Corporal.
- What are you doing out here?

1232
01:26:49,775 --> 01:26:53,024
I'm Lieutenant Holden, off the
"Sea Tiger". We're tied up for repairs.

1233
01:26:53,194 --> 01:26:56,394
We were out trying to locate
some spare diesel parts.

1234
01:26:57,569 --> 01:26:58,564
What is that?

1235
01:26:58,736 --> 01:27:01,734
That's Seaman Hornsby. How
are you feeling, Seaman Hornsby?

1236
01:27:03,361 --> 01:27:06,111
He's not too well.
- What's the matter with him?

1237
01:27:06,279 --> 01:27:08,602
Well, he drinks...

1238
01:27:09,529 --> 01:27:12,279
... "Gilly juice" you know?
The alcohol from the torpedoes.

1239
01:27:12,739 --> 01:27:16,070
Easy, sailor. I think we're going
to have to get him back to the boat.

1240
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,611
If anything happens to him
we're in an awful lot of trouble.

1241
01:27:18,782 --> 01:27:21,151
You see, he's the only
radio operator we have.

1242
01:27:22,074 --> 01:27:24,278
Easy, Hornsby.
- He doesn't look too good.

1243
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:26,441
No.
- You'd better let us take him to the hospital.

1244
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,734
No, no. That's not necessary.
We have a doctor on board.

1245
01:27:30,909 --> 01:27:33,694
Well, you'd better get this man to your doctor.
- All right. Thank you.

1246
01:27:34,243 --> 01:27:36,449
Happy New Year, Corporal.
- Let them pass.

1247
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:49,323
Who were they?
- Three sailors off a submarine.

1248
01:27:49,537 --> 01:27:52,407
Guy named Hornsby was sick,
you should have seen him.

1249
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:55,331
Now I know why they call
submarines "pig boats".

1250
01:27:55,497 --> 01:27:57,572
Man, he was the ugliest.

1251
01:28:00,957 --> 01:28:02,036
Oh, Captain...

1252
01:28:02,332 --> 01:28:05,201
a couple of Army MPs out here
want to see you.

1253
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,000
MPs?
- MPs.

1254
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:15,705
Okay, okay.

1255
01:28:17,294 --> 01:28:19,664
Sir, this man claims that your men
stole a pig from his farm.

1256
01:28:24,753 --> 01:28:27,502
The biggest one he had,
and drove off in a truck;...

1257
01:28:27,671 --> 01:28:30,160
The only truck that passed us tonight
was headed for this boat.

1258
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:33,455
That's ridiculous, Corporal. None
of my men would...

1259
01:28:34,172 --> 01:28:37,041
Is Lieutenant Holden back?
- I do not know, sir.

1260
01:28:38,715 --> 01:28:40,172
Who?
Corporal.

1261
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,916
Good evening, sir.
- Watson.

1262
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:45,586
Lt. Holden was one of the men on
the truck. He had two other men with him...

1263
01:28:45,757 --> 01:28:47,499
A Hunkle and Seaman Hornsby.

1264
01:28:48,008 --> 01:28:49,252
Seaman Hornsby?

1265
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,045
Yes, sir, he was drunk. They
were bringing him back to the boat.

1266
01:28:54,219 --> 01:28:56,588
Where is Seaman Hornsby?

1267
01:28:56,802 --> 01:29:00,250
He's not feeling too well, sir.
- I didn't ask you that. Where is he?

1268
01:29:00,427 --> 01:29:02,998
He's been drinking.
- Where is he?

1269
01:29:03,594 --> 01:29:05,053
In the officer's head.

1270
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:07,463
Just a minute.

1271
01:29:23,723 --> 01:29:27,340
Well, the man is right.
Undoubtedly his pig was stolen.

1272
01:29:27,684 --> 01:29:29,674
You might as well admit it,
Mr. Holden ;...

1273
01:29:29,934 --> 01:29:32,932
When Hornsby runs wild
there's no telling what he might do.

1274
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:35,139
He behaves like a perfect swine.

1275
01:29:35,559 --> 01:29:39,055
Look, Corporal, he's in no condition
to be reprimanded tonight...

1276
01:29:39,268 --> 01:29:42,635
but I can assure you that tomorrow
he's in for a good roasting!

1277
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:45,300
I'm sorry, sir, I'm afraid
we'll have to take him in.

1278
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,847
Now wait a minute, Corporal.

1279
01:29:48,104 --> 01:29:50,260
Sometimes there is a
reason for drinking...

1280
01:29:51,479 --> 01:29:55,261
... You see, Hornsby's been picked
for a dangerous assignment...

1281
01:29:55,439 --> 01:29:58,142
... and there is not much chance
that he will come through it alive.

1282
01:29:58,481 --> 01:30:00,886
Gee, I...
- I knew you would understand.

1283
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:03,855
If this man want to
drop the charges...

1284
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:06,264
I'm sure something can be arranged.
How much is the pig worth?

1285
01:30:08,857 --> 01:30:11,394
He won't take American money
with the Japanese coming.

1286
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:16,605
One moment. Your pig's
not down there. Hey...

1287
01:30:17,527 --> 01:30:20,857
If you won't take American money
I don't see how we are going to...

1288
01:30:23,444 --> 01:30:24,986
You like that?

1289
01:30:26,153 --> 01:30:28,392
You would like to have that?

1290
01:30:28,946 --> 01:30:30,143
Okay.

1291
01:30:31,738 --> 01:30:34,227
I do not understand very well, we'll see.

1292
01:30:35,031 --> 01:30:37,982
I think he said he likes
the bag. You like the bag?

1293
01:30:38,281 --> 01:30:41,114
Good leather, but he does not know
what to do with those things.

1294
01:30:41,281 --> 01:30:45,146
Well, we can make a deal.
- But sir, that was a gift...

1295
01:30:45,323 --> 01:30:48,405
from the admiral's wife.
- Public Relations. Fair enough?

1296
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:55,857
He said that his pig
is worth more.

1297
01:30:56,035 --> 01:30:57,610
No. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1298
01:30:57,784 --> 01:30:59,822
You couldn't possibly...
- See if you like this.

1299
01:31:00,452 --> 01:31:02,407
But sir, you can't. I have...
- Do you like?

1300
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:08,610
Sir, I need that for
my tennis shoulder.

1301
01:31:08,787 --> 01:31:10,244
Your tennis shoulder?
- Yes

1302
01:31:10,412 --> 01:31:12,617
Well, we can take care of that.

1303
01:31:12,788 --> 01:31:15,703
Now you don't need it for your tennis
shoulder. Now, what about it?

1304
01:31:21,164 --> 01:31:22,989
Oh, yes.
- What did he say?

1305
01:31:23,165 --> 01:31:26,081
He said that his pig
weighed two hundred pounds.

1306
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,702
And it is not enough.
- I see. That's it, yes.

1307
01:31:28,874 --> 01:31:31,280
It's a shame.
- Just a minute. Get back.

1308
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:34,371
Let's see here.

1309
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,500
Yes, this.

1310
01:31:36,668 --> 01:31:39,334
Sir, that's solid silver.

1311
01:31:40,626 --> 01:31:44,207
Still not enough?
Let's look here...

1312
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:48,334
Oh, these!

1313
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:51,247
Non-regulation!

1314
01:31:55,297 --> 01:31:58,211
Saks Fifth Avenue.

1315
01:32:02,714 --> 01:32:03,544
Well?

1316
01:32:04,799 --> 01:32:06,789
Put it on your face.

1317
01:32:07,674 --> 01:32:08,586
Shoes!

1318
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:12,172
Shoes. Yes.
- Not my Supadance. Sir, please.

1319
01:32:12,341 --> 01:32:14,084
These are your dancing shoes, aren't they?
- Yes.

1320
01:32:14,258 --> 01:32:15,883
Do you like to dance?

1321
01:32:16,093 --> 01:32:17,252
Dance?

1322
01:32:20,884 --> 01:32:23,966
He likes to dance, perfect.
Is that enough?

1323
01:32:24,802 --> 01:32:26,461
Goodbye. Here, just a moment.

1324
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:30,303
Here's gift for you. That's to go with
the shoes; a little bonus.

1325
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:34,712
Well.

1326
01:32:35,804 --> 01:32:39,549
Very thoughtful of you to offer dinner
for the men. I'm sure they'll appreciate it.

1327
01:32:39,764 --> 01:32:43,509
I suggest you get Hornsby out
of uniform and help him to the galley.

1328
01:32:49,849 --> 01:32:51,047
So am I.

1329
01:33:10,228 --> 01:33:13,227
Yes, they're drafting
everybody these days.

1330
01:33:35,774 --> 01:33:36,688
Pink!

1331
01:33:37,483 --> 01:33:39,475
Twenty-five years I've
been in the Navy...

1332
01:33:40,234 --> 01:33:42,439
... and I've never seen nothing like this.

1333
01:33:43,819 --> 01:33:45,525
A pink submarine.

1334
01:33:49,195 --> 01:33:52,892
All right, you guys, you have three
hours to have a Happy New Year.

1335
01:33:53,071 --> 01:33:56,650
But at 17:00 every man on this crew
starts painting her gray!

1336
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:21,147
This pork is great.
Aren't you going to have any, sir?

1337
01:34:21,325 --> 01:34:24,574
No, Hornsby and I have been
through too much together.

1338
01:34:26,493 --> 01:34:28,900
Captain, can I talk to you?
- Yes, Major.

1339
01:34:29,286 --> 01:34:31,574
It's about Dolores. I can't
get her to come up here.

1340
01:34:31,746 --> 01:34:33,403
She says that you'd
rather she didn't.

1341
01:34:34,662 --> 01:34:38,193
She's tried to apologize, but
you won't even talk to her.

1342
01:34:38,454 --> 01:34:41,489
She thinks that you've been avoiding her.
- Only in self-defence.

1343
01:34:41,997 --> 01:34:43,573
She's scared to death of you.

1344
01:34:45,206 --> 01:34:47,031
It's New Year's, Captain.

1345
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,780
The poor girl is down
there all by herself.

1346
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:53,029
It would be nice if you would
go down and invite her up.

1347
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:55,957
All right, Major, I'll extend
a personal invitation.

1348
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:02,116
Isn't this a lovely shade of pink.

1349
01:35:04,419 --> 01:35:06,954
Please ma'am, I'm trying to eat.

1350
01:35:08,003 --> 01:35:10,040
Throw me a pickle.
- The first time I met her...

1351
01:35:10,211 --> 01:35:12,166
Mr. Tostin, was...
- Chief.

1352
01:35:12,336 --> 01:35:16,460
I was thinking that if you cross
connect the engine cooling system...

1353
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,251
and the mufflers you could
drown out those sparks.

1354
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:20,500
The engine cooling system
and the mufflers?

1355
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:22,493
Are you crazy?

1356
01:35:23,756 --> 01:35:25,248
Hey, you know
that might work.

1357
01:35:27,506 --> 01:35:29,213
Would you like some pork, Major?

1358
01:35:30,131 --> 01:35:30,832
Thank you.

1359
01:35:32,341 --> 01:35:33,715
Captain.
- What?

1360
01:35:34,716 --> 01:35:37,917
I've looked up and down this boat
and I can't find Mr. Holden.

1361
01:35:38,759 --> 01:35:41,959
Or Barbara, er, Lieutenant Duran.
- No kidding!

1362
01:35:42,677 --> 01:35:46,172
And number three life raft is missing.
- Fancy that!

1363
01:35:46,552 --> 01:35:50,249
Well, if they're gone and the number three...
- One moment, Watson, listen...

1364
01:35:50,512 --> 01:35:52,467
... Have you ever been to Las Vegas?

1365
01:35:52,636 --> 01:35:56,084
Because up there the boys would say that
you're trying to make your point the hard way.

1366
01:35:56,512 --> 01:35:59,464
When a girl is under twenty
one she is protected by law.

1367
01:35:59,721 --> 01:36:02,506
When she is over sixty five,
she is protected by nature.

1368
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:05,465
Any where in between -
she's fair game.

1369
01:36:05,723 --> 01:36:07,001
Put that away.

1370
01:36:27,853 --> 01:36:30,720
May I come in?
- Yes, of course.

1371
01:36:31,311 --> 01:36:32,804
Why aren't you at the party?

1372
01:36:33,019 --> 01:36:35,555
I really didn't think that
you wanted me there.

1373
01:36:35,978 --> 01:36:40,139
I would probably do something out
of line and you would be angry.

1374
01:36:40,897 --> 01:36:42,602
Captain, you may not believe this

1375
01:36:42,772 --> 01:36:44,893
... but all of those things that
happened were accidents.

1376
01:36:45,063 --> 01:36:46,521
I'm sure they were.

1377
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:52,011
Lieutenant, if I've been short-tempered,
I want to apologize...

1378
01:36:52,566 --> 01:36:56,476
... my only excuse is that things
haven't been going well and I'm edgy.

1379
01:36:56,691 --> 01:37:00,187
Why not finish your hair
while I wait?

1380
01:37:00,442 --> 01:37:02,267
Then we can go up together
and celebrate.

1381
01:37:02,526 --> 01:37:04,267
Is that all right?
- Yes.

1382
01:37:04,443 --> 01:37:08,223
Let's forget everything that happened and
start the New Year off right.

1383
01:37:09,027 --> 01:37:10,140
You can - Ahhhh!

1384
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:18,100
You'll be a wonderful father.
- Father?

1385
01:37:18,279 --> 01:37:19,772
When you get married.
- Sure.

1386
01:37:19,945 --> 01:37:22,150
Genetically you have
very dominant characteristics...

1387
01:37:22,321 --> 01:37:23,234
Really?

1388
01:37:23,405 --> 01:37:26,487
Dark hair, blue eyes.
- What is this?

1389
01:37:26,739 --> 01:37:29,524
Three of four children
will look after you.

1390
01:37:30,115 --> 01:37:33,029
I know it won't be easy.
- What won't be easy?

1391
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:34,988
Until we get settled.
- But...

1392
01:37:35,157 --> 01:37:36,698
But I'll help.
- Help?

1393
01:37:36,865 --> 01:37:39,615
With the expenses.
I'll get a job.

1394
01:37:39,782 --> 01:37:41,857
Expenses?
- Yes.

1395
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,280
Barbara, I'm engaged
to be married.

1396
01:37:49,577 --> 01:37:51,863
Now, Barbara, don't be hasty.
Let me explain.

1397
01:37:52,035 --> 01:37:53,660
It's a very simple thing to explain;...

1398
01:37:53,828 --> 01:37:56,316
I've known that girl for quite a while...
- Get away!

1399
01:37:56,494 --> 01:37:58,485
I thought to tell you now...
-Get away from me!

1400
01:37:58,662 --> 01:38:00,404
You're not listening.

1401
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,824
I'm going!
- Do not go!

1402
01:38:01,996 --> 01:38:04,568
I'm going to the boat!
-I can explain everything!

1403
01:38:04,748 --> 01:38:06,903
I'm going back to the boat!
- Please listen, apart from... .

1404
01:38:07,413 --> 01:38:10,364
Barbara, wait! There are
women-eating sharks!

1405
01:38:11,706 --> 01:38:12,654
Barbara!

1406
01:38:13,582 --> 01:38:14,825
Barbara, wait a minute!

1407
01:38:19,792 --> 01:38:23,738
I don't think it's serious, sir, but,
shouldn't one of the nurses look at it?

1408
01:38:23,916 --> 01:38:26,489
Just bandage it, Dooley.
- Yes, sir.

1409
01:38:39,961 --> 01:38:42,083
Happy new year!

1410
01:39:43,974 --> 01:39:45,005
Barbara!

1411
01:39:47,685 --> 01:39:49,224
Barbara! Will you... ?

1412
01:39:50,059 --> 01:39:52,430
Barbara, will you get back in the
raft? Will you get in the raft?

1413
01:39:52,602 --> 01:39:54,059
Stop following me!

1414
01:39:56,186 --> 01:39:57,217
Barbara!

1415
01:40:00,228 --> 01:40:02,682
I wish you'd
try to understand.

1416
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:06,352
What if I did say I loved you?
What if we got married?

1417
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:10,434
I'm poor. You're poor.
All we'd get is poor children.

1418
01:40:10,605 --> 01:40:15,014
I don't think I should go to the party.
- Oh yes, you should. I demand you do.

1419
01:40:15,189 --> 01:40:16,469
You don't have to go
just for me.

1420
01:40:16,648 --> 01:40:20,310
I can't think of anyone else I'd do it for;
it's become sort of a need.

1421
01:40:20,482 --> 01:40:21,513
That's very kind of you.
- Yes, isn't it?

1422
01:40:21,691 --> 01:40:25,058
I mean is that you're such a gentleman.
- Yes, that comes as a surprise to me, too.

1423
01:40:25,234 --> 01:40:26,347
Barbara!

1424
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:28,521
Barbara, will you...

1425
01:40:29,358 --> 01:40:30,816
Will you listen to me?

1426
01:40:31,527 --> 01:40:32,557
Barbara!

1427
01:40:34,235 --> 01:40:36,806
Barbara, it's tiring
rowing this way, will you wait?

1428
01:40:37,403 --> 01:40:38,517
Barbara!

1429
01:40:40,236 --> 01:40:43,769
You are a beautiful and intelligent girl,
you should marry a wealthy man.

1430
01:40:43,946 --> 01:40:47,277
I'm no good for you, you don't want to
marry me. I'm doing you a favor.

1431
01:40:47,447 --> 01:40:50,480
Don't do me any more favors, mister.
- Barbara, dear, would you...

1432
01:40:50,655 --> 01:40:52,064
Oh shut up!
- Barbara!

1433
01:40:56,365 --> 01:40:57,444
Barbara!

1434
01:41:00,575 --> 01:41:02,482
Air raid! Man your stations!

1435
01:41:04,283 --> 01:41:07,199
Air Raid!
-Clear the deck!

1436
01:41:10,367 --> 01:41:13,568
Clear the deck!
Get those women down!

1437
01:41:14,077 --> 01:41:15,949
Let's get underway!

1438
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:21,284
Ready in all respects
to get underway, sir.

1439
01:41:21,453 --> 01:41:22,532
Okay, I'll take charge.

1440
01:41:22,954 --> 01:41:24,695
Strike four.
- Strike four.

1441
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:26,408
Strike three.

1442
01:41:27,328 --> 01:41:28,324
Drop two.

1443
01:41:36,873 --> 01:41:38,910
Wait, what's going on here?

1444
01:41:39,207 --> 01:41:42,241
Mr. Holden promised the dealers, sir.
- Promised them what?

1445
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:45,948
You see, sir. If they helped us,
we'd take the women and children.

1446
01:41:47,124 --> 01:41:51,285
Most of the women are pregnant.
- Yes, sir. Any minute now, sir.

1447
01:41:51,792 --> 01:41:54,162
Isn't it lucky that we have
the nurses aboard?

1448
01:41:54,335 --> 01:41:57,002
I'm running a submarine,
not a maternity ward!

1449
01:41:57,169 --> 01:41:58,827
What's that thing doing
here, that goat?

1450
01:41:59,002 --> 01:42:01,076
It's for the children, sir.
Fresh milk.

1451
01:42:01,253 --> 01:42:04,335
I don't care,
get them off the boat!

1452
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:10,744
Aircraft, port quarter!
Closing!

1453
01:42:12,255 --> 01:42:14,163
One moment.
- Lieutenant promised...

1454
01:42:14,339 --> 01:42:16,744
Go on, get them off!

1455
01:42:21,757 --> 01:42:23,831
Here they come. Get down!

1456
01:42:31,218 --> 01:42:33,089
Ramon, take these women
forward.

1457
01:42:33,259 --> 01:42:34,254
Get these kids down.

1458
01:42:34,468 --> 01:42:35,214
Come here.

1459
01:42:35,551 --> 01:42:36,581
Give me the goat.

1460
01:42:36,761 --> 01:42:37,791
Come on, goat.

1461
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:40,833
Give me a hand.

1462
01:42:41,845 --> 01:42:42,875
Somebody get the kid.

1463
01:42:48,095 --> 01:42:50,501
Starboard back two thirds.
- Starboard back two thirds.

1464
01:43:10,558 --> 01:43:12,266
I know it, I'm dead.

1465
01:43:13,933 --> 01:43:15,013
Cherry.

1466
01:43:20,602 --> 01:43:21,633
Clear the bridge!
- Clear the bridge!

1467
01:43:21,811 --> 01:43:24,596
Number One.
- Number Two.

1468
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:26,558
Number Three.
- Number Four.

1469
01:43:26,727 --> 01:43:27,676
Number Five.

1470
01:44:01,403 --> 01:44:04,355
Isn't there some way to sneak back to
Cebu and pick up that gray paint?

1471
01:44:04,528 --> 01:44:05,558
No, there is not.

1472
01:44:06,445 --> 01:44:10,521
But a pink submarine. What if
somebody sees us? It's embarrassing.

1473
01:44:17,281 --> 01:44:20,279
Mr. Stovall, does she
have to be up here?

1474
01:44:20,531 --> 01:44:23,150
Ramon said she would give more
milk if she had fresh air, sir.

1475
01:44:30,907 --> 01:44:32,283
It's a boy!

1476
01:44:32,658 --> 01:44:34,614
Congratulations, sir!

1477
01:44:40,952 --> 01:44:43,110
3 January, 1942.

1478
01:44:43,328 --> 01:44:44,488
21:30.

1479
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:47,824
Born to Mrs. Manuel Garcia -
a boy.

1480
01:44:48,536 --> 01:44:49,946
22:55.

1481
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:53,036
Mrs. Ceferino Vincenzo
has gone into labor.

1482
01:44:53,205 --> 01:44:56,038
The whole crew are acting like
expectant fathers;...

1483
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:59,779
Seaman Fox is even having
sympathetic labor pains.

1484
01:45:02,874 --> 01:45:06,074
Cheer up, Fox, it will all be over soon.
- Yes, sir.

1485
01:45:09,249 --> 01:45:10,576
Diapers.

1486
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:13,321
For the baby, sir.
- Really?

1487
01:45:25,419 --> 01:45:26,581
Got you.

1488
01:45:27,628 --> 01:45:29,666
Yes, you got me, Harmon,
now what?

1489
01:45:29,837 --> 01:45:32,408
Excuse me, sir, playing
blind man's buff with the kids.

1490
01:45:32,588 --> 01:45:34,295
Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

1491
01:45:35,839 --> 01:45:37,165
Hi.
- Hi.

1492
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:38,625
How are you?
- Okay.

1493
01:45:38,798 --> 01:45:40,420
What do you know?
- Okay.

1494
01:45:40,589 --> 01:45:41,787
Okay.

1495
01:45:42,006 --> 01:45:44,126
Can I go through there?
- There's a woman in labor.

1496
01:45:44,298 --> 01:45:46,419
Yes, I know, but I have
to go to the engine room.

1497
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:48,711
If you do not mind.
- I don't mind. Come on.

1498
01:45:50,632 --> 01:45:54,757
Everything all right?
- Okay, okay, everything okay.

1499
01:46:03,135 --> 01:46:04,414
Tostin!

1500
01:46:07,303 --> 01:46:08,582
Tostin!

1501
01:46:12,263 --> 01:46:15,131
Me and the Major were just taking
some measurements, sir.

1502
01:46:15,305 --> 01:46:17,296
Would you care to explain that?

1503
01:46:17,972 --> 01:46:19,548
Fuel oil transfer pump.

1504
01:46:20,597 --> 01:46:22,386
Engine room.
Is the Captain there?

1505
01:46:22,555 --> 01:46:25,674
What is it, Stovall?
- Kraus has the radio repeating, sir.

1506
01:46:25,849 --> 01:46:27,340
I'll be right up.

1507
01:46:32,808 --> 01:46:34,431
It looks like you were right, Edna.

1508
01:46:34,725 --> 01:46:37,012
We'll need some
high pressure piping.

1509
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:39,803
We can get it in the
forward torpedo room.

1510
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,892
Yes, that's right. I'll get it, Sam.

1511
01:46:50,978 --> 01:46:52,637
You're quite a girl, Edna.

1512
01:46:55,854 --> 01:46:57,644
We picked up "Tokyo Rose", sir.

1513
01:46:59,355 --> 01:47:02,887
I have a message for
the crew of the pink submarine

1514
01:47:03,065 --> 01:47:05,683
cruising somewhere
in the Celebes Sea.

1515
01:47:05,898 --> 01:47:07,888
Fellows, start the
New Year off right.

1516
01:47:08,398 --> 01:47:09,477
Surrender.

1517
01:47:09,941 --> 01:47:12,608
We don't know what you're
up to, but it won't work.

1518
01:47:13,066 --> 01:47:16,848
All you've done painting your sub pink
is make it easier to find you.

1519
01:47:17,193 --> 01:47:18,685
... so, why die, boys?

1520
01:47:19,693 --> 01:47:21,729
And now an
appropriate number.

1521
01:47:24,401 --> 01:47:25,730
What do you think, sir?

1522
01:47:27,319 --> 01:47:29,227
Well, we've got nothing
to worry about.

1523
01:47:29,986 --> 01:47:32,025
... their side knows and
our side knows.

1524
01:47:32,196 --> 01:47:34,767
There's probably some of our ships
out looking for us now.

1525
01:47:39,697 --> 01:47:42,778
We've checked with British,
Australian, and Dutch naval units, sir.

1526
01:47:42,947 --> 01:47:45,732
They have no pink submarines.
- And it's certainly not one of ours.

1527
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:48,858
Intelligence feels the
"Tokyo Rose" broadcast

1528
01:47:49,032 --> 01:47:51,317
is a decoy so they can slip
one of their own subs through.

1529
01:47:52,658 --> 01:47:54,898
Well, this is one trick
they won't get away with.

1530
01:47:55,450 --> 01:47:57,441
Notify all Allied naval units:

1531
01:47:57,617 --> 01:48:01,445
Any unidentified submarine, pink or
otherwise, is to be sunk on sight.

1532
01:48:09,369 --> 01:48:10,365
Sir.
- What?

1533
01:48:10,537 --> 01:48:12,029
A destroyer on the
starboard bow.

1534
01:48:16,371 --> 01:48:17,698
It's one of ours.

1535
01:48:18,122 --> 01:48:20,691
How do you want to contact them, sir?
Our radio still isn't transmitting.

1536
01:48:20,871 --> 01:48:23,822
Signal them. Get Harmon to
the conning tower. Stand by to surface.

1537
01:48:37,417 --> 01:48:39,206
Submarine surfacing
port bow!

1538
01:48:41,334 --> 01:48:42,993
It's that pink sub!

1539
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:45,532
Surface action port!
- Surface action port!

1540
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:47,701
Fire when ready!
- Fire when ready!

1541
01:49:03,963 --> 01:49:06,832
Jesus Christ! Take her down!
Clear the bridge!

1542
01:49:07,006 --> 01:49:08,547
Take her down, fast!

1543
01:49:13,674 --> 01:49:15,962
Establish sonar contact.

1544
01:49:20,216 --> 01:49:23,050
All engines ahead full. Stand by
to fire depth charges.

1545
01:49:23,218 --> 01:49:24,924
Stand by to fire depth charges.

1546
01:49:34,261 --> 01:49:36,088
They're coming in
for the kill, sir.

1547
01:49:36,262 --> 01:49:38,502
Rig for depth charges.
Silent running.

1548
01:49:38,679 --> 01:49:39,792
Excuse me.

1549
01:50:09,978 --> 01:50:11,803
Flooding on number two periscope.

1550
01:50:11,978 --> 01:50:14,099
Flooding number two
periscope, sir.

1551
01:50:14,687 --> 01:50:15,682
Clear the conning tower.

1552
01:50:15,854 --> 01:50:18,093
Clear the conning tower.
- Clear the conning tower.

1553
01:50:18,271 --> 01:50:19,763
Clearing below.

1554
01:50:26,398 --> 01:50:29,063
Get on the sound gear and report developments.
- Yes, sir.

1555
01:50:34,899 --> 01:50:37,435
They don't have to hit us, sir.
They're going to shake us apart.

1556
01:50:51,152 --> 01:50:51,983
All stop.

1557
01:50:52,153 --> 01:50:53,019
All stop.

1558
01:51:04,989 --> 01:51:06,149
It's twins!

1559
01:51:06,948 --> 01:51:08,274
One of each!

1560
01:51:09,657 --> 01:51:13,603
Captain, Sonar says they're picking up
something like babies crying.

1561
01:51:14,324 --> 01:51:15,817
That's what they say, sir.

1562
01:51:16,241 --> 01:51:18,694
Stay on that sound.
- Stay on that sound.

1563
01:51:19,157 --> 01:51:20,983
They may have a weapon
we know nothing about.

1564
01:51:24,743 --> 01:51:26,864
Keep them quiet.
That's an order.

1565
01:51:27,034 --> 01:51:29,904
What do you suggest we do?
- You are nurses. Make them stop.

1566
01:51:30,077 --> 01:51:33,740
We're trying.
- What is so difficult about keeping babies quiet?

1567
01:51:33,912 --> 01:51:34,989
Oh, you try.

1568
01:51:35,161 --> 01:51:38,243
I can't. I have to go back
to the control room.

1569
01:51:40,829 --> 01:51:43,033
Here, try this one?
- Certainly.

1570
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,658
Thank you.

1571
01:51:47,914 --> 01:51:49,905
You'll be a wonderful father.

1572
01:51:50,081 --> 01:51:52,950
Don't bother trying.
He's already engaged.

1573
01:51:53,124 --> 01:51:54,498
To a super chief.

1574
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:04,908
Hunkle, get all these
pillows and blankets.

1575
01:52:05,084 --> 01:52:07,703
What's up, Chief?
- The skipper's wants them to think we're sinking.

1576
01:52:07,877 --> 01:52:09,915
We're sending up an oil slick and
everything that isn't tied down.

1577
01:52:10,085 --> 01:52:12,241
Give us a hand, Dooley.
- Okay.

1578
01:52:12,961 --> 01:52:14,334
Sorry, ladies.

1579
01:52:16,003 --> 01:52:19,166
And these life jackets, sir?
- Might as well. Throw them in.

1580
01:52:37,757 --> 01:52:39,547
Tube three ready to fire, sir.

1581
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:51,997
Captain, look!

1582
01:52:55,094 --> 01:52:56,468
We've sunk them.

1583
01:52:57,010 --> 01:52:58,339
Maybe.

1584
01:52:59,345 --> 01:53:01,217
Or they could be
pulling a fast one.

1585
01:53:01,637 --> 01:53:03,923
Continue depth charges.
- Continue depth charges.

1586
01:53:13,015 --> 01:53:14,721
They're not buying it.

1587
01:53:23,183 --> 01:53:24,463
They got your girdle, Edna.

1588
01:53:24,642 --> 01:53:26,134
That's all right, Sam.

1589
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:31,349
You know? I spent a lot of years
disliking women.

1590
01:53:32,686 --> 01:53:33,882
But I don't dislike you.

1591
01:53:34,812 --> 01:53:35,759
Really?

1592
01:53:36,811 --> 01:53:37,676
You are different.

1593
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:39,760
You're not a woman.

1594
01:53:40,853 --> 01:53:41,802
You're more than that.

1595
01:53:42,605 --> 01:53:43,635
You're a mechanic.

1596
01:53:44,646 --> 01:53:46,019
Thank you, Sam.

1597
01:53:58,691 --> 01:54:01,937
Just when somebody comes up
with an idea how I can go home.

1598
01:54:02,107 --> 01:54:04,478
What idea, Hunkle?
- Lieutenant Reid, sir.

1599
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:06,889
She figured out what I can do about Gertie.
- Yes?

1600
01:54:07,067 --> 01:54:09,899
Tattoo panties and a bra on her.
- Oh, that's nice.

1601
01:54:13,943 --> 01:54:15,566
Panties and a bra.

1602
01:54:17,069 --> 01:54:18,348
Panties and...

1603
01:54:18,901 --> 01:54:21,570
Sir, we've been sending up
the wrong stuff!

1604
01:54:27,655 --> 01:54:28,816
This is the Captain.

1605
01:54:28,989 --> 01:54:32,485
Nurses will return to
their quarters and take off...

1606
01:54:32,656 --> 01:54:33,983
... their undergarments.

1607
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:37,734
- Mr. Holden will be
right there to collect them.

1608
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:40,690
Here.

1609
01:54:44,575 --> 01:54:45,523
Okay, lock it up.

1610
01:55:01,412 --> 01:55:04,244
Captain, off the port bow.
More debris.

1611
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:14,454
That's debris?

1612
01:55:15,664 --> 01:55:17,572
Stand by with a
grappling hook!

1613
01:55:36,294 --> 01:55:38,165
Come on, get that
thing up here!

1614
01:55:42,879 --> 01:55:44,253
Come on, come on!

1615
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:52,170
The Japanese have
nothing like this.

1616
01:55:52,879 --> 01:55:54,457
Cease fire!

1617
01:56:13,258 --> 01:56:16,293
Captain, this is going
to be terrible.

1618
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:17,925
We should have
come in at night.

1619
01:56:18,093 --> 01:56:20,666
I'm afraid it's too late, Chief.
We're already committed.

1620
01:56:20,885 --> 01:56:23,090
Fall in.
- Yes, sir.

1621
01:56:23,303 --> 01:56:25,175
All right.
Fall in!

1622
01:56:39,431 --> 01:56:41,636
Sir, we're never going
to live this down.

1623
01:56:42,015 --> 01:56:46,341
We may be pink and coming in by the grace
of a woman's brassiere, but we're coming in.

1624
01:56:47,517 --> 01:56:49,756
Show the colors!
- Show the colors!

1625
01:57:23,399 --> 01:57:24,347
Admiral.

1626
01:57:24,773 --> 01:57:27,179
The Captain's arriving, sir.
And we're ready get underway.

1627
01:57:27,357 --> 01:57:28,389
Thank you, Chief.

1628
01:57:35,108 --> 01:57:38,191
Chief, will you drive Mrs. Holden
and the boys back? Thank you.

1629
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,356
Bye, baby.

1630
01:57:39,528 --> 01:57:40,853
Bye, darling.
- Bye, boys.

1631
01:57:41,026 --> 01:57:42,057
Attention on deck!

1632
01:57:46,321 --> 01:57:47,434
Carry on.

1633
01:57:54,738 --> 01:57:56,894
Good morning, Admiral.
- Morning, Captain.

1634
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:00,151
Any last-minute reprieve?
- No go.

1635
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:04,985
I hate to take her to the junkyard.
- Yes, I know.

1636
01:58:05,324 --> 01:58:08,276
A new atomic submarine comes
off the ways in a month;...

1637
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:12,111
its the same name... "Sea Tiger".
It will be your next command.

1638
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:14,073
That's great. Thank you, sir.

1639
01:58:14,242 --> 01:58:16,149
Here's something else.

1640
01:58:20,576 --> 01:58:23,612
Did you put everything here?
- Yes, everything.

1641
01:58:23,787 --> 01:58:26,820
I feel it will be in safer hands now.
- You know it will.

1642
01:58:26,995 --> 01:58:30,527
I suggest you don't show it to your children
until they're old enough to understand.

1643
01:58:31,746 --> 01:58:34,033
All right, Nick, take her away.
- Yes, sir.

1644
01:58:36,038 --> 01:58:39,321
By the way, where is my wife?
- I don't know. She never showed.

1645
01:58:42,165 --> 01:58:43,622
Attention on deck!

1646
01:58:44,749 --> 01:58:47,369
Okay, Jack. Let's shove off.
Aye aye, sir.

1647
01:58:47,666 --> 01:58:50,237
Take in the brow!
Take in all lines!

1648
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:53,369
Hi Uncle Matt.
- Hello guys, how are you?

1649
01:58:53,583 --> 01:58:54,862
What happened to her?

1650
01:58:55,251 --> 01:58:57,869
We waited as long as we could
and finally took a cab.

1651
01:58:58,460 --> 01:58:59,916
That must be her.

1652
01:59:09,545 --> 01:59:11,039
Yes, that's her.

1653
01:59:14,213 --> 01:59:16,618
Driver! The bumpers
are hooked!

1654
01:59:18,255 --> 01:59:19,334
Stop!

1655
01:59:20,798 --> 01:59:22,042
Hey driver!

1656
01:59:22,966 --> 01:59:24,162
Stop!

1657
01:59:33,591 --> 01:59:35,085
Darling, I 'm terribly sorry.

1658
01:59:35,259 --> 01:59:37,926
I stepped on the brake...
- Leave it. Never mind.

1659
01:59:38,385 --> 01:59:41,004
Yes, but your car...
- I know, dear. Don't worry...

1660
01:59:41,177 --> 01:59:42,504
… they'll stop it at the gate.

1661
01:59:55,763 --> 01:59:58,168
Strange, still that number one engine…

1662
01:59:58,763 --> 02:00:00,755
… I guess they were never able to fix that.
