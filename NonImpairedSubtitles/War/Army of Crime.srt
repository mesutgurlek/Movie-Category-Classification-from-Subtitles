Think there's a bomb in the pram?

28
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,583
You're thinking of Dolores?

29
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,416
Yes. She's with her father.

30
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,874
You see,
Petra was right to split us up.

31
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:01,249
Remember, your daughter
will never know war.

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,041
You'll miss your train, Mrs. Bancic.

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,916
Dolores isn't Romanian.

34
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,624
No, a Spanish War heroine.

35
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,999
Hurry up! We're going to be late.

36
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,166
Where's Alexandre?

37
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,749
Out by the stable.

38
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,291
Mummy will be back soon, dear.

39
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,708
Alexandre!

40
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,124
We'll miss our train.

41
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,208
Will we see her again one day?

42
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,666
Don't say that!

43
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:08,416
Don't say it.

44
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,333
Yes!

45
00:04:57,334 --> 00:05:01,499
I don't want you doing that
here again. It's the last time.

46
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,958
We've done no harm.

47
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,791
Monique, spare me trouble
with your parents.

48
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,624
As for you, Marcel...

49
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:10,291
You should be ashamed.

50
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,124
Sorry, Dad, but I'm not ashamed.

51
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,791
Shame is poisoning us all.

52
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,999
Enough of your fancy speeches!

53
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,791
Get to work.

54
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,499
I'll leave you all.

55
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,666
Come outside, Simon.

56
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,416
- His deliveries...
- We'll go together.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,416
- You should tell Marcel.
- What?

58
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,416
About that green paper
from the police.

59
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,083
What green paper?

60
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,291
I know what you'll say.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,249
What's going on?

62
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:57,458
He's been summoned
to assess his situation.

63
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,291
Don't go!

64
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,958
Don't shout!
I'll go and then I'll be in order.

65
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:06,833
- What if it's a trap?
- You see traps everywhere.

66
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,833
They know my address.
They can come any time.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,666
- Where is it?
- In my pocket.

68
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,541
Want to search me?

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,541
You all piss me off!

70
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,916
Krazu!

71
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:28,791
Krazu!

72
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,749
Krasucki!

73
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,874
Coming!

74
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:21,208
Erase that, you filthy Yid!

75
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:30,041
Then you can lick my boots, you ape.

76
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:14,458
Calm down!

77
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,166
- Where's Mum?
- What's wrong?

78
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,208
Mum!

79
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,249
Thomas?

80
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,833
I was called a filthy Yid!

81
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,458
I'm not having that!
I'll kill him next time!

82
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,958
Ignore provocation.
Hold your head high.

83
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:35,249
Head high...

84
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,833
This is France.
Nothing can happen to us here.

85
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,458
It's the land of human rights.

86
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:45,458
Besides,
all our papers are in order.

87
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,874
Why am I circumcised?

88
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:50,208
It's more hygienic.

89
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,124
Don't worry.

90
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,749
Dad knows people at the city hall.

91
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,416
Paris-soir, ladies and gentlemen!
Germany invades Russia!

92
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,208
The end of the German-Soviet pact!

93
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,166
German troops invade Russia!
Get Paris-soir!

94
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,666
Germany is winning on all fronts

95
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:09,416
The police, Mrs. Manouchian!
Get away fast!

96
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,249
What's this?

97
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,333
What is it, scum?

98
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,749
They're pamphlets
denouncing bastards.

99
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,333
What bastards?

100
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:38,666
Tell us, wop.
Let's have a laugh!

101
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,124
What's going on?

102
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,458
My neighbor.
Go, this doesn't concern you.

103
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,958
I want to know.

104
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,333
Want us to take you in too?

105
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:54,041
Let's go!

106
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:55,874
Move it!

107
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,541
"His eyes knew broad horizons

108
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,708
"He was used to mountains

109
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,583
"And had pierced
the mystery of their grandeur

110
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,458
"The animals and birds, trees
and flowers, plants and the earth

111

"Had taught him the secret of love"

112
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:43,583
Missak?

113
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,041
Come in.

114
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,041
What's wrong?

115
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,999
They took him to the Gestapo.

116
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,541
You can move in here.

117
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,916
Remember the day I nearly drowned?

118
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,166
I remember.

119
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,624
I must have had cramp.

120
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,958
You were all in the sun.
We'd just had a picnic.

121
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,791
Missak jumped in fully dressed
to save you.

122
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,791
We laughed so much that day...

123
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:56,541
We'll laugh together again.

124
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,958
It's my turn to save him now.

125
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,499
Thomas Elek.

126
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,791
- You were born in Budapest?
- Yes, sir.

127
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,416
Mr. Principal.

128
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,583
Yes, Mr. Principal.

129
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,416
And... is your family Jewish?

130
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,708
I'm a Communist, Mr. Principal.

131
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,416
- And your parents?
- Their French is good.

132
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,999
I'm asking you what do they do.

133
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,124
Mother has a restaurant.

134
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:31,583
- And your father?
- He reads all day.

135
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,624
The Talmud?

136
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,499
No, he prefers Dostoyevsky.

137
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,499
Do you know Dostoyevsky?
"Crime and Punishment"...

138
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:42,083
All right.
Reading isn't a trade.

139
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,874
What would you like to be later on?

140
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,249
A physicist, Mr. Principal.

141
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,999
You're doing well
in science subjects.

142
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,333
But you're spoiling everything.

143
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,666
Why keep drawing
the communist emblem?

144
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,958
- To become a martyr?
- Yes, Mr. Principal.

145
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,541
Don't talk nonsense!

146
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,499
You have a bright future.

147
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,749
I'll be frank.

148
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,624
I despise the boy who insulted you

149
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:14,749
and condemn all political activity
here. Is that clear?

150
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,083
This place is neutral!

151
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,083
No one can be neutral now.

152
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,833
Just make an effort.

153
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,874
We'll forget this matter.

154
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,874
But I know people
will hold it against me.

155
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:33,333
Meaning they aren't neutral,
Mr. Principal.

156
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,416
Two kilos, please.

157
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,874
Listen to this...

158
00:14:57,292 --> 00:15:00,124
"This film contains
a host of kike mugs.

159

165

What's a cinematic ploy?

We'll never part, huh?

167
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:33,874
Say we'll never part!

168
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,916
Let go, you're hurting me!

169
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,374
I'm Dupont.

170
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,999
Yesterday's prisoners
are at the fort in Romainville.

171
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,249
- Thank you.
- What?

172
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,333
Do nothing. Wait for orders.

173
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,291
With Russia invaded,
they'll pursue Communists here.

174
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,874
- You understand?
- I understand.

175
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,041
Where are you staying?

176
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,916
At the Aznavourians' for now.

177
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,624
Bad. Very bad.
You'll "indanger" them.

178
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:52,833
We must protect our comrades.
Very bad. You understand?

179
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,291
Mélinée...

180
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,208
We all love Manouchian.

181
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:01,749
For a long time.

182
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:05,041
What does that mean?
That he's already dead?

183
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:24,249
Not here.
The Jewish affairs office.

184
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,583
First floor, staircase F.

185
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,291
I'm here about my husband.
He has been arrested.

186
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,749
Thank you.

187
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,124
That's her.

188
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,958
Inspector Mathelin. Come with me.

189
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,333
You know your husband's on file?

190
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,833
You want to end up in a camp too?

191
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,874
He's not here anymore.

192
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,916
He was moved to Cormeilles.

193
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:23,999
An old fort used by the Germans
as a prison camp.

194
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,791
That's all I know.

195
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:27,458
Thank you.

196
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,249
I'm sorry,

197
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,999
but I have no choice.

198
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:42,916
Because of my colleagues.
I have to play it safe.

199
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:58,958
Mélinée!

200
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,666
Wait!
Let's take a break!

201
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,416
- Aren't you thirsty?
- No.

202
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,499
They'll never agree to this.

203
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,583
He has to eat to keep going.

204
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,791
Be careful.

205
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,583
Chow.

206
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,041
For my husband, Missak Manouchian.

207
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,374
You understand "chow"?

208
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:03,541
Madam, I understand above all
that you're very brave

209
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,333
or completely mad.

210
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:10,583
Prisoner's wives
never dare to come here.

211
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,749
I love my husband.

212
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:13,833
He's a lucky man then.

213
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,624
He's an important Armenian poet.

214
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,499
Intellectuals share the same cells.

215
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,333
The French police arrested them.

216
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,166
- As Communists.
- Missak isn't political.

217
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,708
He has to prove it.

218
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:43,333
- What now?
- We'll give it to your husband.

219
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,791
May I see him?

220
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,958
I'll say goodbye.

221
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,124
We're enemies, madam.

222
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,499
Comrades, finish the pâté.
I'm full.

223
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,124
Finish your share!

224
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,999
You must eat, Missak.

225
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,874
After roots and worms,
you can do without a lot.

226
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,708
The Turks raided my village
every day.

227
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,583
They would fire at random,
just to kill Armenians.

228
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,541
So I fled with my brother Karapet.

229
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,041
We walked with no precise goal.

230
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,208
We should have died 100 times.

231
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,583
Then, one day,
we woke in a Syrian orphanage.

232
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,416
Here, this is my big brother.

233
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,208
Well, this was him.

234
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,874
I couldn't utter a word.

235
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:58,249
Writing poems got me speaking again.

236
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,333
Two tenths faster!

237
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:19,541
Bravo, Rougemont!

238
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:22,124
You're making great progress!

239
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:24,958
- Two tenths isn't bad.
- I don't realize.

240
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,041
Believe me, it's not bad.

241
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:32,083
I'll show you how to swim.

242
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:45,208
What's so funny?

243
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:47,958
Rougemont...
I can't get used to it.

244
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,041
- It sounds like someone else.
- It is.

245
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:54,583
You're ashamed of Rayman,
of being Jewish?

246
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,999
- Shut up, silly.
- I can't shut up.

247
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:02,083
- Let's go.
- Have I upset you?

248
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,999
No, I have to fetch Simon.

249
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,583
Leave your brother be.
You stifle him.

250
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,833
When he's with me, I know he's safe.

251
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:14,791
Go and get dressed.

252
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:16,791
Know why I love you?

253
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:19,833
You never know why.

254
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,958
I know.

255
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,124
Really?

256
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:26,666
You know everything.

257
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,583
Because you're a liar.

258
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,541
Do you really
play harmonica in a band?

259
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,291
Who told you that?

260
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:37,749
People.

261
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,499
- You're a good musician...
- What people?

262
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,583
Don't listen to what people say!
They talk rubbish.

263
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,833
You're no fun.

264
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:03,624
Well?

265
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,249
Krazu!

266
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,041
Come on!

267
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:11,124
We're leaving?

268
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,374
Do you really
play harmonica in a band?

269
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:19,333
I'm a good musician.
But that password is six months old.

270
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,499
Monique just asked me that.

271
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:22,791
Monique?

272
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,791
If she knows, everyone does.

273
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,541
Be more serious,
this isn't some damn game!

274
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:15,458
People of France!

275
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:20,333
Hoping for the victory of England
and the USSR is not enough.

276
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,166
You must play an active role in it.

277
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,249
Hello, gentlemen. Sit down.

278
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:53,583
Mr. Rottée, congratulations
on your nomination

279
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,374
as head of intelligence.

280
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:59,541
Prefect Bard called me
to sing your praises.

281
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,541
We hold Admiral Bard in high esteem.
He's very...

282
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,208
Energisch.
What's the word in French?

283
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,999
Energetic.

284
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:10,374
Energetic!

285
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:15,666
Superintendent David,
our nations are made to get along.

286
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,083
Prefect Bard

287
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,874
is stepping up
the anti-communist effort.

288
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:23,166
Superintendent David
will head the special unit.

289
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:26,249
Six lorries destroyed
on Avenue Parmentier.

290
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,041
The attacks
are increasingly frequent.

291
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:34,124
Attacks on garages, derailments...
They even slash our lorries' tires!

292
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,249
I know, Obersturmführer.

293
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:39,624
Knowing is not enough!
This requires action.

294
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,958
We've managed to keep it quiet
until now.

295
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,708
We have the press under control.

296
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:47,208
You know our orders.

297
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:50,833
10 Communists shot
for each German murdered.

298
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:57,833
You have to sign.

299
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,291
No, I won't sign it.

300
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,249
Stay alive to keep fighting for us.

301
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,208
I won't sign it, I said.

302
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,749
You look upset.

303
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:19,583
Dupont told me Hadj, Boitel
and Pitard were shot two days ago.

304
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:20,791
Don't know them.

305
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,791
- They're in Manouche's cell.
- Shit!

306
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,833
Hello, Cristina.

307
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,249
Hurry up, Mélinée.
I have my opera audition in an hour.

308
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,083
Workers,
sabotage German production.

309
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,374
Each minute of work lost
Will save a life.

310
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,499
A faulty machine, a loose bolt,

311
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,874
or a pinhole in a can
will hasten the German defeat.

312
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:03,708
I write to him every evening.
We'd know if they'd shot him.

313
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,874
Dupont told me he was alive.

314
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:10,874
- Henri, are you listening?
- Of course.

315
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:12,291
You're hiding something.

316
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,916
Mélinée, if I knew anything at all,

317
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:17,458
you know I'd tell you.

318
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,041
Asshole...

319
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,916
Don't you find him cute?

320
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:24,791
Go ahead,
tell him you want to have a Kraut!

321
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,666
Jealousy always makes men stupid.

322
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,124
- What's wrong?
- Bad news.

323
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:46,166
They arrested all the Jews
who came with the green paper.

324
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:49,041
Your father's interned
in Beaune-la-Rolande.

325
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,708
- Where's that?
- Near Orléans.

326
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,708
- A German camp?
- No, French.

327
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,249
That's ok.

328
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:01,458
It's not. The gendarmes open fire
on anyone who approaches.

329
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,458
There's barbed wire and...

330
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:06,624
What?

331
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:09,166
My contact says they'll be deported.

332
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:12,666
He doesn't know where
but we won't see them again.

333
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,791
I'm sorry, Marcel.

334
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:23,708
What's wrong?

335
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:24,999
His father.

336
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,083
Henri. Henri Krasucki.

337
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:43,041
What did he say?

338
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,208
He wants us to play football.

339
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,041
Very pretty.

340
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,041
Tomorrow,
you won't have a head, comrade.

341
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:02,291
- Where are you going?
- To tell Mum to stop waiting!

342
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:06,041
Just wait for orders, ok.
We'll avenge your father.

343
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,583
I know what I need to do.

344
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,083
Here we are in Beaune-la-Rolande.

345
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:25,708
The Jews seethe here
in less space than in Pithiviers.

346
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:27,708
In the French countryside,

347
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:32,041
will they begin to sense
what their race has always lacked,

348
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,708
a love of land and hard labor?

349
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,208
Unfortunately, one doubts that.

350
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:41,416
If they cannot understand
the great and simple example

351
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,124
of France's granary,

352
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:47,208
of this land's
rough and ready inhabitants,

353
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:51,708
at least they have rid Paris
of their undesirable presence.

354
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:54,833
Mum!

355
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:56,874
What's this?

356
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,124
- How was your day?
- What is it?

357
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:01,624
They came earlier, one in uniform.

358
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:02,708
Germans?

359
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,166
No, Tommy, French. All young.

360
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:08,166
That has to go on the door
to avoid trouble.

361
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,291
- Why did you obey?
- To get peace.

362
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:13,624
That's all you talk about.
But we're at war!

363
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,374
They'll be back, Thomas.

364
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,124
Fine, I'll be waiting.
With a gun.

365
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:19,083
You're mad.

366
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:21,291
That's nothing new.

367
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:22,749
I say he's right.

368
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,458
Can I borrow Karl Marx?

369
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:30,333
"Das Kapital"? What for?
It's a Gothic-script edition!

370
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,833
Thanks, Dad.

371
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:33,916
Thomas!

372
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,958
I'll have to scarper.

373
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:18,916
Stay nearby and hide,
keep your eyes and ears open.

374
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:20,874
Watch everything.

375
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:24,124
Then go home and wait.
When I get back,

376
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:27,833
tell me everything, every detail.
You understand?

377
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,958
General Béla Kun!

378
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,291
Still no news, but you've taught me
never to give up hope.

379
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:19,041
I know you're alive.
That's the main thing.

380
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:25,083
In the meantime, I seal envelopes
the way we did together.

381
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,874
My tongue is like
a cheese-grater now!

382
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,083
A swollen one too!

383
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,166
Don't...

384
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,083
I'm too dirty.

385
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:39,458
You escaped?

386
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:40,583
No.

387
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:45,583
I signed a document
declaring I'm not a Communist.

388
00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:49,291
I heard about the others.

389
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:52,583
I'm ashamed that I'm still alive.

390
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:55,833
You've no idea how ashamed.

391
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,416
I love you.

392
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,499
I love you.

393
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:41,791
Sleep, my little orphan.

394
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,499
Thomas!

395
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,541
Been following me long?

396
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,833
Two weeks or so.

397
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:56,249
Ever since I realized
you had something planned.

398
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:57,874
How did you know?

399
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,916
I went round to your hide.

400
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,249
I just blew up "Das Kapital"
in that filthy bookshop!

401
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,874
- You're proud?
- It's a fine gesture.

402
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:13,083
What if they'd checked your bag
at the door?

403
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:17,083
- I took that risk.
- Of being caught. And after?

404
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,124
- What?
- Torture.

405
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:21,583
- I'll never talk.
- Cut it out!

406
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:25,499
Petra is right.
You're a danger for us all.

407
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,249
Listen carefully.

408
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:32,083
Go home now.
I forbid you to return to your hide.

409
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,583
You hear me? I forbid it!

410
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:51,749
How are Charles' songs going?

411
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:54,458
He won another contest
the other day.

412
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,791
The kid's bringing in money!

413
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,291
I'll cut some sausage.
Rhymes with bridge.

414
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:05,666
Bad rhyme.
Where's the "sausidge" from?

415
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:11,291
Laversine, a village west of Paris.
I go for eggs every two weeks.

416
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:13,124
I got two rabbits this time.

417
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:14,999
Life is beautiful.

418
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:29,541
At first, they shot 10 of us
for every German killed.

419
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:32,083
When I left the camp, it was 20.

420
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,833
They're making room
for new arrivals.

421
00:43:35,334 --> 00:43:36,958
It makes you think.

422
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,166
Think too much and you do nothing.

423
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:41,291
She's right.

424
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:48,999
- What will you do now?
- Go mad soon.

425
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,291
I'm waiting for a signal.
All day long.

426
00:43:52,459 --> 00:43:54,958
Why sever all contact with you?

427
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,249
They've put me in quarantine.

428
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:01,333
It's fishy when you get out alive.

429
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:05,999
They think you're a rat
or bait for the cops

430
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,874
who manage to break
a lot of comrades.

431
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,458
Let's do that too.

432
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:01,208
Isn't Monique here?

433
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:04,416
She's at the grocer's.
What do you want now?

434
00:45:04,584 --> 00:45:06,291
- I have a book for her.
- What book?

435
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:07,749
"Les Misérables".

436
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,791
We're getting enough misery.

437
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:12,708
She doesn't need to read
"Les Misérables"!

438
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:17,166
We always need to read.
Henri Krasucki told me that.

439
00:45:17,334 --> 00:45:18,166
That Commie?

440
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:22,166
Part of the bad company you keep!

441
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:25,666
Leave Monique alone!

442
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,958
She'll only end up in trouble!

443
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:50,416
I pity your poor mother...

444
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:51,999
Her husband arrested....

445
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,624
Deported...

446
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:55,499
And eliminated.

447
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:58,458
Don't say that.
You don't really know.

448
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:01,749
They need workers in Germany.

449
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,624
Your father will be back one day.

450
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,083
Bravo, Olga!

451
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,249
Thomas, drink with us!
Come on, Mrs. Elek!

452
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,916
Six months ago to the day,

453
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:20,666
after escaping
from the Argelès camp,

454
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:24,624
I arrived here
without a penny to my name.

455
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,791
I was starving

456
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:30,249
and, right away,
you fed me, Mrs. Elek.

457
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:31,249
And you said...

458
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,749
I'll always remember this...

459
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,583
"If you came to us,
there's a reason.

460
00:47:38,042 --> 00:47:40,958
"A good one no doubt,
but none of my business."

461
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,374
And it still isn't now!

462
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,541
- Consider this your home.
- To you and your family.

463
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,833
- A speech, Mrs. Elek!
- No...

464
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,624
A quick one.

465
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:52,624
No, I'm a good cook
but a terrible speaker.

466
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:54,416
Mum! Go on!

467
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,374
Come on...

468
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:03,249
When we left Budapest
to flee the Fascists,

469
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:06,291
we left many dear ones behind.

470
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,833
So it's natural

471
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,874
to create a new family.
And our family is you.

472
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,124
With you, we keep warm.

473
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:16,874
With you, we don't need coal!

474
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:19,333
May I kiss you?

475
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,083
- May he?
- Yes!

476
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:22,583
Mrs. Elek!

477
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,958
And Mr. Elek!

478
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,708
Tell us about Avenue Parmentier.

479
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,166
No, Tommy, please!
We know it by heart!

480
00:48:35,334 --> 00:48:37,374
So what? Come on!

481
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:42,333
Patriciu is right. Relating his
exploits will make my poet senile.

482
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,958
Senile? Me? Never!

483
00:48:46,084 --> 00:48:47,541
The boy should know.

484
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:03,958
Good evening, Petra.

485
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:09,499
- Are you well?
- Yes.

486
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:11,416
Dupont was right.

487
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,791
You can be heard a mile away!

488
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,208
Come on, Petra.
Have a drink with us.

489
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:28,249
You're totally reckless.

490
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:31,666
You came to lecture us?

491
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,458
Shut your mouth, Boczov!
The fact you fought in Spain

492
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,791
doesn't make you smarter than us.

493
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:41,124
What do you mean exactly?

494
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:45,874
Stop committing isolated acts.

495
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:49,041
They're no use
and put us all at risk.

496
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:51,916
What we want

497
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:57,208
is to form a real army with chiefs
and soldiers who obey them.

498
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:02,541
I'm not against that.

499
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,999
Then you and Olga must part.

500
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:10,208
It isn't good,
you two always being together.

501
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,666
Wasn't leaving Dolores
in the country enough?

502
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:18,333
No, it's not enough.
You mustn't be seen together.

503
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:19,874
Is that clear?

504
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:29,166
You can always find girls
if you want to get laid!

505
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:32,999
My wife's a whore?

506
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:38,249
How can you say that about Olga?
I'll kill you!

507
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,291
Stop!

508
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,666
When I carried grenades
in Dolores' pram,

509
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:52,166
you all thought that was good.

510
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,458
I did it 20 times at least!

511
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:59,833
To thank us, you sent her away.

512
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,999
And we obeyed like dogs!

513
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,541
I was 16 when I married Alexandre!

514
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,249
Don't get divorced.

515
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,791
Just don't be seen together.

516
00:51:10,959 --> 00:51:14,958
Know what a partisan fights for?
He fights for life.

517
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:17,791
For life,
against those fighting for death.

518
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:20,833
And Olga is my life.

519
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,666
And Dolores is my life.

520
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:26,874
Never forget that, Petra.

521
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,166
We kill people
but we're on the side of life.

522
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:56,708
All right?

523
00:51:58,917 --> 00:52:02,624
We're entrusting you
with new responsibilities.

524
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:07,249
You've worked with Immigrant Labour.
The Armenians trust you.

525
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:08,833
You're brave.

526
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,249
People must talk
about the Resistance now.

527
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:17,374
We must demoralize the Germans
and scare the collaborators.

528
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,791
We have to be organized like an army

529
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:22,958
with discipline and rules,

530
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:26,708
with orders and chiefs like you,
you understand?

531
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:30,041
- Nothing to say?
- Petra already lectured me.

532
00:52:30,209 --> 00:52:31,458
What do you say?

533
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,999
I couldn't shoot a German soldier.

534
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:36,083
You can learn fast.

535
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:36,916
No, comrade.

536
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:41,916
I won't kill anyone.
It's a matter of ethics.

537
00:52:42,084 --> 00:52:44,958
Ethics? What the hell are ethics?

538
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:46,208
My personal code.

539
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:49,416
It's nothing to do
with bravery or cowardice.

540
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,166
I don't understand.

541
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:57,208
We have a meeting on March 8th.
Memorize the address and raze this.

542
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:00,249
Burn it, Dupont, you burn paper.

543
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:04,916
Think of your mother dying
of hunger and grief in your arms!

544
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:08,291
Of your father.
And of your big brother Karapet!

545
00:53:08,459 --> 00:53:10,249
His lungs rotted away!

546
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:15,041
And you talk about ethics?
Shame on you!

547
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,583
Leave my family out of this.

548
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,999
Refuse
and we'll dump you and your wife.

549
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:29,416
You have until March 8th to decide.
Ethics!

550
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,708
The Special Brigade's key targets

551
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:38,083
are foreign terrorists,

552
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,416
notably those
of the Immigrant Labour Movement.

553
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:43,958
Any questions?

554
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:47,541
- Inspector David?
- And the Jews?

555
00:53:48,584 --> 00:53:51,541
Let's get this clear.
Jews only concern us

556
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:55,416
if they commit terrorist acts
like other foreigners,

557
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:58,583
Italians or Spaniards,
refugees in France.

558
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,166
The question allows me

559
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,499
to stress something...

560
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:07,458
The close collaboration
of our force with the German army

561
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:11,583
is our main asset.
They're soldiers, we're policemen.

562
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,291
They don't know the streets
or how to tail someone.

563
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:19,791
We must use that to lead the fight
against Bolshevism!

564
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:23,208
Remember the Popular Front.
It was a close call.

565
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:25,291
I would like you

566
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:29,458
to realize
that our mission of repression

567
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:31,541
is a highly

568
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:34,166
patriotic mission.

569
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,749
- Hello, officer.
- Madam...

570
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:47,791
I'm Mrs. Boulin, janitor,
17, Rue Voltaire.

571
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:52,791
I'm not the type
to disparage my tenants, inspector.

572
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:55,791
The gentleman pays his rent on time.

573
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,666
But the other day...

574
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:03,749
there was an odd smell at his door.

575
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:06,041
What kind of smell?

576
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:08,583
I don't know.

577
00:55:09,584 --> 00:55:11,249
A smell like sulfur.

578
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:14,624
You're saying he's the devil?

579
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:16,291
Not at all.

580
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,291
But nip it in the bud, I say.

581
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,291
With all these wops

582
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:23,916
and all these attacks.

583
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:26,583
You're right, Mrs. Boulin.

584
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:31,833
- What will you do?
- We'll watch your building.

585
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,374
I don't want trouble.

586
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:36,749
Don't worry,
the police protects true patriots.

587
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:43,416
Inspector Pujol, 11th district.
Superintendent David, please.

588
00:55:58,167 --> 00:55:59,791
Hello, Mr. Forestier.

589
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:05,208
Have you seen?
It's going to rain.

590
00:56:05,834 --> 00:56:06,999
Goodbye.

591
00:56:07,334 --> 00:56:08,749
Have a good day!

592
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,416
So that's the devil?

593
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:29,708
The comrades are expecting you.

594
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:33,166
- Am I late?
- No, they're always early.

595
00:57:49,042 --> 00:57:50,541
Sit down, Missak.

596
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,208
Were you followed?

597
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:57,833
Only by my shadow,
but it doesn't scare me.

598
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,874
A bowl of chicory?

599
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,041
- Boczov isn't here?
- Boczov isn't on the agenda.

600
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,958
That's a pity.

601
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:12,458
Let's not "squibble" about it.

602
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,249
- What's so funny?
- Nothing. You're right.

603
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,249
Missak,

604
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,624
we asked you to form a combat unit.

605
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,749
Do you have any suggestions?

606
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,083
- I have a list.
- On you? You're mad!

607
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:32,833
Just joking.

608
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,708
I know you like to joke

609
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,208
but these are serious matters.

610
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:42,499
Fine, I'll be serious too.
The first name is Feri Boczov.

611
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:44,208
Are you provoking us?

612
00:58:44,584 --> 00:58:45,916
Not at all, comrade.

613
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:47,916
It's common sense.

614
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:52,249
He's a proven fighter
and is ready to join my group.

615
00:58:52,584 --> 00:58:53,416
Next?

616
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:56,749
Young Thomas Elek.
Boczov will supervise him.

617
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:57,583
- No.
- Yes.

618
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,458
No! He's too foolhardy!

619
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:03,208
Petra's right,
he has a partisan complex.

620
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:04,958
What's that?

621
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,624
He feels invulnerable
and puts us all at risk.

622
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:12,041
I know Tommy well.
He just wants to learn.

623
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:13,958
Just trust Boczov.

624
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,916
Fine. And the others?

625
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:21,999
Former members
of the International Brigades.

626
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:27,374
It's good, they have experience.
And young Armenian refugees too.

627
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:30,624
I already work with them.
And the Italians.

628
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:32,249
Take Olga Bancic too.

629
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:36,666
You and your husband
work separately.

630
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:40,291
All right.

631
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:41,499
And Mélinée?

632
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:47,249
You aren't going to split us up.
That's non-negotiable.

633
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:52,666
Take Marcel Rayman too.
He'll teach you to shoot.

634
00:59:52,834 --> 00:59:56,291
I don't need to know that
to head a combat unit!

635
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,499
You're wrong, Missak.

636
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:01,458
You don't have to kill.
Just learn to shoot.

637
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:04,041
- Comrade...
- That's non-negotiable too.

638
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,041
Your little brother?

639
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:41,374
His name's Simon. Wait here.

640
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:46,041
I didn't ask you to bring him.

641
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:48,083
I asked him along.

642
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:49,624
You're late.

643
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:53,124
Metro trouble.
Another German soldier was shot.

644
01:00:53,292 --> 01:00:55,083
Anything to do with you?

645
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:58,666
I'm teaching you to shoot?

646
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:04,916
With you, Pétain will live
to a ripe old age! Watch...

647
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:11,374
If you use one hand like a cowboy,
your aim is wild.

648
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,791
And you tremble. A gun's heavy.

649
01:01:13,959 --> 01:01:17,249
So use both hands,
spread your legs, get stable,

650
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:19,291
extend your arms to the target

651
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:20,666
and you aim better.

652
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,124
Try it again.

653
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:33,666
Can I try?

654
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:37,333
Haven't you got a book to read?

655
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:47,624
Good, you're making progress.

656
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:48,874
And you?

657
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:52,958
- What about me?
- Can you follow orders?

658
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,541
Talking about Simon?

659
01:01:55,709 --> 01:01:58,666
I told Petra:
I won't be parted from him.

660
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:00,708
If he's with me, he's safe.

661
01:02:02,459 --> 01:02:07,374
I hear you swim. You're training
for a competition, is that right?

662
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:10,124
The Seine championship.
What of it?

663
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:11,916
Keep a lower profile!

664
01:02:12,084 --> 01:02:14,416
I'm not competing, Rougemont is!

665
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,499
- Michel Rougemont!
- Bullshit!

666
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:19,166
You do gymnastics every morning.

667
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:20,333
I need to swim.

668
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,374
And you always need a gun,
even when you swim?

669
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:27,124
- It stays in my bag.
- Someone might search it.

670
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:29,083
I go with Simon, Monique

671
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,041
or Krazu.
One of them stays with my bag.

672
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,624
Is the interrogation over?

673
01:02:39,709 --> 01:02:44,041
You want to join my group
but you don't want to obey me.

674
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,041
Not always.

675
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:50,208
But you're the chief, you decide.

676
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,874
I decide.

677
01:03:10,584 --> 01:03:12,333
Can't you sleep?

678
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:17,124
What's on your mind?

679
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,916
I love you, Mélinée.

680
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:30,291
And that's keeping you awake?

681
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,374
"A charming young child

682
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:45,374
"Spent all night dreaming

683
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:48,416
"That the sweet purple dawn

684
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,166
"Will bring bouquets of roses."

685
01:03:51,334 --> 01:03:53,791
That was my first poem in French.

686
01:04:03,834 --> 01:04:05,541
Paris is so peaceful.

687
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:12,249
We've had news from Drancy.

688
01:04:12,709 --> 01:04:15,208
There are 3 convoys a week
to Auschwitz,

689
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,583
a concentration camp in Poland.

690
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:21,083
I heard German soldiers
have a new weapon,

691
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:24,583
a new nerve gas.

692
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:27,124
I even heard they're testing it

693
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:29,624
on deported Jews.

694
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:33,833
Can you believe that?

695
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:53,041
Daddy's making money in Germany!

696
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:16,749
- A pineapple and two pieces?
- No, only one.

697
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:17,749
Shit!

698
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:19,333
It's what they gave me.

699
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:27,416
A new automatic,
straight from the factory.

700
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:28,916
If I'd known...

701
01:05:29,084 --> 01:05:31,708
It's not your fault.
We'll manage.

702
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:34,624
How's Alexandre?

703
01:05:34,792 --> 01:05:36,374
You're sweet. He's well.

704
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:43,416
One piece.
Good job I still have mine.

705
01:05:43,584 --> 01:05:44,833
I just need a grenade.

706
01:05:45,084 --> 01:05:47,624
Call it off.
It's too risky, Narek.

707
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:48,958
- Missak...
- What?

708
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,874
It'd be a shame to call it off now.
Marcel can cover me.

709
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:59,458
I'll back you both up then.

710
01:06:12,709 --> 01:06:13,833
Let's go.

711
01:07:04,084 --> 01:07:06,249
- What's wrong?
- Give me the grenade.

712
01:07:06,834 --> 01:07:09,833
Are you deaf?
Hand it over and back us up!

713
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:18,833
He's insane!

714
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,958
Let him go. This is unbelievable.

715
01:07:34,334 --> 01:07:35,208
Throw it...

716
01:09:51,084 --> 01:09:53,291
Has something bad happened?

717
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,666
You know, Mélinée,

718
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,833
I always felt revenge
was an awful idea.

719
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:04,249
Changed your mind?

720
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:05,583
I don't know.

721
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,624
I've become a real fighter.

722
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,416
It's my first act
but won't be my last.

723
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:20,291
Once you've started,
you can't back down.

724
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,583
You can't turn back anymore.

725
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:27,958
I know what awaits me.

726
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:52,916
Missak! Missak!

727
01:11:08,209 --> 01:11:11,124
Today is the anniversary
of Soviet Armenia.

728
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:14,999
I remember my father
killed by Turkish soldiers,

729
01:11:15,334 --> 01:11:17,124
my mother who died of grief

730
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:21,333
and the brother I loved so much.

731
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,416
I'm an orphan
like all the other Armenian victims.

732
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:29,833
But I'm lucky
because you're all here.

733
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:32,999
Because you have become my family.

734
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,083
A family of fighters
to confront the occupier!

735
01:11:38,542 --> 01:11:39,708
Long live France!

736
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,208
Long live Armenia!

737
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:43,416
Long live the ILO!

738
01:12:05,709 --> 01:12:07,374
Good evening. Come in.

739
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,333
What's this meeting?

740
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,999
An Armenian wedding.

741
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:21,208
- Who's the bride?
- I am!

742
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:24,416
You can find love at any age!

743
01:12:24,584 --> 01:12:25,833
Can't you, officer?

744
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:28,916
Have a drink!

745
01:12:29,084 --> 01:12:31,874
- We'll bring our bikes in.
- They're safe here.

746
01:12:32,584 --> 01:12:33,249
Don't worry.

747
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,166
Go ahead, please.

748
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,041
What would you like?

749
01:12:45,209 --> 01:12:48,249
That white wine there
will fit the bill.

750
01:12:52,959 --> 01:12:54,708
Glad you're back, Manouche.

751
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:57,624
Me too, Narek.
We'll work well together.

752
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,374
Cheers! To your good health!

753
01:13:13,459 --> 01:13:16,124
Enough orders
from London and Moscow.

754
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:20,083
They never set foot here
and they think we're useless!

755
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:23,208
What can we do?
They supply our weapons.

756
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:25,791
A few at a time, as if we were kids!

757
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:29,249
We'll follow you,
but not the Hungarian.

758
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:31,374
Which Hungarian? Petra?

759
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:33,249
- No names, please.
- I know.

760
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:36,666
But I agree with him.
I won't obey a Stalinist.

761
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,124
- Go on, drink!
- I am drinking!

762
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,749
To the Marshal!

763
01:14:05,792 --> 01:14:06,749
To the Marshal!

764
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:09,249
To the Marshal!

765
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,666
When a train derails
or locomotives are destroyed,

766
01:14:35,834 --> 01:14:38,958
that isn't one train less
for the Germans,

767
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:41,833
it means the French will go without.

768
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:45,374
When a power station or a dam
is bombed,

769
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:50,333
when saboteurs blow up a transformer
or cut power cables,

770
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:55,083
French workers go idle,
French housewives lack electricity,

771
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:58,416
French craftsmen
have to down tools...

772
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:04,958
- Wait a second.
- What?

773
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,916
I'll check we weren't followed.

774
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:48,666
Hello, Mrs. Elek.

775
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,874
This is Mélinée, my wife.

776
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:53,791
Missak talks a lot about you!

777
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:57,124
- Is that lie true?
- I never lie, unfortunately.

778
01:15:57,292 --> 01:15:59,833
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Of course!

779
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,874
- Is Thomas here?
- I'll fetch him. Sit down.

780
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,041
Thomas!

781
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,749
Hello. You want to see me?

782
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:28,041
I think I'll get
her stuffed chicken recipe.

783
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,541
Sit down.

784
01:16:31,209 --> 01:16:32,666
Was that a password?

785
01:16:33,709 --> 01:16:36,249
No. I need to talk to you alone.

786
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:38,291
- Did you mention me?
- Yes.

787
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:42,791
As group chief, I want you with me.
But it wasn't easy.

788
01:16:42,959 --> 01:16:43,708
Thank you.

789
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:46,624
My only worry is your parents.

790
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:48,583
They're not a worry.

791
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:49,458
Are you sure?

792
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:51,708
They don't want to know.

793
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:55,166
I told them
you were teaching me chess.

794
01:16:57,167 --> 01:17:00,541
You and Missak make a lovely couple.

795
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:03,458
I'd like to meet your husband.

796
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:06,583
He's a real bear.
He reads all day long.

797
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:10,041
He's read Missak's poems.
He found them moving.

798
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:13,708
Meet Boczov tomorrow afternoon
at 5 sharp,

799
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:17,541
at the corner
of Rues Ternaux and Oberkampf.

800
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:21,916
Don't wait more than five minutes.
Ever.

801
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:25,791
If he doesn't show,
go back the next day at 5.

802
01:17:25,959 --> 01:17:28,916
If he still isn't there,
he's been arrested.

803
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:30,791
- Got that?
- Yes.

804
01:17:30,959 --> 01:17:32,291
Watch carefully.

805
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:37,166
The knight is protected
by two pawns. We work in threes.

806
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:40,958
One acts, the other two defend him.

807
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:44,333
I hope this war won't last.
What do you think?

808
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,458
We must fight to end it one day.

809
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,666
You sound like Tommy.

810
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,666
I know why Missak
has come to see him.

811
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,583
I prefer it this way.

812
01:17:57,834 --> 01:18:00,874
On his own,
he'll do something really stupid.

813
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:03,666
I'm glad he's being taken in hand.

814
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,874
But don't tell him that.
He has to think

815
01:18:08,042 --> 01:18:10,124
we have our heads in the clouds.

816
01:18:57,959 --> 01:18:59,333
See the car?

817
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:02,374
That's Saas.

818
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,874
You know Patriciu.

819
01:19:05,042 --> 01:19:07,041
He was at the restaurant.

820
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:12,124
The one on the bike is Cristea.

821
01:19:13,834 --> 01:19:16,374
I led them all in Spain

822
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:18,249
against the Francists.

823
01:19:22,417 --> 01:19:25,166
There's a Sten under the vegetables.

824
01:19:25,334 --> 01:19:26,583
I know that one.

825
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,708
An English submachine gun.

826
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:37,374
Every morning, a Wehrmacht unit
relieves the guards at Renault.

827
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:40,874
- Olga scouted it out.
- A motorbike opens the way?

828
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:45,583
From time to time with a sidecar,
never on Monday.

829
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:49,541
If it's there, I step in as back-up.

830
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:54,541
Here's the bus...

831
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:56,374
It's like clockwork.

832
01:19:56,875 --> 01:20:01,041
He moves the old lady.
No innocent victims...

833
01:20:01,209 --> 01:20:04,083
And we avoid any unnecessary risks.

834
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:09,249
We must be precise.

835
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:13,499
We have to stay alive, Thomas.

836
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:48,708
Thomas?

837
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:50,166
Yes...

838
01:20:53,042 --> 01:20:54,916
Why are you up so late?

839
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:57,291
I told you to wear a scarf.

840
01:20:57,459 --> 01:21:00,208
I forgot. You aren't in bed?

841
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:02,624
I was waiting up for you.

842
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,999
If you're here, it went well.

843
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:07,708
I can't say.

844
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:09,291
I'm not asking.

845
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:12,541
I'm with you, that's all.

846
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:15,541
Is Dad too?

847
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,541
He's afraid for you.

848
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:21,541
No sense in worrying him even more.

849
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,124
Go to bed, son.

850
01:21:41,084 --> 01:21:42,249
Here we go.

851
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:50,333
Soldiers from the barracks
come here to drink, sing

852
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:54,666
and get laid. There are at least
20 or 30 in there.

853
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,041
- Only Krauts?
- A mix, but a stinking mix.

854
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:05,291
Rayman, you're with me
as second back-up.

855
01:22:07,459 --> 01:22:10,874
Narek, first back-up,
at the bottom of the steps.

856
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:18,041
Celestino, go in, toss the pineapple
and come back out.

857
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:22,124
- Don't I have time to get laid?
- Or to talk crap! Go.

858
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:57,208
What's he up to?

859
01:22:57,459 --> 01:22:58,291
Go on...

860
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:10,208
Why isn't it going off?

861
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:15,083
What the hell has he done?

862
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,916
- I couldn't do it.
- Why not?

863
01:23:28,084 --> 01:23:30,916
The place is full of women.
I can't do it.

864
01:23:31,084 --> 01:23:34,166
One wasn't even 18,
as pretty as a picture...

865
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:36,749
She had this dress...
and a lovely smile.

866
01:23:36,917 --> 01:23:37,749
Sorry.

867
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,916
What's going on?

868
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,291
- I'll do it!
- Pull out. That's an order!

869
01:23:47,459 --> 01:23:49,999
I'm disobeying.
You can dump me now!

870
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:52,249
Marcel, come back!

871
01:23:57,875 --> 01:24:00,833
- He'll pay for this.
- Maybe right away.

872
01:24:32,084 --> 01:24:34,041
Where's the goddam pin?

873
01:24:41,417 --> 01:24:43,291
I'm getting cramp.

874
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:45,708
You a pain, Rayman!

875
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:47,833
Some things you can't do!

876
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,249
Like I said.

877
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:53,083
Very bad work. Very bad...

878
01:24:54,792 --> 01:24:57,499
There were innocent girls.
We can't do that!

879
01:24:57,959 --> 01:25:00,124
Sure, we'll talk about it later.

880
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,583
Hurry, I can't hold it!

881
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:21,083
What are you doing in my sewing box?

882
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,916
I need a safety pin, a needle,
anything...

883
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:26,583
Hello, Mélinée.

884
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,458
Come over here!

885
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:32,749
Don't move.

886
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:37,916
Let go. Slowly...

887
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:43,708
Good evening, ma'am.

888
01:25:46,084 --> 01:25:48,541
It's true, she had a lovely smile.

889
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:50,041
Listen to him!

890
01:25:50,959 --> 01:25:53,666
What happened
to the bloodthirsty killer?

891
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:50,249
Know what time it is?

892
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:51,958
I can tell the time!

893
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:53,999
I'm waiting for your father

894
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:58,374
because there's no sense
in waiting for you.

895
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,666
You only do as you please.

896
01:27:07,417 --> 01:27:08,541
You stink of drink!

897
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:12,291
- Where have you been?
- At a brothel.

898
01:27:12,459 --> 01:27:15,499
Stop saying such nasty things.
Stop it!

899
01:27:16,084 --> 01:27:18,249
- Is Simon asleep?
- Of course!

900
01:27:18,959 --> 01:27:21,124
I don't want you waking him up.

901
01:27:22,292 --> 01:27:24,041
Go to bed, Mum.

902
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:29,458
And stop waiting for Dad.

903
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:31,708
He'll never come back.

904
01:27:32,042 --> 01:27:34,958
You want to kill me too, is that it?

905
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,708
No, I want you to live.

906
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:40,041
As long as possible.

907
01:27:45,584 --> 01:27:50,249
Near Chalon-sur-Saône, 18 dead
and 32 wounded in an attack.

908
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:55,708
In Grenoble, a terrific explosion
causes 1,500 casualties.

909
01:27:55,959 --> 01:28:00,124
In Bourg-en-Bresse, pillaging
during General Dobenet's funeral.

910
01:28:00,292 --> 01:28:04,083
This is the work of foreign
terrorists, nearly all Jews,

911
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:08,708
Armenians, Polish Jews,
Red Spaniards...

912
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:16,208
We shall answer violence
with fair but merciless repression.

913
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:17,458
Good morning.

914
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,416
It won't rain today!

915
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:22,124
- Goodbye.
- Have a good day!

916
01:28:49,459 --> 01:28:50,624
Police!

917
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:52,624
Hands up!

918
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,541
This is good.

919
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:19,124
It's very good, Pujol.

920
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:21,166
Quite a haul thanks to you.

921
01:29:22,084 --> 01:29:24,833
Their forged papers are a good lead.

922
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,291
We searched that Forestier's place.

923
01:29:28,459 --> 01:29:29,583
We found this.

924
01:29:30,209 --> 01:29:32,458
Not flour, it's potassium chlorate.

925
01:29:34,209 --> 01:29:37,416
Well, I'm delighted
to have been of service.

926
01:29:37,584 --> 01:29:38,624
Tell me, Pujol...

927
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,499
Do you like the 11th?

928
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:44,374
It's humdrum.

929
01:29:44,959 --> 01:29:46,624
You deserve better.

930
01:29:47,334 --> 01:29:49,499
Would you like to join my unit?

931
01:29:50,584 --> 01:29:52,124
My chief may not agree.

932
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:53,708
Hennequin?

933
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:01,166
A good man for the municipal police
but lacking vision.

934
01:30:01,834 --> 01:30:04,041
I'll see the Interior Minister.

935
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:07,333
A rapid promotion for you.

936
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,291
I'm a chief superintendent at 34!
Beat that.

937
01:30:11,334 --> 01:30:13,583
Here's what I tell
my hunting dogs...

938
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:17,208
You'll get shot
more often than congratulated.

939
01:30:17,584 --> 01:30:18,874
It's your choice.

940
01:30:20,959 --> 01:30:22,249
I'll think it over.

941
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:23,958
Don't take too long.

942
01:30:25,959 --> 01:30:28,041
Let me show you the basement.

943
01:30:28,209 --> 01:30:29,208
The basement?

944
01:30:29,542 --> 01:30:32,124
I want you to meet
Daime and Barrachin.

945
01:30:35,042 --> 01:30:39,708
Concerning your district...
from June 7th, in occupied France,

946
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:43,999
all Jews over the age of six
must wear the yellow star.

947
01:30:44,709 --> 01:30:48,999
They must report to the police.
You have better things to do.

948
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:52,208
Such as the big clean
planned for July.

949
01:30:52,792 --> 01:30:54,624
We'll talk about that later.

950
01:30:58,959 --> 01:31:01,083
Boys, meet Inspector Pujol.

951
01:31:02,584 --> 01:31:04,541
He helped catch these bastards.

952
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,124
- Congratulations!
- Bravo!

953
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:13,416
Hold him tight.

954
01:31:29,709 --> 01:31:31,499
- Where are we at?
- Nowhere.

955
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:34,374
This scum faints every five minutes.

956
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,333
It's slowing us down.

957
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,583
Listen carefully, swine.

958
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:41,916
We'll strip you,

959
01:31:42,084 --> 01:31:44,083
lie you between two tables

960
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,916
and crush your balls.

961
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:49,624
You understand French?

962
01:31:56,709 --> 01:31:57,583
The other two?

963
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:00,874
Resting. We'll get back to them
in an hour.

964
01:32:01,167 --> 01:32:03,958
- I have to go, sir.
- You know the way.

965
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:05,374
Strip him!

966
01:32:07,459 --> 01:32:08,708
Hold him tight.

967
01:32:40,834 --> 01:32:41,999
Look...

968
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:48,291
This the secondary track
from the Gare du Nord to Verneuil.

969
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:52,458
The Germans reopened
six months ago.

970
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:55,749
We get here at 8:30 p.m.,
we hide...

971
01:32:56,584 --> 01:32:59,374
and we don't move until midnight

972
01:32:59,667 --> 01:33:01,416
when we unwrap our gear.

973
01:33:01,584 --> 01:33:03,541
Cops patrol the area.

974
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:07,833
Expecting someone?

975
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,374
No. Don't move.

976
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:11,499
Who is it?

977
01:33:11,709 --> 01:33:12,916
Missak.

978
01:33:15,542 --> 01:33:16,583
Come in.

979
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:21,333
- What's wrong?
- Don't keep a gun here, I said.

980
01:33:23,292 --> 01:33:24,666
What's the problem?

981
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,624
They got your pals,
Patriciu, Sass and Cristea.

982
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:31,874
No...

983
01:33:33,709 --> 01:33:35,208
That's impossible!

984
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:36,833
Pack, we have to hide.

985
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,666
Seine Swimming Championship

986
01:33:56,459 --> 01:33:57,708
On your marks!

987
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,958
Go, Michel!

988
01:34:18,209 --> 01:34:19,999
- Go, Michel!
- That's good!

989
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:26,458
We won!

990
01:34:37,584 --> 01:34:39,124
Brilliant!

991
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:41,249
Michel Rougemont!

992
01:34:41,834 --> 01:34:46,541
Lane 5, Seine champion!

993
01:34:53,959 --> 01:34:56,749
- Mr. Rougemont, how old are you?
- 19.

994
01:34:56,917 --> 01:35:01,708
You're a prime example of athletic
and determined French youth.

995
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:04,541
The Marshal would be proud.
Any comment?

996
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:11,749
I've broken my own record
and I hope to go further.

997
01:35:12,459 --> 01:35:14,916
Bravo and keep going, young man.

998
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:16,416
Bravo. Really.

999
01:36:31,542 --> 01:36:33,833
- Do you think Mum...
- Shut up!

1000
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:38,083
Mum!

1001
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:57,083
Speak, say something.

1002
01:36:57,459 --> 01:36:59,499
- I'm so ashamed...
- Stop it.

1003
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,624
I was at the grocer's
when they came.

1004
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,666
Mrs. Lavet hid me in her cellar.

1005
01:37:05,834 --> 01:37:07,666
We mustn't stay here.

1006
01:37:07,834 --> 01:37:09,583
Where on earth can we go?

1007
01:37:11,375 --> 01:37:13,083
Let things cool down.

1008
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:16,583
When the escapees
resume their lives,

1009
01:37:17,042 --> 01:37:19,749
we'll serve them a second helping.

1010
01:37:21,709 --> 01:37:23,374
Look at those two.

1011
01:37:24,459 --> 01:37:25,999
They don't have stars.

1012
01:37:26,167 --> 01:37:27,541
What does that prove?

1013
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:30,791
You're right, nothing.

1014
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,124
Hold your nose
and check their dicks.

1015
01:37:35,292 --> 01:37:38,541
No, I'm worn out.
We have our quota of Yids.

1016
01:37:38,875 --> 01:37:41,166
6,000 in Drancy,
7,000 at the stadium.

1017
01:37:41,334 --> 01:37:42,749
It's a fine score.

1018
01:37:49,292 --> 01:37:51,416
First, stay away
from your old street.

1019
01:37:51,792 --> 01:37:56,499
Second, we've rented you a place
on Boulevard Soult, at number 83a.

1020
01:37:57,167 --> 01:37:59,541
Move there
with your mother and Simon.

1021
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:04,958
Third, stop screwing up.
And that's an order.

1022
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:05,958
What did I do?

1023
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:08,541
A German soldier yesterday.

1024
01:38:08,709 --> 01:38:10,624
A policeman two days ago.

1025
01:38:10,792 --> 01:38:12,458
- He was doing an ID check.
- Listen.

1026
01:38:13,209 --> 01:38:14,874
Obey or we cut you loose.

1027
01:38:16,042 --> 01:38:17,291
You're not Jewish...

1028
01:38:17,459 --> 01:38:21,374
Know what Hitler said
in a Reichstag speech in 1936?

1029
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:24,624
He said,
"Who remembers the Armenians now?"

1030
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,416
My family vanished a long time ago.

1031
01:38:33,459 --> 01:38:34,083
Sorry.

1032
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:42,208
We'll change the mail drop
next week.

1033
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:44,499
Money for the month

1034
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,749
and bread stamps too.

1035
01:38:57,459 --> 01:38:59,124
How much do you make?

1036
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:04,749
1,600 francs like you. A married man
needs children to earn more.

1037
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:12,041
There's no future in the Resistance.

1038
01:40:30,542 --> 01:40:31,999
What are you reading?

1039
01:40:33,334 --> 01:40:34,499
"Les Misérables".

1040
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:38,749
- You live on this yard?
- Yes. Over there.

1041
01:40:39,292 --> 01:40:40,708
Why don't you go in?

1042
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:42,833
You'll catch a chill.

1043
01:40:44,167 --> 01:40:46,041
I'm afraid alone at home.

1044
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:55,833
Where are your parents?

1045
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,374
In Drancy.
I haven't heard from them for weeks.

1046
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:02,249
- Take off the star.
- I can't.

1047
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,999
It's obligatory for Jews.

1048
01:41:05,167 --> 01:41:06,999
There are always exceptions.

1049
01:41:07,792 --> 01:41:09,708
- But the police...
- I am the police.

1050
01:41:10,917 --> 01:41:14,458
My name's Pujol.
Inspector René Pujol.

1051
01:41:17,459 --> 01:41:19,499
You stitched it on well!

1052
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:26,124
- It's ages since I had lemonade.
- Good.

1053
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:31,208
Listen, I'll try to find out
about your parents.

1054
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:33,666
- What's your name?
- Stern.

1055
01:41:34,542 --> 01:41:35,708
Monique Stern.

1056
01:41:36,459 --> 01:41:38,999
Monique... That's a pretty name.

1057
01:41:40,209 --> 01:41:41,416
Pretty like you.

1058
01:41:42,584 --> 01:41:46,333
Why don't you arrest me
so I can be with my parents?

1059
01:41:47,042 --> 01:41:48,624
You'll see them again.

1060
01:42:15,334 --> 01:42:19,749
Obersturmführer Raffenbach,
I'm sorry they wouldn't say a word.

1061
01:42:20,209 --> 01:42:21,958
Not even their names.

1062
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:28,208
I know your methods, superintendent.
I know you did the maximum.

1063
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:30,291
The SS could learn from you.

1064
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:33,208
- Don't exaggerate.
- I'm not.

1065
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:34,999
I'm impressed.

1066
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:38,708
Our collaboration exceeds our hopes.

1067
01:42:39,917 --> 01:42:43,041
Your Police Minister, René Bousquet,
has demanded

1068
01:42:43,209 --> 01:42:46,249
something Himmler never dared ask
your troops.

1069
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:49,916
The stadium round-up
is a fine success for France.

1070
01:42:50,417 --> 01:42:52,083
Not one German took part.

1071
01:43:07,709 --> 01:43:11,791
Allow me to invite you to dinner,
my dear Fernand.

1072
01:43:16,417 --> 01:43:19,416
Clitch blew his brains out
to avoid arrest.

1073
01:43:19,584 --> 01:43:21,083
He was a good man.

1074
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,291
We must be even more vigilant.

1075
01:43:23,834 --> 01:43:25,624
You don't sound convinced.

1076
01:43:25,792 --> 01:43:28,249
- The comrades are exhausted.
- And you?

1077
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:29,624
Me?

1078
01:43:31,042 --> 01:43:35,083
I'm eating soup with the woman
I love. I can't complain.

1079
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,916
I have good news.

1080
01:43:57,084 --> 01:43:59,416
- Is it true?
- Of course it's true.

1081
01:43:59,792 --> 01:44:04,416
They're well, the food's good and
you can write to them through me.

1082
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:09,249
You can even send parcels. I know
an officer who'll get them in.

1083
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:10,874
Thank you, Mr. Pujol!

1084
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:13,124
You can call me René.

1085
01:44:14,542 --> 01:44:16,791
You can even give me a kiss too.

1086
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:19,083
Thank you!

1087
01:44:22,167 --> 01:44:24,041
Know how you could thank me?

1088
01:44:29,459 --> 01:44:31,083
It's very simple.

1089
01:44:35,959 --> 01:44:39,249
We're not getting enough press,
I'm telling you.

1090
01:44:39,917 --> 01:44:42,708
- The command is "mispleased".
- Displeased.

1091
01:44:45,417 --> 01:44:48,291
We've thought hard.
To keep your command,

1092
01:44:48,459 --> 01:44:51,791
we need spectacular results
in the coming weeks.

1093
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:53,541
Spectacular how?

1094
01:44:53,709 --> 01:44:56,874
People
aren't talking about us enough.

1095
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:02,249
So the Germans don't shoot
enough hostages after each attack?

1096
01:45:02,417 --> 01:45:03,666
I mean the press.

1097
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,124
The Resistance
has to make headlines!

1098
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,833
The Paris-Cherbourg train

1099
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,874
will have 1,500 German soldiers
on it when we derail it.

1100
01:45:14,042 --> 01:45:18,124
Come up with something better
or you're out!

1101
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:31,958
I knew you'd be here.

1102
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:39,458
The yellow star's gone?

1103
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:40,874
Yes.

1104
01:45:41,584 --> 01:45:42,874
For good.

1105
01:45:43,834 --> 01:45:45,291
You hit the jackpot?

1106
01:45:45,459 --> 01:45:48,874
You could say that.
I've met someone.

1107
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:49,916
Who?

1108
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:51,708
A friend.

1109
01:45:54,042 --> 01:45:55,458
What does he do?

1110
01:45:56,209 --> 01:45:57,833
He's in business.

1111
01:45:58,917 --> 01:46:01,374
- Shady business?
- Not at all.

1112
01:46:01,667 --> 01:46:04,791
I don't really know.
He does as he wants.

1113
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:10,541
- Sleeping with him?
- He's a friend!

1114
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:14,499
He knows people.
I can write to my parents.

1115
01:46:14,667 --> 01:46:17,166
- Your parents?
- I even sent a parcel today.

1116
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:18,249
To Auschwitz?

1117
01:46:19,292 --> 01:46:20,916
What are you saying?

1118
01:46:23,125 --> 01:46:25,541
Your parents left Drancy long ago.

1119
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,833
For Poland. In cattle wagons.

1120
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,541
Your friend's taking you for a ride.

1121
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:35,083
You're so evil.

1122
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:37,624
I came to tell you I still love you

1123
01:46:38,375 --> 01:46:39,374
and you...

1124
01:46:45,042 --> 01:46:48,333
- You have to forget her.
- You know about girls now?

1125
01:46:58,042 --> 01:47:00,791
- How are your parents?
- They're living in a cellar.

1126
01:47:00,959 --> 01:47:03,541
Dad planned it
without telling anyone.

1127
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:07,249
He's fine with his books.
It's less fun for Mum.

1128
01:47:07,417 --> 01:47:09,958
- And Marthe and Béla?
- They read all day.

1129
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:11,333
And you?

1130
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,749
I'm ok. I manage on my own.

1131
01:47:13,917 --> 01:47:17,124
- 45 Germans down on Quai de Valmy.
- I wasn't alone.

1132
01:47:17,292 --> 01:47:18,291
Narek told me

1133
01:47:18,459 --> 01:47:22,916
you shot two Krauts who were
chasing you on the elevated metro.

1134
01:47:23,959 --> 01:47:24,749
That takes guts.

1135
01:47:24,917 --> 01:47:26,791
You'd have done the same.

1136
01:47:27,459 --> 01:47:29,416
- For confession?
- Yes, for this gentleman.

1137
01:47:29,584 --> 01:47:32,208
Father! I was here first!

1138
01:47:39,167 --> 01:47:40,749
What's on your mind?

1139
01:47:43,834 --> 01:47:45,791
I have to meet someone.

1140
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:47,583
Who?

1141
01:47:58,542 --> 01:48:00,124
We've hardly talked.

1142
01:48:02,667 --> 01:48:04,208
It's better that way.

1143
01:48:05,459 --> 01:48:07,916
I'm just good for making love?

1144
01:48:08,917 --> 01:48:10,166
I didn't say that.

1145
01:48:14,084 --> 01:48:15,999
Why don't you trust me?

1146
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:19,041
I don't trust anyone these days.

1147
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,708
I want to fight with you.

1148
01:48:22,917 --> 01:48:24,208
What do you mean?

1149
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,916
I'm not stupid.

1150
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:30,333
I want to avenge my parents
with the Communist Youth.

1151
01:48:31,917 --> 01:48:34,458
Nothing to do with me.
Ask Krazu.

1152
01:48:37,084 --> 01:48:40,999
I last saw him before the round-up.
Everyone's avoiding me.

1153
01:48:41,584 --> 01:48:43,416
I'll set up a meeting.

1154
01:48:44,209 --> 01:48:45,583
I promise.

1155
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:51,999
Still seeing your protector?

1156
01:48:52,167 --> 01:48:53,041
No.

1157
01:48:54,167 --> 01:48:56,249
You were right, he's a bastard.

1158
01:49:11,292 --> 01:49:12,874
You want to screw her?

1159
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,583
She's very cute.

1160
01:49:16,042 --> 01:49:18,208
Jewish girls freeze me up.

1161
01:49:18,584 --> 01:49:22,833
You wouldn't turn your nose up
at her if she was in your bed!

1162
01:49:23,709 --> 01:49:25,958
Ask my wife what she thinks.

1163
01:49:27,042 --> 01:49:29,833
General Julius Ritter
is a prime target.

1164
01:49:30,542 --> 01:49:34,874
Last year, he sent
600,000 French workers to Germany.

1165
01:49:35,042 --> 01:49:36,208
What's he like?

1166
01:49:37,667 --> 01:49:40,291
A big general with his petty habits.

1167
01:49:41,292 --> 01:49:44,874
Every morning,
his chauffeur picks him up at 8:45.

1168
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:47,624
We could attack then

1169
01:49:47,792 --> 01:49:51,874
or in the Bois de Boulogne.
He rides there every Sunday.

1170
01:49:52,042 --> 01:49:54,999
The Bois.
I'll get him at the polo ground.

1171
01:49:55,292 --> 01:49:56,666
And I look on?

1172
01:49:56,834 --> 01:49:58,708
No, you're back-up.

1173
01:49:59,709 --> 01:50:02,249
- Which one shoots best?
- Don't start!

1174
01:50:02,667 --> 01:50:03,874
It's my decision.

1175
01:50:06,042 --> 01:50:07,666
We have to split up now.

1176
01:50:08,792 --> 01:50:11,208
We leave at three-minute intervals.

1177
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:12,666
Marcel, go first.

1178
01:50:49,917 --> 01:50:52,291
Marcel says
you want to work with us?

1179
01:50:52,459 --> 01:50:53,583
How about a hello?

1180
01:50:54,167 --> 01:50:55,083
Some other time.

1181
01:50:56,709 --> 01:50:57,666
Not very nice...

1182
01:50:58,125 --> 01:50:59,999
It's the times we live in.

1183
01:51:00,667 --> 01:51:03,874
- Marcel's wrong to be sweet on you.
- You're jealous?

1184
01:51:06,042 --> 01:51:06,916
I have to go.

1185
01:51:07,084 --> 01:51:09,124
I came here for nothing?

1186
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:12,249
Where did you get the earrings?

1187
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:14,749
And the fur?

1188
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:18,999
- You've met someone.
- I've stopped seeing him.

1189
01:51:19,459 --> 01:51:20,416
You're a whore?

1190
01:51:22,292 --> 01:51:23,874
He was too good for me.

1191
01:51:24,042 --> 01:51:25,958
Get him to buy you dinner.

1192
01:51:27,084 --> 01:51:27,874
Why?

1193
01:51:28,042 --> 01:51:31,291
Before we decide,
we need to know who you see.

1194
01:51:33,875 --> 01:51:35,291
Come back tomorrow

1195
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:36,958
at the same time.

1196
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:18,291
We've got him. Henri Krasucki.

1197
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:21,333
They all come from the same street.

1198
01:52:22,084 --> 01:52:26,124
A hive of terrorists,
a real shtetl, Jews and Commies.

1199
01:52:27,209 --> 01:52:29,458
All lying low since the round-up.

1200
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:32,541
Want us to arrest this Krasucki?

1201
01:52:32,709 --> 01:52:33,833
No, don't.

1202
01:52:35,084 --> 01:52:39,416
One suspect leads to another.
That's how we trace the network.

1203
01:52:40,292 --> 01:52:42,208
Go slowly, chief inspector.

1204
01:52:43,584 --> 01:52:44,499
Chief inspector?

1205
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:48,666
I promised you swift promotion.
You have it.

1206
01:52:50,834 --> 01:52:52,499
They're doubling our numbers.

1207
01:52:52,959 --> 01:52:54,416
Rottée has transferred you.

1208
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:52,124
Get L'Œuvre!

1209
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:56,083
General Ritter killed by terrorists!
Germany in mourning!

1210
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:59,374
Get L'Œuvre! General Ritter...
L'Œuvre, sir!

1211
01:54:01,875 --> 01:54:05,166
"A day of national mourning
throughout Germany.

1212
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,333
"Himmler asks Oberg to annihilate
all terrorists.

1213
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:13,416
"The army of the shadows
steps into the light." Happy now?

1214
01:54:13,584 --> 01:54:14,874
Well done, Missak.

1215
01:54:15,542 --> 01:54:18,874
But you must be a lot more cautious
from now on.

1216
01:54:21,917 --> 01:54:23,666
Here's the payroll.

1217
01:54:25,709 --> 01:54:30,624
Violence, pillage and murder
are not French words.

1218
01:54:30,792 --> 01:54:33,166
Those who have stayed here

1219
01:54:33,334 --> 01:54:37,333
have retained a better idea
of French values than the immigrants

1220
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:39,374
who sell themselves

1221
01:54:39,542 --> 01:54:41,916
and auction off their country.

1222
01:54:42,167 --> 01:54:45,374
Over to you, Pujol.
You have a free hand.

1223
01:54:46,334 --> 01:54:50,541
But keep it secret.
Walls have ears, even at police HQ.

1224
01:54:53,292 --> 01:54:54,041
Pull him out.

1225
01:54:58,042 --> 01:55:00,249
Pujol, one of your colleagues.

1226
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:02,458
Mathelin...

1227
01:55:03,209 --> 01:55:05,874
A good cop, a good father,

1228
01:55:06,084 --> 01:55:08,166
well on his way to promotion.

1229
01:55:08,917 --> 01:55:12,708
But working for Bolshevik partisans
for two years now.

1230
01:55:23,042 --> 01:55:24,666
You have leads?

1231
01:55:24,834 --> 01:55:25,999
Pujol...

1232
01:55:26,209 --> 01:55:30,583
We've been tailing a certain
Marcel Rayman, a Polish Jew,

1233
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:32,333
and he's likely to...

1234
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,124
I want proof and results!

1235
01:55:34,292 --> 01:55:36,583
All right, we'll make arrests.

1236
01:55:36,875 --> 01:55:39,333
We won't disappoint General Oberg.

1237
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:43,083
General Oberg demands
a large scale round-up!

1238
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:45,833
We'll hold a show trial.

1239
01:55:46,250 --> 01:55:48,958
We must terrorize the terrorists!

1240
01:55:56,917 --> 01:55:58,499
Forget the others.

1241
01:55:59,917 --> 01:56:01,833
But you promised to save Marcel.

1242
01:56:03,209 --> 01:56:05,458
You can't just leave.

1243
01:56:06,667 --> 01:56:08,291
Stay a while longer...

1244
01:56:09,375 --> 01:56:10,083
my honey.

1245
01:56:13,209 --> 01:56:16,458
You said if I slept with you,
Marcel would be safe.

1246
01:56:17,084 --> 01:56:18,333
We've done that.

1247
01:56:19,209 --> 01:56:20,541
Did you like it?

1248
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,541
If you want more, take care of him.

1249
01:56:38,334 --> 01:56:41,333
Mrs. Frydman?
Are you Marcel Rayman's aunt?

1250
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:44,583
- A cup of chicory?
- No, thank you.

1251
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:48,999
Mrs. Frydman, your nephews
are about to be arrested.

1252
01:56:49,167 --> 01:56:53,458
I don't know where they are
but hurry and tell them to hide.

1253
01:56:53,625 --> 01:56:55,291
There's no time to lose.

1254
01:56:55,584 --> 01:56:59,083
You understand? The partisans
are dropping like flies.

1255
01:56:59,917 --> 01:57:02,624
Marcel has to hide or he's had it.

1256
01:57:02,792 --> 01:57:04,916
Thank you, inspector.

1257
01:57:09,084 --> 01:57:09,874
You're going?

1258
01:57:10,042 --> 01:57:12,791
Certainly not.
It reeks of a trap.

1259
01:57:14,542 --> 01:57:15,541
You're sure?

1260
01:57:15,709 --> 01:57:20,499
Why would he want to save Marcel?
Whatever for?

1261
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:23,291
It doesn't seem right.

1262
01:57:42,334 --> 01:57:43,541
Run, Simon!

1263
01:57:44,417 --> 01:57:45,291
Run!

1264
01:59:36,459 --> 01:59:37,499
Wait...

1265
01:59:42,584 --> 01:59:45,791
My name is... Petra.

1266
01:59:46,875 --> 01:59:48,166
There we are.

1267
01:59:48,917 --> 01:59:51,416
I knew we had found
someone important

1268
01:59:52,250 --> 01:59:53,791
and sensitive.

1269
01:59:54,084 --> 01:59:55,916
Get him a glass of water.

1270
01:59:56,875 --> 01:59:58,374
Mr. Petra...

1271
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:02,083
Here are a few photos.

1272
02:00:03,084 --> 02:00:06,208
We know this one is Marcel Rayman,
isn't he?

1273
02:00:11,167 --> 02:00:11,999
Yes.

1274
02:00:12,417 --> 02:00:14,458
General Ritter's killer, right?

1275
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,833
Yes.

1276
02:00:19,459 --> 02:00:23,124
You see, Pujol,
there's no need to rush.

1277
02:00:23,542 --> 02:00:26,291
Raffenbach and Oberg
will be pleased.

1278
02:00:27,292 --> 02:00:30,249
This one is known as Gilles Estain.

1279
02:00:30,834 --> 02:00:32,541
Colonel Gilles.

1280
02:00:33,959 --> 02:00:37,083
The top commander
with the partisans.

1281
02:00:37,417 --> 02:00:39,333
His real name

1282
02:00:39,709 --> 02:00:41,833
is Joseph Epstein.

1283
02:00:46,875 --> 02:00:48,166
And this one?

1284
02:00:50,834 --> 02:00:53,416
Missak Manouchian.

1285
02:00:54,209 --> 02:00:56,374
The head of the group.

1286
02:01:45,875 --> 02:01:47,374
- No one followed you?
- No.

1287
02:01:47,542 --> 02:01:48,833
- You're sure?
- Yes.

1288
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,291
I saw two men in the café.
I think they've left.

1289
02:01:52,959 --> 02:01:55,499
- Got the package?
- Yes. Here.

1290
02:02:11,334 --> 02:02:12,666
Leave it on.

1291
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,708
Go and stay with Cristina.
Come back tomorrow.

1292
02:02:19,709 --> 02:02:24,458
If this rag's still here,
run and drop everything.

1293
02:02:24,834 --> 02:02:26,791
- And you?
- I'm meeting someone.

1294
02:02:26,959 --> 02:02:29,374
Tell me who you're seeing for once.

1295
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,374
Colonel Gilles.

1296
02:02:45,375 --> 02:02:47,666
He's here. He's waiting up there.

1297
02:03:35,417 --> 02:03:37,083
Hands up!

1298
02:04:04,709 --> 02:04:06,958
"My whole soul is on my lips

1299
02:04:07,125 --> 02:04:10,124
"And I cannot communicate
with those I love

1300
02:04:10,625 --> 02:04:13,874
"Countless duties
jostle and assail me

1301
02:04:14,042 --> 02:04:15,999
"I don't know which one to pursue

1302
02:04:17,084 --> 02:04:19,291
"I'm thirsty for science,
"Thirsty for art

1303
02:04:19,459 --> 02:04:21,833
"Thirsty for love,
thirsty for life"

1304
02:04:47,459 --> 02:04:49,166
You still won't talk?

1305
02:04:54,084 --> 02:04:55,166
Nothing to say?

1306
02:04:55,334 --> 02:04:56,083
No.

1307
02:04:56,875 --> 02:04:58,166
Are you sure?

1308
02:04:58,709 --> 02:05:00,041
- Yes.
- Sure?

1309
02:05:10,584 --> 02:05:12,499
Has anyone talked?

1310
02:05:15,584 --> 02:05:16,499
No.

1311
02:05:30,459 --> 02:05:32,041
Here, have a seat.

1312
02:05:33,792 --> 02:05:36,249
Be nice to us, we'll be nice to you.

1313
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:38,041
I'll be right back.

1314
02:05:52,417 --> 02:05:53,749
I know him...

1315
02:05:54,375 --> 02:05:56,833
Shut up. Nobody knows anyone here.

1316
02:05:57,917 --> 02:05:59,749
I'm Marcel Rayman's brother.

1317
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:04,166
You're Simon? How old are you?

1318
02:06:04,334 --> 02:06:05,541
Fifteen soon.

1319
02:07:13,834 --> 02:07:15,291
Can you let me in?

1320
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,083
I've been thinking of you,
Mrs. Mélinée.

1321
02:07:26,334 --> 02:07:27,791
Thank you, Mrs. Viard.

1322
02:07:47,459 --> 02:07:49,124
It's Mélinée, Mrs. Elek.

1323
02:07:55,042 --> 02:07:56,374
Hello, Mélinée.

1324
02:07:59,334 --> 02:08:00,499
Come in.

1325
02:08:01,334 --> 02:08:02,624
Don't get up, Mr. Elek.

1326
02:08:02,792 --> 02:08:05,166
If I don't move, I'll get rusty.

1327
02:08:07,292 --> 02:08:08,458
Any news?

1328
02:08:11,250 --> 02:08:14,458
Mr. Darnand, congratulations!

1329
02:08:14,834 --> 02:08:16,916
General Oberg is expecting us.

1330
02:08:17,209 --> 02:08:20,416
What we want is a trial
that will cause a stir,

1331
02:08:20,584 --> 02:08:22,291
to mark public opinion.

1332
02:08:23,292 --> 02:08:25,374
French patriots need to know

1333
02:08:25,542 --> 02:08:29,083
that the Jews and Communists
who led their country to war

1334
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:33,958
are dangerous terrorists
in the pay of England and the USSR.

1335
02:08:34,334 --> 02:08:35,958
Minister Darnand

1336
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:38,083
has designed a brochure.

1337
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:42,166
We'll call it "The Army of Crime"
and distribute it all over France.

1338
02:08:42,334 --> 02:08:43,249
Excellent!

1339
02:08:43,584 --> 02:08:46,124
The trial will be held in February

1340
02:08:46,292 --> 02:08:49,833
and they will be executed
immediately after at Mont-Valérien.

1341
02:09:02,792 --> 02:09:04,333
My dear Simon,

1342
02:09:04,834 --> 02:09:07,749
I'm counting on you
to do all I can't.

1343
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,666
Take care. I love you.

1344
02:09:11,417 --> 02:09:12,833
I'm pleased.

1345
02:09:13,959 --> 02:09:17,166
Be happy. Make mother happy.

1346
02:09:17,709 --> 02:09:20,041
I would have if I had lived.

1347
02:09:20,334 --> 02:09:23,249
Live the beautiful and happy life
you'll all have.

1348
02:09:24,334 --> 02:09:27,833
Sorry this letter is so crazy
but I can't stay serious.

1349
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,083
Marcel.

1350
02:09:42,417 --> 02:09:46,208
Members of the press,
this is the full Manouchian group.

1351
02:09:46,375 --> 02:09:48,999
Take a look at these characters!

1352
02:09:49,292 --> 02:09:52,541
Polish, Hungarian and Romanian Jews.

1353
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:55,583
Spanish and Italian Communists too,

1354
02:09:55,750 --> 02:09:59,124
with the leader of their gang,

1355
02:09:59,834 --> 02:10:01,166
an Armenian!

1356
02:10:01,667 --> 02:10:03,708
They claim to be liberators

1357
02:10:04,375 --> 02:10:09,249
but this is the army of crime,
vengeance and hatred.

1358
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:17,833
Generals Raffenbach and Oberg want
posters displayed all over France

1359
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,291
showing
these terrorists' countenances.

1360
02:10:21,459 --> 02:10:22,458
There.

1361
02:10:22,625 --> 02:10:27,583
I'll leave you to do your work
with the sample that we've selected.

1362
02:10:45,584 --> 02:10:47,624
Hold onto that gun.

1363
02:10:47,792 --> 02:10:50,833
You'll need it
when the FFI cut off your balls.

1364
02:10:51,792 --> 02:10:53,791
Shut your mouth, filthy Yid!

The Allies freed them in 1945.

To relate the commitment

02:13:28,167 --> 02:13:30,624
of foreigners
in the French resistance,

1406
02:13:30,792 --> 02:13:32,749
I have had to alter
certain events.

1407
02:13:32,917 --> 02:13:35,166
That was necessary
to recount this modern legend,

to help us live here and now.
