1
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:11,762
<i>Mad about the boy</i>

2
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:13,663
<i>I know it's stupid</i>

3
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:17,135
<i>To be mad about the boy</i>

4
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:20,037
<i>I'm so ashamed of it</i>

5
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:24,441
<i>But must admit
the sleepless nights</i>

6
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:28,312
<i>I've had about the boy</i>

7
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:30,950
<i>Walking down the street</i>

8
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:33,077
Excuse me. Excuse me.

9
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:34,519
So where are you from?

10
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:35,646
Mudgee.

11
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:37,213
A country girl.

12
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,349
I knew it.

13
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:40,086
How?

14
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:41,253
They're always shy.

15
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:43,353
You blushed when
I asked you to dance.

16
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,125
I did not.
It's just hot.

17
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:46,666
Have you a boyfriend?

18
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:47,826
Yes.

19
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:49,563
Oh, no, no,
I had one,

20
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:52,538
but he's in Egypt
or somewhere.

21
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:54,369
Egypt? Well, forget him.

22
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:56,341
He's probably chasing
some dusky maiden...

23
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,071
'round the pyramids by now.

24
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:00,711
Know what they call this dance?

25
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,941
No idea.

26
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:02,983
The Crush.

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,176
Do they?

28
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,446
Well, I'm not
really complaining.

29
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,850
You're so beautiful, Rosemary.

30
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,187
So are you.

31
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:13,988
You can't say that, can you?

32
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:16,859
Men aren't-
I am not beautiful.

33
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,126
Yes, you are.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,533
? I'm feeling quite insane
and young again?

35
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:28,405
? And all because
I'm mad about the boy?

36
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:30,500
We've got everyone
Churchill can spare.

37
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:32,136
Thousands of bloody Australians...

38
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,407
drinking the place dry.

39
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,708
And all to fight tiny little...

40
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:37,148
Japanese chaps wearing spectacles.

41
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:38,446
They're all cross-eyed, you know.

42
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,180
Can't aim their damn guns.

43
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:41,949
At night, they can't see at all.

44
00:02:42,022 --> 00:02:43,922
Do they all have
white sticks and guide dogs?

45
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,016
Phyllis, it's true.
Really.

46
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:48,687
Cyril, remember that
Japanese gardener we had?

47
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,992
He had glasses as thick as-

48
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:52,999
The bottom of a gin bottle?

49
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,659
Yes.

50
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:57,499
It's certainly a fact
their weapons are useless.

51
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:01,029
My Godfather! All they can
make are tin toys...

52
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:03,338
and cameras that don't work.

53
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,004
If you don't mind me saying so-
even if you do-

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,047
I don't think I've ever heard...

55
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:08,945
such a total load of poppycock.

56
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:10,483
They've conquered most of Asia.

57
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:11,882
And those "littleJapanese chaps-"

58
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:13,442
You heard of a place
called Pearl Harbor?

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,320
My dear, Topsy, Adrienne,

60
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,052
Pearl Harbor was a surprise.

61
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:20,525
A sneak attack.

62
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:22,687
We're all ready and waiting for them.

63
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:24,128
I hope you're right.

64
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:28,862
Thanks.

65
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:29,994
Ooh, that one come
on a bit strong, eh?

66
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,298
Sort of. He's nice.

67
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:33,806
I just don't reckon he's
got too much upstairs.

68
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:34,806
Come on, Oggi.

69
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,035
It's what they got downstairs...

70
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,509
that really counts.

71
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,847
? A little magic
that would finally?

72
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:03,503
Three, four.

73
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,870
? This dream that pains me
and enchains me?

74
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:12,038
? But I can't because
I'm mad about the boy?

75
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,137
How's that son of yours, Pargiter?

76
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:15,772
Where is he?
Westminster?

77
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:17,714
Robbie, what was that?

78
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:20,185
Just target practice,
I expect, my dear.

79
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:22,222
Target practice, at night?

80
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,586
Mmm?

81
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:26,182
Celia, run upstairs and
get my wrap, will you, dear?

82
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,887
You're wearing it, Mummy.

83
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:30,055
Oh, so I am!

84
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,030
I was just confused.

85
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,795
? And enchains me,
but I can't?

86
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:39,066
? Because I'm mad
about the boy?

87
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,970
? Mad about the boy?

88
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,633
Pardon me, please.

89
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,147
? I'm mad about the boy?

90
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,680
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

91
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:58,384
I'm sorry to disturb
this evening's entertainment,

92
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:01,553
but I have some
rather unhappy news.

93
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:05,064
TheJapanese have now
crossed theJahore Strait...

94
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,929
and have broken through our lines.

95
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,935
And their guns
have the city in range.

96
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:13,166
As you can hear.

97
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,605
But, Colonel, only today,

98
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:15,733
the Straits Times reported...

99
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:18,573
that theJapanese
were being driven back.

100
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:23,815
I'm afraid, sir, the only true thing
you read in the newspapers...

101
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:24,942
is the cricket scores.

102
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:30,720
Now, don't worry.

103
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,190
This hotel will be perfectly safe.

104
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,191
Why?

105
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,660
As I'm sure theJapanese
high command...

106
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:36,753
will want to stay here...

107
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,764
and avail themselves
of the facilities.

108
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:44,128
The city will fall
within a few days.

109
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:46,536
All European women and children...

110
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,268
are to leave immediately.

111
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:50,503
He can't mean us.
They're going to need us.

112
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:53,671
All soldiers to return
to their units.

113
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:55,374
Good luck.

114
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:09,926
Well, now we know.

115
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:11,931
They can see, which
we were told they couldn't.

116
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,193
And they can fight,

117
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:14,325
which we were told
they couldn't.

118
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:15,425
And they're here,

119
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:17,902
which we were told
they would never be.

120
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:19,768
Stop it, sir!

121
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:59,144
It's just up there.

122
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:08,714
Are you all right?

123
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,821
Come on, girlies.
Just leap down.

124
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,488
That's it.

125
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:18,758
Thanks.

126
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:23,101
Take cover!

127
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:31,176
Now, this isn't quite...

128
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:32,177
what I had planned for us.

129
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:33,235
Oh, really?

130
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,144
I should have sent
you home months ago.

131
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,843
Well, at least Charlie
will be surprised.

132
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,853
I wouldn't have seen him
until your next leave.

133
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,447
Good evening.

134
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:46,823
Nice night
for the collapse of an empire.

135
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:02,637
Come on, now.

136
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:06,076
Before you know it, we'll be
back in Portsmouth sailing.

137
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:07,477
You are a great
outdoor girl, Rosemary.

138
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:08,640
That's one thing
I love about you.

139
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,774
And indoors? I thought
you liked me indoors.

140
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:12,284
- Indoors?
- Mmm.

141
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:14,149
Oh, yes.

142
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:31,300
What rubbish!

143
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,861
Are you aware
that my husband...

144
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,271
is the head of Singapore-

145
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:36,036
He could be the king of Bongo Bongo,

146
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:37,201
but you can still only take...

147
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:39,040
one suitcase on board.
That's it.

148
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:41,046
Oh, Celia,
come along quickly.

149
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:42,046
Gangway stowed!

150
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:43,275
Take care, Robbie.

151
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,840
Bye, Daddy.
Ropes away!

152
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,715
Take it to the end
of the wharf, Chee Wan,

153
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,482
- and push it off.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:51,217
Damned if I'll have
some bloodyJapanese officer...

155
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,656
driving it about.

156
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,834
Life jackets on.

157
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:03,836
Do them up
nice and tight.

158
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:06,031
Just ask us
if you don't know how.

159
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,073
I'm glad to help you, ladies.

160
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,505
Thank you.

161
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:10,236
Life jackets on, please.

162
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,237
Just let me know
if you need any help, miss.

163
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:17,306
So, what's going to happen
to the men, do you think?

164
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:18,476
With us out of the way,

165
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:19,985
they're probably
already tucked up...

166
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:21,680
with their Malayan girlfriends.

167
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:23,017
It seems so ridiculous,

168
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,580
shoving us out at the last minute.

169
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:25,955
It seems now they should have...

170
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:27,550
shoved us out months ago.

171
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:28,754
Oh, in all fairness, Phyllis,

172
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:29,818
we could have gone.

173
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,659
I think we chose to stay.

174
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:34,030
- Tea?
- Thanks. You're all Australians.

175
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:35,125
That's right.

176
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,102
We've been in Singapore
for two months.

177
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,762
Now that they must
really need nurses,

178
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:39,771
you're leaving.

179
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,772
Phyllis!

180
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,001
Oh, no, it's true.

181
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:43,337
It's ridiculous.

182
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,140
I was a secretary at Army H.Q

183
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:48,010
I saw the reports on what
theJaps did to the nurses...

184
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:50,015
in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

185
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,176
Life jackets on, please.

186
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:54,243
Do them up nice and tight.

187
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:56,255
Oh, oh, don't go!

188
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:57,688
Lovely.

189
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:59,851
He can wait.

190
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:01,359
He'll still be there.

191
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:03,654
Life jackets on, please.

192
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,095
Give them back!

193
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:06,530
I haven't taken them.

194
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,760
Oh!

195
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:11,970
It's really quite simple,
Mummy. Look!

196
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,007
Like this.

197
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:16,776
Just give them back!

198
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:18,970
Here, let me do it.

199
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:21,207
Oh, thank you.

200
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:22,441
Oh, Mrs. -

201
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,211
Merritt.
Topsy Merritt.

202
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:25,842
Of course, the American.

203
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,183
Your husband runs
the pineapple canning factory.

204
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:29,449
That's right.

205
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:30,455
Give them back!

206
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:32,219
I don't got them!

207
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:35,557
Perhaps the boys could
be restrained a little.

208
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:36,561
I know...

209
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,996
the conditions
are somewhat unusual,

210
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:40,158
but this is my cabin.

211
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,598
Your cabin?

212
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:42,794
It's my cabin.

213
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,064
I understood that Marty
arranged this cabin for me.

214
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:46,264
My husband is an engineer...

215
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,272
with Coastal Traders.

216
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:49,332
Mine is the head of the P.W.D.

217
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:50,808
Mine's in pineapples.

218
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:52,936
Look, girls, we're just
going to have to get along.

219
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:53,945
It's only five weeks.

220
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:55,982
Oh, God!

221
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:11,118
Oh, very good.

222
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,253
Keep your life jacket on, please.

223
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:18,327
Oh, thank you.

224
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:21,768
Excuse me, ladies.

225
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:22,896
Uh, how much longer...

226
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,634
do we have to wear
these life jackets?

227
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,697
A few minutes now, lass.

228
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:27,174
Once we're 11 hours
out of Singapore,

229
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,972
we're out of range
ofJap fighters.

230
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:32,674
But the goddess Hera,
the wicked stepmother,

231
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:34,979
was so jealous of Hercules...

232
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:37,519
that one night
she crept into his room...

233
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:39,987
and put two deadly snakes
in his cradle.

234
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,489
But he was-

235
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:47,424
What's that?

236
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:55,063
Hard to starboard!

237
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:28,426
Aah!

238
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,156
Abandon ship!

239
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:06,233
Turn sideways, Mummy.
Sideways!

240
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,369
Don't reckon
she's got a sideways.

241
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:10,413
Are we sinking?

242
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,469
Yes, that's right, dear.

243
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:13,038
We're going to jump
into the water,

244
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:14,105
and it's going to be lovely.

245
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,481
Oh!

246
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:24,887
Take cover!

247
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:25,893
Get down!

248
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:49,715
Tommy!
Tommy!

249
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,061
Come on, children.

250
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,280
No, thank you, dear.
I'll stay here.

251
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:26,515
The ship is sinking,
Mrs. Roberts.

252
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,183
Hello, Mrs. Roberts.
Remember me?

253
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:30,726
Rosemary Leighton-Jones.

254
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,022
We met at the cricket club?

255
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,256
Oh, oh, of course, dear.
How are you?

256
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,592
Some other time, maybe.

257
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:36,597
Yes.

258
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,361
Just take my hand,
Mrs. Roberts.

259
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:39,526
We'll jump together.

260
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:40,626
Of course.

261
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:45,965
Get in the raft!

262
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,669
Get a place in the raft!

263
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,792
Could be worse, I suppose.

264
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:14,336
Do you think so?

265
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,200
Well, the water could be cold.

266
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:19,605
That's true.

267
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,273
Must be Sumatra.

268
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:25,279
Yes.

269
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,848
It's amazing how everyone's
just disappeared.

270
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,887
It's like one of those
girls' adventure annuals...

271
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:33,684
my mother gave me
every Christmas.

272
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:37,123
It's an adventure I could
certainly do without.

273
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:39,058
They always had
happy endings.

274
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:45,262
Oh! Now I'm cold.

275
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:47,803
If you spend a penny,
it'll warm you up.

276
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,896
Huh?

277
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:51,440
We used to swim
in the North Sea...

278
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:52,997
in our school hols.

279
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,634
It was freezing.

280
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,235
We always did it.

281
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,806
Oh!

282
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,282
It's working.

283
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,102
I'm starving.

284
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:30,071
Yeah, me, too.

285
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:35,676
Rosemary Leighton-Jones.

286
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:37,372
My husband is
Dennis Leighton-Jones.

287
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,744
Royal Malayan Volunteers.

288
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,747
How do you do?

289
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:40,805
Susan Macarthy.

290
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:42,714
Australian Army Nursing Corps.

291
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:46,152
Adrienne Pargiter,
wife of tea planter.

292
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,189
How do you do?

293
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:48,746
- Hello.
- Yeah.

294
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:03,793
You are English ladies?

295
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:04,924
- Yes.
- Yes.

296
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:06,628
- Australian.
- Ah, yes.

297
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:09,034
I was for some years in Singapore.

298
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:11,699
I was a, uh, newspaper correspondent.

299
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:14,800
May I ask what you ladies
are doing here in Sumatra?

300
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:15,809
Our ship was sunk.

301
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:16,810
By your planes.

302
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:17,811
We swam to shore.

303
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,370
What can I say?

304
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,417
Except that attacking the enemy...

305
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:23,384
is a characteristic of war.

306
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,717
The Prince Albert was full
of women and children,

307
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:26,720
not soldiers.

308
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:28,313
A matter of regret.

309
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:30,052
More than that,

310
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,184
there's a Geneva convention...

311
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,454
laying down the rules of war.

312
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:35,224
Japan has signed
no Geneva convention.

313
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:37,425
If a war has begun,
it can only mean...

314
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,594
the time for rules has ended.

315
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,763
The aim is to win.

316
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,261
Good luck.

317
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:21,674
Up until you reminded him
of the Geneva convention,

318
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,939
I thought we were going
to be invited to dine.

319
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,602
Oggi!

320
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,263
Susan! Susan!

321
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:19,699
How- How did you get here?

322
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:21,265
Jap navy boat picked us up.

323
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,275
What were they like?

324
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:23,936
Oh, gentlemen,
compared with this lot.

325
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:53,234
English empire number ten.

326
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:57,507
Nippon Ichiban, number one.

327
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,634
Hai!

328
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:21,181
I am Colonel Hirota.

329
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:25,317
And uh, I am in command
of this- of this place.

330
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:30,691
Days of British and Dutch peoples'...

331
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,735
exploitation of Oriental people
all finish.

332
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:35,827
Now they exploit
Oriental people.

333
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:41,274
You Europeans had great
"proudry" and arrogance.

334
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:43,243
Think Oriental people inferior.

335
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:48,181
Situation now 100% reversed.

336
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:51,746
Colonel, I'd like to know...

337
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,754
how long you expect us to remain...

338
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:55,153
- in these perfectly-
- Aah!

339
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:24,978
Take it all to the kitchen, please.

340
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:29,474
Please, bring everything
to the kitchen.

341
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,567
Not so bad, really.

342
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:47,567
Uhh!

343
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:49,536
- Disgusting.
- At least it's food.

344
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:51,732
I went to an English boarding school.

345
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:53,502
I meant by those standards.

346
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:56,738
It's funny. In the kitchen,
there seemed so much.

347
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,279
What do you mean?

348
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:01,680
Well, how do we know
they're dividing it up fairly,

349
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,682
those Dutch?

350
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:04,912
Oh, come off it.

351
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:06,545
They don't speak English.

352
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:08,556
Well, I think the food
that you saw...

353
00:27:08,624 --> 00:27:11,058
had to be divided up
among over 400 people.

354
00:27:11,126 --> 00:27:13,890
That's correct.
It doesn't go far.

355
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:18,493
I don't know that the Dutch
are noted for their cooking.

356
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,058
No, not like the English people.

357
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:25,167
All I can say is,
I hope this is over...

358
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,332
very, very soon.

359
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:28,342
When our boys get here,
it'll be just a few weeks.

360
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,002
Your boys?
What about our boys?

361
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:33,047
Frankly, I don't
care which boys do it,

362
00:27:33,115 --> 00:27:35,015
just as long as
we're going home.

363
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,914
She's right.
Any boys will do me.

364
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:38,247
Thought they might.

365
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,187
I've heard they're sending
all the noncombatants home.

366
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:43,190
What do you think
about that, now?

367
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:44,725
Where did you hear that?

368
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,784
Oh,just around and about.

369
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:48,796
We're all noncombatants,
Mrs. O'Riordan.

370
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,391
No. I mean like me.
See, I'm Irish.

371
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:53,434
We're neutral.

372
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:55,561
There's two Portuguese ladies.

373
00:27:55,637 --> 00:27:57,832
And you-
well, you're-

374
00:27:57,906 --> 00:27:59,498
I have a German passport.

375
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:02,373
Well, then, you're
on their side, aren't you?

376
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:04,344
So you think.

377
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:08,342
Already I have escaped
two madmen in Europe.

378
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,248
Now I'm "catched"
by the Oriental version.

379
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,650
You're from Singapore.

380
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,654
I don't think we've met.

381
00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:15,155
I don't think.

382
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:17,089
The English don't
inviteJewish refugees...

383
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:18,558
to the cricket club.

384
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:22,825
My husband and me,

385
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:24,957
we are doctors
in Asian hospital.

386
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:26,466
Oh, you're a doctor.

387
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:29,026
That is what I say.
You like perhaps...

388
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:31,538
I send to Leipzig
for the certificate?

389
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,074
- Oh, no. I-
- Anyway...

390
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:35,075
they're sure to let you go.

391
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:37,577
No. Japanese men
don't like lady.

392
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:40,046
CallJapanese lady
zashiki bita.

393
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:43,243
Means "old pig in back of house. "

394
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:44,751
Sounds strangely familiar.

395
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,415
I- I was in China
when theJapanese invaded,

396
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,424
and I think the people
they despised most...

397
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:53,256
were Europeans,
then prisoners, then women.

398
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:54,761
Well, that's us.

399
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,922
All three.

400
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:48,616
Quick.

401
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:20,247
You see man before?

402
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:22,078
Well, no. Only here.

403
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:26,086
So, you know,
some little Oriental men...

404
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:28,088
big like this.

405
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:30,420
And some big
European men...

406
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:31,754
like this.

407
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:33,954
You never can tell.

408
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:34,961
Really.

409
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,019
Mm-hmm.

410
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:46,833
Bugger!

411
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:48,842
And I thought
being a secretary...

412
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,172
was a rotten job.

413
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:52,179
What if they do win
the bloody war?

414
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:53,908
They'll have us
doing this forever.

415
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,916
They're not going to win.

416
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,508
We'll win.

417
00:30:57,586 --> 00:30:59,554
The British don't lose wars.

418
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:02,556
Yeah? I reckon
if I'd paid attention in school,

419
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:04,558
I could think of a few.

420
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:12,066
They tell me
you are a model.

421
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:14,398
Oh, yes, it's true.

422
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:16,403
I think that
you're very beautiful.

423
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:17,403
Yeah.

424
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:19,406
You have been to Paris?

425
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:20,406
Many times.

426
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:21,442
Ohhh...

427
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,410
wunderbar clothes and...

428
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:25,241
the lovely people.

429
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:26,245
The elegance.

430
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:28,248
In Singapore, did you model?

431
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:31,080
Oh, no. I was visiting
my husband there.

432
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:32,245
Oh.

433
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,914
I'm modeling next season
for Hartnell's in London.

434
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,922
London! Ohhh-

435
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:37,982
Well, I hope I am.

436
00:31:40,657 --> 00:31:41,248
Ja.

437
00:31:41,825 --> 00:31:44,794
You know, you could
do some work, Mrs. Tippler.

438
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,351
In this heat?

439
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:48,761
We're all supposed to work
if we're not sick.

440
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:49,992
You're just lazy.

441
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,624
Lazy? Me?

442
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,633
You.

443
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,930
Ohhh...

444
00:31:54,003 --> 00:31:55,436
I'm completely...
buggered.

445
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:56,972
Phyllis!

446
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,473
Well, I'm sorry.

447
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,372
There's simply no other
word for it.

448
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:01,375
I'm buggered.

449
00:32:01,444 --> 00:32:03,378
You know, this place
sure ain't Alcatraz.

450
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:05,038
We could be
under that fence...

451
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:06,207
and into that jungle...

452
00:32:06,282 --> 00:32:07,715
before you could say "boo. "

453
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:09,809
Well, don't forget to write, Topsy.

454
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,480
You would die in that jungle.
It's full of snakes.

455
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,715
Boa constrictors.

456
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,779
Horrible.

457
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:16,553
Yeah, well, after three months
in this place...

458
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:18,150
it doesn't sound so bad.

459
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,490
The locals will betray you.

460
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,325
TheJapanese have
got them all terrified.

461
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,365
That's right.
Some of the men escaped,

462
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:24,866
and they brought them back.

463
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:27,528
They cut off their noses
and their ears,

464
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:29,299
and they hung them
upside down, so they did.

465
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:30,964
How awful.
All the loose change...

466
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,530
must've fallen
out of their pockets.

467
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:33,871
They'd have hated that.

468
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:35,376
But it's true!

469
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:37,003
Yeah, well, you've convinced me.

470
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,672
This place ain't so lousy.

471
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,340
Room service is a bit slow.

472
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,348
Mmm.

473
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,714
What men, Mrs. O'Riordan?

474
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:44,719
That guard.

475
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:46,584
You know, the one
that looks like the actor.

476
00:32:46,656 --> 00:32:48,089
- Mr. Moto.
- He's in all those...

477
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:49,591
- Japanese detective films.
- Peter Lorre.

478
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:51,092
Mr. Moto.
Yes, Mrs. O'Riordan,

479
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:52,253
but what men?

480
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:54,558
I was telling you.
That guard was saying...

481
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:56,258
there's a campful of men
over the hill...

482
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:57,697
just a few miles away.

483
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,995
Now, they're Dutchmen, I think.

484
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:01,662
But he says there are
some from Singapore.

485
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,221
Oh, Hudson insisted on growing...

486
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,723
masses and masses
of red carnations.

487
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,224
Ooh, lovely.

488
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,726
Hey, Dr. Mizushima.

489
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,729
Get me some quinine, eh?
And some bandages...

490
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,731
and morphine und a stethoscope.

491
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,733
Even some aspirin is good.

492
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,570
Just Mercurochrome.

493
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,072
Mercurochrome. I know.

494
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,575
I- You Japanese think
it cures everything.

495
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,441
Then you give me
some cigarettes, eh?

496
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:44,878
I'm a German, your ally.

497
00:33:44,948 --> 00:33:47,075
I'm not one of these
British colonialists.

498
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,583
Uhh. OnlyJapanese?

499
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,915
Taste like cow dung.

500
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,254
How she is?

501
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,760
Oh, Doctor...

502
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,763
can't get her
to eat anything.

503
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,696
I think it's just...

504
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,860
uhh, too much for her, really.

505
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:09,700
For a lot of them.

506
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:13,173
They don't adjust,
they die, my dear.

507
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:16,178
How many gone since we come
to this wonderful place?

508
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:17,178
Oh, four.

509
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:18,874
Not so bad.
Be worse by Christmas...

510
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:21,883
with the bad food
and no medicine.

511
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:24,078
Christmas? The war
will be over by Christmas.

512
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:27,088
Don't you bet your fuddler
on that one, my darling.

513
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,393
What's a fuddler?

514
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:34,396
I think I can guess.

515
00:34:34,464 --> 00:34:35,726
Oh. Fuddler.

516
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:38,232
Do you think she's really a doctor?

517
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,734
What do you mean?

518
00:34:39,802 --> 00:34:41,736
Well, who'd know?
She certainly got herself...

519
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:43,396
out of working in the field-

520
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:44,405
Shh!

521
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:46,408
...and cleaning out the lavatory.

522
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:51,910
Buck up, Phyllis.
It's Christmas.

523
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,314
Where's the champagne?
The plum pudding? The turkey?

524
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,081
Oh, it's lovely, Adrienne.

525
00:34:58,154 --> 00:35:02,352
Perhaps now might be a time
to deal with that dog.

526
00:35:02,425 --> 00:35:04,052
He'd make a nice stew.

527
00:35:04,127 --> 00:35:06,391
It's only a little dog.
It don't eat much.

528
00:35:06,462 --> 00:35:08,930
Yes, but he does eat what
we could give to the children.

529
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:10,590
But how will Mrs. Roberts
cope without him?

530
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,568
She's right, Edna.
It'd be the end of her.

531
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,103
I think...

532
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:18,606
this must be
the servants' quarters.

533
00:35:18,675 --> 00:35:19,539
Tell Chen Li...

534
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:21,975
only to come when we call.

535
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:23,706
Mummy, that's not Chen Li.

536
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,712
That's Wing.

537
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:26,009
Aiya...

538
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,550
Malaria bad.
So sorry. Yes.

539
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:30,552
We can't get any quinine?

540
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,520
I think she's been stealing...

541
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,021
the sugar again, dear.

542
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,718
You have to watch
these Chinese, Robbie.

543
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:39,852
I get quinine.

544
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:51,831
Not so young no more.

545
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:53,834
Quinine?

546
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:56,064
Oh. Thank you.

547
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:57,401
Did they see you?

548
00:36:57,473 --> 00:36:58,735
I think maybe no.

549
00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:00,070
Ohhh-

550
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:07,242
They catch them?

551
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:08,248
Can't tell.

552
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:09,875
Here you are, Mummy.
Take this.

553
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:12,011
That black market
could get us all into trouble.

554
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:14,488
They warned us.
They'll cut our rations again.

555
00:37:14,557 --> 00:37:15,489
She's right.

556
00:37:15,558 --> 00:37:17,253
Here, Mummy.
This can help.

557
00:37:17,326 --> 00:37:18,350
Wait! Wait!

558
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:25,199
What is it?

559
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:26,701
There's no more gin.

560
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,703
It's sake.
Japan drink.

561
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:29,703
Very strong.

562
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:31,706
You no like?

563
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:34,004
Mmm. I wouldn't say that.

564
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:44,851
Look who's here.

565
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,959
Kempei-Tai.

566
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:58,967
What's that?
Sounds like a Chinese dish.

567
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:01,936
Would be better.
It's Japan's secret police.

568
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,776
Ho!

569
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,057
Oh! Oh!

570
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:27,891
Ohhh! Oh! Oh!

571
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:30,731
Uhh! Ohh!

572
00:38:34,871 --> 00:38:36,270
Ho!

573
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:43,771
Uhhh!

574
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:48,643
Wing.

575
00:38:50,419 --> 00:38:54,355
Ohh!

576
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:12,905
Ohh! Aaah!

577
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,739
Aaah!

578
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:27,480
"How silent is this place.

579
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,611
The brilliant sunshine
filters through the trees.

580
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:35,487
The leaves are rustled
by a gentle breeze.

581
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,493
A wild and open space,

582
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,654
by shrubs, pink-tipped,

583
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,994
mauve-blossomed, is o'ergrown.

584
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,331
A hush enfolds me,

585
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,667
deep as I have known,

586
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,835
unbroken, safe,
by distant insects drone.

587
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,503
Ajungle clearing,

588
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,012
a track...

589
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,878
through which
we bear our load to Him.

590
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,688
It is our Paradise Road.

591
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,850
How silent is this place.

592
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,587
How sacred is this place. "

593
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,742
One would think
they would've learned...

594
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:48,310
a few words of English by now.

595
00:41:48,388 --> 00:41:51,152
They understand
a lot more than they let on.

596
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:05,227
Oh. Wait a minute.

597
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:11,402
I want my soap.
Where's that soap?

598
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:13,411
Soap?

599
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:16,381
Soap. Soap.

600
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:18,076
Ah. Ah. What else?

601
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,145
Nay. Nay.

602
00:42:22,222 --> 00:42:24,690
Don't give me that.
I was here. Right there!

603
00:42:26,092 --> 00:42:28,026
I had to write an I.O.U...

604
00:42:28,094 --> 00:42:30,858
for £5 for that soap,
and I want it now!

605
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:48,678
Ladies! Ladies! Please!

606
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:51,740
Calm down! What is this?

607
00:42:55,455 --> 00:42:57,013
So you think they took your soap?

608
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,352
I don't think so.

609
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:59,858
You don't think so?

610
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:02,121
Well, I bloody well "tink" so.

611
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:03,890
Maybe we should
just have a look...

612
00:43:03,963 --> 00:43:05,931
in their ugly bloody dresses
or their silly wooden shoes.

613
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:08,401
Ladies.

614
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:14,931
See soap.

615
00:43:17,877 --> 00:43:18,969
Ohhh...

616
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,123
Elgar.

617
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,160
What?

618
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:37,628
You were humming
the Elgar Concerto.

619
00:43:45,772 --> 00:43:49,139
Do you know, I went
to the very first performance?

620
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,677
Felix Salmond.
Leeds, 1920.

621
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:54,473
That was almost
my last concert.

622
00:43:54,547 --> 00:43:57,573
The church sent me to China
a few months later.

623
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,141
But, I mean, you're
not a musician,

624
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,482
are you, Miss Drummond?

625
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:03,818
Your poem.
I assumed you taught English.

626
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,484
Oh, I taught a bit
of everything in China.

627
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,585
But I did study music at Durham.

628
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:12,792
Miss Drummond...

629
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:14,800
would you care
to take a turn with me...

630
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:16,597
in the gardens
before lights out?

631
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:19,671
I'd be delighted,
Mrs. Pargiter.

632
00:44:20,907 --> 00:44:23,569
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I've interrupted your prayers.

633
00:44:23,643 --> 00:44:26,009
Oh, perhaps it's just as well.

634
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,513
I was about to ask God...

635
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:31,015
to smite Captain Tanaka
and the Snake...

636
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:33,018
with a severe case of dysentery.

637
00:44:36,422 --> 00:44:38,287
I studied music
at the Royal Academy...

638
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:39,791
under Sir Henry Wood.

639
00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:42,293
What did you play,
the violin or the viola?

640
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:44,296
The violin.
How did you know?

641
00:44:44,364 --> 00:44:46,798
Just a guess.
You were humming...

642
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:48,458
the Symphonie Concertante
the other night,

643
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:50,469
and that has leads
for both instruments.

644
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:51,629
Yes.

645
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:17,428
I came out to Singapore
with my father,

646
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:19,829
and I met my husband William,
who's an absolute darling,

647
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:23,665
but music was fairly low
on the list of priorities...

648
00:45:23,736 --> 00:45:25,169
for Singapore society.

649
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:27,172
Very low,judging
by the stories I've read...

650
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,502
by Mr. Somerset Maugham.

651
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:30,509
Oh, well-
If you've read him,

652
00:45:30,577 --> 00:45:32,511
you'd think we did nothing
but drink G & Ts...

653
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:35,514
and murder one another
and indulge in ceaseless-

654
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:36,549
Wife swapping?

655
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:39,276
What will they think of next?

656
00:45:41,187 --> 00:45:42,779
Do you know, Miss Drummond,

657
00:45:42,855 --> 00:45:44,789
I feel I owe you an apology.

658
00:45:44,857 --> 00:45:45,983
Me? Whatever for?

659
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:48,118
My- My snobbery.

660
00:45:48,194 --> 00:45:50,628
We never mixed with
missionaries in Singapore.

661
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:52,927
We were taught
to look down on them.

662
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:54,694
Oh, what a tedious lot, most of us,

663
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:56,632
and very self-righteous.

664
00:45:56,703 --> 00:45:58,500
You're not serious.

665
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:02,007
Not really.
Well, maybe just a bit.

666
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:04,872
Oh, dear.

667
00:46:04,944 --> 00:46:06,206
Back we go,

668
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:07,871
or the head prefect
will be after us.

669
00:46:15,288 --> 00:46:16,880
Do you know, Mrs. Pargiter,

670
00:46:16,956 --> 00:46:18,947
I've just had a wonderful idea.

671
00:46:19,025 --> 00:46:21,220
An orchestra?
You're crazy.

672
00:46:21,294 --> 00:46:23,807
Do you expect theJapanese
would give us instruments?

673
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:24,965
Not at all, Harriet.

674
00:46:25,042 --> 00:46:26,475
I thought I'd made that clear.

675
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:27,635
We don't need instruments.

676
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:29,338
I don't think so, Adrienne.
After what happened,

677
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:30,937
no one's in the mood
for a sing-along.

678
00:46:31,014 --> 00:46:32,538
But that's just the point.

679
00:46:32,616 --> 00:46:35,449
I don't think it's such a bad idea.

680
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,850
Do you read music, Mrs. O'Riordan?

681
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,945
Read it?
Didn't know you could read it.

682
00:46:39,022 --> 00:46:40,580
But I can sing it all right.

683
00:46:40,657 --> 00:46:42,420
I was in the choir at school.

684
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:44,723
I think it's
a harebrained idea, Adrienne.

685
00:46:44,795 --> 00:46:46,285
We hardly have
the strength to talk.

686
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:49,298
You want my advice,
you'll forget the whole thing.

687
00:46:49,366 --> 00:46:50,799
You think theJaps will agree?

688
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:51,800
Not on your nellie.

689
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:53,803
They have forbidden any meetings...

690
00:46:53,871 --> 00:46:55,133
or religious services.

691
00:46:55,205 --> 00:46:57,730
We can't even
have classes for the children.

692
00:47:02,413 --> 00:47:03,971
You must have
perfect recall, Miss Drummond.

693
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:05,241
I envy you.

694
00:47:05,315 --> 00:47:07,249
They say Mozart
could play any piece...

695
00:47:07,317 --> 00:47:08,909
after hearing it only once.

696
00:47:08,986 --> 00:47:11,477
But I'm cheating.
I know Dvorák back to front.

697
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:13,216
It's probably full of mistakes.

698
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,587
I don't think so.

699
00:47:14,658 --> 00:47:16,091
It's rather complicated,

700
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,092
isn't it?

701
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:18,594
You'll have your work
cut out for you...

702
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:20,095
when you conduct it.

703
00:47:20,164 --> 00:47:22,098
I'm not conducting it.
You are.

704
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:23,098
Me?

705
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:25,101
Well, you trained
at the Royal Academy.

706
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:27,501
Yes, but I was a violinist,
and that was years ago.

707
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:29,163
Miss Pargiter, you read music.

708
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:31,673
And Sir Thomas Beecham
isn't available.

709
00:47:33,744 --> 00:47:34,676
Uhh-

710
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:38,180
After tea, we will go-

711
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:39,840
Use "shall. "
"Shall" is more refined.

712
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,851
...shall go to the member's stand...

713
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:43,352
and "vatch" the-

714
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,409
And watch.

715
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:47,184
And watch the gentlemens
play the cricket.

716
00:47:47,257 --> 00:47:48,747
Yes!

717
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:50,418
What are we gonna sing?

718
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:51,756
I love Rudy Vallee.

719
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,524
It won't be Rudy Vallee.

720
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:58,868
Mrs. Roberts, what about you?

721
00:47:58,936 --> 00:48:00,870
Oh, my dear, I was a stalwart...

722
00:48:00,938 --> 00:48:02,872
of the Cathedral Choir of Singapore,

723
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,532
and my husband Robbie was-

724
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:06,200
You have a lovely voice, Mummy.

725
00:48:06,276 --> 00:48:07,868
Well, perhaps I should consider it.

726
00:48:07,945 --> 00:48:09,708
Lovely. I'll put you down.

727
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:15,710
Tan, Millie, you've
heard about our choir.

728
00:48:15,786 --> 00:48:17,651
You'll join us, won't you?

729
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:21,054
What kind of people
will be in this group, dear?

730
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:22,056
Mummy!

731
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:23,717
What's wrong? I simply asked...

732
00:48:23,794 --> 00:48:25,455
what kind of people
would be in this group.

733
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:27,224
People like us, Mummy.
Prisoners of theJapanese.

734
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:28,730
But that's irrelevant, dear.

735
00:48:28,799 --> 00:48:30,733
One has a certain position.

736
00:48:30,801 --> 00:48:33,235
I mean, one can tolerate
the Dutch, some of them, but-

737
00:48:33,303 --> 00:48:34,235
Mummy, I-

738
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:36,871
What is it, Celia?

739
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,068
Try to finish your sentences.

740
00:48:40,143 --> 00:48:41,633
Do you remember Wing?

741
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:43,646
Well, of course I do.

742
00:48:43,714 --> 00:48:44,646
Horrible business.

743
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:45,647
Horrible.

744
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:48,150
But who knows
what kind of contraband...

745
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:49,651
she was trading in?

746
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,415
I mean, probably some Oriental-

747
00:48:51,488 --> 00:48:55,049
Quinine, Mummy.
She'd gone to get quinine for you.

748
00:49:05,936 --> 00:49:07,369
You know what Colonel Hirota said...

749
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:08,836
about writing anything.

750
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:10,339
They find that,

751
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:12,841
they could execute
the whole bloody lot of us.

752
00:49:16,313 --> 00:49:18,247
Perhaps we're all being put...

753
00:49:18,315 --> 00:49:21,910
in a precarious position, Adrienne.

754
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:23,680
Perhaps. I happen to think...

755
00:49:23,754 --> 00:49:25,016
it's worth risking.

756
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:26,020
Oh!

757
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:31,420
TheJapanese will only find out
if somebody says something.

758
00:49:31,495 --> 00:49:33,087
And what's that
supposed to mean?

759
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:37,433
Somebody tells them
every time one of us...

760
00:49:37,501 --> 00:49:38,763
rolls over in bed.

761
00:49:40,904 --> 00:49:42,599
You've always got
plenty of cigarettes.

762
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:47,071
Do you think that-

763
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,206
I've never heard
anything so insulting.

764
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,713
Well, someone told them
it was Wing...

765
00:49:51,782 --> 00:49:53,249
trading outside the fence
that night.

766
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:54,909
Well, it certainly wasn't me!

767
00:49:54,985 --> 00:49:56,543
What about thatJew doctor?

768
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,588
What-What about that one?

769
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:00,555
Always making eyes
at that bloody guard.

770
00:50:00,624 --> 00:50:02,615
Susan, Mrs. Tippler, that's enough.

771
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:12,197
S'truth! You were always...

772
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:15,204
the shyest little thing
at nursing school.

773
00:50:15,272 --> 00:50:18,537
Maybe nobody there
ever got my goat.

774
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:33,287
Well, then.

775
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:35,290
Who's first?

776
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:42,826
Um, Mrs. O'Riordan?

777
00:50:42,899 --> 00:50:44,332
If you would.

778
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:47,165
? Ah?

779
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,812
Thank you.

780
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,812
And...

781
00:50:57,881 --> 00:50:58,973
Mrs. Cronje.

782
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:00,914
Mrs. Cronje, would you, please?

783
00:51:00,984 --> 00:51:04,010
? Ah?

784
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:13,452
Quick. Hide it.

785
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,497
Aah!

786
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:26,941
Oh, God.

787
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:09,146
Eh, I reckon...

788
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:11,653
she's gonna be all right, Mrs. Roberts.

789
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:13,155
She might have...

790
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:15,657
a bit of a funny bark.

791
00:52:15,726 --> 00:52:18,661
Thank you, dear.
Thank you so much.

792
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:20,162
Oh, thank you.

793
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,492
Oh, Tillie,

794
00:52:21,565 --> 00:52:23,157
come and have some water, dear.

795
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:26,868
You okay?

796
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:27,961
Okay.

797
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:31,373
No, not so okay,
but I breathe,

798
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:33,033
so it's not so bad.

799
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,544
I think you might have
a touch of malaria.

800
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:37,477
I might be able
to get some... quinine.

801
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:38,980
I'll get some whiskey.

802
00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:40,073
Cures everything.

803
00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:43,485
So, after the war, darling,

804
00:52:43,553 --> 00:52:45,987
you go to medical school, yes?

805
00:52:46,056 --> 00:52:47,148
Me?

806
00:52:47,224 --> 00:52:48,657
Yes, you. Why not?

807
00:52:48,725 --> 00:52:52,161
You know, my father'll
want me back at the station.

808
00:52:52,229 --> 00:52:54,993
He never even wanted me
to go into nursing.

809
00:52:55,065 --> 00:52:58,330
Station.
He is a railway master?

810
00:52:58,401 --> 00:53:01,336
No. I was-
It's a sheep station.

811
00:53:01,404 --> 00:53:03,167
It's like a farm.

812
00:53:05,075 --> 00:53:07,009
You do what you want, darling...

813
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:09,011
not what your father want.

814
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:11,673
He get plenty of those
big Australian men...

815
00:53:11,748 --> 00:53:14,012
to work on the station.

816
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:18,683
So. TheJapanese
end the ladies' choir...

817
00:53:18,755 --> 00:53:20,188
before it even begin.

818
00:53:20,257 --> 00:53:22,521
Oh, not at all.
And it's a vocal orchestra,

819
00:53:22,592 --> 00:53:24,025
not a choir.

820
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:28,430
But you can't possibly
go on with it,

821
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:30,796
not if they won't let
everybody meet.

822
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:33,768
It's only the large group
that attracted the Snake's attention.

823
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:35,771
You don't give
a damn about us-

824
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,568
the whole camp.

825
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:38,903
I beg your pardon?

826
00:53:38,975 --> 00:53:40,966
Isn't all this just
so you can lord it...

827
00:53:41,044 --> 00:53:42,739
over the rest of us,
boss everyone around?

828
00:53:42,813 --> 00:53:47,147
The whole thing might be a bit
grandiose, Adrienne. I mean,

829
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:48,149
how many
women conductors...

830
00:53:48,218 --> 00:53:49,207
are there, anyway?

831
00:53:49,286 --> 00:53:51,220
None that I know of.

832
00:53:51,288 --> 00:53:52,220
Well.

833
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:54,655
Well, then this
is probably a first:

834
00:53:54,724 --> 00:53:56,555
something to be proud of.

835
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:08,101
No. Excuse me,
Mrs. Roberts, you were late.

836
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:09,763
Oh, I don't think so, dear.

837
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,432
Yes, Mrs. Roberts.
You must watch me.

838
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:13,271
I was watching you.

839
00:54:13,343 --> 00:54:15,277
Perhaps everyone else was early.

840
00:54:15,345 --> 00:54:17,779
No, Mrs. Roberts.
Once again, everyone.

841
00:54:17,848 --> 00:54:18,906
? Ah?

842
00:54:23,687 --> 00:54:25,712
Hai!

843
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:28,055
Hai!

844
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:40,268
Aah! Oh!

845
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:41,429
Ohhh...

846
00:54:41,504 --> 00:54:43,028
boring man.

847
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:46,040
Aah! Oh!

848
00:54:48,945 --> 00:54:49,843
Ohh!

849
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,246
Is there something we can do
for you, Sergeant Tomayashi?

850
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:03,825
Huhh!

851
00:55:05,795 --> 00:55:08,593
Conner, Griffin, Munn-

852
00:55:08,665 --> 00:55:10,098
Well, it isn't just
our orchestra members, is it?

853
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:11,098
No.

854
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:12,600
I can't see what it means.

855
00:55:12,669 --> 00:55:14,261
Do they have
something in common?

856
00:55:14,337 --> 00:55:16,271
Some of the Dutch girls
are on here, too.

857
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,432
Well, repatriations?
Executions?

858
00:55:18,508 --> 00:55:19,941
You're there, Rosemary.

859
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,443
And Susan and Topsy.

860
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:24,947
I know. God, what else
could they do to us?

861
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:26,949
It says the main gate after tenko.

862
00:55:27,017 --> 00:55:28,951
We'd better not go.
We just won't go!

863
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:30,953
Just say you have
another engagement.

864
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:32,613
Mistake.
They'll do something awful...

865
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:34,122
if we don't go.

866
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:35,782
I know what this is.

867
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:36,791
What?

868
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,452
This is all the younger girls-

869
00:55:38,528 --> 00:55:40,120
all the more attractive ones.

870
00:55:40,196 --> 00:55:41,629
Am I on there?

871
00:55:41,698 --> 00:55:43,256
No! No! No!

872
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,799
This is Japanese Officer's Club.

873
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:52,468
This is Japanese officer men.

874
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:56,445
Most were educated and refined.

875
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,947
Some speak English...

876
00:56:58,015 --> 00:56:59,607
like Englishmen from Oxford.

877
00:56:59,684 --> 00:57:01,083
What rubbish.

878
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:03,086
Japanese officer
look for volunteer...

879
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:05,315
to work in club.

880
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:16,359
Volunteer have plenty of food...

881
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,561
and satin sheet.

882
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:21,230
And we're the acceptable volunteers?

883
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:24,240
That is correct interpretation.

884
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:26,208
Disgusting, is what I call it.

885
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,438
I'd rather kiss a leper
from Leopoldville...

886
00:57:28,513 --> 00:57:30,708
before I let
any of that lot touch me.

887
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:32,181
Well, we don't have to stay.

888
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,581
They're not forcing us.

889
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:34,743
Right.

890
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,787
Our own satin sheets?

891
00:57:45,263 --> 00:57:48,699
Ladies who stay
in beautiful house...

892
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:52,634
will please to walk
in direction indicated.

893
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:11,684
No. You can't be serious.

894
00:58:11,756 --> 00:58:12,688
Too right I am.

895
00:58:12,757 --> 00:58:13,689
You know bloody well...

896
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:14,690
we've got Buckley's chance...

897
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:15,691
of getting through the war...

898
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,692
in that camp.

899
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:17,693
You think I want to end up...

900
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:18,694
in some shallow grave...

901
00:58:18,763 --> 00:58:19,695
in Sumatra?

902
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,197
The war's going to be finished soon.

903
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:22,596
You said that over a year ago.

904
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,736
Bett!

905
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:30,773
Hot water. Ahem.

906
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:34,243
Is there hot water in this club?

907
00:58:34,312 --> 00:58:36,212
Plenty hot water.

908
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,838
Plenty soap.

909
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:38,847
Soap! Soap!

910
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,213
It's been so long.

911
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:41,251
Oh...

912
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:45,722
Topsy, don't be absurd.

913
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,224
Japanese officers
gonna be any worse...

914
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,884
than most of the
creeps we've all known?

915
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:50,825
Probably.

916
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:52,487
What about Marty?

917
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:56,166
Well, what he don't know-

918
00:58:56,234 --> 00:58:58,065
Then what about
the vocal orchestra?

919
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:02,162
I'll be an alto short if you go.

920
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,505
Are you asking me
to give up food and soap...

921
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:09,171
and God knows what else,
so I can starve and sing?

922
00:59:09,247 --> 00:59:10,179
Yes.

923
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:13,046
I suppose I am.

924
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,386
Lady...

925
00:59:19,457 --> 00:59:20,788
please.

926
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:40,168
A good Catholic sister like you.

927
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:42,576
I just can't believe
you're not more-

928
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:43,841
Censorious?

929
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:46,247
I'm not their judge.

930
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:49,047
If they want to survive,
maybe they will this way.

931
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,020
The will to survive is very strong,

932
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,988
stronger than anything.

933
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:56,322
I just can't believe
what you're saying.

934
00:59:58,229 --> 00:59:59,662
Very well, Phyllis.

935
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:03,166
I've just lost four sopranos
in that lot.

936
01:00:03,234 --> 01:00:05,395
You're going to
have to join us now.

937
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:07,994
I'm not interested
in your bloody choir.

938
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:10,199
Well, you could stop
lying around and whinging...

939
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,969
and jolly well
get interested.

940
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:12,975
Well.

941
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:15,239
What about you two?

942
01:00:15,313 --> 01:00:17,247
Oh, no, not me. I-

943
01:00:17,315 --> 01:00:18,247
Susan?

944
01:00:18,316 --> 01:00:19,681
Look, to be honest,

945
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,615
I don't like the kind
of music you're doing.

946
01:00:21,686 --> 01:00:23,119
It's got no tune.

947
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:24,620
You really don't know...

948
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:26,020
what you're talking about.

949
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,717
No?

950
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:29,225
No.

951
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,853
All right, now, altos,
it's two notes.

952
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,954
? Mmm?

953
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:34,963
? Mmm?

954
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:35,964
? Mmm?

955
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:36,965
All right?

956
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:38,967
Ahem.

957
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,367
? Mmm?

958
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:42,030
? Mmm?
Yep.

959
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:44,074
How many do you have today?

960
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,201
Two. I found them
both just staring up...

961
01:00:47,278 --> 01:00:48,404
like this.

962
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,811
Just wait till
Mrs. Van der Weyden dies.

963
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,748
She's so big with beri-beri,
it will take 10 women...

964
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:54,842
just to carry her
out of the hut.

965
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:56,318
Yeah. We'll have to jump on her...

966
01:00:56,387 --> 01:00:59,117
to get her in the coffin.

967
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,987
Dr. Verstak?

968
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:02,958
Yes. Over here.

969
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:07,226
So, how it goes,
the English ladies' choir?

970
01:01:07,298 --> 01:01:08,731
I can't tell.

971
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,664
Lots of stopping
and starting, it seems.

972
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:12,168
Not much singing.

973
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:14,170
You sound very disapproving.

974
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:16,399
Oh, but I'm not.

975
01:01:16,474 --> 01:01:18,032
It will keep the ladies busy,

976
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:19,542
and that is good,

977
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,670
but the noise they will make!

978
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:27,016
It is not for someone...

979
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:29,678
who's heard the great
choirs of Leipzig and Vienna.

980
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:31,483
What are you doing?

981
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,750
You're pulling out
their gold fillings.

982
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:35,257
Quite right, my dear.

983
01:01:35,326 --> 01:01:38,261
They are of no further use
to their owners.

984
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:40,354
You should not be so squeamish...

985
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:41,693
with all that you have seen.

986
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:44,200
I think this takes the cake.

987
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:45,701
So this is how...

988
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,931
you get your whiskey
and cigarettes.

989
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:49,199
That is so,

990
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,468
and the small amount
of medicine that we have.

991
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,442
How do you think we get that,

992
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:55,206
theJapanese give it to us?

993
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,907
I trade with the guards.

994
01:01:57,982 --> 01:01:58,971
Ah!

995
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:00,813
Amazing, how strong.

996
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:03,979
Anyway, it's best
you know all this...

997
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,647
in case something happen to me.

998
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:07,156
What do you mean?

999
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,454
I should carry on doing this?

1000
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:12,894
Only if you want some
of the ladies in the camp...

1001
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,055
to stay alive. Ah!

1002
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:21,463
So what do you sing?

1003
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:22,733
Oh, um...

1004
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:25,241
it's all stuff I've never heard.

1005
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:26,606
Oh, uh, some...

1006
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:27,644
The- The New World?

1007
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:28,643
Dvorák?

1008
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:29,644
Yeah.

1009
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:30,737
They sing Dvorák?

1010
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:32,680
Yes, I think.

1011
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,843
You don't know Dvorák?

1012
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:37,854
What? They don't teach you
anything in Australia?

1013
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:39,651
Only about sheep?

1014
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:07,649
Aah!

1015
01:03:08,853 --> 01:03:10,047
Aah! Uhh!

1016
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:09,241
I have perhaps seen you before.

1017
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:11,781
I think not.

1018
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,282
I think so.

1019
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:18,117
The insolent lady
to whom I gave a ride.

1020
01:04:18,189 --> 01:04:21,955
Japanese soldiers
never attack women.

1021
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:24,460
You refused to bow to him.

1022
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:27,190
He struck you on the face,
quite rightly,

1023
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:30,427
then you struck him.

1024
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:37,196
No. He was drunk.
I could smell the sake.

1025
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:38,707
He grabbed me from behind-

1026
01:04:38,776 --> 01:04:39,834
Silence!

1027
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,070
Uhh!

1028
01:05:23,988 --> 01:05:27,082
Colonel Hirota say
incident with the lady...

1029
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,419
most regrettable,

1030
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:33,429
but is death
for strikeJapanese soldier.

1031
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:35,931
Lady have very bad manners.

1032
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,436
Manners very important
toJapanese people.

1033
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:42,438
That is all.

1034
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:51,448
You're starving and beating
woman and children.

1035
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:58,887
You steal our Red Cross
parcels for yourselves.

1036
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:02,392
You don't give us any
medicine for the sick,

1037
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:06,418
not even the quinine for the
bloody malaria everyone's got.

1038
01:06:06,497 --> 01:06:09,728
You make us work like slaves.

1039
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,634
You don't even let us
write to our families,

1040
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:16,400
and you have the cheek
to sit there...

1041
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,703
and lecture us on good manners!

1042
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:36,985
Tomorrow, lady will be executed.

1043
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:39,788
Please, please!

1044
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:42,696
You tell Colonel Hirota
that I saw what happened.

1045
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,631
The colonel knows that I'm a nun,

1046
01:06:44,702 --> 01:06:48,468
and nuns never tell lies.

1047
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,905
The lady only raises her hands...

1048
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:51,963
to protect herself-

1049
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:55,136
like this-
and then she hit him by accident,

1050
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:56,941
and he fell back
into the latrine.

1051
01:07:06,657 --> 01:07:08,591
Colonel Hirota say he regret,

1052
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:13,858
but the incident all dealt
with by Captain Tanaka.

1053
01:07:13,931 --> 01:07:16,900
Captain Tanaka
with Kempei-Tai.

1054
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,828
So Captain Tanaka
is in charge of this camp?

1055
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:28,377
I understood it was you,
Colonel Hirota.

1056
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:48,864
Two broken ribs
is not so bad.

1057
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:49,864
Better than...

1058
01:07:51,435 --> 01:07:52,697
Yes?

1059
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,637
You will not be able
to move around...

1060
01:07:55,706 --> 01:07:57,640
for maybe a week,
maybe two.

1061
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:58,640
That's impossible.

1062
01:07:58,709 --> 01:08:00,142
Everything's arranged
for Saturday.

1063
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,643
It's our anniversary.

1064
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:02,644
Anniversary?

1065
01:08:02,713 --> 01:08:03,907
We've been here two years.

1066
01:08:03,981 --> 01:08:05,141
Oh,

1067
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:06,648
what an anniversary.

1068
01:08:06,717 --> 01:08:08,981
Well, you do as you like.

1069
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:10,144
I'm only the doctor.

1070
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,653
I told a lie,

1071
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:13,155
but God will forgive me.

1072
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:17,159
I think He will even
congratulate me.

1073
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:19,491
I have some medicine.

1074
01:08:19,563 --> 01:08:20,495
Come.

1075
01:08:35,926 --> 01:08:36,893
Cheers.

1076
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:40,061
Oh!

1077
01:08:41,799 --> 01:08:44,825
Sister.

1078
01:08:44,902 --> 01:08:46,164
Whiskey?

1079
01:08:46,237 --> 01:08:48,171
I love whiskey.

1080
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,504
I'm a nun, not a saint.

1081
01:08:51,575 --> 01:08:53,406
And you, are you a saint?

1082
01:08:53,477 --> 01:08:56,344
No, no. That would
make me fall over.

1083
01:08:56,413 --> 01:08:59,780
Oh, I've never drunk whiskey before.

1084
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:01,784
Let us hope
that you do worse things...

1085
01:09:01,852 --> 01:09:03,149
in your life, darling. Prost.

1086
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,152
Bottoms up.
Prost.

1087
01:09:04,221 --> 01:09:05,620
Faith, you can do
very little with it...

1088
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:07,281
and nothing without it.

1089
01:09:07,358 --> 01:09:08,620
Cheers.

1090
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:14,896
Yes,Japanese whiskey, not scotch.

1091
01:09:14,965 --> 01:09:17,627
Still, we can't have everything.

1092
01:09:22,206 --> 01:09:23,639
You got some lipstick?

1093
01:09:23,707 --> 01:09:24,639
Orange?

1094
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,141
All the rage in Palembang.

1095
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,142
Look!

1096
01:09:27,211 --> 01:09:28,143
Oh!

1097
01:09:28,212 --> 01:09:30,476
Look at these!

1098
01:09:39,423 --> 01:09:42,790
Oh, gee, it's been a long time
since I kissed a man.

1099
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,293
There's nothing nicer.

1100
01:09:44,361 --> 01:09:45,794
Only one thing.

1101
01:09:45,863 --> 01:09:48,161
- Oh? Heh heh heh!
- Heh heh!

1102
01:09:55,139 --> 01:09:57,107
You look lovely, Helen.

1103
01:09:57,174 --> 01:10:00,109
Some man will be
very lucky one day.

1104
01:10:00,177 --> 01:10:01,610
Not if we stay here.

1105
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,271
Then we meet no one.

1106
01:10:03,347 --> 01:10:05,281
We shall not meet anyone.

1107
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:06,281
Shall.

1108
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:08,113
But we won't stay here.

1109
01:10:08,185 --> 01:10:12,121
One day we shall all go home.

1110
01:10:12,189 --> 01:10:13,281
Ja.

1111
01:10:42,019 --> 01:10:43,452
There's gonna be trouble.

1112
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,320
Japs won't take this lying down.

1113
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:48,358
Come on.

1114
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:23,856
I'm fallin' down like an old house.

1115
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:25,765
Would you look at me legs?

1116
01:15:25,836 --> 01:15:27,997
They look like
that little wooden man.

1117
01:15:28,071 --> 01:15:29,003
Pinocchio.

1118
01:15:29,072 --> 01:15:30,004
Aye.

1119
01:15:30,073 --> 01:15:31,506
That's the fellow.

1120
01:15:31,575 --> 01:15:33,065
Uh-oh. Winner...

1121
01:15:33,143 --> 01:15:35,941
of the 1944 Dale Carnegie
Charm School Award-

1122
01:15:36,013 --> 01:15:37,071
Tokyo division.

1123
01:15:45,322 --> 01:15:46,289
You!

1124
01:15:47,491 --> 01:15:48,753
No go!

1125
01:15:48,825 --> 01:15:50,793
Stay!

1126
01:15:50,861 --> 01:15:52,260
Topsy.

1127
01:18:25,615 --> 01:18:27,310
You like?

1128
01:18:48,638 --> 01:18:51,129
It's for you, from Chinese man.

1129
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:04,211
"My darling, I hope
this finds you well.

1130
01:19:04,287 --> 01:19:06,380
I'm in the camp
at Talang-Batu.

1131
01:19:06,456 --> 01:19:08,890
I'm escaping with
some of the Aussies.

1132
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:11,587
See you in Sydney.
Hotel Australia.

1133
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:13,492
All my love. "

1134
01:19:18,435 --> 01:19:21,337
Bugger the emperor.

1135
01:19:21,404 --> 01:19:22,894
- Edna?
- Yeah.

1136
01:19:22,973 --> 01:19:26,465
Fancy having a flag
with a poached egg on it.

1137
01:19:36,353 --> 01:19:40,119
Colonel Hirota proud
to report further victory...

1138
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:42,420
ofJapanese armed forces.

1139
01:19:42,492 --> 01:19:44,119
American imperialists...

1140
01:19:44,194 --> 01:19:47,129
removed from many Pacific Island,

1141
01:19:47,197 --> 01:19:49,927
and Australia bombed many times.

1142
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,365
Australian government...

1143
01:19:51,434 --> 01:19:53,595
want to make peace with Japan.

1144
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:55,103
That'll be the day.

1145
01:19:55,171 --> 01:19:57,366
Churchill and Roosevelt,

1146
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,170
number ten.

1147
01:20:00,243 --> 01:20:02,541
Emperor Hirohito,
Son of Heaven...

1148
01:20:02,612 --> 01:20:04,978
number one.

1149
01:20:17,427 --> 01:20:18,359
You!

1150
01:20:21,965 --> 01:20:23,227
You!

1151
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,826
Come here.

1152
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,765
Oh, no.

1153
01:20:31,836 --> 01:20:34,634
At least it's not me.

1154
01:20:45,082 --> 01:20:47,414
You spoke.

1155
01:20:47,485 --> 01:20:48,952
What did you say?

1156
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:52,922
I said, "Warm, isn't it,
for this time of year?"

1157
01:21:55,252 --> 01:21:56,514
Sorry.

1158
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:29,047
When you say to Captain Tanaka...

1159
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,953
that all wars end,

1160
01:22:32,022 --> 01:22:35,458
you tell him that perhaps
the invincibleJapanese Army...

1161
01:22:35,526 --> 01:22:36,959
will lose this one.

1162
01:22:37,027 --> 01:22:37,959
Who knows?

1163
01:22:38,028 --> 01:22:39,723
And if they do,

1164
01:22:39,797 --> 01:22:41,230
his treatment of this young woman...

1165
01:22:41,298 --> 01:22:43,061
will not result in the Allies...

1166
01:22:43,134 --> 01:22:44,624
building any shrines to him.

1167
01:22:44,702 --> 01:22:48,194
Maybe they even hang him.

1168
01:22:49,406 --> 01:22:51,271
Yes.

1169
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:54,903
I do not think
you are in a position...

1170
01:22:54,979 --> 01:22:57,072
to threaten Captain Tanaka.

1171
01:22:57,148 --> 01:22:58,581
Not a threat.

1172
01:22:58,649 --> 01:22:59,581
Advice only.

1173
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:01,413
I'm his ally.

1174
01:23:01,485 --> 01:23:03,077
You tell him.

1175
01:23:03,154 --> 01:23:06,521
I think it's impossible.

1176
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:09,081
Oh, I can understand this,

1177
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,060
but, you try,

1178
01:23:11,128 --> 01:23:12,060
yes?

1179
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:28,401
Uhh!

1180
01:24:57,534 --> 01:24:59,502
Lift her up.

1181
01:25:02,673 --> 01:25:05,267
Oh, my dear...

1182
01:25:05,342 --> 01:25:07,776
that's one to tell
your grandchildren.

1183
01:25:07,845 --> 01:25:09,779
Oh, I knew he was bluffing.

1184
01:25:09,847 --> 01:25:11,212
Yeah, show-off.

1185
01:26:25,155 --> 01:26:27,089
It's just humming, that's all.

1186
01:26:27,157 --> 01:26:28,920
Anybody could do that.

1187
01:27:22,246 --> 01:27:23,338
Miss Drummond.

1188
01:27:23,414 --> 01:27:24,346
Come.

1189
01:27:24,415 --> 01:27:25,677
Bravo!

1190
01:27:29,987 --> 01:27:31,079
Marvelous.

1191
01:27:31,155 --> 01:27:33,089
I loved it.

1192
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:35,591
Brava!

1193
01:27:37,161 --> 01:27:39,095
Do you know, Miss Drummond,

1194
01:27:39,163 --> 01:27:42,098
I just realized I don't know
your Christian name.

1195
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,258
It's Daisy.

1196
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:44,766
I've always hated it.

1197
01:27:44,835 --> 01:27:46,268
I wanted to be called Margaret.

1198
01:27:46,336 --> 01:27:47,769
Well, then, Margaret it is.

1199
01:27:47,838 --> 01:27:48,998
Why not?

1200
01:27:54,211 --> 01:27:55,735
A gift...

1201
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:58,304
from Colonel Hirota.

1202
01:27:58,382 --> 01:27:59,474
Soap.

1203
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,074
Oh, thank you.

1204
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:04,086
Oh, this will go a long way
among 300 of us.

1205
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:07,089
Colonel Hirota say
you will please to sing...

1206
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:08,647
oneJapanese folk song.

1207
01:28:08,725 --> 01:28:10,158
Tell him no.

1208
01:28:10,227 --> 01:28:11,660
Oh...

1209
01:28:11,728 --> 01:28:14,663
but this is very
difficult to say.

1210
01:28:14,731 --> 01:28:16,665
Tell him my appreciation
of theJapanese culture...

1211
01:28:16,733 --> 01:28:18,360
is at a low ebb.

1212
01:28:20,137 --> 01:28:23,470
I think I make
some other reason.

1213
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,098
As you wish.

1214
01:28:31,148 --> 01:28:34,083
You don't hate them, do you?

1215
01:28:34,151 --> 01:28:35,584
Why not?

1216
01:28:35,652 --> 01:28:38,086
I've tried, but I just can't...

1217
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:40,089
bring myself to hate people.

1218
01:28:40,157 --> 01:28:42,091
The worse they behave,

1219
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,593
the sorrier I feel for them.

1220
01:28:57,875 --> 01:28:59,308
Are you comfortable, Mrs. O'Riordan?

1221
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:01,037
I'm all right. Gently.

1222
01:29:01,111 --> 01:29:02,203
No go!

1223
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:03,712
Boys no go! Too big.

1224
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:04,872
- Go men's camp.
- What?

1225
01:29:07,618 --> 01:29:08,710
No!

1226
01:29:08,785 --> 01:29:10,377
Mom, please!

1227
01:29:10,454 --> 01:29:12,445
It'll be all right!

1228
01:29:12,523 --> 01:29:14,957
Don't let anybody
push you around.

1229
01:29:22,533 --> 01:29:23,625
Ugh!

1230
01:29:35,546 --> 01:29:37,480
So, Mr. Tomio...

1231
01:29:37,548 --> 01:29:38,981
where are we going now?

1232
01:29:39,049 --> 01:29:40,482
Yes, what's happening?

1233
01:29:40,551 --> 01:29:41,711
I don't know.

1234
01:29:41,785 --> 01:29:43,047
I think you do know.

1235
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,111
No, I don't.

1236
01:29:45,188 --> 01:29:46,621
Tell us something, Mr. Tomio.

1237
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:47,816
Be a man.

1238
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,531
General MacArthur
back in Philippines.

1239
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:59,000
ChaseJapanese soldier all over place.

1240
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:08,771
Try it.

1241
01:30:12,082 --> 01:30:13,447
Ohh!

1242
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:17,552
I always wanted
to be an engineer,

1243
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:20,055
but my father wanted me to be a nun.

1244
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,556
Don't worry. I love God,

1245
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,559
even though I sometimes
wonder what He's doing.

1246
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:24,559
Here.

1247
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,027
Arigato.

1248
01:30:26,096 --> 01:30:27,529
If my guys are coming,

1249
01:30:27,598 --> 01:30:29,031
why don't theJaps just go...

1250
01:30:29,099 --> 01:30:30,532
and leave us here?

1251
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:32,034
I don't think they've
ever done anything...

1252
01:30:32,102 --> 01:30:33,228
that made much sense.

1253
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,790
It's the satin sheet brigade.

1254
01:31:19,569 --> 01:31:22,595
I knew I should've
joined that bunch.

1255
01:31:22,672 --> 01:31:25,641
I think maybe we all should've.

1256
01:31:51,801 --> 01:31:55,737
Up there is the mountains
of Loebok Lingau.

1257
01:31:55,805 --> 01:31:58,239
My father would
take us there...

1258
01:31:58,308 --> 01:31:59,741
in the summer.

1259
01:31:59,809 --> 01:32:02,744
In the jungle,
there are many tigers.

1260
01:32:02,812 --> 01:32:05,246
At night we close
all the windows and doors,

1261
01:32:05,315 --> 01:32:07,749
or they come in the house.

1262
01:32:07,817 --> 01:32:10,251
I lie there and I hear them...

1263
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,254
walk up and down the verandah.

1264
01:32:12,322 --> 01:32:13,755
Pom, pom.

1265
01:32:13,823 --> 01:32:15,256
So heavy they are.

1266
01:32:15,325 --> 01:32:17,486
I can hear them breathing...

1267
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,755
through the other side of the shutter.

1268
01:32:20,997 --> 01:32:22,931
One morning, I opened the door...

1269
01:32:22,999 --> 01:32:26,127
and a big tiger is sleeping
on the front stoop.

1270
01:32:26,202 --> 01:32:27,760
Oh.

1271
01:32:29,406 --> 01:32:30,498
Ahh.

1272
01:32:30,573 --> 01:32:32,006
I spent my summers...

1273
01:32:32,075 --> 01:32:34,509
at my family's home in Dorset.

1274
01:32:34,577 --> 01:32:36,010
No tigers.

1275
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:37,512
Just rain.

1276
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:40,515
Soft days, we called them.

1277
01:32:41,584 --> 01:32:43,518
That's where I met Dennis.

1278
01:32:43,586 --> 01:32:44,848
We were 17,

1279
01:32:44,921 --> 01:32:46,411
and he was my
school friend's brother.

1280
01:32:46,489 --> 01:32:47,922
I thought he was
the best-looking boy...

1281
01:32:47,991 --> 01:32:49,424
I'd ever seen,

1282
01:32:49,492 --> 01:32:50,789
but it took him so long to kiss me,

1283
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,293
I thought it was
never going to happen.

1284
01:32:52,362 --> 01:32:53,693
And then it did?

1285
01:32:53,763 --> 01:32:54,855
Oh, yes!

1286
01:32:54,931 --> 01:32:56,364
Ha ha ha!

1287
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,795
We were in
my father's study.

1288
01:32:59,869 --> 01:33:01,302
I nearly fainted.

1289
01:33:01,371 --> 01:33:02,804
We were so young,

1290
01:33:02,872 --> 01:33:05,807
they didn't want us
to see each other,

1291
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:08,810
so we pretended
we weren't in love.

1292
01:33:08,878 --> 01:33:11,312
So you keep seeing each other?

1293
01:33:11,381 --> 01:33:12,473
Oh, yes.

1294
01:33:12,549 --> 01:33:15,040
We didn't fool anybody.

1295
01:33:15,118 --> 01:33:19,054
I realized love is like a flame.

1296
01:33:19,122 --> 01:33:22,216
It burns and is visible to all.

1297
01:33:31,134 --> 01:33:32,999
Ah.

1298
01:33:50,253 --> 01:33:51,242
Be careful.

1299
01:33:53,423 --> 01:33:54,788
Are you all right?

1300
01:34:08,838 --> 01:34:10,430
Is Susan here?

1301
01:36:51,634 --> 01:36:52,726
Ugh!

1302
01:36:52,802 --> 01:36:54,736
If I ever get out of this,

1303
01:36:54,804 --> 01:36:57,432
I'll never say a word
against New Jersey.

1304
01:36:57,507 --> 01:36:59,941
You'll never get out of this.

1305
01:37:00,009 --> 01:37:02,944
None of us will ever leave Sumatra.

1306
01:37:11,054 --> 01:37:13,682
Come on.
A little towards me.

1307
01:37:13,756 --> 01:37:14,950
That's it.

1308
01:37:24,067 --> 01:37:25,967
Snake!

1309
01:37:26,035 --> 01:37:27,127
Aah! Where?

1310
01:37:28,538 --> 01:37:29,630
Snake.

1311
01:37:33,042 --> 01:37:35,408
Kill it. We'll eat it.

1312
01:37:35,478 --> 01:37:36,570
Aah!

1313
01:37:39,248 --> 01:37:40,875
Don't give up now.

1314
01:37:42,085 --> 01:37:44,019
Dennis "vouldn't" want that.

1315
01:37:44,087 --> 01:37:45,486
Wouldn't.

1316
01:37:48,024 --> 01:37:50,959
Rosemary, remember,
we are going to Lord's...

1317
01:37:51,027 --> 01:37:54,463
to watch the gentlemens play cricket.

1318
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:57,260
Then we have some tea.

1319
01:38:02,538 --> 01:38:05,063
Snake's not so bad.

1320
01:38:05,141 --> 01:38:07,075
The grasshopper's delicious.

1321
01:38:11,481 --> 01:38:14,279
Wonder what Bing Crosby's up to now.

1322
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:16,784
Bing Crosby? Why?

1323
01:38:16,853 --> 01:38:19,185
I miss him. That's all.

1324
01:38:19,255 --> 01:38:22,383
Beaut he is, Bing Crosby.

1325
01:38:23,593 --> 01:38:27,393
We must get
the orchestra started again.

1326
01:38:27,463 --> 01:38:29,397
We've got to have a rehearsal.

1327
01:38:29,465 --> 01:38:30,397
Oh.

1328
01:38:30,466 --> 01:38:33,026
Yes, of course, Margaret.

1329
01:38:33,102 --> 01:38:36,003
Show theJapanese we're still alive.

1330
01:38:37,607 --> 01:38:39,598
Still got some spirit left.

1331
01:38:41,544 --> 01:38:42,977
That bloody choir.

1332
01:38:43,046 --> 01:38:44,479
Totally exhausted everyone.

1333
01:38:44,547 --> 01:38:47,539
They won't be able
to find enough people now...

1334
01:38:47,617 --> 01:38:49,050
for a barbershop quartet.

1335
01:38:49,118 --> 01:38:50,551
Oh, shut up, Harriet.

1336
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:51,712
Shut up?

1337
01:38:51,788 --> 01:38:53,722
You were bullied
into joining by Adrienne.

1338
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:54,882
That's true.

1339
01:38:54,957 --> 01:38:57,949
Best thing that
ever happened to me.

1340
01:39:03,633 --> 01:39:04,759
Here you are, Mummy.

1341
01:39:08,704 --> 01:39:11,138
Mummy, you have to eat something.

1342
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:17,144
No, dear.

1343
01:39:17,213 --> 01:39:20,148
I really don't mind dying.

1344
01:39:20,216 --> 01:39:21,911
No.

1345
01:39:23,219 --> 01:39:26,154
I learned a great deal in the camp.

1346
01:39:28,724 --> 01:39:32,387
I did nothing, you know, in Singapore.

1347
01:39:32,462 --> 01:39:35,260
Mummy, you're not going to die.

1348
01:39:35,331 --> 01:39:37,094
Yes, dear...

1349
01:39:37,166 --> 01:39:38,724
I am.

1350
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:45,106
I'm really sorry that I won't see...

1351
01:39:45,174 --> 01:39:48,940
your dear father again.

1352
01:39:50,179 --> 01:39:53,114
I have so much to tell him.

1353
01:39:55,084 --> 01:39:57,314
So much.

1354
01:40:33,956 --> 01:40:35,048
Doctor.

1355
01:40:36,359 --> 01:40:37,451
Rosemary.

1356
01:40:38,628 --> 01:40:41,062
The beautiful English girl.

1357
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:43,792
Paradise Road.

1358
01:40:43,866 --> 01:40:46,232
Tomorrow...

1359
01:40:46,302 --> 01:40:48,202
perhaps tonight.

1360
01:40:48,271 --> 01:40:50,205
Sometimes God reaches down...

1361
01:40:50,273 --> 01:40:52,207
and pulls the wings
off his butterflies.

1362
01:40:52,275 --> 01:40:53,799
Wh-What is it?

1363
01:40:53,876 --> 01:40:56,310
She doesn't want to live anymore.

1364
01:40:56,379 --> 01:40:58,813
Perhaps now she realizes
the world is not a place...

1365
01:40:58,881 --> 01:41:01,543
where lovers are reunited
and good always wins.

1366
01:41:01,617 --> 01:41:04,051
She saw her husband
at the railway yard.

1367
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,445
The great love affair.

1368
01:41:06,813 --> 01:41:11,614
I can't say I'd pine away
over any of my husbands.

1369
01:41:11,685 --> 01:41:13,983
If I fall in love,

1370
01:41:14,054 --> 01:41:16,852
then I hope
it is like that.

1371
01:41:18,658 --> 01:41:20,888
Good luck, my dear.

1372
01:41:29,569 --> 01:41:33,096
"Father, in captivity...

1373
01:41:33,173 --> 01:41:35,107
we would lift
our prayer to Thee.

1374
01:41:35,175 --> 01:41:37,268
Keep us ever in Thy love.

1375
01:41:37,344 --> 01:41:40,108
Grant that daily we may prove...

1376
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:42,614
those who place
their trust in Thee,

1377
01:41:42,682 --> 01:41:45,014
more than conquerors may be.

1378
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:49,648
Give us patience to endure.

1379
01:41:49,723 --> 01:41:52,453
Keep our hearts serene and pure.

1380
01:41:52,526 --> 01:41:55,791
Grant us courage, charity,

1381
01:41:55,862 --> 01:41:57,955
greater faith, humility.

1382
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:01,133
Readiness to own Thy will,

1383
01:42:01,201 --> 01:42:03,999
be we free or captive still. "

1384
01:42:05,138 --> 01:42:06,230
Amen.

1385
01:42:06,306 --> 01:42:08,740
Amen.

1386
01:42:46,746 --> 01:42:48,475
What are you doing?

1387
01:42:48,548 --> 01:42:51,381
The French eat snails, don't they?

1388
01:42:51,451 --> 01:42:53,783
Yes, but I think those
ones will make you sick.

1389
01:43:15,208 --> 01:43:16,641
I'm here, Margaret.

1390
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:19,144
You can't die now.

1391
01:43:19,212 --> 01:43:21,077
Not now.

1392
01:43:28,321 --> 01:43:31,051
She's asking for something.

1393
01:43:32,726 --> 01:43:34,694
"The Lord is my Shepherd.

1394
01:43:35,762 --> 01:43:37,195
I shall not want.

1395
01:43:37,264 --> 01:43:41,064
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1396
01:43:41,134 --> 01:43:44,069
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

1397
01:43:44,137 --> 01:43:46,662
He restoreth my soul.

1398
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:49,106
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness...

1399
01:43:49,176 --> 01:43:50,609
for His name's sake.

1400
01:43:50,677 --> 01:43:53,111
Yea, though I walk
through the valley...

1401
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,943
of the shadow of death,

1402
01:43:55,015 --> 01:43:56,949
I will fear no evil,

1403
01:43:57,017 --> 01:43:58,484
for Thou art with me.

1404
01:43:58,552 --> 01:44:01,487
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

1405
01:44:01,555 --> 01:44:03,989
Thou preparest
a table before me...

1406
01:44:04,057 --> 01:44:05,718
in the presence
of mine enemies.

1407
01:44:05,792 --> 01:44:08,022
Thou anointest
my head with oil.

1408
01:44:08,094 --> 01:44:10,528
My cup runneth over.

1409
01:44:10,597 --> 01:44:13,532
Surely goodness and mercy
will follow me...

1410
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,932
all the days of my life,

1411
01:44:16,002 --> 01:44:17,435
and I will dwell...

1412
01:44:17,504 --> 01:44:20,439
in the House of the Lord forever. "

1413
01:44:31,117 --> 01:44:33,142
That's what I wanted.

1414
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:34,551
Amen.

1415
01:45:45,025 --> 01:45:46,959
The war...

1416
01:45:47,027 --> 01:45:49,052
is over.

1417
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:54,930
Who won?

1418
01:45:55,001 --> 01:45:57,128
Once more...

1419
01:45:57,203 --> 01:46:00,195
we can be friend.

1420
01:46:02,442 --> 01:46:05,969
I have done my best for you.

1421
01:46:08,481 --> 01:46:09,641
I know,

1422
01:46:11,318 --> 01:46:12,808
not enough.

1423
01:46:14,988 --> 01:46:17,718
But I could do no more.

1424
01:46:54,694 --> 01:46:56,855
We weren't number ten.

1425
01:46:59,733 --> 01:47:01,166
Oh, Tillie!

1426
01:47:03,536 --> 01:47:04,969
Does this mean...

1427
01:47:05,038 --> 01:47:06,972
it's back to picking up
groceries, laundry,

1428
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,974
and all that? My God!

1429
01:47:09,042 --> 01:47:10,532
For you, my dear.

1430
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:12,544
For me, it is luxury hotels...

1431
01:47:12,612 --> 01:47:14,944
and limousine cars. Yes.

1432
01:47:15,014 --> 01:47:16,538
Dr. Verstak.

1433
01:47:16,616 --> 01:47:19,050
Yes, Macarthy.

1434
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,144
Are you really a doctor?

1435
01:47:21,221 --> 01:47:22,654
Yes and no.

1436
01:47:22,722 --> 01:47:26,055
My husband is a medical doctor.

1437
01:47:26,126 --> 01:47:28,219
I'm doctor of philosophy.

1438
01:47:29,629 --> 01:47:32,564
I hurt no one. Maybe I help.

1439
01:47:32,632 --> 01:47:34,827
Is wanting to survive so bad?

1440
01:47:34,901 --> 01:47:36,596
Susan.

1441
01:47:39,606 --> 01:47:40,698
Dear Susan.

1442
01:47:42,409 --> 01:47:43,501
Well...

1443
01:47:43,576 --> 01:47:45,009
we made it.

1444
01:47:45,078 --> 01:47:46,511
Yes, we did.

1445
01:47:46,579 --> 01:47:48,103
Some of us.

1446
01:47:59,859 --> 01:48:01,793
I can't believe it!
