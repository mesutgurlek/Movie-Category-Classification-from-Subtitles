1
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,176
The latest tanks, planes and artillery
are loaded on board transports...

2
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,984
to be shipped to the Libyan desert.

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,566
Where they will disembark
at the coastal fortress of Tobruk.

4
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,136
Tobruk...

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,710
the respectable stronghold of
allied resistance in North Africa

6
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:28,114
from which allied troops...

7
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:31,912
throw down their comforts,
to submerge track effort decor.

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,320
And now our boys are over there...

9
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:38,142
with teams of combat
experience in desert conditions.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,200
Side by side,
with their British comrades,

11
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,686
against a Nazi war machine.

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,240
And they're looking forward to...

13
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:49,244
wiping the smile off,
General Rommels face.

14
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,242
Waco! Let's go!
Let's go!

15
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,352
Come on!

16
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:35,602
This is U.S. Tactical Tank to Unit 5.
Repeat message.

17
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:40,752
U.S. Tactical Tank for Unit 5.
Repeat. Over to you. Over.

18
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,012
Sarge!

19
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:47,102
Get up! Come on!
Stand up!

20
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:48,342
Come on!

21
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:56,864
I don't understand.
Do we go south?

22
00:01:57,304 --> 00:01:59,872
[ radio indistinct ]

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,084
Come on! Get in here!

24
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,092
Down!

25
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:15,090
Come on.

26
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,406
Okay, okay, but what's the order?

27
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,484
[ indistinct radio chatter ]

28
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,774
..... <i> Get the hell out of there! </i>

29
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:29,088
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

30
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,148
"As a walk in the sun"
Get in this thing and ...

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,232
see how this baby works in the sand,
and that's what they said.

32
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:52,104
Hey, Sarge. We're in trouble.
- Yeah?

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,232
What, is that a wild guess?

34
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:58,562
General retreat order. Points to the west
and north are under enemy control.

35
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,082
We're boxed in.

36
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,166
We're still going south then, hey Jimmy?

37
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:06,084
Get down, and give us a hand.

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,678
What are we going to do, if we
can't get the cement-mixer rolling?

39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,404
Hey, what did I tell you
about that cement-mixer stuff?

40
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,548
Lay off that.

41
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,094
She's sensitive.

42
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,764
Give me a screwdriver.

43
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,894
What's in that stuff, a Pináta?

44
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:21,924
What stuff?

45
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:22,928
Nothing.

46
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,112
It can't be just nothing.

47
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:25,890
Rocks, sand, nothing.

48
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:27,962
He does his own
god damn shopping.

49
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:32,906
Well, if they keep that up,
they're liable to hit us.

50
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:34,762
She going to get us out of here, Joe?

51
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,432
Uh, she's a lady now.

52
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,118
Now, you gotta treat her like a lady.

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,008
Alright, get up there and give it a try.

54
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,764
Cement-mixer.
- Yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:44,240
I'll tell you.

56
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:46,560
No woman sounded this sweet,

57
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:49,456
as this baby is gonna sound,
when she gets rolling.

58
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:52,452
Alright, Jimmy. Give it a try!

59
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,054
God damn it.

60
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,108
Aw, come on Jimmy.

61
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,014
Come on, Jimmy!

62
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:09,578
He's not feeding her right.

63
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:12,484
More atriums for
the woman after the dinner.

64
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:16,366
Come on, Waco. Hold on to this. Push
on the contacts, while I give it a try.

65
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:22,144
Hey!

66
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:23,780
You said go.

67
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:26,654
I said, get out of there.
Get out of there!

68
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:34,112
Come on, LuLu Belle.
Come on.

69
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:37,022
Come on. Get us out of here.

70
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:39,002
Come on, keep going.

71
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:42,458
Come on, LuLu Belle.
Come on, sweetheart. You can do it.

72
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,102
LuLu Belle, come on.
Don't let me down now.

73
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:51,548
LuLu Belle.. !
Come on! Here we go!

74
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:54,126
Ahh!

75
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:57,322
Waco! Come on. Let's go!

76
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,112
Waco! Come on in here!

77
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,602
He's hurt, Joe!

78
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,346
You gonna make it?

79
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,902
Yeah, I'll be all right.

80
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,006
What happened?

81
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,904
She bit me, Joe!

82
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:19,752
Well, some women are like that, kid.

83
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:21,004
Ask Abby.

84
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:50,846
Let's see, what this is about?

85
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:52,002
Go.

86
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:58,104
Jimmy, stay on that radio.
- Sure.

87
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:15,766
Sgt. Gunn,
U.S. Army Tactical Tank.

88
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,870
Capt. Halliday,
Royal Army Medical Corp.

89
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:21,440
Where's uh ...the rest of
your unit, Sergeant?

90
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:24,122
Well, you're looking at it.

91
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,946
My gunner got hurt.

92
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:28,780
Anyone around here help him out?

93
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:31,842
Yes, of course, I can.
Come here, private.

94
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:38,294
Thank you, sir.

95
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:45,010
Well, looks like, we're not the
only one's, who took a beating.

96
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:47,340
I had 42 wounded.

97
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:51,108
By the time the Stuttgart stopped
bombing, I had 42 dead.

98
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:53,952
I guess that Red Cross, doesn't
mean anything, anymore, huh?

99
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:55,866
That's a nasty cut.

100
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:57,886
How did it happen?

101
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:59,904
LuLu Belle bit me, sir.

102
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,574
LuLu Belle?

103
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:03,772
That's the Tank, sir.

104
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:11,894
What's your problem?

105
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:13,920
Problem?

106
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,934
Cigarette?

107
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,952
Here. Help yourself.

108
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,888
Merci.

109
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:23,786
Oh, American ci,
I don't see for a long time.

110
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,902
Pass them around.

111
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:29,218
I'm afraid that's the
best I can do, private.

112
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,184
How you doin', Waco?

113
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:32,794
I'll be alright, Sarge.

114
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:37,242
You know, we can use
all the water you can spare?

115
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,978
Well ...

116
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,906
I'm afraid you are out of luck, sergeant.
Our entire supply was destroyed.

117
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,446
All we have left, is
what's in our canteens.

118
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:52,764
These men under your command, sir?

119
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:55,642
Stragglers, like yourself.
Trying to rejoin their outfit.

120
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:57,598
It's too late for that.

121
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,194
There's been a General Retreat Ordered.
Haven't you got a radio?

122
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:02,162
Had one, sergeant.

123
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:04,904
That gunfire doesn't sound
like a Retreat to me.

124
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,910
Those are German guns, mopping up.

125
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:09,908
Look, we're cutting south.

126
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:14,322
We figure, we can link up with another
outfit until we can turn and make a stand.

127
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,874
South?

128
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:20,312
South is the guitar of the prescence, sergeant.
It's the worse piece of desert in Libya.

129
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,914
How far do think you will get in a tin can?

130
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:25,922
That's my Tank, private.

131
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,860
She's a good Tank.

132
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:29,944
And right now, she's the only
ticket you got out of here.

133
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,114
No one had considered Retreat, sergeant.

134
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:36,002
You're new to the desert.
We've been here for awhile

135
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,960
Much better to dig in and
wait for re-inforcements.

136
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:41,366
Re-inforcements?

137
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:42,976
What are you crazy?

138
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:44,320
We just got our ass kicked.

139
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:50,408
I'm sorry sir, but you have been cut off.
And south, is the only way out.

140
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:54,112
Instead of south, I'm for digging in, sir.
Better then running scared in a tin coffin.

141
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:55,328
Good luck.

142
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,002
First, we ain't runnin'.
We're obeying orders.

143
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:03,112
Second, she's not made out of tin.
Third she's no ones coffin.

144
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:06,108
She's an M3 air-cooled Lee.

145
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:10,880
She can cross 200 miles of desert as easy as
you can take a stroll in Picadilly circus.

146
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:13,780
It would be good for
before the war, Sgt.

147
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:18,994
And uh, .. Picadilly is in London.
I'm from Sundargarh.

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,102
That will do, gentlemen.

149
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,662
Look, you can either ride with me or see
Berlin from the inside of a prison camp.

150
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:29,882
Me? I'm going into Berlin right
on the top of LuLu Belle, there.

151
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,994
Now, south is the only way out
and that's the way we're going.

152
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:35,764
Head south, until we
can turn and make a stand.

153
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:47,788
Good luck, Captain.
Come on Waco.

154
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:49,704
Sargente!

155
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:55,402
I go with you.

156
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:58,104
Why?

157
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:01,906
I like your cigarettes.

158
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:06,296
It's transporte.
We don't have any.

159
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,450
Alright, mount on top.

160
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,008
Merci.

161
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:13,994
Alright men, we can
go with the Americans.

162
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:15,960
Get your gear.
Hurry it up.

163
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:17,880
Jimmy, wind her up!

164
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,904
Is he any good, this Sergeant?

165
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:45,454
Is you're Sergeant, any good?

166
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,508
The best.

167
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,462
Joe's a smart guy. Just don't say
nothing bad about the Tank.

168
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,112
Sounds alot like a tractor
my father used to have.

169
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:56,890
Don't call it a tractor.

170
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,980
That's my girl. Kathy.

171
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:05,546
She got a sister?

172
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:10,448
The last thing she said to me was,
"Stay out of trouble, mate."

173
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,580
Did Sgt. Gunn say, out
of trouble or into trouble, Jimmy?

174
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:21,890
Yeah.

175
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:30,066
Come on, come on baby.

176
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,684
What's the problem?

177
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:39,604
I think I cut the mixture a little thin.
Tried to save on gas.

178
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:42,220
Alright.

179
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:45,710
Waco!
Tell them they can stretch their legs.

180
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:48,878
Jimmy!
Get down here on the radio.

181
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:55,488
If I was you all,
you can come down now.

182
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:04,998
Frenchy !

183
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:08,104
Go for that slope over there
and keep a look-out.

184
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:11,106
Alright, we're only going to
be here for a few minutes.

185
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:12,502
Better eat something.

186
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:15,202
Drink a third of a cup of water apiece.

187
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,112
Be sure to measure that water in a cup.

188
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,842
Waco. Get my mess kit.

189
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:32,744
Aw .... babe.

190
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:35,320
Starving you to death, ain't I?

191
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:39,884
Well, I know you need gas.

192
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,988
Not as bad as we need water.

193
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,686
Tobruk.
That's where I'd head for.

194
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,744
Dais sever.
This sand, it's a death trap.

195
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,604
Except, we're not headed for Tobruk.

196
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,240
This Tank has saved us alot of days.

197
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,112
More than you and
I've done anyways, in a minute.

198
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:05,906
Listen to it.
The voice of playing the game.

199
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,996
Sgt. Gunn, he knows what he is doing.

200
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:12,896
Yeah, well, I grew up in the Outbacks son.
And the sergeant's a new-born in the desert.

201
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:15,800
Jimmy!

202
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,986
- Yeah.
Get anything on the radio yet?

203
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,324
Nothing but static and a Heil Hitler.

204
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,544
Well. we're not getting
anything on the radio,

205
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:26,080
so we don't know where
they are going to take a stand.

206
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,632
Well, Tobruk's my bet.
It's never fallen.

207
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,796
Have we enough petro-oil for there?

208
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,988
Well, we got enough for about 160 miles.

209
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:35,990
What we need is water.

210
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,896
Hey!

211
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,344
I thought I told you
to measure that in a cup.

212
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:42,658
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

213
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:46,492
Waco, take their canteens
and bring them to me!

214
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,002
Now, you just hang on a second, sergeant.

215
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:52,890
We got our own officer here.
And we take our orders from him.

216
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:55,960
A complainer, huh?

217
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,108
No, a soldier.

218
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,402
A lousy soldier,
you don't take orders well at all.

219
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:04,898
Well, ever heard of chain of command.
He out ranks you.

220
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,490
Sergeant Gunn is in command of the Tank.

221
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:10,290
It's his job to get us through the desert safely.
So, you will take your orders from him.

222
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,992
And it only comes from him.

223
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:14,970
Thank you, sir.

224
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:20,112
However, I will continue to consult with you
on the progress of this expedition, sergeant.

225
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:23,902
My canteen.

226
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:25,890
Yes, sir.

227
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:29,990
Waco, pick up the canteens!

228
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:34,608
Move out!

229
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,666
Sargente!
Sargente!

230
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:48,722
Over there Sargente!
Over there!

231
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:51,912
What can you make out, Sarge?

232
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:57,832
Well, I think for the first time,
we got somebody out-numbered.

233
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:01,220
Frenchy!
Send them a postcard!

234
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,558
That's a British Sudanese soldier, sergeant.

235
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:17,544
And an Italian prisoner.

236
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:19,900
I think he's coming after us.

237
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,642
One of you guys give me
something white, to wave.

238
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:27,112
We know when we're licked.

239
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,804
Get up!

240
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:37,890
Come forward!

241
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:48,242
Sgt. Major Tambul,
Fourth Sudanese Battalion.

242
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:52,112
Well, Tambul,
you had us scared.

243
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,040
But it is true, Bimbashi? To think
I capture me an enemy Tank.

244
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:01,542
Where is the rest of
your outfit, Sgt. Major?

245
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,762
They come with many machines.
Many tanks fell upon us there.

246
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:09,894
All my men died in battle.

247
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:14,338
I escaped ...and captured
this man to carry my pack.

248
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,852
Do you know the desert?

249
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:19,012
Yes, sergeant.

250
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:22,042
We need water. Can you
guide us to the nearest well?

251
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:25,324
Yes, there is one in area.
Very old.

252
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,378
Very hard to find.

253
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:32,854
Leads to a well in Sadi Barrani.

254
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,878
Is there water there?

255
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:36,904
It is possible, sergeant.

256
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,112
Can you take us there, Sergeant Major?

257
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:44,142
Allah is my guide, I can only try.

258
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:46,342
Excellent.
- Alright.

259
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:50,766
Ok, Tambul. You ride up front.
- Yes, sergeant.

260
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:54,012
Waco!
Wind this thing up!

261
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:56,868
Jimmy!
Throw me down a can of rations!

262
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Sargento, I have a wife
and family in Italy.

263
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,100
I speak English. Good English.

264
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,100
Go on, here. No room.

265
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,900
If you leave me here, I die.

266
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,600
Look, you head north and you might
get lucky and join up with the Germans.

267
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,500
My cousin lives in America. He works
in a factory that produces steel...

268
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,900
Waco, wind this thing up!

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
Probably he manufactured
the steel for this Tank ...

270
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Out of my way.

271
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,800
Look, a letter from my wife.
A photograph here, of my wife.

272
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,200
We have no time for your photographs!

273
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,700
Jimmy, give me half-full canteen.

274
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:36,200
Sergeant, this man is a prisoner of war.
We must take him with us.

275
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,200
We are moving on. We are leaving.
Mount up, sir.

276
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,402
Be kinder to put a bullet
in him now.

277
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:42,982
- I thought about it.

278
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,754
Now look. This is
more than we can afford.

279
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:48,396
Now head north.

280
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,122
Sergeant, I protest!
You must not do this!

281
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:53,100
I made my decision, Captain!

282
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:56,200
You can't kill him in cold blood!
It's a man's life we're talking about.

283
00:18:56,264 --> 00:18:57,820
We're talking about nine lives. Theirs.

284
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:59,822
- Then ask them, see if
they agree with you.

285
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,352
They're not going to agree
with me now, Captain.

286
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:04,746
But when we run out of water
and dying of thirst ...

287
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:07,890
do you think they are going to
thank me for bringing this whop along?

288
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,002
It is about survival.

289
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:12,012
I thought that's why
you put me in charge, Captain?

290
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,990
Now, Mount up!

291
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:17,652
Sargeant, ....

292
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,106
- Let go!

293
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:22,084
Captain, ...please.
- No.

294
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:23,974
No, ...I'm sorry.

295
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,430
Lousy way to go.

296
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:30,288
The Sergeant is right.
It is stupid to have pity in war.

297
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,494
Waco, Move it!

298
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,100
I hope you sleep well,

299
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
you mangy dog, Sargeant!

300
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,900
Waco, Stop!

301
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Come on!

302
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,006
Come on, mate!

303
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,854
Hurry up!
Come on!

304
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,432
Give me your hand.

305
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,256
Sit down here.

306
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Thank you.

307
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:06,890
He's onboard, sergeant.

308
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,785
Waco, Let's go!

309
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:28,242
Bone dry.

310
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,906
It can't be.

311
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:31,894
Oh well, wasn't thirsty anyway.

312
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:34,102
Mind you, I wouldn't mind a
nice cold beer right now.

313
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,548
Shut your cake hole, will ya.

314
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,964
Suppose we dig?

315
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,002
It's no good, sergeant.

316
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:41,962
The water comes and goes.
The desert decides when to give life.

317
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:44,762
Besides, we only got
two canteens of water left.

318
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:47,540
Sergeant, now might be a good time
to consider turning back.

319
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:48,758
We're not done yet.

320
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:52,652
Tambul.
How far is the nearest well?

321
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:57,122
The ruins of Bir-Acroma.
It is a God forsaken place, Sergeant.

322
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:58,976
It's 70 miles south.

323
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:01,326
It's 70 miles in the Sahara.

324
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,986
Well, we gotta try.

325
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:05,974
And suppose the next well
is as dry as this one?

326
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,224
Eww ..Wee!

327
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:13,223
- You must think this is funny?
No, I don't think this is funny at all.

328
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:17,348
I was just thinking, when I was a kid,
the biggest treat I ever got ...

329
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,330
was going to the beach and
playing in the sand.

330
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:24,890
Jimmy, you got anything
on that radio, yet?

331
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:27,432
Nothing but
static and saur-kraut, Joe.

332
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:31,380
Nothing.

333
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,690
Hey lads, we got company!

334
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:36,784
It's not one of ours.
Move it!

335
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:41,008
Take cover!

336
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,456
He's coming back boys!

337
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,894
Let's go! Go on!

338
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,204
Why aren't we fighting back?

339
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,878
I want him to think,
we are out of ammunition.

340
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,772
Come on!
Let's go!

341
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,768
I think he will come in
lower this time.

342
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:03,744
Yahoo! Ha! Ha!
Yahoo!

343
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:06,740
We got him!

344
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:08,990
Nice shooting, Sergeant!

345
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:09,898
Yeah.

346
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,994
- There's a parachute.
The pilot bailed out!

347
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,252
Alright, Captain. Tambul.
Come with me.

348
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:30,424
Bates, you too.

349
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:51,652
Drop it! You heard me.
Drop that gun!

350
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:52,886
Drop the gun!

351
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,568
What the hell is he saying?
Anybody know what he is saying?

352
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:02,141
It's actually German, Sergeant.

353
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:05,322
What's he saying?

354
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:09,990
He's offering us the opportunity
to surrender, Sergeant.

355
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,112
Oh, he is, is he?

356
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:16,242
Drop the god damn gun !!

357
00:25:19,248 --> 00:25:20,824
Let the weapon fallen.

358
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,700
Tell him to put his hands on his head.

359
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:33,012
" Aber diene Hande uber diene Kopf. "

360
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,100
Put 'em up there.

361
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,900
Ask him if he speaks English.

362
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,584
" Sprech du Englisch? "

363
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:40,780
-Nein.

364
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:42,990
He got the message.

365
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:45,700
Tambul. Search him.

366
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,700
Herr Captain,
nicht mit diesem Mann.

367
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,600
He is objecting Sgt Major Tambul.

368
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,600
Seems he considers the Sergeant Major
to be of inferior race.

369
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Well he doesn't have to worry
about the Sergeant Major's color.

370
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,800
It won't rub off
on his nice clean uniform.

371
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,463
Search him Tambul ...

372
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,380
thoroughly!

373
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,100
Knife.

374
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,800
Oh, yes.

375
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,554
Here.

376
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Thought so.

377
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,800
And this, " Bimbashi."

378
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,700
It's in English. Propaganda drop
for our troops, no doubt.

379
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,900
" wave the white flag and
surrender your arms...

380
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,000
" your officers are incompetent fools..

381
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
" our victorious armies
are already cele ...

382
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,600
What? What is it?

383
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,400
it says they are celebrating
the fall of Tobruk.

384
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,800
Ja. Tobruk fallen. Tobruk kaputt.

385
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,900
Tobruk?
It's not possible, is it, sir?

386
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,800
Captain! Captain!
It's Clarkson, sir. He's been hit!

387
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,400
Tambul.
Bring him along.

388
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
How bad is it?

389
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,400
It's bad.

390
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,800
Well, we can't stay here.

391
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,800
If the flyboy is telling the truth there's
nothing stopping the German troops, now.

392
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,500
They'll be coming down,
right over the top of us.

393
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,100
I can't feel my legs.

394
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,000
Can he be moved?

395
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,800
Not till we stop the bleeding.

396
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,100
Jimmy, Get on that radio!

397
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,700
Right, Sarge.

398
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
The Gerry here, says Tobruk's fallen.

399
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,500
O' Blimey. If Tobruk's fallen,
they're a long way from us.

400
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,700
Short cockey's, that's us. Dingo bait.

401
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,000
Sargente,
what about the new prisoner?

402
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:09,000
What about him?

403
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,200
Suppose he has an accident.
We take a walk beyond that hill ...

404
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,200
and when you are ready to go,
I come back alone.

405
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,800
Enjoy your work, huh?

406
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,500
I have a tender heart too, Sargente.

407
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,300
But this ... this is a Nazi ...mad dog.
Nazis a mad dog.

408
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And one more mouth to give water.

409
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,300
I never let my tender heart get in
the way of what has to be done.

410
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,300
This kid has got an Iron Cross.
He's valuable.

411
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,800
I'm gonna hang onto him.

412
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,100
But I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna do, Frenchy.

413
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm going to make you responsible
that this kid stays in one piece.

414
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Understand, Sargente.

415
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Jimmy, did you get
anything on that radio!

416
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,500
It's confirmed. They took Tobruk.
They are attacking Sidi Barrani.

417
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,240
West is falling back trying to reform and
defend I Qatar along the El Alamein line.

418
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:13,894
That's where they are
going to make a stand.

419
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,600
That puts us on the wrong
side of the fence.

420
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,100
Something amusing you, Fritz?

421
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,800
Something I said, maybe?

422
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,000
Es ist nicht, was er sagte.

423
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,500
Vas des es amusement?

424
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,000
He said, we're riff raff.

425
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,440
Americanos, Englische,
Franzosa ......

426
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:45,300
Nigger.

427
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,322
If I see you smile again,

428
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:49,908
I'm going to punch your teeth
into the back of your neck.

429
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,602
And if I find out you're
lying to me flyboy ...

430
00:29:51,604 --> 00:29:54,010
I'm going to give you to
Frenchy there and see if he likes you.

431
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,762
And if you do not understand
a word I'm saying, ...

432
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:58,112
you got nothing to worry about.

433
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,600
Tambul.
70 miles to the next well?

434
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,800
That way, Sergeant.
We call it Hala Hara Shep.

435
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Left, Sergeant. Toward the left.
Toward the left!

436
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,100
You know, Joe.
I got a bad feeling.

437
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,700
We gotta trust Tambul.

438
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,900
Left, Sergeant! Left!

439
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:41,000
Left! Left!

440
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:49,900
Turn to the Left, Sergeant!

441
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,900
Bir Acroma!
It's Bir Acroma, Sergeant!

442
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,200
Bir Acroma.

443
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,400
Out, boys.

444
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,500
Sergeant, Clark will have to have water
soon or he won't last another day.

445
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,800
The rest can wait till later on.

446
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,600
- Tambul...
- Yes, Sergeant.

447
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,800
Where's that well?

448
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We must look for it.
But not until the storm has past.

449
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,300
Tambul, where?

450
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,500
Somewhere, Sergeant,
within the walls.

451
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,600
Alright, spread out and look for it.

452
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,500
Waco, stick with me.

453
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,400
Alright, Waco. Clear the rollers.
Grease those bogies.

454
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,000
We got a ways to go yet.

455
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,300
Right, Sarge.

456
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,300
Least we can do, huh, sweetheart?

457
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,500
" Bimbashi " The well!
The well!   The well!

458
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,198
The well!

459
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,500
Sarge! He found the well!

460
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,800
The well! The well!

461
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,600
Tambul. Climb on down there.

462
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,500
Give him a hand.

463
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,898
Quick!

464
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,500
Quick!
Send down a bucket!

465
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,500
Quick! Something to catch the water!

466
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,000
Quick! Something to catch the water!

467
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,300
Wait!
Tambul, use this!

468
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,900
Allah, be praised.

469
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,000
Send down a bucket!
A bucket!

470
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,498
Waco, go to the Tank and
get some mess kits ...

471
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,200
and some rope, quick.
- Yes, sergeant.

472
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,200
Água...grazie a Dio.

473
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,600
Ok. Raise it up very slowly.
Slowly.

474
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,100
Easy. Careful now.

475
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
The real stuff.

476
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,900
Alright.

477
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,898
Three swallows for each of us.

478
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
Only three swallows.

479
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,800
Waco, take that to the kid.
- Ok.

480
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,600
Here.

481
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There's a drink for you outside, sir.
I got one here for Mike.

482
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,600
Thank you Private.
You'll have to support him.

483
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:48,800
Ok.

484
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,400
Hey Buddy.

485
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,100
How you doing?

486
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,600
Here you go, Buddy.
Just a sip.

487
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,100
Sweet...
like a woman.

488
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,100
Thank you, Sergeant.

489
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,800
- Frenchy, go get yourself a drink.
- Thank you.

490
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,100
Kathy ...
Easy boy.

491
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,500
Kathy ...

492
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,000
I can see, Kathy.

493
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,100
You have us now, Mike.
You're gonna be just fine.

494
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,400
I don't want to lose you.
Na, you're not gonna lose nothing.

495
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,900
You know what?
You could use a drink.

496
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,100
Merci.

497
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,000
How about another one
for luck, huh?

498
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,600
Waco, Clarkson getting his water?

499
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,500
I think he's dead, Sarge.

500
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,400
Come on.
Let's take a look at LuLu Belle.

501
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,800
Waco!

502
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,300
Your turn.

503
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,500
Three swallows.

504
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,200
Gratias, Sargento.

505
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:06,300
The boy is dead.
Yeah.

506
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,100
I didn't know Mike Clarkson well.

507
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,000
I hardly knew him at all
to tell you the truth.

508
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,900
But, he seemed a good soldier to me.
And a decent chap.

509
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,000
And I'd like to think,
he didn't die for nothing.

510
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
We his comrades commend
him unto God's mercy.

511
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,700
The Lord is my shepherd ...

512
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,000
I shall not want.

513
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,500
He liketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

514
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,500
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

515
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,300
Yay and all the days of my life.
I shall walk in righteousness.

516
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,500
Thou restoreth my soul.
My cup runneth over. Amen.

517
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,000
Alright, gentlemen.

518
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,700
How's it coming?
Very nice, sir. Very good.

519
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,100
Any way you can squeeze
it out a little quicker?

520
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,800
It takes it's own time.
You can not milk it like a cow.

521
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,600
How long can we
afford to stay here?

522
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,100
Well, long enough to get as much
water as we can carry out of here.

523
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,500
[singing]

524
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,600
Alright, I want you to watch
for planes from up here.

525
00:45:34,602 --> 00:45:35,590
Roger, that.

526
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,300
Nice breeze.

527
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,300
This is what the Arabs would
call a beautiful moment.

528
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,700
Yeah, like a stroll in
the park, huh, Casey?

529
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,100
Knightsbridge, Kensington.
That was my patch.

530
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
And very nice pickings they were, too.

531
00:45:52,104 --> 00:45:53,790
Pickings?

532
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,400
What did you do, Casey?

533
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,200
Cat burglar.
Doing very nicely.

534
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,200
And then what happen?
A blazin' Blitz.

535
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,798
And who's going to leave a diamond
Tiara laying around in an upstairs bedroom ...

536
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,200
when Gerry is raining bombs,
all through out the night.

537
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,600
You're kidding me?

538
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,600
Yeah. Of course.

539
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,800
Alright. Stay sharp.

540
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,800
Sharp as a tack.
I like it up here.

541
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,500
A bit of nostalgia,
you know what I mean?

542
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:47,300
- Sarge! LuLu Belle is gonna need
a lot more than her bogies greased.

543
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,600
I got a feeling we've got
trouble with that engine.

544
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Alright, I'll take a look at it.

545
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,600
Relieve Tambul immediately.

546
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,800
Sargente! The Tank.
I can help you.

547
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,500
What do you know about motors?

548
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,800
I was a mechanic in Turino.
A...very good mechanic.

549
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,598
Uhh ...

550
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,200
You're on the wrong side of the wall
to be messing with my Tank, pãisãn.

551
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,800
Ohh, Sargente.
LuLu Belle she is for me too, the way out.

552
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,400
Very good mechanic, Sargente.

553
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,000
- Frenchy, bring the Italian out here!
- Yes, Sargente.

554
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,600
Why don't you let me
give you a break, huh?

555
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,900
No. No, no. It's not necessary.

556
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,500
How's it coming?

557
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,200
The water comes very slowly.
No one ever knows about these wells.

558
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,400
What's that song you are singing?
The song of life.

559
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,700
When my father sing the song all the rain fall
from the sky, everywhere across the desert.

560
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,200
What was you before the war, Tambul?
A farmer?

561
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:09,500
No, no. Soldier.
Long time. 20 years.

562
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,400
My father was a Captain.
And his father was as well, a Captain.

563
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,500
My folks, have always
been farmers in Texas.

564
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,700
Texas, oh, Texas is very far.

565
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,100
Sure seems like it, right now.
You married, Tambul?

566
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,200
- I am.
- Me, too.

567
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,000
Good. Good.

568
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,200
Good? It's sensational.
But I guess it's really good for you people.

569
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,100
I mean, the fellas were telling me,
that you all have as many as 300 wives.

570
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,500
The prophet said that 4 wives are
sufficient for a true believer.

571
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,700
Four? How come?

572
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:57,600
One wife.
One wife is bored. Day and night.

573
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,700
Two wives.
Two wives argue all day long.

574
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,700
Three wives.
They argue and they can't decide.

575
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,600
But four wives ... ahh ... two and two
are complement to each other.

576
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,700
The man has food, the man has money,
and the man has his rest!

577
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,900
You got four wives?

578
00:49:20,902 --> 00:49:23,598
No.

579
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,600
I'm afraid the woman I married,
would not like that very much.

580
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,100
You know what?
Mine neither.

581
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,400
She is beautiful. LuLu Bellã.

582
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,500
Yeah, she's a piece of work, ain't she?

583
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,100
Sargente, when a machine is good,
the pistons, the wheels,

584
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,000
everything working together,
it's like a music, mmm...

585
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,000
...like a song.
You understand?

586
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah, you make it sound like poetry.
Or bullshit.

587
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,700
Sargente, you can trust me to help.

588
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,100
Trust you?
Now why would I do that?

589
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,400
I have a wife. I have a "bambina."

590
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,100
Yeah, a little late to be changing sides,
don't you think.

591
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,100
Mussolini? Dirty dog...

592
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,200
In the beginning, he speak
like a thunder storm,

593
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,300
corruption, on order, ...

594
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,300
but now it changed. He's changed.

595
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,800
How you say .... make it worthy ...?

596
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,700
You watch your right hand, while
their picking your pocket with the left.

597
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,300
Si, si, bravo.

598
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,800
It's ...uh... now ...
we learn ..uh...the hard way.

599
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,200
Doesn't get much harder than this.

600
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:57,200
I want to ride out from here
on your LuLu Bellã.

601
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,400
We will.

602
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,400
Hey, Jimmy.
- Yes.

603
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,800
How do you spell "oasis?"

604
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,900
Waco...!

605
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,900
O-A-S-I-S.

606
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,700
An oasis?

607
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,100
Don't forget to tell them the part
about them trying to kill us.

608
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,500
I ain't going to upset
my wife, Williams.

609
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,100
According to this, I'll have some green grass
and some palm trees waiting over here.

610
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,400
Well, I hate to tell you this, son.

611
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,300
But, I think the local post office
has been shut for some time.

612
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,900
Well, I promised my wife I'd write a
letter every week, if I weren't dead.

613
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,600
Guess what? I ain't dead.

614
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,500
A letter a week, that's the least
you owe them, back there.

615
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,900
Hey, where's back there
for you, Bates?

616
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,800
Tippett, Yorkshire.
It's a fine place.

617
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,000
Except for the bloody rain.

618
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,500
Mind you I wouldn't say no to a
bit of English drizzle right now.

619
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,300
I'd settle for Michigan and
a little home cooking.

620
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,200
You know you can go a whole
year without rain in Sundargarh.

621
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,800
And down the rain comes and
the desert goes mad.

622
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,400
There's flowers and green stuff springing
up over night.

623
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,100
A party that night.

624
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,600
A farmer, were you?

625
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,600
No, my father was a driver.
That's a cowboy to you blokes.

626
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,100
Best beef in the world.

627
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,000
You ain't never been to Texas.

628
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,000
In my village is the best
cheese in the world.

629
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,100
My family make cheese.

630
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,800
A cheese maker, Frenchy?
I'd never have picked it.

631
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,900
We had fine cows with brown faces
and the white necks.

632
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:54,900
The best breed.

633
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,600
Ja, I know cheese, Ja.

634
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,400
The cheese mesa ami,

635
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,500
I wish you could have such a meal..

636
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,100
Hey, here you have a little cheese.

637
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,900
You take your knife, so.

638
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,900
.... hmmm.

639
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,300
Then grab some bread.

640
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,300
Some wine, of course.

641
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,100
To wash the throat.

642
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,600
A little cheese.

643
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,600
Oh, a little onion.

644
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,700
Oh, yes, he knows what is good.
So some cheese...

645
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,700
some onion...

646
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,100
some bread ...

647
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,200
an olive maybe.

648
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,500
Some more cheese ...

649
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,400
and some wine.

650
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,900
Lay off. We've had enough.

651
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,700
What, of what ... cheese?

652
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,700
You'll see buddy, you'll get
back there one day.

653
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,200
No. No, I can never go back.

654
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,300
The cows they make no more milk.

655
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,200
The Nazi cut their beautiful white
throats and took them for meat.

656
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,300
My family make no more cheese.

657
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,600
When was this happening, Frenchy?

658
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,900
Six months ago.

659
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,800
I was in the Resistance.
You understand the Resistance?

660
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,200
I helped many to escape.

661
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,600
The Nazis, they take 12 hostages.
All friends.

662
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,700
Andre Pucell who run the store.
Jean Marie a rover.

663
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,100
Francois, a school teacher ...

664
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:06,100
My friends, they didn't talk.

665
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,100
And I can not betray
the man I might be.

666
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,900
So the Nazis, they shot them all dead.

667
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,200
I come here to kill Nazis.

668
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,800
I have too much hate
to do the Resistance.

669
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,900
I can never go back.

670
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,800
My village is dead for me.

671
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,500
Sargeant! Sargeant!

672
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,200
I can hear a vehicle!

673
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,200
German half-track.
Coming this way.

674
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,600
Frenchy, keep an eye on
that Italian and German.

675
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,900
Bates, go down in the well
and tell Tambul stay there.

676
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,200
The rest of you take up defensive
positions around the wall here.

677
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,000
This bloody war,
keeps following us about.

678
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,300
Not a word. Silence.

679
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,400
Sprechen sie Deutsche?

680
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,400
No, parlo tedesco.

681
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,900
Waco, you and Jimmy find a
spot on the west flank.

682
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,100
Set up a crossfire.

683
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,400
And don't kill them all.
I want prisoners.

684
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,000
Is it true what they say?
Do you speak English?

685
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,100
When the time comes,
I will tell you what to do.

686
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,600
There's about six.
Roger that, Sergeant.

687
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,000
Halt!
Everybody out!

688
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Go ahead.

689
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,600
Halt! Take cover!

690
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,900
- Captain Halliday.
- Yes, Sergeant.

691
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,600
Tell them to surrender.

692
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,800
Ergeben ich oder sterbe!

693
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,500
Ergeben ich oder sterbe!!

694
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,400
Nicht schießen, nicht schießen!

695
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,400
Drop it! Come on!
Drop it!

696
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,300
Drop it!

697
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,200
Drop it! Drop it!

698
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,400
Drop it!

699
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,300
Nicht schießen.

700
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,800
- Sprechst du Englisch?
- Nein.

701
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,600
Hey, sarge! They got some
land mines and some grenades!

702
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,900
They got any water?
- One can. Empty.

703
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,100
Like these.

704
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,500
Jimmy, bring me some water.

705
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,200
Ask them where their outfit is?

706
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,300
Woher ist Ihre Regiment?

707
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,300
Sie fragen sich:
Woher ist Ihre Regiment?

708
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,000
Tell them they can put
their hands down.

709
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,900
Senken Sie Ihre Hände.

710
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,000
Thirsty?

711
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,200
Yeah, I don't blame you.

712
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,300
It's a warm day.

713
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,100
UH!
- Herman!

714
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,900
Take him out of here!

715
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,700
Ask him if he's thirsty.

716
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,700
- Bitte Durstig?
- Ja.

717
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,000
Ask him where their outfit is.

718
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,700
Woher ist der rest alle Heinrich?

719
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,500
Dieses Wasser ist für Sie,
maybe later.

720
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,900
Wir sind verloren. Wir sind aus
von unserer Kompanie aus position.

721
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,100
He said, they are stragglers.

722
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,900
Tell him, he's lying.

723
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,800
Du lügst.

724
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,200
Ich möchte nur etwas Wasser.

725
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,400
Ask him where his company is?

726
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,800
Woher ist du Kompanie?

727
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,000
Wasser, bitte.

728
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,000
Talk!

729
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,800
Vas ist der position?

730
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,200
Wasser, bitte.

731
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,600
Ask him again!

732
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,400
Woher ist du Kompanie?

733
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,800
Ask him again.

734
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,100
They are an advanced scouting party
sent here to check out the well.

735
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,500
Part of a mechanized battalion
that is cutting southeast...

736
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,100
across the Egyptian border.

737
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,200
They're a light motorized unit,
with no tanks, no artillery, but...

738
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,800
about 500 men, who've had
no water for days.

739
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,900
Here, you've earned it.

740
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,200
They were told they could get
all the water they wanted here.

741
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,100
Sergeant, Gunn!

742
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,400
- What?
- The well, she's gone dry.

743
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,400
- How much do we have left?
- 9 and 1/4 cans.

744
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,800
Alright, there is 500 thirsty
Germans on their way here.

745
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,700
The well is dry at hassan Barrina.

746
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,700
Is there any water within a
100 miles of that well?

747
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,700
Only here, Sergeant.
Now, this too is dry.

748
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,900
Damn.

749
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,900
I wouldn't half mind seeing
the look on Gerry's face ...

750
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,500
when he dips
his bucket in that well.

751
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,900
What?

752
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,900
- I said, I wou...
- Yeah, I heard you.

753
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,400
Tell the men
I want to talk to them.

754
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,100
Sir.

755
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,100
What do you think
our chances are.

756
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Well, if we can get out of
here as fast as we can ...

757
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,900
we might run into one of
our long-range Recon patrols.

758
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,100
Give them a warning that the Germans
are trying to outflank our troops.

759
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,800
Yeah. We could do that.

760
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,800
- Or we can stay and defend the well.
- You can't be serious?

761
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,600
The well is dry, Captain.
We know that.

762
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,600
But, they don't know that.

763
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,900
They need water bad.
And they'll fight for it, if they have to.

764
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,900
And while they are fighting,
they are not fighting nobody.

765
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,000
Have you gone
completely mad, Sergeant?

766
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,300
I don't know.

767
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,200
I put you in charge of these men, so
you can get them through the desert.

768
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,900
Save lives, not throw them away.

769
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,900
Yeah.

770
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,500
That was us against the desert.

771
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,800
And now, it's us against the Nazi's.

772
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,900
Captain, thousands of our boys are
trying to regroup in El Alamein,

773
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,500
and if we can buy them 24 hours, just
24 hours, we might make a difference.

774
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,900
That's an awful big might, Sergeant.

775
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:57,200
Well Captain, I have been a soldier
since I was 17 years old ...

776
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,900
and I've been waiting
for this moment.

777
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,600
And you know what?
I'm scared.

778
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,900
And that tells me we are in the
right place at the right time.

779
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,900
These are still men's lives
we are talking about.

780
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,300
These men are soldiers, Captain.

781
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,900
And soldier's have their duty?
- Right.

782
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,600
Tell me something.
Are you going to order them to do this?

783
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,300
No.

784
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,100
I'll put it to them.

785
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,800
Go ahead then.
Put it to them.

786
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,800
Alright, I got a lot to say and
not a lot of time to say it in.

787
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,600
We got 500 thirsty Germans on their
way here, desperate for water.

788
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,900
I'm telling their buddie's to go back and
tell them we got all the water they need.

789
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,400
Oh, I get it, a diversion. While they're
digging around in a dry well ...

790
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:05,400
seems like a good time to,
you know, bugger off.

791
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,500
Well, .. I ain't leaving.

792
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,100
Are you saying
we should surrender, Sergeant?

793
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,900
I'm saying we stay.

794
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,700
We take a stand and defend the well.

795
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,800
It's got no bloody water in it!

796
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,200
Don't you get it?
He's using the water as bait.

797
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,200
He thinks it's the bloody Alamo.

798
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:31,000
We can stay. We can defend the well.
And we can delay the Germans.

799
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,000
Well, there's one thing wrong
with that little picture, Sergeant.

800
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,400
We're here.

801
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Here are the Germans.

802
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,400
That's what happens when
you put nine blokes up against 500.

803
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,100
That's right. If you can't count,
well, the rest of us can.

804
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,000
If we don't take a stand here and
defend the well and delay them, ...

805
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,500
the Germans are going to come
right through here ...

806
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:01,400
and out-flank our boys who are
trying to regroup in El Alamein.

807
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:05,900
Then the German tanks are going to roll down the
streets in Cairo and Alexandria within a week.

808
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,900
I say we stay. Take a stand
and defend the well.

809
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,000
Is that an order, sir?

810
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:21,000
If Sergeant Gunn chooses to
stay and defend the well,

811
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,700
then I will be staying with him.

812
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,700
Look, I ain't got nobody at
home waiting for me.

813
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,700
I know you guys got a lot to lose.

814
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,500
I'm only speaking for
Jimmy, me and Waco.

815
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,400
You guys have an option.

816
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,700
You have a German half-track back there.
You got a back door.

817
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,400
Tell me something Sergeant,
reckon we've got a chance of winning?

818
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,400
I'd say the odds are about a 100 to one.

819
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:56,800
I fancy the odds.
I'll stay.

820
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,500
Oh, god, the bleedin' war
just caught up to me.

821
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,900
Alright, I'm in.

822
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,600
Well, I've never been at the
back door in my life.

823
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,500
And I'm not going to start now.

824
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:18,600
Hey sarge, I want to be around to remind
you blokes, that this is a very bad idea.

825
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:24,700
- Tambul?
- I'm a soldier, Sergeant.

826
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,400
Alright.

827
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,400
We stay.

828
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,300
Captain?

829
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,000
Tell the sergeant,
we're sending them back.

830
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,700
They need water, we need food,
fair exchange, no need to fight.

831
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,200
Sie hören nicht zu haben!

832
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,400
Es gibt kein Wasser!

833
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:51,700
NO!

834
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,200
I do my duty. I fight with honor.

835
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,900
I'm not one of those
who killed your villagers.

836
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:10,600
Open your mouth again
and I gut you like a fish.

837
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,300
Think they bought it?

838
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:20,900
They bought it.

839
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,200
Playing a little game?
Trying to be a Hero, huh?

840
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,100
You try it again, you'll be a dead Hero.

841
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,600
Do you know he spoke English?

842
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,900
Si, I...I found out ..not long time.

843
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,200
Kept it from us, huh?

844
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,700
Sargento, Germans account, if I betray
they take me...

845
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,200
when they finish with you.

846
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:54,100
You just jeopardized these men's lives.
For what?

847
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,500
For your wife? For your Bambino?
For your cousin in Pittsburgh? That's bullshit!

848
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,700
You did it to save your pitiful ass!

849
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,200
Now you got to decide which side
of the wall you fall on, soldier.

850
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,900
I want to live, Sargento.
To live.

851
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,800
The rest of us are staying.
What about you?

852
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,100
I still like your cigarettes.

853
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,900
All right men, we got to work fast.

854
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,800
Casey, I want you to take that
half-track around back.

855
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:32,800
Unmount that machine gun and
put it up there in the parapet.

856
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,500
Williams there's a lot of land mines in the back
of that half-track, courtesy of General Rommel.

857
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,000
I want you and Bates to lay them
in a field here, to keep them hopping.

858
01:09:39,004 --> 01:09:40,100
Yes, Sarge.

859
01:09:40,102 --> 01:09:43,400
Captain, Frenchy, I want you to bring all
the ammunition, up here to this front wall.

860
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,400
Jimmy. Waco.
- Yes, sir.

861
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,500
Get LuLuBelle ready.

862
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,100
We're taking her on a date.

863
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,200
Macht schnell !

864
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,900
Now !

865
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,700
Here's a Gerry gun for you
in case yours jams.

866
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,200
The splendor of Allah is with us today.

867
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:35,000
Well, they can have their bullets back.

868
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,800
- Ready, Sarge.
- Thank you, Casey.

869
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,700
All right, Doc.
Do you think you can handle this?

870
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,800
Well, it's a little different from
hunting grouse in Shropshire.

871
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,200
I'd say so.

872
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,400
Alright, push these in like this.
Shut this.

873
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,500
And when you start firing, I want
you to swing it in a slow arc.

874
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:05,000
Now, if it jams, don't panic.
Just stop, clear it, and start firing again.

875
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,700
Yes, I understand.

876
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,200
Seen much action, sir?

877
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,500
Not at all actually.

878
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,100
I was trained to save lives.

879
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,800
Yeah, well things change.

880
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Kill as many as you can.

881
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,100
Yes, I'll do my best.

882
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,700
- Frenchy, you got a good position?
- Right.

883
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,700
- Now, you keep an eye on that German.
- Yes, Sargente.

884
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,100
Alright!

885
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,700
Hold your fire until the
first mine detonates.

886
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,500
You were right about the 100 to one.

887
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,200
Yeah. But they don't know
about LuLu Belle.

888
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,700
- Move ahead. Stay firm.

889
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,400
- Company!

890
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,900
Let's go!

891
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,200
FIRE!

892
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,700
FIRE!

893
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,100
Aqui esta bom, dispare!

894
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,700
Maltidos!
(Damn!)

895
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,800
All right, cease fire!

896
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,800
Save your ammo!

897
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:11,700
- Williams, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I am still here.

898
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,400
- Jimmy, Waco!
- We're okay, Joe.

899
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,600
- Captain Halliday.
- Right, Sergeant.

900
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,000
- Frenchy!
Wie, Sargento.

901
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,300
- Tambul !
- No trouble, Sargento.

902
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,400
- Bates!
- Over here.

903
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:37,000
Casey...Casey!

904
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,800
God damn it.

905
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,500
You did good, Doc.
So did you, Sergeant.

906
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,600
- We had a victory.
- Yeah.

907
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,400
My God ...

908
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,400
Sergeant.

909
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,696
Well I'm an optimist, sir.

910
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,200
But, I don't think joining us
is what they have in mind.

911
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,300
Parlay. Seems as though they
taking your offer seriously.

912
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,300
Yeah. Maybe.

913
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,400
At least they are taking
us seriously, huh?

914
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,000
I better get out there and
see what the hell they want.

915
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,100
If there's any translating to be done,
they'll have to do it themselves.

916
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,000
If it's a trap by Gerry?

917
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,300
Well, that puts you back
in command, Captain.

918
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:50,700
- Sergeant Gunn, United States Army.
- Major Von Falken, Afrika Korps.

919
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,900
You've come a long way, Sergeant.

920
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,100
You Americans must have a
fate for lost causes.

921
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,800
With all due respect, major ...

922
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,000
I'm not the guy with a bunch of casualties
lying around for the buzzards to pick.

923
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,900
Are you authorized to negotiate?

924
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,600
Where is your Officer?

925
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:14,700
Well, our Captain is British, sir.
You know how the British are.

926
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,500
After a little action, they like to
wash up, before tea time.

927
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,600
Careful Jimmy. This is our entire supply.

928
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,700
I'd give anything to see the look on
that Kraut's face right now.

929
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,400
Water for food, is that your offer.

930
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:42,900
Yeah.

931
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,700
If you have a lot of thirsty boys
we'll need a count on them.

932
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,600
Private Verkmann gave you a
full account of our forces.

933
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,100
He admitted it, before I shot him.
The bastard.

934
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:58,500
It is still possible to come
to an agreement, Sergeant.

935
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,600
What's the deal?

936
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,600
Surrender your arms and
you go free...

937
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:09,700
with as much food and water,
as you can carry.

938
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:18,900
Well, I don't think so.
We like it here.

939
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,700
Actually, we got so much water, we can
pull our belts in a couple notches.

940
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,100
The offer's changed.
Water for guns.

941
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:32,800
One pint for one rifle.
One quart for one mortar.

942
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,300
Water for guns. That's the deal.

943
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:39,600
You think it is time
for making jokes, huh?

944
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,700
I'm not joking, Major.

945
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,800
Water for guns. Take it or leave it.

946
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,600
How'd you make out, Joe?

947
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,000
Well, they think we have so much water,
that we are swimming in it.

948
01:22:09,004 --> 01:22:09,986
Alright, yeah.

949
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:11,800
My guess is, they're worse
off then we thought.

950
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,900
They must have left some
men on the outer walls.

951
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,200
That's our first problem.

952
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,600
Our second problem, is ammunition.

953
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,500
Ok, Jimmy, go tell the guys not to fire,
until they are coming for us.

954
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:25,300
Okay.

955
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:25,900
Come on.

956
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,600
Yeah, I know, I know, trace bullets.

957
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,700
Don't you ever stop complaining, Williams?

958
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:01,100
Stop? I haven't even started yet.

959
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,200
So, all the food and water we
can carry out, huh?

960
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,900
Yep, that's what the Major said.

961
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,700
And what did you say to the Major?

962
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,600
I told him we're staying,
because you liked it here.

963
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,900
I said it reminded you of home.
"Sunda Gere."

964
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,700
Sundargarh.

965
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,400
That's it.

966
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,700
Yeah, well, we got the heat, the dust,
the floors and the thirst, ...

967
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,800
but not the bloody Germans.

968
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,300
You know mate?
As an infantry soldier, ...

969
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,400
I decided that running LuLu Belle,
isn't such a bad thing.

970
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,000
You can go.

971
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,700
You might get to Berlin, on
that Tank of yours yet.

972
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,100
You think so?

973
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:02,100
Bereiten Sie den Mörtel!

974
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Mortars!

975
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:21,100
Stay in position! Nobody move!!

976
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,900
Sarge, over there!

977
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,100
Frenchy, they're coming
in from the rear!

978
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:33,600
Get up there help the Captain.
Give him a hand.

979
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,800
You and Tambul watch the front.

980
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,700
- Jimmy, you come with me!
Come on!

981
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,500
Captain! The rear!

982
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,000
Jimmy, get over here!

983
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,900
Son of a bitch.

984
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,500
Son of a bitch!!

985
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,700
Attack!

986
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,200
They're coming!!

987
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,000
Now, this is the time to tell them
there is no water here!

988
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,900
No, I can't let you!

989
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,900
I'll have you hung, as a traitor!

990
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:14,700
Socorro!

991
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:42,600
Sargente! The German escaped!
He is going to them, we have no water!

992
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,200
Where is he?
He's there, Sergeant.

993
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,300
Get him!

994
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,200
I'm here!

995
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:50,500
Let me go, nigger!

996
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,100
Don't worry, Sergeant!
They're running.

997
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,600
Tambul !

998
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,900
Run!
Come on, Tambul !

999
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,800
Come, Tambul, run!!

1000
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,700
Come on!

1001
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:40,100
He got him, Sergeant.
He got him.

1002
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,200
He got him.

1003
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,200
Go for a drink, Doc.

1004
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,100
For Tambul, there was very little water,

1005
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,700
He told me, he sucked pebbles.

1006
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:19,800
I tried it, it seems to help.

1007
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,100
Two armies, both dying of thirst,
fighting over an empty well.

1008
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,100
If that don't sum it up.

1009
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:34,000
Water ... Water ...
Water ... Water ...

1010
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,900
Frenchy, you were right
about that Gerry.

1011
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,700
We should have killed him,
when we had the chance.

1012
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,700
You hated him,
the first minute you saw him.

1013
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,100
I hate them all.

1014
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:14,200
Well, bloody right. It's a bloody thing
to go about shooting your friends.

1015
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:24,400
Mind you, you find yourself thinking.
They ain't so different.

1016
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,600
We got Sergeant Gunn,
pulling us together.

1017
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:29,900
They got that Major of their's
out there doing the same.

1018
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,200
Where would they be,
without him, hey?

1019
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,700
Where would they be.

1020
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,800
Where would they be,
without their commander?

1021
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:08,400
Frenchy, they're bloody officers.

1022
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,800
- I'll get the Sergeant.
- No, I'll do it.

1023
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,400
Frenchy, you can't do it.
Come back!

1024
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,800
[speaking in French]

1025
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,600
Where is the Sergeant?

1026
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:51,700
He is busy. I'm all they could spare.
The others are having tea.

1027
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,600
We will make no further attempt
to take the well.

1028
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,900
If you provide us with water.
Tell that to your officer.

1029
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,400
No, no, no, not so fast, Major.

1030
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,900
Water for arms ...

1031
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:11,200
one rifle, for one pint.
Give up your arms.

1032
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,900
How many of you, I wonder, are left?

1033
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:21,100
Enough to watch you choke, Herr Major.

1034
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,200
What were you thinking.

1035
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:29,000
He is negotiating, sir.
I couldn't stop him.

1036
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,000
Frenchy?

1037
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,800
Alright, Major.
What is your answer?

1038
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I offered you the courtesy's of war.

1039
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,700
Offered you, mercy.

1040
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,800
When did the Nazi's ever show mercy?

1041
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,800
What we are, we keep!
Why do you take it as you want?

1042
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:53,400
To keep? To protect what?
You're country?

1043
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,700
We can take it easy enough.

1044
01:33:56,100 --> 01:34:01,300
Accept my terms ...
or I will send you to hell.

1045
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,500
Join me!

1046
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:23,600
Save it!
Save it!

1047
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,600
He was a good soldier.

1048
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:55,400
I'm out of ammunition!

1049
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,500
Here, take Frenchy's gun.

1050
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,900
When it's all gone,

1051
01:34:58,900 --> 01:34:59,900
what do we fight with then?

1052
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,200
Bayonets, rifle butts, fists.

1053
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:07,300
Fists? Bad time to tell me, Sergeant,
never been much good with a fist.

1054
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,800
Well, just keep your left up.

1055
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,200
And pray for a miracle.
Yeah, whatever.

1056
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,500
Well, there's four of us against a
battalion and we're still alive.

1057
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,398
You don't call that a miracle?

1058
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,700
Maybe, all I know is,
we started out with nine.

1059
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,700
- Bates!
- Still here, Sergeant!

1060
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,200
Waco, Waco!

1061
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,100
Put him down!

1062
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,500
Come on, take it easy.

1063
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,500
Please, don't make it hurt!

1064
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,600
LuLu Belle bit me!

1065
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,700
She didn't mean it.

1066
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,900
Press this down hard. Hard!

1067
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,600
I've got him.

1068
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,200
Come on.

1069
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,000
Waco, hang in there now, come on.

1070
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,300
Ok, I've got him, Sergeant.

1071
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Hang in there.

1072
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:22,886
Look at me. You're going to be fine.
Do you hear me?!

1073
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:23,886
Sergeant!

1074
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:27,400
Bates is alone out there.
You get outside and you help him.

1075
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,800
Come on, god damn it, Waco!
Hang in there!

1076
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
That's an order, Sergeant!

1077
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,600
Don't you die on me, Waco!

1078
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:51,900
I'll be fine, Sarge.

1079
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:00,000
- I'm fine ...
- Yeah.

1080
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,500
How is he?

1081
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,400
- You're doing well ...
- It'll take more than that to kill me.

1082
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:20,700
Okay, I'll be right here.

1083
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:01,400
Yeah, that was a close one.

1084
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,400
Ha, they got the well.

1085
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,300
I wonder what it feels like?

1086
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:10,800
What?

1087
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,200
Cold steel.

1088
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:19,800
Well, my guess is,
it's over pretty quick.

1089
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,400
I hope someone finds it.

1090
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,200
Well, chances are, no one will know
this ever happened.

1091
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,900
If they don't find me intact,
I'm missing.

1092
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,900
If they do find it, I'm dead.

1093
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,600
If I'm missing, nobody knows if I'm dead.

1094
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,400
If I am dead, then how will they even know?

1095
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,000
Never knowing is killing me, Sergeant.

1096
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:46,700
I think about my wife, never knowing.

1097
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,114
So ...

1098
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,700
I might as well be dead.

1099
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,300
Here they come.

1100
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,300
Water.... water.... water....!

1101
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,700
This is it.

1102
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,900
Come on! Come on!

1103
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,300
Come on!
What are you waiting for?!

1104
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,900
We ain't surrendering!
Get it over with!

1105
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:22,600
Come on!

1106
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,700
Water.... water.... water....!

1107
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,900
- Water?
- Water for guns.

1108
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,000
Oh, that's rich! Heh!

1109
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,100
There take all you want. Drink it, swim in it!
Drink it and drown!

1110
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,200
Water.... water.... water....!

1111
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,500
Go ahead, take it!

1112
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I'll be! ......The shell !
It's opened up the well!

1113
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:03,700
That's water, it's a bloody miracle!

1114
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:08,700
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what it is.

1115
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:14,500
Go over and pick up those guns,
while they're wet and stupid.

1116
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,500
Tell them, drink all they want.
I'll cover you.

1117
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:30,700
What are we going to
do with them, Sergeant?

1118
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,800
Bates, that is
one hell-of-a good question.

1119
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,600
Oh, no.

1120
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:56,700
That's not fair.
That's bloody unfair!

1121
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:04,100
Sit down!
Sit down!

1122
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,100
Get your asses on the ground!

1123
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,700
Who are those guys?

1124
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:36,500
They're British.
A long-range desert patrol.

1125
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,200
They're ours!

1126
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:41,200
Well, I'm glad about that.

1127
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:18,800
Sergeant,

1128
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:25,200
You were right. It was touch and go for
awhile, but our lads held at El Alamein.

1129
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,500
I knew we done our bit,
when I heard that.

1130
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:33,300
- It weren't in vain.
- I guess so.

1131
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,600
Bates, what's your first name?

1132
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:44,300
- Osmond.
- Osmond?

1133
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:47,400
Alright, 
you don't have to say nothing.

1134
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,200
No, no, no, it's a fine name.

1135
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,900
- How you planning on
riding out of here, Osmond?

1136
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,800
I was rather counting on going out,
the same way I came in, Sergeant.

1137
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,400
Mount up.

1138
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:25,400
" They shall not grow old "

1139
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,400
" As we that are left grow old. "

1140
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:32,400
" Age shall not weary them. "

1141
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:35,400
" Nor the years condemned. "

1142
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,100
" As the going down of the sun

1143
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:43,100
and in the morning "

1144
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:46,900
" We will remember them. "

1145
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:52,300
" Lest we forget. "
