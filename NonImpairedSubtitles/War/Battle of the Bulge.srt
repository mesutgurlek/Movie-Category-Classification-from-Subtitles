1
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,515
<i>December, 1944.</i>

2
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,683
<i>British and American armies</i>
<i>were on the threshold of victory.</i>

3
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:57,024
<i>Stretched across half of Europe,</i>
<i>the Allies gathered themselves...</i>

4
00:05:57,198 --> 00:06:00,031
<i>... for the final assault on Germany.</i>

5
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,635
<i>To the north</i>
<i>stood Montgomery's Eighth Army...</i>

6
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:05,271
<i>... to the south, Patton's Third.</i>

7
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,135
<i>In the center, along an 88-mile front...</i>

8
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:13,542
<i>... a few battle-weary American divisions</i>
<i>rested in a quiet sector.</i>

9
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:17,812
<i>To them, the war seemed already won.</i>

10
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:20,782
<i>This is their story.</i>

11
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:23,048
We've been flying over these woods
all week.

12
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:25,249
There's nothing but trees.
Let's turn back.

13
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,055
- Getting hungry, Joe?
- The war is over.

14
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,597
I hear GHQ is cutting orders
to ship us home for Christmas.

15
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,736
The German army still has
6 million men carrying arms.

16
00:06:35,903 --> 00:06:38,770
I haven't heard they're going home
for Christmas.

17
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:43,340
Hey, there it is...

18
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:46,276
...the German army.

19
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:49,745
Let's go down and have a look.

20
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:58,489
- Buzz him again. I wanna get a picture.
- Okay.

21
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,685
This time, gun your engine.
Make him look up.

22
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,207
It worked.

23
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,843
Swing around.
I wanna get another one.

24
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,889
Conrad.

25
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,054
I am ashamed of you.

26
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:15,929
Get up.

27
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,936
They could have killed us, sir.

28
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,937
If you'd taken the pains
to have looked carefully...

29
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,907
...you would have observed it was
an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

30
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:34,275
You would stay in the car if it were
a fighter plane shooting at us.

31
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:38,174
I did not lose a war to die
in the back seat of a car.

32
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:42,413
Does the colonel think any of us
has a choice where we will die?

33
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,152
I know where you'll die, Conrad,
at home, in your own bed.

34
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:50,422
Is the colonel trying to get rid of me?

35
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:56,131
I think that the world is going
to get rid of both of us.

36
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:59,665
Pick up your cap! Put it on.

37
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,434
Try to look like a soldier!

38
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,642
What good is a soldier anyhow?

39
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,043
He wins, he loses.

40
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:10,706
What's he good for anyhow?

41
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:13,512
Conrad, I've told you before...

42
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:16,656
...never leave the motor running.
Petrol is blood.

43
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,189
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,452
It won't happen again.

45
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:40,477
Looks like something on the ground
at 10 o'clock. Let's take a look.

46
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:51,324
Nothing.

47
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:53,483
Let's go home.

48
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,615
<i>Herr Oberst</i> Hessler is here.

49
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,866
- Colonel Hessler, sir.
- Yes.

50
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:47,166
Well, Hessler.

51
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,640
It has been a long time.

52
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,142
How good it is to see you again.

53
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:54,547
You look the same.

54
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:55,875
Little...

55
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,380
Little leaner perhaps.

56
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:02,453
The Russian front does not put meat
on a man's bones, general.

57
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:06,354
Ah, yes. War is hard on all of us.

58
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:09,661
- Central heating.
- Yeah.

59
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,355
Crystal chandeliers.

60
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,630
You have a nice cellar.

61
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:17,498
Field Marshal Göring
gave me that painting.

62
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,866
Lovely, isn't it?

63
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:28,103
I imagine he found a bargain
in Paris last year.

64
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,048
My corporal's waiting.
He's had a hard drive.

65
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:35,211
Do you suppose there's somewhere
in these ruins he can find a bed?

66
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,888
Sit down, Hessler.

67
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,054
You have too little faith
in the genius of the German people.

68
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:47,699
A few stones
have been knocked down...

69
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,929
...but our country's strong,
united, determined...

70
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,197
...and more productive than ever.

71
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:59,779
The Allies think that their constant
air raids have undermined our morale.

72
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:03,177
- This they'll never do.
- Why have you sent for me, general?

73
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:09,189
You are our finest
panzer commander, Hessler.

74
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:11,050
You will lead us to victory.

75
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:13,719
Our Germany is now like an iceberg.

76
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:18,229
Only a fraction of it
can be seen on the surface.

77
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:22,127
Let me show you some of the results...

78
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:25,669
...of what Germany
has produced underground.

79
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:28,905
You will discover a new Germany...

80
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,739
...and will take a new pride
in being a German.

81
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,305
Our latest airplane.

82
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:36,915
A jet.

83
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,076
It flies at more than 900 kilometers
per hour.

84
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,485
Within six months,
we will have enough jet fighters...

85
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:47,127
...to shoot down every
Allied plane in the air.

86
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:51,655
Our V-1 rocket destroyed
20 percent of London.

87
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:56,235
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.

88
00:14:58,072 --> 00:15:01,838
The new 70-ton King Tiger tank.

89
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:06,340
It has two-and-a-half times
the firepower...

90
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:10,745
...and double the armor
of the American tanks.

91
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:14,845
Our Germany is far
from finished, Hessler.

92
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:20,016
It's a very beautiful model, general.

93
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:25,428
It proves that the Germans
are still the world's best toy makers.

94
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:31,367
The toys we are making these days
are not for children.

95
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,837
Let me show them to you.

96
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,291
Hands up! Get on over.

97
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:02,526
Hold it! Put them up! Stand against
the wall. Put them up, general.

98
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:05,004
Well, boys...

99
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,902
...looks like we've caught ourselves
a couple of big fish.

100
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:12,512
- One nice, fat Kraut trout.
- That's enough, now.

101
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:19,176
Sorry, general.
We are just rehearsing a commando raid.

102
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,820
Very good.

103
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,513
Not bad, Hessler, huh?

104
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,992
Had you fooled, didn't they?

105
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,025
Completely.

106
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,221
Unfortunately,
I am beyond playing games.

107
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,696
Oh, this is no game.

108
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,995
These are German soldiers, all of them.

109
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:39,901
Trained German soldiers.

110
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:45,272
Diepel commands the panzer grenadiers
attached to the 1 st Tank Brigade.

111
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:48,676
These men will work with him.

112
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:52,012
Major Diepel, kindly explain
Operation Transit to the colonel.

113
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:55,952
The soldiers will be parachuted
behind the American lines.

114
00:16:56,123 --> 00:17:00,059
Their mission:
To disrupt enemy communications.

115
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,855
We have organized many such teams.

116
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,195
Each will be led by a man who has
actually lived in America.

117
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:11,462
Schumacher here lived
in Texas for 12 years...

118
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:14,232
...before returning to the fatherland.

119
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:18,241
Tell me, lieutenant,
who is your favorite baseball player?

120
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,778
- Lou Gehrig.
- Because he's hit the most home runs?

121
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:25,248
No, sir. Babe Ruth hit
the most home runs, 60 in 1927.

122
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,252
And what's your opinion
of Adolf Hitler?

123
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,155
As an American, my opinion
would be offensive to these gentlemen.

124
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:38,798
Come, lieutenant. As an American officer,
you care nothing for German opinion.

125
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,401
Adolf Hitler is a crazy,
Austrian housepainter.

126
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:50,009
He's a madman who thinks he knows
more than the whole general's staff.

127
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:53,305
And he's leading Germany
to complete, total destruction.

128
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:57,082
Perhaps you are going too far.

129
00:17:57,684 --> 00:18:02,451
To carry off this great deception,
even their reflexes must be American.

130
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:08,083
Your reflexes are to be congratulated,
lieutenant.

131
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,901
Insolent man.

132
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:17,803
Let him have his fun now.

133
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,804
If he is captured,
he will be shot as a spy.

134
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,273
And if he survives,
he can be shot as a traitor.

135
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:31,111
You must admit, we are very thorough.

136
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:41,321
Even a pass won't get you through here.

137
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:24,526
We will attack
through the Losheim Gap.

138
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,003
It's defended only by a single battalion.

139
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:31,701
The American division
on the Schnee Eifel will be cut off.

140
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:34,574
Then the Our River Bridge
will be in our hands.

141
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:39,074
From there, on to Amblêve,
with its road network.

142
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:43,780
In four days, we will be across
the River Meuse.

143
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,559
The strategic objective?

144
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,251
Antwerp.

145
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:53,064
By taking Antwerp, we split
the enemy forces in two.

146
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,129
It will take them 18 months to recover.

147
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,799
By then, we will have air superiority
with our jet engines.

148
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,308
And we will have even more
significant weapons.

149
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:09,278
Weapons which can destroy
an entire city with a single blast.

150
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:13,411
You have forgotten
one important detail, general.

151
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,648
With their present control of the air,
the Allies will smash our tanks...

152
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:20,486
...machine-gun our troops,
bomb the bridges...

153
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,390
...and cut our communications.

154
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:28,432
Suppose I tell you there will be
no Allied planes.

155
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,165
Another secret weapon?

156
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:35,132
From Spitzbergen, Norway...

157
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:38,277
...the northernmost weather station
in the world.

158
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,608
We have been waiting two months
for this report.

159
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:46,117
"A low-pressure area over northern
Europe, starting December 16th.

160
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:50,188
Low clouds and fog
which will ground all aircraft."

161
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,789
- How long?
- Long enough...

162
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,428
...if we keep strictly to our timetable.

163
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,824
Unusual clock, isn't it?

164
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,535
It has only one cycle.

165
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,068
Fifty hours.

166
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:10,337
We have the resources
for 50 hours, full-scale attack.

167
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:16,378
Maps, clocks, toys.

168
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,675
But with what will I fight?

169
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:22,618
Colonel Hessler...

170
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,020
...l'm putting you in command
of our armored spearhead.

171
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:09,197
It can be done.

172
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:42,399
This came in from SHAEF.

173
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,799
I got a Christmas cake
from home today.

174
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:48,134
- Think I'll still be here to eat it?
- Send this right through.

175
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:51,141
Develop this. Bring me the prints
as soon as they come out.

176
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:52,801
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Kiley.

177
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,447
Find any Germans under
your bed this morning?

178
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:59,813
Marching around under there all night.
Couldn't sleep a wink.

179
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,952
That's an order.

180
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:07,150
I want every item on that menu delivered
to every soldier in the division...

181
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,818
...especially those
in the forward positions.

182
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:13,329
And I want them delivered
in time for Christmas dinner.

183
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:17,798
Counterintelligence picked
this up from an enemy agent.

184
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:19,939
Dated November 29th.

185
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:23,166
"From Field Marshal Keitel. Most secret.

186
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:27,473
Officers and men who speak English
are wanted for special mission.

187
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:31,447
Volunteers will report
to General Kohler's headquarters."

188
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,314
- What do you make of it?
- You know my opinion.

189
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:37,115
This is one more confirmation.
They're going to attack.

190
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,724
Oh, come on, Kiley, not that again.

191
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:44,329
They're probably preparing a fifth column
to drop behind our lines.

192
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:47,155
Were you
in the State Department too, Kiley?

193
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:50,360
I thought your experience
was limited to police work.

194
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:56,105
Having been an inspector of police
doesn't disqualify me from thinking.

195
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,107
All cops aren't flatfoots.

196
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:00,174
Your limited military experience...

197
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:03,839
...doesn't inspire confidence
in your conclusions. If you think...

198
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:06,986
Why do you keep saying
they're mounting an offensive?

199
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:12,051
I spent 20 years before the war
asking questions.

200
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,057
Ever since D-day,
you've had me doing the same thing...

201
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:17,526
...interrogating prisoners.

202
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:19,824
I can only report what I've learned.

203
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,027
The German soldier facing us
is still an undefeated enemy.

204
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:26,331
He can still fight.
His leaders know that.

205
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,531
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.

206
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:32,334
I have 10 other officers in my section.

207
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,812
We see the same information,
get the same facts as you, Kiley.

208
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:41,079
All of us come up with one answer, you
come up with the complete opposite.

209
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:44,086
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,
you'd better lie down.

210
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:46,691
Colonel Pritchard,
you may be my superior officer...

211
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:48,724
He is.

212
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,827
Excuse me.
Here are the prints you wanted.

213
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:53,431
Thank you.

214
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,395
Look what showed up on this one.

215
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,065
I took it over the Ardennes.

216
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:08,806
Is this a Tiger tank, or isn't it?

217
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,880
So it appears.

218
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,179
One tiger doesn't make a jungle, sir.

219
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,623
I expect tigers in jungles. When I discover
one in a peaceful neighborhood...

220
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:22,124
...I recommend all of us
take a good look under our beds.

221
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:24,058
Excuse me, sir.

222
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:35,873
Step outside.

223
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,985
With your permission, sir.

224
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:58,263
This is from headquarters, Kiley.
Top-secret.

225
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,629
The Third Army has been ordered
to attack the Germans in the Saar.

226
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:06,101
General Patton is launching
the offensive in two days.

227
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:07,762
Does it seem possible...

228
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,570
...headquarters would commit an entire
army to an offensive in the south...

229
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:15,476
...if there were any possibility of the
Germans attacking in the Ardennes?

230
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,610
With all due respect to headquarters,
they could be wrong.

231
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:24,853
Send this to headquarters anyway.

232
00:26:25,024 --> 00:26:27,185
There seem to be new features
on that tank.

233
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:28,691
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

234
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:31,591
Yes, sir. I'd like a rundown
on this German officer.

235
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:36,629
- All right, send this along.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,164
Get up to the line and tell them
to grab some new prisoners.

237
00:26:41,341 --> 00:26:44,504
- I'm interested in any fresh information.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:48,135
One thing more. What are
you doing in a reconnaissance plane?

239
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:51,147
We're not paying you
to be a combat soldier.

240
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:54,343
- Trying to shorten the war by yourself?
- No, sir.

241
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:59,515
Just wanna make sure I can enjoy
that nice Christmas dinner you ordered.

242
00:27:10,737 --> 00:27:13,900
I see the colonel's
in fine appetite again.

243
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:15,734
I am.

244
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:18,570
Join me in a glass of wine.

245
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:20,508
Thank you, sir.

246
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:24,382
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

247
00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:37,260
Conrad.

248
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,590
Speak.

249
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:44,232
What does the colonel wish me to say?

250
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:46,599
Speak your mind, the truth.

251
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:52,041
Don't be afraid, Conrad. I must have
someone to tell me the truth.

252
00:27:55,482 --> 00:28:01,114
I've always been fortunate
to serve under brilliant men...

253
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:03,619
...who know everything.

254
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,725
From them, I've learned one thing:

255
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:12,229
When all was lost,
these brilliant men never lost hope.

256
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:15,060
I admire that.

257
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:19,870
What else do you admire
about these men?

258
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:22,101
The illusion.

259
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:27,603
Maybe I'm not using
the right word, colonel.

260
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,374
I'm not an educated man.

261
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:34,617
The hope that there is
always one more chance.

262
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:38,016
That is the illusion.

263
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:43,025
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.

264
00:28:44,464 --> 00:28:47,262
It's not my place
to speak of such things.

265
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,834
Go on.

266
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,137
I order you to.

267
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,736
Colonel...

268
00:28:57,844 --> 00:29:03,077
...this new command is an illusion.

269
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:05,644
Give it up.

270
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:11,183
I am Martin Hessler.

271
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,688
Four years ago,
my panzers overran Poland in one week.

272
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:16,988
That was no illusion.

273
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:20,997
In 39 days, my tanks smashed all
the way to Paris. That was no illusion.

274
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,169
I conquered the Crimea.
That was no illusion.

275
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:28,031
Today...

276
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:31,608
...I was given a brigade of Tiger tanks.

277
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:34,645
When I have a brigade of tanks...

278
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,338
...that is reality.

279
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,813
And who will drive your tanks?

280
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,956
The men you led were soldiers.
Veteran soldiers.

281
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:45,954
Are there any left?

282
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,025
What will they give you now?

283
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:50,560
I was by your side
in Poland, France, Crimea.

284
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,721
Look at me, colonel,
I'm not the same man.

285
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:56,892
I jumped in a ditch today at the sight
of an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

286
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:59,628
My two boys remember me
as a good soldier.

287
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:01,501
They wouldn't believe it.

288
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:05,303
But, colonel, I am not the only one.

289
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:10,142
How sure can you be of the men
who will drive your tanks?

290
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,524
Major Diepel?

291
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:27,165
- Diepel.
<i>- Yep.</i>

292
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,697
I want to see my tank commanders.
Have them assembled at once.

293
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,137
Conrad, my boots.

294
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,151
Your commanders, sir.

295
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:11,705
Boys. Too many boys.

296
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,438
The first battle will turn them into men.

297
00:31:15,615 --> 00:31:17,981
In the old days,
I lived six months with my men...

298
00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:22,245
...before going into action. I knew them,
they knew me. These are strangers.

299
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,912
Too many boys.

300
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,887
They have never tasted defeat.

301
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:28,823
Do they know what is expected of them?

302
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:32,123
They are ready to die for you.

303
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,893
Can you ask more?

304
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:26,076
Sing.

305
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:36,912
Louder.

306
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:03,435
Hold it. Hold it.

307
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,838
Hold it. Hold it.

308
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:10,313
Pull up. We got brass on our tail.
Take it...

309
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,451
Pull it forward, you idiot!

310
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:15,685
Drop dead.
Pull it forward, you idiot!

311
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,518
Just a little bit. Hold it.

312
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:24,389
Hold it! Hold it!

313
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:26,554
You're dropping my merchandise!

314
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:28,893
Barrel and Eddie,
come on out of there.

315
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:31,195
Come on, Cortland.

316
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,974
Disaster.

317
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:40,778
Solid. Some driver, huh?
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.

318
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,608
- Complain to my union.
- Yeah, go ahead, tie it up.

319
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:45,944
- We near enemy territory yet?
- Too near.

320
00:35:46,118 --> 00:35:48,109
- Give me a cigarette.
- I don't smoke.

321
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,346
Sarge, when will we see
some Germans?

322
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,956
- Barrel?
- Smoke your own.

323
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:53,455
Got a cigarette, Eddie?

324
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:55,924
- You kidding?
- You cheapskates.

325
00:35:56,095 --> 00:35:58,757
Reach into my bag,
get me a carton of cigarettes.

326
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:00,762
What's with you and the Germans?

327
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,026
Nothing. I just ain't never seen one.

328
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,693
You know, I've never
even seen a German plane.

329
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,362
Sarge, when are we
gonna get in the action?

330
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,066
What are you, some kind of a nut?

331
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:13,803
What kind of replacements
they sending us, huh?

332
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:16,740
"I wanna see action."

333
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:19,578
- What's this?
- Put that back. That's merchandise.

334
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:22,243
Don't tell me there's women
where we're going.

335
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:26,118
- Who are you gonna give these to?
- Guffy don't give nothing.

336
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:28,919
- He's peddling them.
- You keep tying it up.

337
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:31,655
- Peddling them? To who?
- The boys in the front.

338
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:35,733
They're gonna need that in Germany.
There's lots of broads there.

339
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:39,636
- French perfume.
- Champagne.

340
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:43,138
That's gonna bring me 30 bills a bottle
where we're going.

341
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:46,745
Because there's nothing,
nothing too good for our boys.

342
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:49,904
- Yeah. What's in here?
- That's the mail.

343
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,176
Are you gonna charge them
something for that too?

344
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:59,013
- No, they wouldn't sit still for that.
- Just kidding, sarge. Just kidding.

345
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,921
No. When you get these thoughts,
tell me anyway...

346
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,461
...because one thing I'm not
going back home again is poor.

347
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:07,997
Keep thinking, kid. Very nice.

348
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:31,186
Germans?

349
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,390
This is the up-front front.

350
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,071
Wide awake bunch of boys.

351
00:37:52,244 --> 00:37:56,544
- Don't you people ever post a sentry?
- I'm sorry, sir. I came in for a second.

352
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:59,081
What's the matter?
Close the pneumonia hole.

353
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:01,845
- What were you born in, a barn?
- Oh, sorry, sir.

354
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:04,046
We didn't know it was you.

355
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:08,516
- Major Wolenski?
- He's over there, sir.

356
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:17,325
Hello, colonel. I wasn't expecting a visit
or I'd have had my men smarten up.

357
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,664
How are you?
Hot coffee for the colonel.

358
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,830
Come over and get warm.

359
00:38:22,374 --> 00:38:24,535
You run a pretty loose outfit here.

360
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,409
That radio's been yakking between
Christmas carols we're all going home.

361
00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:31,413
Here, sit down.

362
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:34,878
It's tough keeping discipline
when the only action...

363
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:37,215
...is sitting on your butt
to keep warm.

364
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:38,879
What are the Germans doing?

365
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:41,754
Same damn thing,
except they don't have any heat.

366
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:44,259
They gotta exercise
to keep from freezing.

367
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,593
Well, I got a little exercise
for your boys.

368
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:50,860
I wanna patrol tonight,
try to pick up some prisoners.

369
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:55,463
Well, there they are.

370
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:07,140
- Hey, sarge, put those blankets back.
- Come on, shut the window.

371
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:09,310
What do you wanna
do that for, sarge?

372
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:12,980
They're out of range. They'll
shoot back with something heavier.

373
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:17,322
It's you or them, dogface.
I need practice.

374
00:39:18,764 --> 00:39:20,231
That's enough, sergeant.

375
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,630
If you wanna play with that popgun,
you can go outside.

376
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:28,831
What do you say I take the men out
for a field drill, lieutenant?

377
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:33,636
In this weather? What for?

378
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:36,838
Because they're drilling, that's why.

379
00:39:37,016 --> 00:39:40,452
I'll let you know
when I want a drill, sergeant.

380
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:43,588
Yes, sir, lieutenant.

381
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:49,158
I'll take that sergeant.

382
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:53,526
All right. That's all right.
But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.

383
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:56,434
Here you are, colonel.

384
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:01,132
We got about three hours before dark.
How about some half-and-half?

385
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:03,172
Just sweeten it.

386
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:38,208
You are Colonel Hessler?

387
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:39,867
Who are you?

388
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:42,536
How did you get in here?

389
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:47,084
General Kohler's signature is magic.

390
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:49,186
You will excuse us, major.

391
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:52,222
Before you give orders,
may I ask your rank?

392
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:54,859
Courtesan, first class.

393
00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:57,587
Compliments of General Kohler.

394
00:40:57,796 --> 00:41:01,425
I think we have covered
everything, colonel.

395
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:10,540
General Kohler did not tell me
you were so handsome.

396
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:14,201
What did General Kohler
tell you about me?

397
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,439
Nothing.

398
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:20,443
Whatever I want to know...

399
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,512
...l'll find out for myself.

400
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,215
I'm very good at that.

401
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,858
Aren't you going
to offer me a drink?

402
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:41,231
Or have you been at the front so long
you have forgotten your manners?

403
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,110
What shall we talk about?

404
00:41:51,283 --> 00:41:53,717
Your wife perhaps.

405
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,718
Won't you join me?

406
00:42:05,497 --> 00:42:09,729
I am told I'm an attractive woman.

407
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,393
You are not paying
much attention to me.

408
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,734
Very little has escaped my attention.

409
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:20,171
General Kohler did tell me one thing.

410
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:26,943
What he admires most about you
is your reputation with the ladies.

411
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:33,790
I regret that is the opinion
of my commanding officer.

412
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:40,959
I have worked very hard
to achieve a reputation as a soldier.

413
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:43,601
Do not the two go together?

414
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,795
Give the general my compliments.
Tell him, "Thank you.

415
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:49,964
I appreciate his gesture."
And good night.

416
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,301
You can make your own way out.

417
00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:17,302
<i>Zero minus two hours.</i>

418
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,300
<i>All units ready to attack.</i>

419
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:25,432
<i>Repeat. Zero minus two hours.</i>
<i>All units ready to attack.</i>

420
00:43:35,587 --> 00:43:39,045
- Come on.
- Put them down, dummkopf.

421
00:43:43,328 --> 00:43:45,489
Hello, Kiley.

422
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:49,532
I was curious to see how
you interrogate your prisoners.

423
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:53,364
My other officers may be
asking the wrong questions.

424
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:57,405
I'm afraid you won't
hear any new answers.

425
00:43:57,576 --> 00:44:02,172
Sometimes it's more important
what you see than what they say.

426
00:44:12,424 --> 00:44:15,222
Could we get
a little more light in here?

427
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:17,419
How's that, sir?

428
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,610
So this is the face
of the undefeated enemy.

429
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:36,771
It looks like you've captured
a Sunday school class.

430
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:40,942
This all they have left to put in
the front lines? Where are the weapons?

431
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,916
Here, sir.

432
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,886
What's this?

433
00:44:51,463 --> 00:44:54,489
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.

434
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,725
- Did they put up any fight?
- No, sir.

435
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,836
Just gave up.

436
00:44:59,037 --> 00:45:02,666
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.

437
00:45:02,841 --> 00:45:04,775
Take a good look at them, Kiley.

438
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:08,743
They're not even tough enough
to be classified as delinquents.

439
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:12,441
Go ahead and question them.
Ask if Germany's gonna win the war.

440
00:45:12,618 --> 00:45:14,586
Go ahead, Kiley.

441
00:45:15,354 --> 00:45:19,120
They could be plants put
in the front lines to mislead us.

442
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:22,919
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.

443
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,360
Escort these prisoners to the rear
for proper interrogation.

444
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:28,294
Yes, sir. Move them out.

445
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:31,095
- Let's go, move it out.
- Go!

446
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,698
These prisoners
were carrying these rubber hoses.

447
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:37,205
Send them along,
and anything else you found.

448
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:39,569
Yes, sir.

449
00:45:42,214 --> 00:45:46,583
Do you actually still think the Germans
are preparing a major offensive?

450
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:49,144
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

451
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:52,984
You mean those kids are replacements
for more seasoned troops...

452
00:45:53,158 --> 00:45:56,218
...sent to the rear
to re-form for the big attack?

453
00:45:56,395 --> 00:45:58,625
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

454
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:03,533
Kiley, you're crazy. Facts mean nothing
to you. Evidence means nothing.

455
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:07,194
The only thing you can see
are your own cockeyed hunches.

456
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,899
Well, that doesn't work in the Army.

457
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:14,204
I'm recommending you for transfer
to a desk in Washington.

458
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:20,810
You can tell the president
how to run the war.

459
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:30,327
Major.

460
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:46,739
You make coffee as bad as my wife.

461
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:51,780
She always told me
I'd never get along in the Army.

462
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,519
I never had it so easy
in the police force.

463
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:04,417
I've just been counting up
how many times I've been wrong.

464
00:47:04,596 --> 00:47:07,190
But never this wrong.

465
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,095
All the signs point
to only one thing.

466
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:14,864
Is it possible they mean
something else?

467
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:21,276
Maybe this war is beyond me
and maybe Colonel Pritchard's right.

468
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:24,279
Runner brought this from headquarters.
It's for you.

469
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:25,814
Open it.

470
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,327
Well, it's a picture of a Kraut colonel
and his service record.

471
00:47:36,495 --> 00:47:38,963
I wanted that.

472
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:48,270
Well, there it is again. Panzer officer.
Fine fighting record.

473
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,807
Last reported in the Russian front
commanding a tank regiment.

474
00:47:51,977 --> 00:47:53,740
What's he doing here?

475
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,278
I'd say that proves my point.

476
00:47:56,448 --> 00:48:02,409
Colonel Pritchard would probably say
he got fired for losing the war in Russia.

477
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:07,155
I don't know. What do you think?

478
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:13,487
Well, sir. I'm regular Army.
I don't get into beefs between colonels.

479
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:18,530
But I'll tell you what some
of my stir-crazy men think.

480
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:21,934
They think we got
a great opportunity here.

481
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:25,270
We got a chance
to wipe out Germany.

482
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:29,540
Just wipe it clean off the map.
Knock everything down...

483
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:31,113
...every city...

484
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,810
...every castle, all the bridges,
all the roads. Everything.

485
00:48:34,986 --> 00:48:39,821
Don't leave two stones standing
together. Just wipe the slate clean.

486
00:48:39,991 --> 00:48:43,324
Turn Germany into a prairie,
then ship over a few buffalo...

487
00:48:43,495 --> 00:48:45,520
...and let them start from scratch.

488
00:48:45,697 --> 00:48:48,393
Now, what do you think
of that, colonel?

489
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:58,208
I think your men ought to wash their
socks and take a shave. It stinks in here.

490
00:49:35,947 --> 00:49:38,916
- Speak English. Only English.
- Okay, lieutenant.

491
00:49:39,084 --> 00:49:41,951
Let's get this stuff out of here.

492
00:49:59,971 --> 00:50:03,304
<i>Operation Transit</i>
<i>parachuted behind enemy lines.</i>

493
00:50:03,475 --> 00:50:08,606
<i>Repeat. Operation Transit</i>
<i>parachuted behind enemy lines.</i>

494
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,445
What the...?

495
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:25,708
What's that noise?

496
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:27,749
On your feet! Everybody out!

497
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:31,946
- Sounds like a thousand of them.
- Hey, Charlie, get battalion.

498
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:34,717
- Get battalion.
- On the double! On the double!

499
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:38,562
Sergeant, haul everybody out.

500
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,188
- Everybody out. Come on.
- Bazooka men, report to me.

501
00:52:44,602 --> 00:52:46,763
The line's dead, sir.

502
00:52:47,872 --> 00:52:50,739
Go! Go! Go!

503
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:05,787
What's that?

504
00:53:05,957 --> 00:53:09,256
"What's that?" And you wanted
to see Germans, right?

505
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:12,260
Come on! On the double!

506
00:53:12,964 --> 00:53:15,296
On the double!

507
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,334
Turn them over! Turn them over!
Let's go! Let's go!

508
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:24,098
Come on,
let's get this baby moving.

509
00:53:25,176 --> 00:53:29,237
<i>Colonel Hessler reports</i>
<i>panzer Tiger moving to the attack.</i>

510
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,904
<i>No enemy activity.</i>

511
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:35,143
<i>Northern front reporting</i>
<i>panzer Eisen entering Losheim Gap.</i>

512
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,254
<i>No enemy opposition encountered.</i>

513
00:54:04,015 --> 00:54:05,676
<i>Southern front reporting.</i>

514
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:10,787
<i>All elements of panzer Eisen</i>
<i>linking up at road junction 0-2.</i>

515
00:54:46,191 --> 00:54:48,250
Stay on my tail.

516
00:54:54,065 --> 00:54:55,589
Soldier.

517
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:57,735
Did they give you basic training?

518
00:54:57,902 --> 00:55:00,666
Here, you do it this way.

519
00:55:04,242 --> 00:55:07,905
They're green, never seen action before.
What do you expect?

520
00:55:16,888 --> 00:55:20,619
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here.
Nobody moves without orders.

521
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:22,384
Yes, sir.

522
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,423
Stay here. One more man
won't make a difference.

523
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,558
- I need to look inside one of those Tigers.
- All right, come on.

524
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:29,349
Relay to Standard O-bay.
I've made contact with enemy.

525
00:56:29,527 --> 00:56:31,495
Meeting weak resistance.

526
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:36,157
Take cover! Make a stand.
Take cover! Make a stand.

527
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:38,529
Make a stand.

528
00:56:57,021 --> 00:56:58,454
Load.

529
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,023
I said, load!

530
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:22,374
Tiger to Tank 104.
Tank 104, you're blocking the road.

531
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:25,175
Get off the road at once!

532
00:57:28,353 --> 00:57:30,287
There's your Tiger.

533
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:38,491
Wait a minute.

534
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,221
You're gonna need this.

535
00:57:40,398 --> 00:57:42,423
Take the greaser.

536
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:29,907
<i>Tiger to Tank 104,</i>
<i>what is your condition?</i>

537
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,616
<i>Tank 104, reply at once.</i>

538
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:35,980
<i>This is Colonel Hessler.</i>

539
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,353
Button up!

540
00:58:44,162 --> 00:58:45,652
Tigers at 11 o'clock.

541
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,266
Hit them hard, Eddie.

542
00:59:15,193 --> 00:59:16,524
They got Blondie.

543
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:26,603
Forget it. It's like hitting them
with tennis balls.

544
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,605
Come on, let's get out of here!

545
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,481
Get down and stay down.

546
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,292
Crawl, you dummy! Crawl.

547
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,227
Lieutenant,
keep those grenades coming.

548
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:06,469
Fall back!

549
01:00:07,745 --> 01:00:09,508
Fall back!

550
01:00:20,057 --> 01:00:21,991
Fall back!
