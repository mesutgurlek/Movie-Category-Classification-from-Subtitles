00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,900
<i>In this power 20th century,
almost every nation</i>

2
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,500
<i>in the world has at some
time been in conflict,</i>

3
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,009
<i>the oppressors and the oppressed,
the victors and the vanquished</i>

4
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:37,973
<i>The people of war are tragic
indictment of our civilization.</i>

5
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,863
<i>A time, when much of
the world was looking</i>

6
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:45,481
<i>for ways to increase their
influence, power and riches.</i>

7
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:48,400
<i>Full of dreams for the restoration of
the glory that was Rome, ...</i>

8
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:53,363
<i>in 1911 Italy joins
the hunt for territory.</i>

9
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:57,752
<i>Libya on the other side of the
Mediterranean sea is the target.</i>

10
00:02:57,754 --> 00:03:00,990
<i>Landings were made at Tripoli, ...</i>

11
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:06,650
<i>Benghazi, Zvora, Cert,
Derna and Tobruk.</i>

12
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,078
<i>The local population
fighting on many fronts,</i>

13
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,558
<i>made fierce and resolute
resistance to the</i>

14
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:21,750
<i>invaders, thus bringing
the war to a stale-mate.</i>

15
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:28,649
<i>1922 saw a dramatic change in Italy.</i>

16
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:32,611
<i>The beginning of Mussolini's
era of dictatorship.</i>

17
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,460
<i>The conflict in Libya escalated
as more and more fascists might</i>

18
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:43,720
<i>was thrown against the scithening
resistance of the local population.</i>

19
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:47,334
<i>Mussolini (The Duce):
"We will overrun the earth..."</i>

20
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:56,508
<i>"and then we will take the flag
of fascism to the throne."</i>

21
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:14,653
Ready, charge!

22
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,879
More... More... I don't understand.

23
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,593
If we defeated the Bedouins,
why are we still hanging them?

24
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:43,891
Why do I have to ford troops
into a victory I have already won?

25
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,773
Oh, I wish my generals were right,
two different dispatches,

26
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:54,818
one telling themselves of their
glorious victories

27
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:59,615
and one telling me of their defeats.

28
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:14,963
Can't go on..
I will not let it go on!

29
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,678
Here...

30
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,175
This green, this subtle green..

31
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:35,734
That's your prize, the
rest is brown paper.

32
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:41,740
Just need someone bold
enough to roll it up.

33
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,048
Graziani.

34
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,428
Come with me.

35
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:18,318
20 years.

36
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:24,283
20 worthless years we
wasted on this war.

37
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:31,540
I sent 5 governors to
Libya in 5 years.

38
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:42,009
No...the military logic of fascism
will not be compromised!

39
00:06:54,813 --> 00:07:00,861
It's wrong with Alway, Giada,
Bayonets, Bannu, Don.

40
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:07,618
What we are fighting in
reality is just tribesmen, ghosts.

41
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,036
I want their leader
brought here.

42
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:14,124
I want them brought to me and
I want the revolution crushed.

43
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,669
- What's his name?
- Omar Mukhtar

44
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:21,465
- Omar?
- Omar Mukhtar.

45
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:25,719
Omar Mukhtar.

46
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,378
You know general,

47
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:03,988
those colonists that we sent
over especially from the south,

48
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:07,788
they cost us leader
for leader almost

49
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,739
as if we put them up
at the grand hotel.

50
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:14,076
Now something must be wrong.

51
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,945
No...

52
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,320
I will not have a
handful of Bedouins...

53
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,200
stop the progress of
forty million Italians.

54
00:08:56,977 --> 00:09:00,314
I'll give you Libya, General.

55
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:05,027
At least you have a name
that will frighten them.

56
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:08,302
May I say, my Duce, that
when I crush rebellions,

57
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:12,166
I do so with a clear
conscience ensouled.

58
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:17,164
What did Mukhtar do before
the rebellion?

59
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,083
He was a teacher.

60
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,960
- A teacher?
- Yes.

61
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:24,212
I was a teacher.

62
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,383
Be careful you don't end up
as the five who went before you,

63
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,553
taught by him.

64
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:42,064
Well, I'm a man who likes action...
Go to Libya!

65
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:52,791
General...

66
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:57,119
Bring me back Mukhtar!

67
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:03,293
Bribe him or break his neck!

68
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:36,118
In the name of God,
the compassionate, the merciful

69
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,736
It is the god of mercy who
has man known the Koran,

70
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,873
he created man and
told him speech.

71
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:44,187
He set to the sun and the
moon in their courses.

72
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:47,659
He raised the sky up and set
the balance of whole things.

73
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,350
Stop right there!

74
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,350
Why do you think we begin
every chapter of the Koran with

75
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:58,265
"God, the merciful", uh?

76
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,687
Because, one of the names
of God is mercy.

77
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:06,064
That's right, yes.

78
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:09,651
And how..
does God show his mercy?

79
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:15,449
He taught..
people how to speak.

80
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:21,621
How to speak..
that's right.. yes.

81
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,625
And then there was something
else in what we read,

82
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:31,763
Can anybody...
can you tell me what that was?

83
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:36,731
- It was...
- Here, let me give you a hint...

84
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,587
- It was the what?
- It was the balance.

85
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:43,203
That's right...
the balance.

86
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:48,398
And why did God
set that balance?

87
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:55,469
Boys! Why did God
set the balance?

88
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:03,580
Because.. without the balance
everything would fall.

89
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:12,130
Uhm... let me see
what you read.

90
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:39,331
Everything did
fall apart though.

91
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:41,481
What are you
waiting for?

92
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:43,431
Go on.

93
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:53,828
Take it to your father.

94
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:15,141
Peace be upon you.

95
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:18,547
Where's Siddik Omar?

96
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:39,720
Yes, Bu-Matani,
what is the news?

97
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,182
- A new governor...
- ...again, huh?

98
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:49,188
They always come in like lions
and go home like worn-out goats.

99
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:54,860
- Well, who is it this time?
- Graziani.

100
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:58,005
- The butcher of the Zion.
- Graziani...

101
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:01,367
It was only a question of time
before they let him loose on us.

102
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,203
It will mean a new offensive.

103
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:10,042
My father used to say:
"Blows that don't break your back, ...

104
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:15,006
strengthen it."

105
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,428
We will show Graziani some spine.

106
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,705
They tell me that Graziani
loves blood?

107
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:45,128
I don't like to believe those stories.

108
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,974
And yet I do.

109
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:53,502
- When is he expected?
- They decorate in Benghazi for him.

110
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:40,063
Signore, signori,
his excellency

111
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:44,060
General Graziani,
governor of Sirinika,

112
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:50,169
his royal highness,
Prince Amadeo, Duke of Aosta.

113
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,251
Gentlemen, thank you.
But the ladies are present,

114
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,163
we should be at our ease.
Let the dancing continue.

115
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,619
General.
Colonel Sarsani.

116
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:43,623
Signore Tomelli.

117
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Diodiece! Here... in Benghazi?

118
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,000
The sun turns the rest of us
black in the desert,

119
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,000
but it seems to be
be turning you white.

120
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
I came to talk to him.

121
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,200
A drink first.

122
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,700
If Europe knew what we do here...

123
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,850
If even Italy knew...

124
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,900
But here in Libya we
photograph everything.

125
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,950
Whenever without a snap,
you know.

126
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
You mustn't tell me too much.

127
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,550
Even to tell you we are not abiding
by the Geneva convention?

128
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Colonel, don't... please.

129
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,450
Colonel Diodiece, sir.

130
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
Ah, yes.

131
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,650
Diodiece...

132
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:50,879
I read reports on you.

133
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,611
They say that you could make friends
with a Bedouin with a hand-shake.

134
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,305
I'm not so sure that I
like that it implies that

135
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,449
the rest of them are strangled
them in order to make peace.

136
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,915
Sir, there are 5,000 displaced
Bedouins outside my force.

137
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,078
I have no food for them.

138
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,675
I've difficulty in controlling
them and I need...

139
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:17,895
What you need Colonel,
what you need...

140
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:20,428
is a little bit
more of that.

141
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,892
Who is that man?

142
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,205
Sharif El Gariani.

143
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,334
He's quite useful to us,
old friend of Omar Mukhtar.

144
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,839
- Useful you say?
- Yes.

145
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,135
Bring him here.

146
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,432
I think you will find
that you can rely on him.

147
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:05,949
General Graziani, may I present
his excellency, Sharif El Gariani.

148
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,303
I understand that you know
Omar Mukhtar.

149
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:10,679
I did.

150
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,293
What would it take to get
him to surrender?

151
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:22,466
I don't know. Even as a boy,
he was terribly stubborn.

152
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:29,556
But if I could be of help in any way,
I should be very willing to agree.

153
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,852
You'll find that we can
be terribly generous.

154
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,488
Lt. Genieri, urgent message sir.

155
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,450
Can't it wait? You see
you're disturbing my guests.

156
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,379
Excuse me gentlemen.

157
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,558
They say, the flagman has lost tre
semana (ital./span. hogwash 'three weeks')...

158
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,408
while sleeping on his dispatches.

159
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:06,426
What is this?
Another wasted maneuver?

160
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:12,265
How many dead Italians?
20 dead, 50 wounded sir.

161
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,279
And they let him go again.

162
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,787
Yes, sir.

163
00:23:14,788 --> 00:23:17,378
- But, this time, he was seen.
- He was seen?

164
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,024
How do they know he was seen?
Nobody knows him.

165
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,483
How do they knew he was seen?

166
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:26,363
It was only for a moment sir.
But they are sure. It was Mukhtar.

167
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,660
I suppose I should decorate them
just for the bravery of seeing Mukhtar.

168
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,832
There could be.. There could be..
Could be anywhere..

169
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:44,726
Tomelli, I want you to use
a fast, hard hitting force

170
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:47,476
and you forget what
Omar Mukhtar looks like.

171
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,013
We're all obsessed by never
having seen him.

172
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:54,268
Go for his blood.
Go for his circulation.

173
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,852
Go for the revolution that
is inside every Bedouin.

174
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:05,652
Mukhtar's been fighting turns,
three months we run with him.

175
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,931
The next three months their
peace XXXXXX???.

176
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,450
Tomelli, no peace.

177
00:24:55,052 --> 00:24:58,121
Take your brother!

178
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,739
The women must hide!

179
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,714
Round up the men.

180
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,844
Those three at the end there.

181
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:02,886
And...

182
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,772
these two at the back.

183
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,902
And...

184
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,073
Yes...!

185
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,327
Let the young curb XXXXX????
(WTF is he saying???)

186
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,632
Some of you have conscript,

187
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:36,011
instead of going three months
...with Mukhtar.

188
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,057
You go one year to useful labor...

189
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,551
while you'll be out of town.

190
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,869
Burn their half
they give to Mukhtar.

191
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,079
Burn half of everything.

192
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,753
It's a bullet wound sir.

193
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:51,955
You were shot running
with Mukhtar, weren't you?

194
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,968
What have you to say?

195
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,308
What have you to say?

196
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,937
You do?

197
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:17,362
Well, you brought it on yourself.
Execute him.

198
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:24,659
Not, not over there. Here!
Let them see it.

199
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,780
In the name of God,
give him time to pray!

200
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,967
You're warned, be careful.

201
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:45,901
Saleem!

202
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:08,456
Murderer! Killers!

203
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,790
Aisha!

204
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,355
Aisha!

205
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:07,305
Mother,
I must do something.

206
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:11,155
Poor Aisha.

207
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,405
She forgot her veil.

208
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,962
Oh God!

209
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,090
I must do something!

210
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:30,680
Hameed,
they burned his tree.

211
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:45,320
I saw what happened,
my brother and Aisha.

212
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,204
And look, my father!
I'm going to Siddik Omar.

213
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,589
It's not your turn yet.

214
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,170
I became old enough today,
mother.

215
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,222
Please God,

216
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,683
I need you.

217
00:33:24,257 --> 00:33:26,752
They must pass through here.

218
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:39,273
That's our ground.

219
00:33:41,942 --> 00:33:49,241
Out there, that is it.

220
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:53,287
But you can't hide
a lizard out there.

221
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:32,659
Siddik Omar..

222
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:15,494
It's all clear sir.

223
00:35:27,631 --> 00:35:29,341
Check the other side.

224
00:36:14,803 --> 00:36:18,139
Sir, at last we got them
where we want them.

225
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:20,784
Let's crack it off them,
move it.

226
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:23,020
Let's go!

227
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:14,863
They're here.

228
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:17,991
Mount.

229
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:33,940
They're running!
Get your foot down!

230
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:52,175
We've run in a trap!
We must warn Tomelli!

231
00:37:57,981 --> 00:37:58,998
Do you hear that?

232
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:01,350
Could be Lt. Sandrini, sir.

233
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:11,503
What the hell is he doing?

234
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:13,589
Maybe warning shots sir.

235
00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:17,467
No! Stop!

236
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:19,011
Stop!

237
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:30,981
Do you see anything?

238
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:31,940
No, nothing sir.

239
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:35,902
Nothing.

240
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:40,198
They're getting away.
We have them in our hands!

241
00:38:41,325 --> 00:38:43,035
Full pursuit!

242
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:34,554
- Look at those machines.
- Siddik Omar.

243
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:51,655
We do not kill prisoners!
They do it to us.

244
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:54,874
They are not our teachers.

245
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:01,381
He's a boy.

246
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:16,646
Here.

247
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:21,860
Tell your general it
does not belong here.

248
00:44:21,456 --> 00:44:24,334
My husband?

249
00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:35,183
I... brought his book home.

250
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:44,479
Never turned his back on it...

251
00:44:52,279 --> 00:44:53,949
Come here.

252
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:57,556
- What is your name?
- Ali.

253
00:44:57,656 --> 00:44:59,678
Oh, yes, Ali.

254
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:02,142
This is yours.

255
00:45:02,584 --> 00:45:04,893
This is your book now.

256
00:45:06,752 --> 00:45:09,288
You tell your mother
to keep it for you.

257
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:48,069
Do not let him see you
crying too much.

258
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,087
One day they will carry on the fight.

259
00:45:51,546 --> 00:45:57,093
He truly should remember
him as strong and confident.

260
00:45:58,303 --> 00:46:01,181
Never broken.

261
00:46:01,973 --> 00:46:02,849
Go inside.

262
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:07,479
Let us go and see
the camp, Ali.

263
00:46:21,457 --> 00:46:23,661
There he is.

264
00:46:29,983 --> 00:46:33,077
This is my friend, Ali.

265
00:46:34,756 --> 00:46:38,218
This is Bu-Matari.
He has a little boy just like you.

266
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:41,763
He is in Kufr, that's far away,
in the desert.

267
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:47,126
He misses him. Now,
we have some work to do.

268
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:54,734
Be careful...

269
00:46:58,029 --> 00:47:02,158
Oh... Is this supposed
to be me? How do I look?

270
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:07,372
You've to give it back to me.
Otherwise, I cannot read.

271
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:12,585
You go... you go see.
Let the people work.

272
00:47:27,517 --> 00:47:31,896
Wiped out..
one Lieutenant...

273
00:47:32,605 --> 00:47:34,691
and one scout car...

274
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:36,818
That is all its left
of a fighting force.

275
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:41,739
I did not come to Libya to
be stung by Bandits.

276
00:47:43,116 --> 00:47:47,996
Senore Tomelli is one
of our finest officers.

277
00:47:48,621 --> 00:47:53,420
This young boy saved our honor,
he brought back the flag.

278
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:55,298
But sir...they gave us the flag.

279
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:57,964
Yes yes yes, you will be decorated
with the medal of honor.

280
00:47:58,381 --> 00:48:03,845
I never in my
career lost a flag.

281
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:07,182
Gentlemen, I will repeat
one simple fact to you,

282
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:08,882
We’re not merely
fighting Mukhtar and...

283
00:48:08,883 --> 00:48:11,402
200 of his men here or
50 of his men there.

284
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,742
We are fighting a population.

285
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,354
We have Rome to answer to.

286
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:21,738
I am therefore taking
the first of three final steps.

287
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:25,366
Strides to eliminate rebellion
in this colony.

288
00:48:26,776 --> 00:48:29,452
It's really quite simple and
should have been thought of before.

289
00:48:30,663 --> 00:48:34,292
I propose to concentrate the Bedouins.

290
00:48:34,584 --> 00:48:36,294
Concentrate them?

291
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:40,014
Yes, put them behind wire, camps
and keep them there until

292
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:42,708
we find them prudent or
safe to release them.

293
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:45,750
No, I don't want any
pity for them.

294
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:47,931
They have brought
it on themselves.

295
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:53,895
We will fill their wells,
we will burn their fields,

296
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:57,348
we will destroy their trees,
we will turn their land brown.

297
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,859
Now, if they cannot live
with it, they'll leave it.

298
00:49:01,002 --> 00:49:02,863
And.. if we meet a resistance?

299
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:06,240
You answer it promptly with the
old Roman punishment for rebellion:

300
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:07,316
Decimation.

301
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:13,250
It is ridiculous to think that
we can fight this war kindly.

302
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,000
We cannot.

303
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,050
We have to fight with authority.

304
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,400
To place half a million
people behind barb wire...

305
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:27,650
it is a promotable
and majestic undertaking.

306
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,000
And we will do it.

307
00:50:26,246 --> 00:50:29,375
Turn around.

308
00:50:31,293 --> 00:50:35,381
As mutinier and rebels,
you will be decimated.

309
00:50:50,788 --> 00:50:55,889
One... Two... Three... Four...

310
00:50:58,042 --> 00:51:06,203
Five... Six... Seven...
Eight... Nine... Ten...

311
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:02,434
They've taken everybody.

312
00:54:03,924 --> 00:54:06,259
Who can fight such a war?

313
00:54:07,052 --> 00:54:11,139
Not against armies, but
against innocent people.

314
00:54:13,308 --> 00:54:18,030
Old people will be dying in
those camps and come out.

315
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:24,486
People will be dying without
fault, without choice.

316
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:31,201
Or is it our fault
and our choice?

317
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:43,839
Look what they did.

318
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:28,175
"Raised the sky up and set
the balance of all things."

319
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:07,357
It's Siddik Omar!

320
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:52,762
No!

321
00:57:53,279 --> 00:57:55,281
They will be massacred.

322
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,996
You have a chance to get away,
take it!

323
00:58:03,038 --> 00:58:05,729
Go with Ismail!
Don't think of me!

324
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,463
Go!

325
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,393
Ali!

326
00:58:43,244 --> 00:58:44,204
Ali!

327
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:09,426
Hurry! Go back!

328
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,952
Up behind me, Ismail.
Up behind me!

329
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:36,289
Go back!
Go back for that boy!

330
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:39,259
The horse won't take two.
Ismail knows that.

331
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:44,891
Hurry up, Siddik Omar!

332
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,160
So, you're the brave young man.

333
01:01:30,994 --> 01:01:35,039
The brave young man
who saved Mukhtar from me.

334
01:01:42,005 --> 01:01:45,884
Why did you do it?
You are young.

335
01:01:46,634 --> 01:01:49,679
You had your whole life
ahead of you.

336
01:01:51,598 --> 01:01:55,810
Tell me, don't you want to live?

337
01:01:55,852 --> 01:01:56,603
Come on.

338
01:01:56,644 --> 01:02:00,023
I want him to live more.

339
01:02:00,482 --> 01:02:02,859
You'd make a fine soldier.

340
01:02:04,235 --> 01:02:06,338
Would you think of joining us?

341
01:02:06,339 --> 01:02:09,282
You are more ruthless
than I am, Prince.

342
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,593
You would corrupt him.

343
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,021
Get him out of here.

344
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:21,902
Give him what he asked
for, fruit, honey, whatever.

345
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:27,250
And don't harm him.
Hang him, in the morning.

346
01:02:35,391 --> 01:02:38,888
Does it ever worry you,
general, ...

347
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:42,900
that in our most casual acts
we make history here, ...

348
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:47,150
even if it's just a small paragraph
in a newspaper in Rome?

349
01:02:47,195 --> 01:02:54,327
You touched my strength, Prince.
You see I didn't care.

350
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:58,932
A day in the mind of Rome
is more important to me than...

351
01:03:00,033 --> 01:03:03,436
than a generation
in the memory of Libya.

352
01:03:06,188 --> 01:03:09,742
And what happens, I wonder,
if we are forgotten in Rome and...

353
01:03:09,926 --> 01:03:12,728
we are remembered in Libya?

354
01:03:12,762 --> 01:03:16,541
Don't you worry your
royal head about that.

355
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:19,718
You'll see, we will
write the history.

356
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:22,790
Libya is our crown of thorns.

357
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,250
Nonsense.

358
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:31,030
Libya is a career.

359
01:03:32,115 --> 01:03:33,324
Look at it.

360
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,372
Look at it.

361
01:03:43,459 --> 01:03:47,922
It's always the same. We can never
persue them in the desert.

362
01:03:48,881 --> 01:03:51,200
I must conquer the desert
to march on Kufra.

363
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:55,750
From here to here.

364
01:03:56,468 --> 01:03:58,800
Simple.. isn't it?

365
01:03:59,642 --> 01:04:01,477
No, it's not.

366
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:03,271
But, its only empty desert.

367
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,900
There's nothing there,
just wind and sand,

368
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:10,200
not even much opposition.

369
01:04:11,988 --> 01:04:16,117
What can you get from it?
- Glory for Rome.

370
01:04:16,701 --> 01:04:21,789
An extension of the empire
confining a revolution to that mountain.

371
01:04:23,082 --> 01:04:28,304
My name, a new page
in military history.

372
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:31,557
You see, it's quite full
that desert of yours, isn't it?

373
01:04:35,261 --> 01:04:37,154
I will surprise you.

374
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:38,304
Come in.

375
01:04:46,439 --> 01:04:50,600
Diodiece, now it's your time.
Please, sit down.

376
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:51,900
Thank you.

377
01:04:55,439 --> 01:04:59,276
The man who can make
peace with a hand-shake.

378
01:05:02,404 --> 01:05:03,302
Do it now....

379
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:05,798
Hands across the desert.

380
01:05:08,786 --> 01:05:12,456
I wish you to instigate to
peace talks with his excelleny.

381
01:05:15,726 --> 01:05:18,313
Omar Mukhtar.

382
01:05:22,858 --> 01:05:27,405
- That will not be so easy now.
- No, but you will do it, won't you?

383
01:05:27,822 --> 01:05:32,618
And what are the pre-conditions
for talks with Omar Mukhtar?

384
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:37,965
No pre-conditions. The whole of
Libya is open to discussion.

385
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,550
Look at it.

386
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,100
Look at it.

387
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,556
We go to the conference
table with an open mind, do we not?

388
01:05:46,332 --> 01:05:51,671
He fought us for 20 years.
We are an enemy he knows.

389
01:05:52,304 --> 01:05:55,300
He has heard all our promises.

390
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,500
20 years is too long.

391
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:59,270
I mean can you imagine
escaping hanging for 20 years

392
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,400
knowing you can't win this,

393
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:02,890
just... hoping to keep on?

394
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,003
It's the war that's hope
for the man.

395
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:08,200
He'll be mad to get on his
high horse about past promises.

396
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:15,985
When may I in your excellency's
name sit down with him?

397
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:18,499
You're too eager.

398
01:06:19,374 --> 01:06:23,753
When you talk to Omar Muktar,
it must be with the speed of dictation.

399
01:06:24,707 --> 01:06:30,095
Regress whether he wants talk or not.
You test him, you try him.

400
01:06:36,265 --> 01:06:40,311
Yes, I will try.

401
01:06:40,352 --> 01:06:41,353
Thank you very much.

402
01:06:42,396 --> 01:06:46,358
Thank you for coming at such
short notice. It was very kind of you.

403
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,541
Thank you.

404
01:06:59,205 --> 01:07:03,084
Well, let's settle this.
Diodiece is not the right man.

405
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:06,754
He will offer.
But Mukhtar can't take.

406
01:07:07,088 --> 01:07:10,132
And Muktar will ask
what he can't give.

407
01:07:10,758 --> 01:07:14,804
Which makes me think,
you want things go long.

408
01:07:19,141 --> 01:07:20,476
No.

409
01:07:21,185 --> 01:07:26,107
That's unfair, of course, I want peace,
of course. I want to win that peace.

410
01:07:27,108 --> 01:07:29,402
But sometimes, Prince,
when you are strong, ...

411
01:07:29,403 --> 01:07:32,830
peace takes on the nature
of 'conquest is enough'.

412
01:07:34,865 --> 01:07:39,829
He won't give me peace.
But he'll give me his time.

413
01:07:40,371 --> 01:07:41,288
What I need is time.

414
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:21,804
So that's what he looks like.

415
01:08:22,388 --> 01:08:27,434
After all these years,
we are the first to see him.

416
01:08:31,647 --> 01:08:34,233
The Old Lion!

417
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:41,778
Peace be upon you.

418
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:47,696
- Colonel Diodiece?
- Yes sir.

419
01:08:51,876 --> 01:08:52,835
Please.

420
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:01,218
This side.

421
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,780
Colonel Barillo, military
governor of Merch.

422
01:09:23,081 --> 01:09:27,749
This is Commissioner Lobito,
who has come directly from Rome...

423
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:30,330
to advice and assist us.

424
01:09:35,552 --> 01:09:38,347
Look, you invited us here to talk.

425
01:09:39,097 --> 01:09:40,223
We are here.

426
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:47,230
Your excellency,
it is my one wish

427
01:09:47,648 --> 01:09:51,902
to see the Italian and the Arab
together in the same interest.

428
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:56,750
I foresee a future
of common cause,

429
01:09:57,328 --> 01:10:01,500
a give and take of
character and skill.

430
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:08,885
Our civilization and your
culture in marriage of virtues.

431
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:13,950
I want observers from the
governments of Tunisia and Egypt

432
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:17,100
to witness any
agreements between us.

433
01:10:17,545 --> 01:10:19,463
As for as I am concerned...

434
01:10:19,505 --> 01:10:20,850
Out of the question!

435
01:10:20,965 --> 01:10:25,350
He is seeking international
recognition, as if the Bedouins

436
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,200
were an independent nation,
which they are not.

437
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,850
They are subjects within our province.

438
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:35,500
Our arguments are not within
nations, but between Italians.

439
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:40,192
We cannot permit outside
interference  in our internal affairs.

440
01:10:40,692 --> 01:10:42,764
Then why must we
represent this?

441
01:10:42,765 --> 01:10:46,000
We are not Italians so do
not tell us that we are.

442
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,250
We were born where we were
born, only by the will of God

443
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:53,350
and only by our own mothers.
We are not you.

444
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:57,000
We will come to foreign
observers later, uh?

445
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,504
As yet, there is nothing written,
nothing witnessed.

446
01:11:02,097 --> 01:11:04,683
But we have written.

447
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:22,800
We must have
our muslims schools...

448
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:29,750
Oh yes. No question. Freedom
of education, no question.

449
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,961
The schools will be re-opened.

450
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:38,451
We must have some form
of national protection.

451
01:11:38,844 --> 01:11:41,590
We must have a
National Parliament..

452
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,850
The Parliament is
a matter for Rome.

453
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,309
This tent is not the place.

454
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:47,176
Why not?

455
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:50,715
You pitched it, no conditions you
said, no limits, no exclusions,

456
01:11:50,715 --> 01:11:54,928
everything open on this
table in this tent.

457
01:11:54,434 --> 01:12:00,300
Let us say that, at present we will
note your demand for the parliament.

458
01:12:00,554 --> 01:12:02,441
Mark it well.

459
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:14,829
The confiscated lands
must be given back.

460
01:12:15,663 --> 01:12:16,790
Well...

461
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:21,044
Now, I wouldn't say confiscated lands.

462
01:12:21,144 --> 01:12:25,781
I would say lands reserved for
settlement and cultivation.

463
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,800
Lands to be developed.

464
01:12:28,897 --> 01:12:31,993
To be developed by Italians?

465
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:35,964
I tell you there is no
escape 20 years, 40 years,

466
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,719
the land will be back
to its people.

467
01:12:40,688 --> 01:12:42,878
Why do you think we fight you?

468
01:12:42,879 --> 01:12:46,527
But, the new settlements
will provide employment.

469
01:12:47,653 --> 01:12:50,575
As long as you take our lands,
for as long we're able...

470
01:12:50,576 --> 01:12:51,657
we must fight you.

471
01:12:51,966 --> 01:12:54,535
- Must?
- Yes, we must.

472
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:58,399
But, I have it on religious
authority that your

473
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,543
Koran does not permit you to
fight a war you cannot win.

474
01:13:03,169 --> 01:13:06,797
Now, you are going to
interpret our religion for us...

475
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:09,486
The Book leaves no doubt.

476
01:13:09,488 --> 01:13:12,678
It is our duty to God
to defend ourselves

477
01:13:12,754 --> 01:13:17,308
against those who have
driven us out of our homes!

478
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,050
I think this might be a
good time to adjourn.

479
01:13:21,052 --> 01:13:23,706
We are in no hurry.

480
01:13:26,376 --> 01:13:28,920
Why are you delaying?

481
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:35,558
Your excellency, we are obliged to
refer your demands to Rome.

482
01:13:36,002 --> 01:13:38,226
At our next meeting...

483
01:13:38,227 --> 01:13:41,291
we will give you their answer
and make our proposals.

484
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:46,971
At least.. we know that
we all want...

485
01:13:46,972 --> 01:13:49,995
the blood-shed
between us to end.

486
01:15:10,354 --> 01:15:13,441
An Italian innovation.

487
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,945
The first to use
aircraft in combat, ...

488
01:15:17,762 --> 01:15:20,974
the first to put tanks
in the desert.

489
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,019
History will mark that, gentlemen.

490
01:15:28,606 --> 01:15:33,110
What we needed was time.
Now, we have achieved that time ...

491
01:15:34,069 --> 01:15:38,651
with talk peace, with eloquence.

492
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:43,171
1. Omar Mukhtar's men will come under
the command of Italian Officers.

493
01:15:45,356 --> 01:15:46,174
Go on...

494
01:15:46,783 --> 01:15:51,704
2. The Italian Government will
pay monthly salaries to these men.

495
01:15:52,055 --> 01:15:53,264
Go on.

496
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,141
Go on!

497
01:15:57,227 --> 01:16:00,746
The Government reserves
the right to punish any persons

498
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,806
who committed a crime
before this agreement.

499
01:16:03,942 --> 01:16:08,800
Omar Mukhtar will have no
right to protect such persons.

500
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:09,472
4. ...

501
01:16:09,473 --> 01:16:12,742
- These terms mean dishonour.
- Absolute surrender.

502
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:16,204
Not even subjects for discussion.

503
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:19,577
The Italian Government
undertakes to pay

504
01:16:19,578 --> 01:16:22,877
Omar Mukhtar a pension of
50,000 lira a month.

505
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:26,089
and to provide him with
a comfortable house.

506
01:16:27,632 --> 01:16:30,000
Do I deserve so much?

507
01:16:30,094 --> 01:16:33,490
Have I been so successful
for someone to  offer me...

508
01:16:33,508 --> 01:16:37,183
50,000 lira a month?

509
01:16:37,183 --> 01:16:41,896
You know, by offering me
bribes you are insulting me.

510
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:47,569
Your Excellency,
I made that proposal.

511
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:49,612
Believe me..

512
01:16:49,904 --> 01:16:54,117
It was not an attempt
to bribe you.

513
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:58,750
Only to make your
retirement comfortable.

514
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:02,842
How can I be comfortable when
my people are in concentration camps?

515
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:06,087
And where is this General
who bombs and burns and hangs?

516
01:17:06,171 --> 01:17:08,381
Why has be never come here?

517
01:17:08,631 --> 01:17:11,134
One term is agreed
between us...

518
01:17:11,175 --> 01:17:13,261
General Graziani will be
happy to see you.

519
01:17:13,303 --> 01:17:19,267
I do not want to see him.
I want to see the last of him.

520
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:25,648
And why is he landing troops?
Where is he going, to the last oasis?

521
01:17:25,648 --> 01:17:28,443
6,000 drums of water!

522
01:17:32,864 --> 01:17:38,453
He is going to Kufra.

523
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:46,753
He never wanted peace.
All you wanted was time.

524
01:17:48,338 --> 01:17:51,215
We will be with Graziani.

525
01:17:51,674 --> 01:17:53,533
If you will not come to terms,

526
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:55,845
I promise you immediate
and terrible war!

527
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,181
Oh, I know the power
of your Government,

528
01:17:58,182 --> 01:18:01,058
the power you
threaten us with...

529
01:18:01,184 --> 01:18:05,897
We've stood against you for 20 years
... and with the help of God,

530
01:18:06,356 --> 01:18:11,486
we will stay with you till your end.

531
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:17,066
I knew this conclusion....

532
01:18:32,081 --> 01:18:37,350
Poor fools! They think they
can ride against a modern army...

533
01:19:50,109 --> 01:19:52,862
It is Kufra, no question.

534
01:19:54,029 --> 01:19:58,845
Thousands of soldiers and
machines, all going to Kufra.

535
01:19:58,951 --> 01:20:01,728
Graziani is doing what
no one has ever done.

536
01:20:01,729 --> 01:20:03,748
He's putting tanks in a desert.

537
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:07,500
Time... is on our side.

538
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:16,469
Graziani is marching south to Kufra.
We attack north. We throw him back.

539
01:20:16,844 --> 01:20:19,000
But we must fight him for Kufra.

540
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:24,467
Sometimes, it is braver not to die.
What is lost count as lost.

541
01:20:25,394 --> 01:20:27,855
We know your family is there.

542
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,401
But, to defend Kufra is to die there.

543
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:46,040
I must go.

544
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:52,464
Yes, yes you must.

545
01:22:25,092 --> 01:22:29,118
- Are you ready to patter them?
- Yes sir.

546
01:22:29,763 --> 01:22:32,435
Good...then, give them hell.

547
01:22:32,474 --> 01:22:35,018
Lt. Sandrini, open fire!

548
01:22:52,503 --> 01:22:53,699
Fire!

549
01:23:00,335 --> 01:23:02,170
Go now.

550
01:25:46,751 --> 01:25:48,907
Fire everything on them!

551
01:25:51,339 --> 01:25:53,571
Bomb it to the front!

552
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,651
Murderers!

553
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,635
- What are you doing?
- Colonel Sarsana's orders.

554
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:54,483
No retreat, we fight and die here.

555
01:30:28,187 --> 01:30:29,386
Fire!

556
01:31:51,614 --> 01:31:54,367
Gentlemen, this is Kufra.

557
01:32:42,575 --> 01:32:48,337
The seizure of Kufra
has hurt us deeply.

558
01:32:48,463 --> 01:32:51,382
It has closed the south.

559
01:32:52,049 --> 01:32:58,406
The only road for military supplies
is across the Egyptian Border.

560
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:06,564
We are in desperate
need of supplies, food...

561
01:33:06,564 --> 01:33:09,192
Three Italian cars coming
up the Merch Road!

562
01:33:09,325 --> 01:33:13,154
- How many?
- Three. They are flying white flags.

563
01:33:13,696 --> 01:33:15,907
Let them in.

564
01:33:18,409 --> 01:33:20,495
We will finish later.

565
01:33:45,255 --> 01:33:50,141
Sharif El Gariani.

566
01:33:52,735 --> 01:33:55,655
To come through, we had to
use the Italian cars.

567
01:33:56,072 --> 01:34:02,119
- You found them comfortable?
- We want to talk to you alone.

568
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:05,331
What we have to say
cannot be said in public.

569
01:34:05,623 --> 01:34:08,793
Then, it is not to be said to me.

570
01:34:10,086 --> 01:34:11,699
Omar, why do you not surrender?

571
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:15,015
Obtain the best terms
you can from the Italians.

572
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:19,672
Mohamed XXXX??? can arrange a safe
conduct for you out of the country.

573
01:34:19,713 --> 01:34:22,692
Safe conduct? Where to?

574
01:34:22,942 --> 01:34:24,442
Egypt.

575
01:34:24,684 --> 01:34:28,229
Ah... to Egypt...
to hide with his brother.

576
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:31,600
You are the only sonusi
left in this country.

577
01:34:31,709 --> 01:34:34,151
I look at you.
Just...

578
01:34:35,444 --> 01:34:39,073
Just look at him.

579
01:34:40,533 --> 01:34:42,312
But my people have fought...

580
01:34:42,362 --> 01:34:44,362
To defend your own privileges!

581
01:34:45,288 --> 01:34:47,164
Where are you now?
- Omar Mukhtar...

582
01:34:48,165 --> 01:34:50,382
The Italians assured us...

583
01:34:50,383 --> 01:34:51,877
You better get back to them.

584
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:55,298
My friend, they are the
government of this country.

585
01:34:55,298 --> 01:34:58,217
No, they take this land by day,

586
01:34:58,217 --> 01:35:00,761
but, by God,
we take it back by night.

587
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:03,556
Omar Mukhtar,
you are alone, ...

588
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:07,351
cut off from the rest of this country,
isolated from the rest of the world.

589
01:35:08,311 --> 01:35:12,523
In the league of nations,
you will not speak.

590
01:35:13,716 --> 01:35:16,269
And if they should,
they will not listen.

591
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:17,819
No one would care.

592
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:21,733
This battle is not being fought
in the league of nations.

593
01:35:21,734 --> 01:35:25,769
This battle is being
fought here on this land.

594
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:27,788
Omar, you cannot win this war.

595
01:35:27,872 --> 01:35:30,666
Your blood against their metal?

596
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,346
Every man has two days, his
own day... and his children's day.

597
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:39,617
Your children are starving,
dying in the concentration camps.

598
01:35:39,892 --> 01:35:42,762
Dying... because you
persist in fighting.

599
01:35:42,954 --> 01:35:45,615
Yes, they are hostages of war.

600
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,218
But not one of them betrays me.

601
01:35:48,361 --> 01:35:50,954
Not one has asked me
to surrender...

602
01:35:51,056 --> 01:35:55,232
because they know and I know
that if I surrender I betray them.

603
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:57,549
Omar, we grew up together.

604
01:35:57,550 --> 01:36:01,074
Don't you remember 70 years
ago, we were boys together.

605
01:36:01,197 --> 01:36:04,325
Yes, yes I remember.

606
01:36:05,201 --> 01:36:08,579
Look how far apart we have grown.

607
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:14,377
This may be the last chance you have
for seeking an honourable peace.

608
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:20,115
They steal our land, they destroy
our homes,  they kill innocent people

609
01:36:20,299 --> 01:36:23,135
and you call it peace?

610
01:36:23,761 --> 01:36:27,723
I will not be corrupted by
that man's peace.

611
01:36:30,643 --> 01:36:35,022
- Perhaps we should go.
- Yes, I think you should!

612
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:37,066
Yes, you should.

613
01:40:31,782 --> 01:40:34,042
- Mabrouka?
- Yes.

614
01:40:40,507 --> 01:40:42,384
You're alive...

615
01:40:44,588 --> 01:40:47,941
Yes, with Siddik Omar.

616
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:50,225
I prayed for you.

617
01:40:51,352 --> 01:40:55,940
When he sees Malik showed
him the back, he gave it to me.

618
01:41:17,862 --> 01:41:19,688
My boy.

619
01:41:22,141 --> 01:41:24,246
My baby.

620
01:41:48,659 --> 01:41:51,787
Was he a brave boy?

621
01:41:57,626 --> 01:41:59,962
Will you be back?

622
01:42:00,671 --> 01:42:01,672
Yes.

623
01:42:03,716 --> 01:42:06,552
But not for some time.

624
01:42:12,099 --> 01:42:14,518
Go.

625
01:42:14,601 --> 01:42:15,853
Go now.

626
01:44:23,106 --> 01:44:25,203
Up you get!
Come on, out!

627
01:44:25,303 --> 01:44:29,296
- The child is sick sir.
- I don't want him. I don't care.

628
01:44:58,607 --> 01:45:00,759
You are accused of giving aid,

629
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:04,468
comfort and sustainance to
the rebels in the mountain.

630
01:45:05,105 --> 01:45:08,609
Do you admit these capital crimes?

631
01:45:12,654 --> 01:45:15,240
So, you are admitting your guilt?

632
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,748
You will all hang by your necks...

633
01:45:24,666 --> 01:45:27,586
until you are dead.

634
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:42,414
As the holder of a Silver medal
of Honour, Lieutenant,

635
01:46:42,415 --> 01:46:45,329
you will have the privilege of
giving the order for the execution.

636
01:46:45,662 --> 01:46:47,039
No!

637
01:46:49,416 --> 01:46:54,451
What did you say?
You will do your duty Leutinant.

638
01:46:55,839 --> 01:46:59,510
I did not join the army
to hang women, sir.

639
01:46:59,684 --> 01:47:01,202
Very well...

640
01:47:03,658 --> 01:47:08,627
Lt. Sandrini, you will consider
yourself under arrest.

641
01:47:39,133 --> 01:47:43,762
Thank you God for the lives
you have given.

642
01:48:14,569 --> 01:48:19,490
What am I to do?
You refused your duty.

643
01:48:20,074 --> 01:48:23,536
Insubordination is a
very serious offence.

644
01:48:24,078 --> 01:48:26,574
When your officers start to
cry conscience...

645
01:48:26,575 --> 01:48:28,447
you had that word
lent to you.

646
01:48:28,749 --> 01:48:32,549
I'm prepared to answer to
the Court Marshall sir.

647
01:48:36,507 --> 01:48:42,597
Indeed... and I am not prepared to
loose one of my colony's new heroes.

648
01:48:43,514 --> 01:48:44,740
The hero I created.

649
01:48:44,741 --> 01:48:47,224
I will not give you
the pleasure nor the

650
01:48:47,225 --> 01:48:49,645
publicity of a Court
Marshall, Sandrini.

651
01:48:51,689 --> 01:48:54,734
As an officer, you were taught to
obey orders not to question orders.

652
01:48:55,151 --> 01:48:59,780
- Yes sir, but..
- Do not dispute with me!

653
01:49:03,117 --> 01:49:07,163
The state has needs that outweigh
the conscious of the individual.

654
01:49:07,296 --> 01:49:11,116
Demands that go beyond
individual intelligence, don't you agree?

655
01:49:12,168 --> 01:49:13,878
Yes sir.

656
01:49:14,663 --> 01:49:18,341
You will report to Sarsani for
duty in the mountains.

657
01:49:18,716 --> 01:49:21,969
I will give you the honour
of dying XXXXXX???.

658
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,052
The old man has these mountains.

659
01:51:09,302 --> 01:51:11,002
And he uses them.

660
01:51:11,952 --> 01:51:13,652
XXXXX??? prove that.

661
01:51:15,602 --> 01:51:17,502
Beyond this mountain range...

662
01:51:17,652 --> 01:51:19,952
there's a plateau
upon which instinct...

663
01:51:20,202 --> 01:51:23,002
Instinct tells us the tanks
can't operate.

664
01:51:23,052 --> 01:51:24,752
Now, that is not true!

665
01:51:24,802 --> 01:51:26,302
- Can we do it?
- Yes, but it will...

666
01:51:26,552 --> 01:51:28,952
It will be decisive.

667
01:51:29,002 --> 01:51:31,902
We control the approaches
here, here and here.

668
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:34,152
These are tank roads now.
Use them, will you?

669
01:51:34,402 --> 01:51:38,202
- Uhm...
- Intelligence!

670
01:51:40,852 --> 01:51:42,552
If I can think about that
you execute it, ...

671
01:51:42,602 --> 01:51:44,502
especially if I could put you
on that plateau, ...

672
01:51:44,507 --> 01:51:46,352
that'd be XXXX??? shock XXXXX???
- Yes.

673
01:51:46,602 --> 01:51:51,802
Our directive Mukthar.
Here, using artillery, ...

674
01:51:52,052 --> 01:51:53,752
gas, aircraft, no armor.

675
01:51:54,002 --> 01:51:56,902
Once he's committed himself
30 kilometeres to the west...

676
01:51:56,952 --> 01:51:58,852
by this road...

677
01:51:59,002 --> 01:52:01,002
then we will push
by armors through.

678
01:52:01,052 --> 01:52:02,752
That'll leave 'em with
their mouths zipped.

679
01:52:04,702 --> 01:52:06,502
Let's flush them out!

680
01:52:55,752 --> 01:53:00,152
- Gas will be our prison.
- We must get to high ground.

681
01:53:01,502 --> 01:53:03,002
Get back to high ground!

682
01:53:03,752 --> 01:53:05,552
Move everybody!

683
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:36,602
Captain...

684
01:54:17,652 --> 01:54:18,552
XXXXXXXXX???

685
01:55:19,902 --> 01:55:23,102
They've given us five days
and nights of it.

686
01:55:35,652 --> 01:55:38,352
He's making a big push
for the mountains.

687
01:55:40,702 --> 01:55:42,602
No use in artillery.

688
01:55:43,052 --> 01:55:45,752
His tracks and armored cars
are useless in the mountains.

689
01:55:46,102 --> 01:55:48,202
We can only operate
on level ground.

690
01:55:49,252 --> 01:55:50,752
Yes.

691
01:55:51,602 --> 01:55:53,402
But he forced us here.

692
01:55:53,852 --> 01:55:55,752
What does that suggest?

693
01:55:58,102 --> 01:56:00,102
He wants control of
the mountain roads.

694
01:56:00,352 --> 01:56:01,852
Yes.

695
01:56:02,102 --> 01:56:03,602
And what is there?

696
01:56:07,052 --> 01:56:08,452
The bridge...

697
01:56:08,502 --> 01:56:10,202
at Wadi Al-Kouf.

698
01:56:12,552 --> 01:56:14,252
That is what he wants.

699
01:56:14,649 --> 01:56:17,736
Gentlemen, this time he
won't get away.

700
01:56:18,909 --> 01:56:21,163
First, we take the bridge,

701
01:56:21,164 --> 01:56:25,811
get our armour behind him,
artillery in front of him.

702
01:56:25,993 --> 01:56:27,263
then we pound him
into submission.

703
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:31,757
About the bridge sir, I'm surprised
that Mukhtar hasn't tried to cut it.

704
01:56:32,697 --> 01:56:35,427
That's because he's an artful
fighter, not an educated one.

705
01:56:35,428 --> 01:56:37,837
He didn't go to military
academy like you gentlemen.

706
01:56:40,018 --> 01:56:44,981
Now is the time, we dangle the bait.

707
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,053
Check the bridge.

708
01:57:57,261 --> 01:57:58,846
Sargeant, check the bridge.

709
01:58:20,702 --> 01:58:21,878
All clear.

710
01:58:21,879 --> 01:58:26,582
Right, check the next bridge,
I will hold this one here.

711
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:38,136
He is careful.

712
01:58:39,595 --> 01:58:41,013
He is showing his naive.

713
01:59:06,038 --> 01:59:07,500
That is bait.

714
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:10,100
We should  have
blown up the bridge.

715
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,350
No.

716
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,600
The scout cars, we must stop them.

717
01:59:25,808 --> 01:59:27,643
Give the signal.

718
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:00,946
You see?

719
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:07,118
Look the mice,

720
02:01:07,702 --> 02:01:11,581
they could never resist the
cheese, could they?

721
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:12,650
Never.

722
02:01:55,876 --> 02:01:58,129
Prepare the artillery to open fire.

723
02:02:04,218 --> 02:02:05,177
Blast them!

724
02:03:03,444 --> 02:03:05,696
Now, send in the army.

725
02:04:13,013 --> 02:04:17,142
Now, he has made his move.
Let's go.

726
02:04:45,212 --> 02:04:47,172
Look, over there.

727
02:05:48,226 --> 02:05:50,395
Ambush!

728
02:05:50,854 --> 02:05:51,646
Now.

729
02:08:30,429 --> 02:08:32,264
He is good.

730
02:08:33,515 --> 02:08:35,892
He is good.

731
02:08:38,186 --> 02:08:40,772
This old man is good.

732
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,127
My dear General

733
02:09:50,266 --> 02:09:51,282
My dear dear General.

734
02:09:52,083 --> 02:09:54,600
I hope you don't mind that
I share some of your credit

735
02:09:54,650 --> 02:09:56,900
but after all, I chose you.

736
02:09:57,046 --> 02:09:59,667
- I hope, Duce, that I can...
- You can have anything you want.

737
02:09:59,668 --> 02:10:01,801
You're the most fortunate
man in this room.

738
02:10:03,469 --> 02:10:06,764
I have physically moved the war
from the desert into the mountains.

739
02:10:07,098 --> 02:10:08,927
The last remnant of the enemy
has now run into holes,

740
02:10:08,928 --> 02:10:10,833
we find ourselves into a
position whereby we are

741
02:10:10,852 --> 02:10:14,314
are forced to pull them out
by their necks one by one.

742
02:10:15,273 --> 02:10:16,691
Duce, I didn't know..

743
02:10:17,275 --> 02:10:19,068
I know.

744
02:10:21,362 --> 02:10:23,489
You are having difficulties.

745
02:10:25,501 --> 02:10:27,573
You're having problems with
them being in the mountains.

746
02:10:28,088 --> 02:10:32,775
I don't seem to have an enemy to
fight, yet they attack and assasinate.

747
02:10:32,775 --> 02:10:33,957
I mean, they have no form,

748
02:10:33,958 --> 02:10:36,413
if they have form,
I could beat them with form.

749
02:10:36,586 --> 02:10:40,086
But they have no continuity of
movement, no fixed point of position.

750
02:10:41,917 --> 02:10:44,670
I haven't however have
to come to my Duce to remind him.

751
02:10:47,222 --> 02:10:49,807
I have a radical solution.

752
02:10:49,974 --> 02:10:51,559
A New Hadrian's Wall.

753
02:10:52,518 --> 02:10:53,937
Except..

754
02:10:54,771 --> 02:10:59,484
that Hadrian used his walls to
shut the Barbarians Out.

755
02:10:59,984 --> 02:11:02,111
Which is mine is to shut them in.

756
02:11:02,445 --> 02:11:06,616
I propose, my Duce,
the fence in Libya.

757
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:10,598
To run a war in an impossible
wire across the desert,

758
02:11:10,599 --> 02:11:15,048
from the Mediterranean to the
shores of this sea of moving sand.

759
02:11:16,668 --> 02:11:19,205
It will cut the enemies
off from his supplies out

760
02:11:19,206 --> 02:11:21,995
of Egypt and cut him off
from his retreat into Egypt.

761
02:11:21,995 --> 02:11:28,566
Duce, my Duce!
Hundreds of miles of barbed wire?

762
02:11:29,931 --> 02:11:32,493
But is it possible
to know the cost?

763
02:11:32,494 --> 02:11:34,852
Why do you question
Hadrian's Wall?

764
02:11:35,395 --> 02:11:38,314
Remember, it was
Hadrian's Wall that kept

765
02:11:38,315 --> 02:11:41,234
the Romans in Britain
100 years longer.

766
02:12:36,534 --> 02:12:38,573
Thousands of tons of equipment...

767
02:12:38,823 --> 02:12:40,323
4000 men...

768
02:12:40,573 --> 02:12:43,573
Six months in the whole job
completing the last part.

769
02:12:46,723 --> 02:12:48,123
You're awful.

770
02:12:48,373 --> 02:12:49,873
You don't even look it
your own vision...

771
02:12:50,123 --> 02:12:52,423
of XXXXX himself
XXXXX primal, do you?

772
02:12:57,173 --> 02:12:59,973
There's going up to
a big casa (house).

773
02:13:00,223 --> 02:13:02,523
They were trying to get through
with wire cutters...

774
02:13:02,573 --> 02:13:05,073
and 5000 rounds of ammunition.

775
02:13:21,523 --> 02:13:23,223
Well...

776
02:13:24,873 --> 02:13:26,573
That is that.

777
02:13:26,723 --> 02:13:29,823
Now all he is the trickle
from the concentration camps.

778
02:13:32,073 --> 02:13:33,873
And we'll dry that up, gentlemen.

779
02:13:34,623 --> 02:13:36,323
We will dry it up.

780
02:13:55,273 --> 02:14:00,173
<i>(Duce on radio:) In ten years time
all Europe will be fascist.</i>

781
02:14:00,423 --> 02:14:01,923
<i>I'm XXXXXXXXXXXX???</i>

782
02:14:02,873 --> 02:14:09,573
<i>XXXXX??? in the air, in Roman tanks,
in Roman ships, in Roman planes.</i>

783
02:14:09,823 --> 02:14:15,023
<i>The new men of fascism are
writing the pages of tomorrow.</i>

784
02:14:15,273 --> 02:14:20,173
<i>We have conquered a second
Roman empire with our blood.</i>

785
02:14:20,323 --> 02:14:23,723
<i>We will fertilise it with our labor.</i>

786
02:14:23,973 --> 02:14:25,773
<i>We will hold it forever...</i>

787
02:14:25,823 --> 02:14:31,423
<i>with out arms, our XXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX!</i>

788
02:14:43,473 --> 02:14:46,100
- How many bullets have you?
- Twelve.

789
02:14:46,851 --> 02:14:50,730
At this rate, we will be soon down
to fighting them with stones.

790
02:14:52,398 --> 02:14:54,859
How long can we last?

791
02:14:55,318 --> 02:14:57,862
Till doomsday.

792
02:14:58,279 --> 02:15:00,448
Nothing has got through for a month.

793
02:15:00,657 --> 02:15:02,450
We are fighting barbed wire.

794
02:15:05,578 --> 02:15:09,999
The wire will win when
it tears our spirit.

795
02:15:11,668 --> 02:15:13,378
Only then.

796
02:15:14,837 --> 02:15:18,458
Yes, yes, the wire
is hurting us.

797
02:15:18,458 --> 02:15:20,299
It is... It is around our neck.

798
02:15:21,219 --> 02:15:28,307
But it is God, not Graziani and not him
who decides what becomes of us.

799
02:15:30,241 --> 02:15:33,578
What is the will of wire
compared to the will of God?

800
02:15:36,456 --> 02:15:41,691
They have 8 million  bayonets,
we have one that matters.

801
02:15:42,091 --> 02:15:48,400
And we are not alone.
We have many, many friends.

802
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:51,050
And others are
fighting beside us.

803
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:03,200
<i>Duce on Radio:
"We will overrun the earth."</i>

804
02:16:03,650 --> 02:16:09,650
<i>"And then we will
take the flag of fascism..."</i>

805
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:12,600
"to the throne."

806
02:16:26,050 --> 02:16:27,450
Thank you.

807
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:31,200
It's not the cold.

808
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:35,000
It's the dust.

809
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:39,750
You've been fighting a war...
for 22 years.

810
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:42,900
It's the same dust.

811
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:46,950
Why don't you sleep?

812
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:50,200
I've been better sitting up.

813
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:55,050
We must sleep
XXXXXX?????

814
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:08,200
Go! Go!
We will hold them off!

815
02:20:00,262 --> 02:20:02,181
It's suicide sir.

816
02:20:02,182 --> 02:20:05,274
They tied their legs
so they cannot run.

817
02:22:15,474 --> 02:22:17,351
No!

818
02:22:17,902 --> 02:22:19,353
No!

819
02:22:22,330 --> 02:22:26,100
Don't beg boy.
Don't beg!

820
02:22:39,981 --> 02:22:41,613
You're taken in arms.

821
02:22:46,409 --> 02:22:47,787
You...
Shoot him!

822
02:22:48,775 --> 02:22:50,637
There are more in there.
Follow them up.

823
02:22:53,703 --> 02:22:54,951
Go on.

824
02:22:55,576 --> 02:22:57,240
You took him. Shoot him.

825
02:23:04,136 --> 02:23:06,931
You idiot.
I said... shoot him.

826
02:24:28,735 --> 02:24:30,445
Where is he?

827
02:24:40,258 --> 02:24:41,593
Well?

828
02:24:43,177 --> 02:24:45,305
Yes.

829
02:24:45,939 --> 02:24:48,016
I confirm the identification.

830
02:24:49,584 --> 02:24:50,843
He's Omar Mukhtar.

831
02:24:55,472 --> 02:24:59,058
I'm distressed
to see him like this.

832
02:24:58,517 --> 02:25:00,436
How can you say that?

833
02:25:00,686 --> 02:25:04,315
He has lead the rebellion
against us for 20 years.

834
02:25:03,857 --> 02:25:06,900
As a gallant enemy,
Omar Mukhtar should be

835
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,900
treated by us with dignity
and with respect.

836
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:14,632
With respect?

837
02:25:14,533 --> 02:25:18,438
He should have been
whipped all the way here.

838
02:25:19,757 --> 02:25:22,176
You forget yourself sir.

839
02:25:35,155 --> 02:25:37,449
Sir?

840
02:25:39,117 --> 02:25:42,495
Is there anything I can do for you?

841
02:25:43,706 --> 02:25:50,650
If you will allow me a little water,
I could make myself ready for prayers.

842
02:25:50,795 --> 02:25:51,880
Of course.

843
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:55,000
And... the chains while I pray?

844
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,750
Out of the question!

845
02:25:56,885 --> 02:25:59,120
He only wants to pray.

846
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:03,805
I am too old to climb walls or...
to fight bare-handed.

847
02:26:04,267 --> 02:26:06,450
Remove his chains for an hour.

848
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:08,950
On your own personal
responsibility, sir?

849
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:10,940
Yes.

850
02:26:16,237 --> 02:26:17,489
Bring the water.

851
02:26:24,211 --> 02:26:25,796
Thank You.

852
02:26:26,314 --> 02:26:30,276
No.

853
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:31,944
No need.

854
02:27:33,021 --> 02:27:34,979
Omar Mukhtar...

855
02:30:00,082 --> 02:30:02,251
I have come a long way to meet you.

856
02:30:04,753 --> 02:30:07,256
Now, you must wait.

857
02:30:44,918 --> 02:30:48,213
I want to ask you one question.

858
02:30:48,881 --> 02:30:51,383
Why did you keep going this alone?

859
02:30:51,947 --> 02:30:56,550
I am sure you didn't hope to drive us
out of Lybia with so little, did you?

860
02:30:57,681 --> 02:30:59,558
We fought you.

861
02:31:01,268 --> 02:31:02,645
That was enough.

862
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:04,839
But you care nothing about
the ruination of your country?

863
02:31:05,173 --> 02:31:08,426
You are the ruination of my country.

864
02:31:08,635 --> 02:31:11,805
What would you do if
someone occupied your land?

865
02:31:13,572 --> 02:31:17,830
Did you ever think how
your attacks seemed to us...

866
02:31:18,243 --> 02:31:22,331
Ambush, murder by night,
deception by day, ...

867
02:31:23,248 --> 02:31:26,426
threats against the farmers.
- Farming our land.

868
02:31:26,426 --> 02:31:28,601
Libya is not your country,
you have no right in it.

869
02:31:28,602 --> 02:31:33,234
Not to the pasture of one cow,
not one minute the right.

870
02:31:34,176 --> 02:31:37,513
Italy has as much right in here
as anybody else.

871
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:41,892
England has a right to Egypt
France to Tunisia, Algeria.

872
02:31:42,518 --> 02:31:44,895
Spain to Morocco.

873
02:31:45,213 --> 02:31:47,785
But none of them
have our pedigree.

874
02:31:47,785 --> 02:31:50,495
We have hundreds
of years of right here.

875
02:31:51,902 --> 02:31:54,299
So, you will take
everything from me...

876
02:31:54,349 --> 02:31:58,149
and you want me to
justify your tax?

877
02:31:58,242 --> 02:32:02,037
No nation has the right
to occupy another.

878
02:32:11,672 --> 02:32:16,843
We are back here, that's all.
No one can deny us.

879
02:32:29,147 --> 02:32:32,651
Read the date on this coin.

880
02:32:35,237 --> 02:32:38,865
It's a coin of the Cesars,
dated, minted in Libya.

881
02:32:39,408 --> 02:32:43,620
You will also find Greek,
Turkish, Venecian coins.

882
02:32:44,204 --> 02:32:46,832
All over Libya
you will find them,

883
02:32:46,608 --> 02:32:47,950
buried in our sand.

884
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,994
Yes, I had forgotten.

885
02:32:51,020 --> 02:32:54,000
You are short sighted,
aren't you?

886
02:32:58,010 --> 02:33:01,471
Your spectacles, I believe.

887
02:33:01,572 --> 02:33:03,701
The day they brought them
to me, I knew...

888
02:33:03,751 --> 02:33:05,451
you wouldn't be
too far behind.

889
02:33:05,643 --> 02:33:10,823
My spectacles... we're
both your prisoners.

890
02:33:11,282 --> 02:33:16,629
I will not be trivial.
Take them back. Here...

891
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:36,950
Yes, it does have
an interesting past

892
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,778
but don't try to buy
too much with it today.

893
02:33:41,511 --> 02:33:47,142
The money, like your
glory, is not permanent.

894
02:33:48,602 --> 02:33:52,814
But I respect your past
and you must respect ours.

895
02:33:53,398 --> 02:33:58,904
We too have a history and science,
mathematics and medicine.

896
02:33:59,946 --> 02:34:03,825
In your dark ages,
we lead the world to learn.

897
02:34:06,828 --> 02:34:11,375
How many days will it take you
to arrange the surrender of your men?

898
02:34:12,876 --> 02:34:15,545
We will never surrender.

899
02:34:17,214 --> 02:34:20,342
We win or we die.

900
02:34:20,717 --> 02:34:23,303
And don't think it stops there.

901
02:34:23,804 --> 02:34:26,156
We will have the next
generation to fight,

902
02:34:26,157 --> 02:34:28,016
and after the
next, the next.

903
02:34:29,184 --> 02:34:35,107
As for me, I will live longer
than my hang-man.

904
02:34:35,774 --> 02:34:39,486
What makes you think I'm
going to hang you?

905
02:34:41,947 --> 02:34:45,492
I mean it might suit my papers
better to pension you.

906
02:34:45,750 --> 02:34:49,503
If I hang you, I run the risk of
beating an open grave.

907
02:34:50,414 --> 02:34:52,499
But, on the other hand,
you are an prime example.

908
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:58,547
You can only do to me
what God decides for me.

909
02:34:59,715 --> 02:35:02,676
Those chains are uncomfortable?

910
02:35:03,677 --> 02:35:07,514
There are uncomfortable effects.

911
02:35:07,889 --> 02:35:10,434
Sit down.

912
02:35:12,185 --> 02:35:14,146
Thank You.

913
02:35:19,497 --> 02:35:21,366
Do you know...

914
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:30,567
I had always hoped that you and
I... implacable enemies, might

915
02:35:30,587 --> 02:35:34,000
sit down on the day of your
capture and discuss like Cesar ...

916
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:35,665
General...

917
02:35:35,667 --> 02:35:40,079
Omar Mukthar cannot
give you the conquest of Cesar.

918
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:42,799
I wanted you for so long.

919
02:35:44,509 --> 02:35:48,200
I mean knowing each
other as we do... an idea...

920
02:35:49,320 --> 02:35:51,896
Can't we work
together for peace?

921
02:35:54,561 --> 02:35:59,316
And today is the day
I work for you?

922
02:36:00,066 --> 02:36:01,860
Why don't you ask me
for your life?

923
02:36:03,153 --> 02:36:07,908
I might give it to you,
like that.

924
02:36:09,075 --> 02:36:12,000
Do I give you...

925
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:15,165
my coloboration?

926
02:36:16,833 --> 02:36:19,044
No.

927
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:22,380
No!

928
02:36:25,884 --> 02:36:29,388
You are too late for bargains,
Mukhtar!

929
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:31,598
You are far too late!

930
02:36:31,681 --> 02:36:34,476
I have not asked you for my life.

931
02:36:34,851 --> 02:36:36,637
Do not tell the world...

932
02:36:36,638 --> 02:36:40,941
in the privacy of this room
I asked you for my life.

933
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,488
No, I will not do that.

934
02:36:47,322 --> 02:36:48,990
I will not lie about you.

935
02:36:51,618 --> 02:36:54,454
You are a man of courage.

936
02:36:58,959 --> 02:37:01,962
Let us hope that you can keep
that courage tomorrow.

937
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:13,390
Rope of your justice is always
hanging in front of me, General.

938
02:37:22,148 --> 02:37:28,238
Have him a photograph.
I wish my  enemies to be recorded.

939
02:37:32,117 --> 02:37:34,323
Instruct the President
of the Court that he

940
02:37:34,324 --> 02:37:36,800
must be hanged in
front of his people.

941
02:37:37,873 --> 02:37:40,292
They must be there.

942
02:38:01,700 --> 02:38:05,309
Omar Mukhtar, you are accused

943
02:38:06,651 --> 02:38:12,991
of open rebellion against the
lawful Government of your country.

944
02:38:24,103 --> 02:38:26,063
What age are you?

945
02:38:28,415 --> 02:38:30,835
73.

946
02:38:32,002 --> 02:38:35,840
Are you the head of the forces
in Libya fighting against Italy?

947
02:38:38,926 --> 02:38:40,594
Yes, I am.

948
02:38:44,265 --> 02:38:47,810
Have you taken part in
attacks on Italian Soldiers?

949
02:38:49,186 --> 02:38:51,397
Yes, I have.

950
02:38:52,314 --> 02:38:56,610
For how long have you taken
part in attacks on Italian Soldiers?

951
02:38:59,155 --> 02:39:01,073
20 years.

952
02:39:01,740 --> 02:39:04,076
How many attacks?

953
02:39:05,995 --> 02:39:11,000
You know, ... I couldn't
remember  the number.

954
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:16,172
You ordered the torturing and
murdering of Italian Prisoners.

955
02:39:16,300 --> 02:39:18,174
I did not.

956
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:20,092
Never.

957
02:39:20,092 --> 02:39:22,887
You were captured with
arms in your hands!

958
02:39:23,596 --> 02:39:26,056
Yes, I was.

959
02:39:48,329 --> 02:39:51,165
The enemy of Italian soldiers.

960
02:39:51,999 --> 02:39:55,169
In the field,
I would be his enemy.

961
02:39:56,670 --> 02:39:58,524
But here...

962
02:39:59,104 --> 02:40:00,496
I am obliged to.

963
02:40:02,635 --> 02:40:04,720
I am appointed to defend him.

964
02:40:08,307 --> 02:40:10,434
You are an old man.

965
02:40:12,811 --> 02:40:16,023
Older than all of us here.

966
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:20,361
And I will not abuse you
with too many questions.

967
02:40:21,987 --> 02:40:25,616
Did you ever submit
to the Italian authority?

968
02:40:25,950 --> 02:40:28,452
I did not.

969
02:40:29,286 --> 02:40:36,256
Did you ever receive money or other
subsidy from the Italian government...

970
02:40:36,268 --> 02:40:40,940
as a condition of good behaviour?

971
02:40:41,048 --> 02:40:43,384
I did not.

972
02:40:44,385 --> 02:40:45,719
Never.

973
02:40:46,428 --> 02:40:47,721
I declare...

974
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:53,269
that Omar Mukhtar
never submitted to us, ...

975
02:40:53,644 --> 02:40:56,397
never took subsidy from us, ...

976
02:40:56,563 --> 02:41:01,402
never recognized our right
to rule in this colony.

977
02:41:01,986 --> 02:41:03,887
He cannot therefore,

978
02:41:03,889 --> 02:41:08,450
illogic or justice,
be tried by us as a rebel.

979
02:41:09,118 --> 02:41:15,749
When we captured Omar Mukhtar
after 20 years of battles...

980
02:41:16,166 --> 02:41:22,000
we are morally obliged to deal with
him as a prisoner of war.

981
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:33,400
Silence!

982
02:41:33,990 --> 02:41:36,854
Silence in court!

983
02:41:43,027 --> 02:41:46,609
Captain Lontano, you
were ordered to

984
02:41:46,610 --> 02:41:51,452
defend this rebel against
the charge of treason.

985
02:41:52,619 --> 02:41:58,334
You have over-stepped your orders.

986
02:42:06,258 --> 02:42:09,303
The sentence on you, Omar Mukhtar,

987
02:42:10,346 --> 02:42:14,600
is death by hanging, in public...

988
02:42:14,650 --> 02:42:19,188
in the town of Sadook
at 11 o'clock tomorrow, ...

989
02:42:19,188 --> 02:42:23,317
16th of September, 1931, ...

990
02:42:25,027 --> 02:42:31,033
year 9 of the fascist era.

991
02:42:31,867 --> 02:42:37,122
From God we come and
under God we shall return.

992
02:44:15,280 --> 02:44:19,034
In the name of the Government of
the Italian Selanaica,

993
02:44:19,617 --> 02:44:25,582
we execute this sentence as decreed
by the military tribunal of Benghazi

994
02:44:25,790 --> 02:44:30,295
of the 15th day of September 1931,
year 9 of the fascist era.

995
02:44:31,046 --> 02:44:34,265
Omar Mukhtar, you
have been found

996
02:44:34,266 --> 02:44:39,830
guilty of high treason,
both morally and materially,

997
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:42,258
of a sustained
rebellion against

998
02:44:42,259 --> 02:44:45,286
the Italian Government
of this Colony.

999
02:44:45,287 --> 02:44:48,743
The sentence passed
by the Court, death by

1000
02:44:48,744 --> 02:44:53,151
hanging in a public place,
will now be carried out.

1001
02:47:24,172 --> 02:47:30,303
Thank you, god, for letting me
tie the hands of our enemies.

1002
02:48:36,662 --> 02:48:38,414
Untie him.

1003
02:50:05,292 --> 02:50:07,350
We will never surrender.

1004
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:09,379
We win or we die.

1005
02:50:10,422 --> 02:50:12,629
We will have the next
generation to fight,

1006
02:50:12,630 --> 02:50:14,426
and after the next,
the next.

1007
02:50:15,135 --> 02:50:19,556
As for me, I will live longer
than my hang-man.
