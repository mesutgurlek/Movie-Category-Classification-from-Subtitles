1
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,082
[military march]

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,607
I have a nice load of ladies
for you this morning.

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,048
Them city dick turd packing hookey
motherfuckers have drafted...

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,681
my main man away.
They'll send you off to kill Chinks.

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,481
Who's gonna take care of
the vineyards for me on the street?

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,483
Look son, I don't care
what you mother says.

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,406
You're doing the right thing by joining up
now. Get the service out of the way.

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,805
You're fighting a real war over there,
boy. It's not like your make up stories.

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,489
You're always bragging about
how you ran off and joined up.

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,085
It's good enough for you.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,450
- Vinnie...
- Come on, Jill.

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,602
Vinnie, I've got work to do.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,566
You've got work to do?
What am I, going to a picnic?

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,330
Hey, where you going?

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,409
Excuse me, Inspector. You think
J. Edgar Hoover would fire you?

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,090
Well, the cuffs have got to stay on.

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,927
Bets, about last night, I...

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,081
Well, I just...
I want you to know...

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,481
Don't worry, Billy.
I wanted to.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,769
It'll make me feel closer
while you're away.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,602
Well, take care of your ass, nigger.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,646
Take care.

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,963
You take care of yourself, you hear.

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,163
You relax, just relax.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,489
I'll get out of this.
I'll kiss the sergeant or something.

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,609
Hey, peace, man.
Make love, not war, man.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,005
[ALVIN]: August 27, 1967.
We took the oath this morning.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,769
Tyrone Washington, Chicago, Illinois.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,162
Billy Ray Pike, Galveston, Texas.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,484
Me, Alvin Foster, Emporia, Kansas.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,770
Vinnie Fazio, Brooklyn, New York.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,926
Dave Bisbee, Seattle, Washington.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,124
And a bunch of other guys
from all over the country.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,690
I decided to keep a journal...

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,730
and write about our experiences
in the Marine Corps.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,121
Maybe I can get it
published some day.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,925
That is if anybody even wants
to read about what happens...

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,721
to a bunch of guys
they're gonna send to Vietnam.

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,851
- Hey, look at them guys march.
- What?

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,682
Hey, you think we're gonna get
machine guns?

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,606
I don't know. What do I look like,
an information booth over here?

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,444
- Just guys are marching.
- Hey, my name's Alvin.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,761
Hey, Alvin, I'm Vinnie.
Vinnie Fazio.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,330
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to know you.

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,765
- Hey?
- What?

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,600
- You ever shot a machine gun?
- Have I ever shot a machine gun?

47
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,886
- Yeah.
- I'm from Brooklyn.

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,440
- We play ball on the streets, you know.
- You play baseball?

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,169
Yeah.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,208
All right, you people, listen up.

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,922
You are now at the US Marine Corps
recruit depot San Diego, California.

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,521
When you left home, you were under
your mother's care, you are now...

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,922
under mine. From now on, you will not
eat, sleep, blow your nose...

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,810
or scratch your ass
until someone tells you to do so.

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,123
I am going to give you approximately
30 seconds to fall out of this bus...

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,921
and god help the last man off because
you better give your soul to god...

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,810
because your ass is mine.
Do you understand?

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,167
- Yes!
- I can't hear you.

59
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,207
Yes!

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,085
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
I still can't hear you.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,288
- Yes, sir!
- Move!

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,445
Move. Get out. Get out.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,761
You get out of the bus right now.

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,690
[continuous shouts and yelling]

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,004
God dammit!

66
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,166
What the fuck has the goddamn
recruiters given me now?

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,730
Holy shit!

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,088
I've never seen a bunch fucking
walking garbage heap in my life.

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,051
You look like a bunch of sorry
son of a bitches if I ever saw them!

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,204
Mister, you got something
tickling up your ass?

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,766
What the fuck are you
bouncing up and down at rest for?

72
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,287
What are you looking at, Hollywood?
Straight eyes.

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,769
I don't owe you no money.

74
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,247
Man, we got
Jesus Christ with us today.

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,085
What are you looking at? You
should be looking at your father...

76
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,322
God, not me.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,882
Do you find something funny?
Get on fucking knees...

78
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,928
and you be his disciple.

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,011
You freaking...
You find again something funny, huh?

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,891
Listen, man...

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,088
- Listen, man?
- I don't want any hassles.

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,844
I mean, I like you. I like you.

83
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,049
I ain't gonna give you no hassle,
I like you too.

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,327
- Okay.
- Maybe you love me?

85
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,011
- Yeah, I love you. I love everybody.
- Very good.

86
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,289
I love you, too.
Maybe one day we'll get married.

87
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,404
If you don't get your shit together,
you ain't even have to worry...

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,369
about getting engaged!

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,924
Okay?
What?!

90
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,884
- All right, sir!
- Thank you very much!

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,083
You find something funny?

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,447
- Did you eat shit this morning?
- No, sir.

93
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,490
Then why the fucking shit eating grin?
What do you mean?

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,609
Don't even start to explain yourself.
You're a bad fucking excuse.

95
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,969
Get up on your goddamn feet,
you shit head!

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,365
Come on, snap to!

97
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,364
Hollywood, what are you looking at?

98
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,723
Take off those goddamn glasses
before I yank them off you.

99
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,561
Hey, god dammit.
You, with the fucking pretty face.

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,324
What are you spitting
on the ground for?

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,562
- What is that shit in your mouth?
- Chewing tobacco, sir.

102
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,563
- it's what?!
- Chewing tobacco, sir!

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,849
What the hell are you doing,
chewing tobacco in your mouth?

104
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,162
I don't know sir.
I chew when I play baseball.

105
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,971
Do you think this looks like
a baseball stadium?

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,724
- No sir, it doesn't.
- Then what the hell...

107
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,565
are you chewing tobacco for?
You got on the wrong fucking train?

108
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,530
- Or did they draft you?
- No, sir. I enlisted, sir.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,604
- You did what?!
- I enlisted in the marines, sir.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,803
What the hell did you do
a thing like that for?!

111
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,246
- Answer me, god dammit!
- I wanna be a marine, sir.

112
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,924
What the hell for?

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,400
- So I can fight for my country, sir.
- You fucking turd!

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,691
Right now I can't stand
to look at you.

115
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,604
Sergeant, get this shit
out of my fucking face.

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,966
I'm Sgt. Loyce.

117
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,123
I'm your drill instructor for the next
two fucking months, maggots.

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,729
Jesus. How in the hell do they
expect me to train fucking marines...

119
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,089
when they won't even send me
human goddamn beings to start with!

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,209
Sergeant, get these fucking people
through receiving barracks.

121
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,284
I'm gonna help you out. I don't wanna
drop any of their fucking civilian...

122
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,761
slime on the way through. Jesus!

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,721
When you are told to do so,
you will reach down by your right foot...

124
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,640
...pick up your bags, empty the contents
on the table in front of you.

125
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,323
You will empty your pockets and place
the contents of your pockets...

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,805
on the table in front of you.

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,967
Do it, now!

128
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,125
What do you got
in your back pocket?

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,646
- A diary.
- Contraband, get rid of it!

130
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,965
What do you got in your pocket?
All right, Technicolor rubber.

131
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,245
- I bet you're a virgin, aren't you?
- I lost it when I was 13.

132
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,688
- What?
- I lost it when I was 13, sir!

133
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,841
Contraband, get rid of it.

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,884
- What's in the plastic there, private?
- Cookies from my girlfriend, sir.

135
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,281
Bullshit, contraband,
put it on the table.

136
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,085
Oh, what do we have here?
A little faggot, huh?

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,970
Get your jewelry off there,
sweetheart, and put it on the table.

138
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,089
What do you have in your
pocket there, lipstick?

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,281
Jesus.
Put the goddamn thing on the table!

140
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,322
You will answer
the following questions.

141
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,404
Have you ever had any sexual act
with another man?

142
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,211
With an animal?
Do you wet your bed?

143
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,370
Do you like to wear women's clothing?
How often do you masturbate?

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,568
- Where's your belt, private?
- What?

145
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,564
- Where's your belt?
- Well, I don't know. Where's his?

146
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,404
I'm asking you private.
Where's your belt?

147
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,562
I must have left it in my bed.

148
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,291
You get your belt and you better report
back to me when you're through.

149
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,521
- You understand?
- Okay.

150
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,921
- You get your belt too.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,049
Unhook.

152
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,689
Move it out, guys.
Get out there.

153
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,410
Move it out.
Move it out.

154
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,610
Go, go, go, go.

155
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,160
Asshole!
Get up there.

156
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,127
Move it up to the private
in front of you in file.

157
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,283
Platoon 163 here.
First five privates, get on the chair.

158
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,886
Move it up. Hurry!
We don't have all day, private.

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,962
Move it up.
Hold it up there, little man.

160
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,283
[electric clipper buzzing]

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,525
[buzzing stops]

162
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,561
Get out of here.
Move.

163
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,369
Move it up.
We're late.

164
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,801
We don't have all day, ladies.
Anytime, anytime.

165
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,609
Move it up.
Next five. Next five.

166
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,410
Come on up, quickly!

167
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,966
Get in here.
Get in there, Jesus.

168
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,209
I want you to do a special job
on Jesus for me there, huh.

169
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,287
Very nice.
Yeah.

170
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,569
Do Jesus real good there for me.
I want to see Jesus' bald head.

171
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,330
Huh, Jesus? Huh?

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,886
Very cute.

173
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,927
Sexy.

174
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,961
Very nice.

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,921
Cute.

176
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,442
Try to stay in step with the private
in front of you.

177
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,005
Keep your head always up.

178
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,090
Move it up.
Get in there.

179
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,806
Move. Move. Move.

180
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,641
All right, you maggots.
Listen up.

181
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,611
We're gonna say
your Marine Corps prayer.

182
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,251
You will repeat after me.

183
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,328
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,491
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

185
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,566
I will fear no evil...

186
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,601
for I am the biggest, baddest,
meanest motherfucker in the valley.

187
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,049
For I am the biggest, baddest
meanest motherfucker in the valley.

188
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,450
When I tell you to prepare to mount
you will say "Prepare to mount" after me.

189
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,124
You're will say "Aye, aye, sir."

190
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,090
Then you will do it
as I give you the command.

191
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,563
- Prepare to mount.
- Prepare to mount, aye, aye, sir.

192
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,201
Do it.

193
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,086
At attention worms.
At attention.

194
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,044
You will repeat after me.

195
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,881
- Gung ho.
- Gung ho.

196
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,167
- Louder!
- Gung ho!

197
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,647
- Gung ho.
- Gung ho.

198
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,686
- Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.
- Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.

199
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,367
Revelry you at 0430.

200
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,011
You boneheads go to sleep.

201
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,568
Who the fuck is Chesty?

202
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,846
[laughter]

203
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,605
Who's gung ho?

204
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,489
[more laughter]

205
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,925
Hey, what do you think,
we're gonna get to shoot tomorrow?

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,244
Oh, great, they got bizzaro over there,
one of those gung ho types.

207
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,088
Hey, what the hell is that?

208
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,087
It's the only paper
I could find to write on.

209
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,161
Oh, yeah?

210
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,164
Tell me, what are you writing,
a note to your asshole?

211
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,602
- No, it's sort of like a journal, sort of.
- Oh, a journal, huh?

212
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,205
Why don't you write in your notebook
or something like that?

213
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,567
You saw them,
they took my notebook.

214
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,886
They did?

215
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,407
What's that under your pillow then,
Swiss cheese? What?

216
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,563
- Hey, that's it.
- Hey...

217
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,405
This is mine.
This is my notebook.

218
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,891
That's right.

219
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,729
- Hey, how'd you get it?
- I don't reveal my sources.

220
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,849
I didn't register because I figured
if they got you, they got you.

221
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,729
If they don't, they don't.

222
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,165
Well, they got me.

223
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,491
I guess that's my karma
coming out the Marines.

224
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,891
Shoot

225
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,444
I knew the Army could draft you, but
did you know the Marines can draft you?

226
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,208
The guy at the recruiting office told me
that if I can prove myself as a writer...

227
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,681
he could get me assigned
to public information in the Marines.

228
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,568
- Oh, yeah?
- Right.

229
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,729
So I can write about all the stuff
we do around here. And then...

230
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,929
if we get sent to Vietnam
I can get into combat information...

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,604
...write about the war.

232
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,045
- Combat?
- Yeah.

233
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,885
- You wanna get into combat?
- I'm gonna write about it.

234
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,566
What, are you kidding me?
Listen, I'll tell you something.

235
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,325
The only thing I wanna get into is
how I'm gonna get the hell out of here.

236
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,562
And Vinnie Fazio is
gonna get his ass out of here.

237
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,166
- Out of boot camp?
- Yeah, out of boot camp.

238
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,050
- Good luck.
- Good luck?

239
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,765
Hey, listen.

240
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,604
You gotta know the angles.

241
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,682
I've seen a golf range
on the base on the way in.

242
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,001
All the hoi polloi use the golf range.

243
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,050
All you gotta do is move in,
get with the people that can help you.

244
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,724
That's what I'm talking about.

245
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,203
Well, you're gonna have
to do it without me.

246
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,849
I'm not going.
I'm getting out of here.

247
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,888
- I'm not killing anybody.
- Hey...

248
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,803
What's the matter with you,
you chicken?

249
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,120
Shit.

250
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,807
Pussy.

251
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,369
Hey, what are you doing, son?

252
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,606
And what are you doing, son?

253
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,603
You're gonna get warts, boy?

254
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,330
Hey, stop shouting, you jerk!

255
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,164
Jerkin' himself off!

256
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,685
Give me back my blanket.

257
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,091
Shut up!

258
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,007
You listen to me dip shit.
And I ain't gonna repeat myself.

259
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,208
Don't mess with me.

260
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,487
Don't mess near me.

261
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,483
Don't bring no heat down on me.

262
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,641
You're all headed for a fall and
I ain't taking the ride. Do you dig?

263
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,884
You just stay clear of Tyrone.

264
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,570
Because your all a bunch of fuck ups.

265
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,128
And you're all gonna die.

266
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,926
Every last one of you.

267
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,727
You too, dipshit.

268
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,451
Platoon 163.

269
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,601
Sir, Platoon 163.
Aye, aye sir.

270
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,920
Get on the road.

271
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,368
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

272
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,124
Hurry up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

273
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,440
What are you doing on my grass,
private, huh?!

274
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,010
Move, move, move.

275
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,084
You wanna rest on that grass?
Get in line!

276
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,924
Move it down.
Move it down.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,650
Oh, what do we have here?

278
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,370
Nice fucking move sweetheart.

279
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,290
When we come out of the village
we're fully dressed, you understand me?

280
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,686
Do I make myself clear?!

281
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,410
Oh, Christ, my nuts!

282
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,200
- Do you like your nuts?
- Let go, man, what are you doing?!

283
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,930
You don't talk to me like that.

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,650
- Do you like your nuts?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,926
- You want some?
- Shit, yeah.

286
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,889
- Do you wanna keep them?
- Yeah.

287
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,203
All of you son of a bitches,
grab your fucking nuts.

288
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,248
Right now, grab your nuts!

289
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,805
You too, you freak.

290
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,088
All of you guys grab your nuts.

291
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,322
- Grab your fucking nuts.
- Get a hold of them.

292
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,689
- Do you like them?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,922
- Do they feel good to you?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,685
If you fucking guys
wanna keep them son of a bitches...

295
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,206
...you better listen to your
drill instructors.

296
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,725
I'm trying to help you keep them.

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,082
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

298
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,200
Do you think your girlfriends is gonna
love it if you come back without them?

299
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,082
No, sir.

300
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,290
If you come back without your balls
they're gonna find another guy.

301
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,249
Did you understand
what I'm saying to you?

302
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,207
Yes, sir!

303
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,000
I've got eight weeks to train you...

304
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,249
to think, to act, to be one.

305
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,408
I'll have to make you
depend on each other.

306
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,448
I have to make you
a fighting Marines unit.

307
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,969
Look around you.
You like the man next to you?

308
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,206
You think he's a nigger or
that one's a Jew or that one's a spik!

309
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,205
I don't care.

310
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,961
That motherfucker
is gonna save your life one day!

311
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,370
And you better depend on you buddy.
And you're buddy's buddy.

312
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,523
- You understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yes, sir.

313
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,051
Sergeant!

314
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,927
Explain your two tours
to these people...

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,890
and clean this shit off
the fucking street.

316
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,931
I spent 26 months in Vietnam.

317
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,204
And I can tell you
right goddamn now, privates...

318
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,568
if you don't pay attention to what's
happening here in the recruit training...

319
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,567
and learn, you're gonna come back from
Vietnam in a goddamn plastic body bag.

320
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,363
Right now the casualty rate for
young Marines is over 50 percent.

321
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,487
If you don't pay attention, you are
gonna be that private in the body bag.

322
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,531
September 1, 1967.

323
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,569
We can't seem to do anything right.

324
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,043
In fact, half of us don't even know
our right from our left.

325
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,966
Sgt. Loyce says if Uncle Sam
is counting on our platoon...

326
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,283
to win the war for him,
he's betting on the wrong side.

327
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,442
Without my rifle I am useless.

328
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,851
[gunshots]

329
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,881
Undoubtedly, you people have set
some kind of a new record today.

330
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,043
You have fucked over
these weapons so goddamn bad...

331
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,168
they'll probably never fire again!

332
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,287
Let's move.

333
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,528
Oh, come on, baby, pull that out.
Get out of here!

334
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,882
Peace!

335
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,041
Kill, kill, kill!

336
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,841
Come on, Alvin.
Protect yourself, Alvin.

337
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,569
Alvin, get up, get up.

338
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,324
- Come on man, get up now.
- Come on Alvin, get up.

339
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,208
Protect yourself!

340
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,487
Come on Alvin, get up.
Protect yourself.

341
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,321
- Pop it!
- Hey, man!

342
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,448
Why'd you get on my foot, boy?

343
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,201
All right, move it up.
Quickly. Quickly.

344
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,683
Jesus, get your ass back there.
Go over that goddamn bar.

345
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,607
Let see a little goddamn teamwork.
Quickly!

346
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,603
God damn it, you're in combat!

347
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,921
AK-47s are firing over your head.

348
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,765
They'll tear your asshole
the size of a goddamn basketball.

349
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,368
Move it up.
Get over there. Get over there.

350
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,281
- How's my time, sir?
- Good work, but you lost, dummy.

351
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,409
You left the half of your goddamn
platoon behind the enemy lines!

352
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,130
Come on, get moving.
Don't wait.

353
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,804
Don't you wait for him.
Shit!

354
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,042
Faster private!

355
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,045
God damn it, Washington, you just
put two private's on a trip wire.

356
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,482
You just wiped out everybody
in a 50 meter radius, you dummy.

357
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,561
You wiped me out!

358
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,761
Go!

359
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,648
[splash]

360
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,449
God damn it, teamwork.

361
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,249
You're all dead!

362
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,245
Get in the fucking water.
Get in the water.

363
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,288
Get in the fucking water.

364
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,441
You're all dead.

365
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,885
Get over there Washington, quickly.

366
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,405
You're dead!

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,685
The VC just heard you
and you're dead!

368
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,490
And you can thank that man.

369
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,843
Washington, you're instructors
have been telling you for weeks...

370
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,686
...to pull together, pull together.
But he let you get wiped out.

371
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,445
That's all it takes,
one fuck up.

372
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,368
You look like shit.

373
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,521
So I'm going to give you a shit detail
that will help you pull together.

374
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,363
Let's get this goddamn aircraft loaded.
Let's get this aircraft loaded.

375
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,202
Get them moving.

376
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,202
Hey, Billy Ray Pike.

377
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,240
Billy the Vile.

378
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,882
Damn, you ain't Smoke Spaulding,
are you?

379
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,361
In the flesh, bro, in the flesh.

380
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,886
You know, I got me
a nice soft desk job here.

381
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,043
I'm the company clerk. You know,
I thought that was your name I saw...

382
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,521
- on that telegram I got the other day.
- What telegram?

383
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,682
Your D.l.'s got it, man.

384
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,809
Betsy's up at Ocean side,
and the Marines...

385
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,121
- Wait man, Betsy's here?
- What a hole in the wall!

386
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,686
- Full of sailors.
- Shit man. She might need me bad.

387
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,001
Hey man, you gotta...
Can I get to see her?

388
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,849
- Can you give me a pass?
- Hold your horses.

389
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,922
Don't get your balls in an uproar.
Look...

390
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,884
I gotta take some stuff op tomorrow
and I'm gonna a private to help me...

391
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
[gunshots]

392
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,885
Goddamn shit.

393
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,530
Oh, my god!
Christ Almighty!

394
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,130
Shit! God, no!

395
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,051
- Who's in charge here?
- The Lieutenant, sir.

396
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,770
The Lieutenant.
Is that your Lieutenant?

397
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,205
Leave me. Leave me.
Get away.

398
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,608
- Are you all right?
- Alvin...

399
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,808
- What the hell.
- I'm okay, nothing happened.

400
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,731
Damn bastards.
Just trying to make fools of us.

401
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,768
I knew they were just
trying to scare us.

402
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,128
They did a good job on you, Billy Ray.
You almost pissed in your pants.

403
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,201
Bullshit.

404
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,444
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.
What seems to be going on here?

405
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,364
Well, sir, it looks like we just
wiped out your entire platoon here.

406
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,727
We got an airplane
and two trucks beside.

407
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,161
Now, sir, I'm afraid
there has been mistake.

408
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,924
These people die at my command.

409
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,085
Excuse me, you gentlemen are all dead.
Will you please lie down?

410
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,207
I'm their drill instructor.
This a recruit platoon...

411
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,884
Are you all right?

412
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,885
All right? Hey, I knew they were
blanks the whole time.

413
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,884
El Toro called up and they said
they had an emergency shipment...

414
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,327
...that had to go to Vietnam.
I volunteered my privates...

415
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,721
to come up here and now
they are involved in some kind...

416
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,451
- of a silly ass war game.
- Excuse me, sir.

417
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,646
This is not a game.

418
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,726
This is an advance combat tactical
exercise and these men are all dead.

419
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,167
Now, lay down, that's an order!

420
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,368
Come here, Lieutenant.
May I have a word with you?

421
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,442
You're dead. You're dead.
Get down.

422
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,806
Get down!

423
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,209
What is all this stuff anyway?

424
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,490
- HQ111 Marine Air Force, Da Nang.
- RVN. What's RVN?

425
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,170
Republic of Vietnam.

426
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,931
This stuff is going to Vietnam, Alvin.
What is this?

427
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,161
Ouch!

428
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,085
What the hell is this?

429
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,207
I don't know.

430
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,129
Hey, Fazio.

431
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,607
- Foster, what is this stuff?
- We don't know.

432
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,523
I think it's a giant rubber.

433
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,967
Put it over your head,
Pike, you're a big prick.

434
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,320
Shit.

435
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,449
Hey, look here, man.
Looks like an airbag or something.

436
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,124
I don't think so.

437
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,922
Hey, I got it, you sleep in it.

438
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,571
It's a lightweight, sleeping bag.
Look at this!

439
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,683
Hey, look at this.
It's for sleeping, man.

440
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,171
I can sleep all night in this thing.

441
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,080
Hey, Billy...

442
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,330
Billy, if you fall asleep in that,
you won't wake up.

443
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,851
It says it's a body bag.

444
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,963
What's a body bag?

445
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,761
What's a body bag?
That's what they ship the stiffs in.

446
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,604
Damn, the zipper is stuck.

447
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,761
Get me out of here.
Get me out!

448
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,962
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, take it easy.

449
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,121
Hey, Alvin, are you still writing
about that creepy shit?

450
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,885
Listen, I'm gonna show this
to the public information officer.

451
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,804
This is a story
I can really say something about.

452
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,048
I mean, the way they stick somebody
in one of those bags...

453
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,248
...seal it up and send it off?

454
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,171
It's like a neat little convenient
package.

455
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,330
And nobody even thinks
about what's inside.

456
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,720
Yeah?

457
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,962
Nobody ever looks inside.

458
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,843
Alvin, Alvin, look at this.

459
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,969
This is that driving range I was
telling you about. Look at this.

460
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,566
And look, look at the full bird
colonel out there.

461
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,325
And look at the legs
on the chick his playing with.

462
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,210
Well, I'm gonna be that guy's Caddie.
I'm not fooling around here, no more.

463
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,930
- Hey, Vinnie, no, no...
- Hey, hey, listen...

464
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,684
You only got one shot, right?

465
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,366
I mean, it's not like you got forever,
you know what I mean?

466
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,887
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Okay, see you.

467
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,644
Take it easy, man.

468
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,291
Stupid motherfucker.

469
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,402
What else can we do?

470
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,281
You know...

471
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,691
You see...

472
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,888
I heard about, you know,
down in Tijuana...

473
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,125
they got real doctors.
They ain't like it as here.

474
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,850
You're allowed to...

475
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,764
You know. I mean...

476
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,967
- I can get the money.
- I have the money.

477
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,211
It's just ain't the right time now.

478
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,931
It's just not the right time.

479
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,409
You see?

480
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,245
I see.

481
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,048
Baby...

482
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,762
I gotta go.

483
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,288
Please don't leave yet.

484
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,881
Halt. Who goes there?
Hey, you!

485
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,770
- [gunshots.]
- Goddamn! Oh, Goddamn!

486
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,490
Jesus!

487
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,808
You son of a bitch,
you didn't have to shoot me.

488
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,644
Well, you scared
the shit out of me, asshole.

489
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,721
Goddamn!

490
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,164
Sir, here are the agents of Hanoi who
have come to fuck the Marine Corps, sir.

491
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,402
Which one is the Dago, Fazio?

492
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,525
Ain't he the cute one?

493
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,809
It says here, he was trying to get his
end in with the Colonel's daughter...

494
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,450
...out on the driving range.

495
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,409
Let me tell you this, private.

496
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,370
We'll take care of your
overactive sex drive in here.

497
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,125
We got us a Foster, Alvin,
apprehended by public information...

498
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,965
...for disseminating classified
and subversive material.

499
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,883
- No, sir, that was...
- Quiet, Billy Ray.

500
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,404
AWOL and resisting arrest.

501
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,482
Sir, private's wounded, sir.

502
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,565
Quit your whining you candy ass turd!
You ain't got nothing but a scratch!

503
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,325
And you, what are you doing
bleeding all over my floor?

504
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,007
Sir, this prisoner
is by nature a filthy hippie.

505
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,651
He was trying to desert,
but he was so high on marijuana...

506
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,451
that he tripped and fell
into the barbed wire, sir.

507
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,806
That's a lie.

508
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,208
I'm sorry.
That's a lie, sir.

509
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,442
Don't you wanna be
n the Marine Corps, Private?

510
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,601
Don't you want
to fight for your country?

511
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,561
Sir, the war in Vietnam
is a purely, internal, civil war.

512
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,723
- Do you believe that crap?
- Yes, I believe that.

513
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,969
You're all fucking communists.
Sergeant...

514
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,761
Get this faggots out here. See if you
can teach them how to walk around...

515
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,320
without falling down and
hurting themselves all the time.

516
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,007
About face!
Move out!

517
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,120
♫ Don't wanna fight ♫

518
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,690
♫ War is hell so we might as well
Make love tonight ♫

519
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,926
♫ Oh, put down your gun
Let's have some fun by the moonlight. ♫

520
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,561
Hey, there Jethro, what for
they stick us in this outfit?

521
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,089
They got more niggers in this platoon
than the Oakland fucking Raiders.

522
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,245
Sambo, why don't you get some of that
whitewash on your black ass there?

523
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,850
Hey, boy, what you going
inside for there, boy?

524
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,605
I thought the hot sun
don't bother you.

525
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,441
[banging]

526
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,801
Sir, Private Washington requests
permission to speak with...

527
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,848
- the drill instructor, sir.
- Speak.

528
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,367
Sir, Private Washington requesting
permission to enter the duty office, sir.

529
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,841
Enter.

530
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,405
Sit down.

531
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,408
You've met our four new
replacements yet?

532
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,926
Their drill instructors call them
the four fucking stooges.

533
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,287
Replacements?
Man, I ain't no fool.

534
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,329
Those fucks won't last
a week out there.

535
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,722
And anybody who's gotta depend
on them is already dead meat.

536
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,366
I don't believe that.

537
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,286
But I'll tell you what, Washington.
I respect your judge of character.

538
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,045
You think they're anymore fucked ups
in the rest of the shit we got in this...

539
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,531
- goddamn platoon?
- No, shit.

540
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,688
Why don't you just march
the whole fucking platoon right here...

541
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,603
blow their damn brains out right here...

542
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,284
cause you're gonna end up
killing all of us.

543
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,682
I'm not the goddamn one, Washington,
that's killing these people.

544
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,161
It's you, asshole.
You're the one!

545
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,368
- Not me.
- That's bullshit. That's Bullshit.

546
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,771
That's bullshit!

547
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,763
Let me tell you something,
Washington.

548
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,528
I've got one hell of a shitty
goddamn job here.

549
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,809
They send me 60 to 80 buckets
of civilian shit...

550
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,801
and expect me to train them to become
combat-goddamn-ready marines.

551
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,611
I've got to send these people
to Vietnam.

552
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,523
I'm the one that has to send them.

553
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,089
They're gonna come back in bags.

554
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,525
They're gonna come back in
wheelchairs.

555
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,647
They're gonna be maimed.

556
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,809
They're gonna be fucked up people
when they come back.

557
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,367
It's up to me how they come back.

558
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,126
And you, asshole,
Washington, you're not motivated.

559
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,125
You're not motivated at all.
You can fucking help me.

560
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,081
But no, hell no.

561
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,925
You've got your goddamn
head up your ass all the time.

562
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,924
You're playing your own
silly ass goddamn game.

563
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,050
But I tell you one thing, hippie,
you're gonna start playing my game...

564
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,323
or you're gonna find yourself
in combat in Vietnam...

565
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,448
and you're gonna have Charlie
shooting at you from the front...

566
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,205
and the four Stooges are gonna be
shooting at you from the rear.

567
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,011
Sir, are you talking to me
man to man?

568
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,810
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
man to man.

569
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,611
Then will you remove your hat, sir
so I could face you eye to eye.

570
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,047
I don't mind at all, Washington,
if it's gonna help you out.

571
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,690
Okay, sir, what do you want me
to do, huh?

572
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,240
I mean, what the fuck
do you want me to do, man?

573
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,163
You want me to...
You want me to be a good nigger...

574
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,369
so you can march those boys
out of the brig, is that it?

575
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,690
No, Washington, I don't want...
Goddamn, I don't want a good nigger!

576
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,083
I want a goddamn man
that's out there pushing these people.

577
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,721
Somebody they can trust, somebody
that they know is trying to help them.

578
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,282
I want somebody
that they can count on in Vietnam.

579
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,124
I don't want them to be afraid
to fall down...

580
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,407
because they know somebody's
behind them to pick them up

581
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,721
and stand them back up
on their goddamn feet.

582
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,003
I got eight fucking weeks
to teach these goddamn people...

583
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,048
what it took you to 20 years
to learn on the streets.

584
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,090
Now, you show me
that kind of a goddamn nigger...

585
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,528
and I'll give you a platoon
that will stand by you.

586
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,803
A platoon that will save your ass
in combat, Washington.

587
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,723
And they will
save their own asses, too.

588
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,167
Teamwork, goddamn it.
Teamwork.

589
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,765
Yes, sir.

590
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,565
Sir...

591
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,484
Can you get them back?

592
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,645
Yeah, I can get them back. But I'll you
one fucking thing right now, hippie.

593
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,571
You start this lone wolf shit
again on me...

594
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,769
and I'll stick you with a maggoty ass
bunch of goddamn shit...

595
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,684
you've ever seen in your life.
You are bound to get fucking killed...

596
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,445
in the first week in Vietnam.

597
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,171
Get them back.

598
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,722
- I got your goddamn word?
- You got my goddamn word.

599
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,290
All right.

600
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,323
Go out there and get rid of that...

601
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,803
Those four fucking scumbags.
Send them beck where the fuck they came from...

602
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,803
and I'll go down to the brig
and I'll pull some strings...

603
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,486
- and I'll get our people back.
- Thank you. Sir.

604
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,922
You don't have to thank me.

605
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,725
Oh, shit.

606
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,561
Hey, boys, here comes our
pickaninny friend again.

607
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,325
What's the matter boy, they quit
giving away fried chicken in there?

608
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,006
Excuse me sir, but do you mind moving
your asshole downwind of me?

609
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,208
- You said what?
- Oh, I'm sorry, that's your mouth.

610
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,851
I didn't see the teeth. Hey man,
anybody could have made a mistake.

611
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,605

January 4, 1968.

743
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,969
Vinnie finally got his boat ride.

744
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,122
And I finally have some time
to catch up with my journal...

745
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,000
after three tough months of advanced
training. The Marine Corp...

746
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,004
prepared us for everything except
our new company commander.

747
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,163
It's easy to see what's in your minds
as we steam for far-off angry shores.

748
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,961
So I'd like to share with you some
figures that have come my way. Gunny?

749
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,369
From 1961 until this past summer 1967,
only 13,000 Americans...

750
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,762
have died in combat in Vietnam.
You, you step forward.

751
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,928
That means...

752
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,364
of the 110 men in C company,
the chances are only two...

753
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,490
will die. I find that pretty
reassuring. Thank you, men.

754
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,563
I have a theory as to why we aren't
doing as well as we might in Vietnam.

755
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,850
Our thinking is shaped
by the games we grow up with.

756
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,447
The VC don't play by our rules. They
grew up with a game that demands...

757
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,966
constant movement
and fluid shifting strategy.

758
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,522
Now while you're on the ship,
you will all learn to play their game.

759
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,001
And, gentlemen,
their game is soccer.

and kick it into the goal...

Lt. Archer, sir?

766
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,086
Sir, some of the men were talking
about Captain Collins' theory.

767
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,130
And I was curious about
what you think of it.

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,448
Well, Foster...

769

771
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,761
Maybe Lt. Archer is right
about the Captain 's theory...

772
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,003
on how soccer can help us beat the
enemy. But at least, playing soccer...

773
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,560
keeps us from thinking about
the Captain's other theory...

774
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,361
and wondering if he's right that only
two guys in the company will die.

775
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,046
Anyways, he's get me
keeping stats on the team...

776
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,566
but I'm using the time to write
in this journal. Vinnie says...

777
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,486
if I play my cards right, this journal
could prove my writing ability...

778
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,484
and get me a desk job, behind
the lines, writing propaganda.

779
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,167
But what I wanna do, is get in to
combat and write about the real thing.

Hold your fire!

914
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,762
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, please. Over.

915
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,330
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, please. Over.

916
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,880
The boys have been hit hard.
Better call the MEDEVAC in.

917
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,566
No time for a goddamn MEDEVAC.
We're getting the shit blown out of us.

918
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,768
If I don't get some air cover,
we will be blasted.

919
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,007
[machine gun fire]

920
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,207
You son of a bitch!

921
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,486
Asshole!

922
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,606
You... you motherfucking goop!

923
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,084
Delta 5, this Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, over.

924
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,449
- Where's my RTO?
- He got hit, skipper.

925
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,091
I don't believe this.
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.

926
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,968
Come in, over!

927
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,404
He's gone.

928
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,963
Must have had a tunnel.

929
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,043
Lieutenant, you're sure
he's not still there?

930
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,646
What the hell do you mean,
are you sure he's not still there, man?

931
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,803
You come bursting across the damn
field with that big ass gun.

932
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,882
We had him trapped,
we had him cornered.

933
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,088
We were gonna maim
that motherfucker.

934
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,408
One MEDEVAC is not is
not enough, goddamn it!

935
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,041
We're bleeding, we need more! Why
can't I get what I want around here?!

936
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,202
Jesus christ!

937
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,851
Captain!

938
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,646
- You got your two dead men.
- Easy, private.

939
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,326
Private, I don't have to take that shit
from you. Now listen to me!

940
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,564
It could not be helped. This is a war and
people die! Now we got a job to do.

941
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,526
We are taking a convoy to Long Khe
and it's vital and it's urgent.

942
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,009
This convoy will save hundreds of men
and two lives are a small price to pay!

943
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,485
- Easy, baby.
- Bullshit!

944
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,608
- Bullshit?!
- Bullshit, Captain!

945
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,131
At ease!

946
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,721
Is that your fucking vital supply, sir?

947
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,486
How many lives is this gonna save?

948
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,840
You son a bitch!

949
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,805
We're dying out here...

950
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,528
so that some shit bird general
can have his fucking pork steak!

951
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,962
Come on. Take it easy.

952
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,490
We must be having
a vital and urgent sale...

953
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,086
a vital and urgent sale
at the PX, huh, Captain?!

954
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,842
Out, out! Get it all out.

955
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,926
Happy birthday, Gen. Dearborne.

956
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,208
Here is your new
mobile whorehouse.

957
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,448
Compliments of Charlie Company!

958
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,801
Was it worth all this, Captain?
Was it worth it?

959
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,802
I didn't know.

960
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,848
Is it the Captain's job
to kill his own men?!

961
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,571
- Son of a bitch!
- The Major told me it was urgent.

962
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,929
- I didn't know! Son of a bitch!
- Come on. We gotta call in...

963
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,449
I didn't know! God damn it.
What the fuck? I did not know!

964
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,371
I never saw a dead body before.

965
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,051
They look real small.

966
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,209
You've never seen a stiff, huh?

967
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,887
- Did you?
- Yeah.

968
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,209
Well, not in real life, you know.
Just... on TV.

969
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,771
It's not the same.

970
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,647
January 11, 1968.

971
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,769
Our vital Army convoy finally got
through to the U.S. Army Base...

972
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,730
at Long Khe.
General Dearborne commanding.

973
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,769
The Captain says that since
we've shown the general...

974
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,731
what e few good marines can do,
he's given us 24 hours liberty.

975
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,923
T24 hours to eat,
drink, smoke and screw.

976
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,890
After what we've been through,
I don't know if we've got the energy.

977
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,683
But I know we left two guys back there
who'd have wished they had a chance.

978
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,962
Hey, do you want to buy
some ears, man?

979
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,566
I'm just glad I'll never be able to see
the sorry looking bunch...

980
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,847
of Army fuck-ups
that they died for.

981
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,003
Look at this!
Esther Williams Swimming Pool...

982
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,321
Beauty Parlor and Bowling.

983
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,925
That figures.

984
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,481
Hey, Albert. Albert!
The Nikon's here.

985
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,483
Trade in that toy now
and get a real camera.

986
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,527
I think I'm gonna.

987
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,365
Madame Cocos Steam Bath,
Massage and Health Club!

988
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,408
- Where?
- Follow the arrows.

989
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,087
- That's nothing. Look at here.
- Prime Cut Steak House...

990
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,290
home of Armed Force Television,
Channel 4, movie theater, snack bar.

991
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,091
Hey, man, now that ain't gonna be se
bad. Everything you ever wanted...

992
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,209
in a whole fucking world
is right here, on this base.

993
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,726
Hey man, I wonder where
the Base Hospital is?

994
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,211
Let's get out of here.

995
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,089
- Yo, Vinnie!
- What?

996
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,810
- Where is the Base Hospital?
- Hospital?

997
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,848
- Hospital?
- You take care of my shit.

998
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,730
I'm gonna go out here
and check out this new turf.

999
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,122
Oh, look at this, more stuff.

1000
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,289
Now what am I, a closet?

1001
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,201
Oh, don't do anything.
Just stand there, Alvin.

1002
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,441
That's right.

1003
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,761
Okay, you're ready to go out there
and show them what's what?

1004
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,604
- Alight!
- I thought you're gonna sleep though.

1005
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,411
I can't sleep, you know. I've been
sitting so long I get all cramped up.

1006
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,051
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1007
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,885
All right, let's go. Let's have action.

1008
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,447
You should have joined the Army,
Bisbee.

1009
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,329
I didn't join, sir.

1010
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,323
I told you already, I can't refill
that prescription. It's a narcotic.

1011
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,006
Come on, it's just some little pills
they gave me back in boot camp.

1012
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,924
Look, Private, I'm off duty.
Sick call's in the morning.

1013
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,082
Hey, you got to give me something.

1014
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,731
Wait a minute, goddamn it.

[whistling]

1016
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,522
Come here, man. I'm not gonna talk to
you out on the street. Come on.

1017
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,323
I want you to do
some of this stuff, man.

1018
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,687
I mean, this is gonna
set you right partner, no lie.

1019
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,208
Oh, man, are you crazy? I ain't gonna
shoot none of that shit in my veins.

1020
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,927
Oh, I don't blame you, man.
I mean, I hate needles myself.

1021
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,331
You just...

1022
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,240
Now, I don't do drugs.
I don't want to get hooked on dope.

1023
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,685
I just... I've been taking
some little pills that's all.

1024
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,650
They gave them to me in boot camp
for pain. Demerol.

1025
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,960
Demerol?

1026
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,248
And what you think Demerol is?
Some guy in a lab...

1027
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,443
he cooks this stuff up into little pills,
he sticks it in a bottle...

1028
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,649
- it's the same as this.
- Yeah, like hell it is.

1029
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,321
Well, there's just one way
to find out, huh, sport?

1030
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,450
I need enough to circulate
in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles.

1031
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,761
Everybody's out, everything is dry.

1032
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,366
I'm here to represent
all the dryness there.

1033
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,125
I need to meet the big man, here.
Beaucoup.

1034
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,965
I'm taking about the big money,
dollars...

1035
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,449
Motherfucker, do you
understand English?

1036
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,688
Don't poke sticks!

1037
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,401
OK, huh?!

Guns are different.

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,564
I am Col. Long Dong...

1041
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,326
district chief and commandant
of the National Police Field Force.

1042
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,721
- I suspect you know why you're here.
- Look, man.

1043
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,246
I only went into that dump
to have myself a drink.

1044
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,561
I took the wrong turn
when I was looking for...

1045
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,406
Corporal, you're conspiring
to traffic heroin, don't deny it.

1046
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,767
I wonder of you were aware
of the Vietcong bringing heroin...

1047
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,844
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail and
that the profits support guerilla forces!

1048
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,126
- I had no idea...
- Doesn't it bother you...

1049
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,487
to harm your own troops?
Does it bother you...

1050
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,881
to put money in the pockets
of your enemies?

1051

No?

1052
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,441
Good.

1053
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,045
Doesn't bother me either.

1054
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,687
Men of conscience have
no place in our business.

1055
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,208
I understand you'll be stationed
in I Corps.

1056
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,882
My brother-in-law, Col. Trang,
is District Chief there.

If we are to do business,
he will visit you.

1058

What's the big "if"?

1059
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,730
You understand that everything
you ship back to your country...

1060
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,486
- is searched thoroughly?
- There's one thing that isn't.

What is that?

00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,967
The body bags.

1063
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,520
Oh...

1064
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,364
Oh, Alvin...

1065
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,289
Look at the tits on number 40.

1066
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,451
Give her a 10.

1067
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,568
All right, a 10?

1068
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,080
- Nine and three quarters.
- Nine and three quarters.

1069
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,522
While you're at it, write something down
and we'll get you the hell out of here.

1070
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,648
I don't want to get out of here, Dave.

1071
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,526
[sighs]

1072
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,489
Al, it's true.

1073
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,010
Half of your fucking problem
is no fucking!

1074
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,087
Come on!

1075
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,208
Hey, listen now, once you find out
that your pecker is good...

1076
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,170
for more than goosing with, you won't
be so quick to want to get it shot off.

1077
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,401
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.

1078
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,761
♫ Happy birthday to you... ♫

1079
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,520
♫ Happy birthday to you... ♫

1080
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,969
♫ Happy birthday, General Dearborn,
Happy birthday, fuck you. ♫

1081
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,364
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1082
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,410
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

1083
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,290
I got some money for everybody.
Hang on, baby.

1084
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,445
There you go.

1085
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,525
Sound off!
1-2...

1086
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,330
[laughing]

1087
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,089
Al, look at this!

1088
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,681
Hey! It's Mickey Mouse Mantle
over here.

1089
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,603
Doesn't look like
he can handle his stuff, huh?

1090
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,720
- What he needs is a little more of this.
- You get that bottle out of his face!

1091
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,562
Oh, my god, this boy is OD-ing
on some heavy shit.

1092
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,405
If we don't get him up right now,
he'll be cold in half an hour.

1093
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,801
All right, everybody up.
Hold on to this, Alvin.

1094
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,527
Hold on. Here we go.
Everybody up!

1095
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,690
What's this guy bringing,
potatoes in a bag?

1096
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,571
Stop fucking up. If you're not
gonna help, get out of the way!

1097
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,483
This guy's dying, goddamn it.

1098
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,447
[explosion]

1099
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,320
it's over. You get down.

1100
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,041
Sandbag!

1101
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,408
The enemy blew up the General's trailer!
We'll go through over the wire!

1102
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,209
- There's VC all over the place!
- Pike!

1103
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,884
Wake up!

1104
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,291
What?!

1105
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,761
The enemy blew up
the General's trailer.

1106
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,090
All the world is exploding.
Jesus Christ!

1107
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,731
♫ Happy Birthday,
General Dearborn... ♫

1108
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,163
Jesus h. christ!

1109
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,721
Hey, Al!
Pike is sleeping like a log.

1110
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,480
Bisbee, get down,
you stupid motherfucker.

1111
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,642
Get over here and sit down.
Sit down!

1112
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,561
Pike!

1113
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,801
Oh, god...

1114
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,891
Damn it! The VC are fucking having an
attack on us, and you're out there...

1115
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,042
- playing your music.
- They're not VC.

1116
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,646
I put a Claymore
under the General's trailer.

1117
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,809
You put one more round
into the god damn mortar...

1118
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,167
I'm gonna blow up
whatever brains you got left!

1119
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,163
- There's 10,000...
- Asshole!

1120
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,641
You and your freaks are the only ones
shooting anything around here.

1121
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,208
Come here. Come here.

1122
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,846
Come here!

1123
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,486
Oh, man... I can't keep you
alive by myself.

1124
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,609
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

1125
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,929
I cannot keep you alive by myself!

1126
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,520
You're gotta wanna live.
Come on, man.

1127
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,726
I can't feel my legs.

1128
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,565
What do you mean you can't feel
your legs? You're dying, man.

1129
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,371
You're fucking dead meat, man.
You're fucking dying!

1130
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,166
You understand me?
Look at your eyes.

1131
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,289
Your eyes are like
two fucking pin holes in the snow.

1132
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,281
Come on, Pike. Come on.

1133
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,967
Come on, Pike. Come on.
Come out of it.

1134
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,487
Come on, Pike.
You gotta help me, man.

1135
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,130
You gotta want to live.

1136
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,971
You son of a bitch,
you ain't gonna die on me!

1137
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,008
You gotta wanna live,
goddamn it!

1138
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,005
January 12, 1968.

1139
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,321
We're on our way to the Division
Headquarters at Da Nang.

1140
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,485
The Captain can't prove that Dave
blew up the General's trailer.

1141
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,528
I just hope he hasn't noticed that
one of our Claymore mines is missing.

1142
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,648
Billy seems to be fine now.

1143
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,644
But Tyrone is still really pissed off
at him. I can't see why.

1144
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,326
I mean, it wasn't Billy's fault
he got all messed up.

1145
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,961
I sort of wonder what's really bugging
Tyrone. I know whet's bugging Vinnie.

1146
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,727
He picked up a dose of clap
from those hookers.

1147
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,280
And now he thinks I must have
it even worse than he does...

1148
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,045
because I had three of those girls
come up to my room.

1149
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,202
The only thing I did
was talk to them.

1150
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,760
And I got some great stories
for my journal.

1151
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,205
Of course,
how could I tell Vinnie that?

1152
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,805
Look! Al!

1153
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,009
Al, that's triage.
That's a hospital, Al.

1154
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,804
- So what?
- So what?

1155
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,726
So we gotta go see a doctor, Al, before
our peckers run off and crawl way.

1156
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,804
Look, I'm dripping like a Good Humor
in July, you know what I mean?

1157
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,048
What are you talking about?
I feel fine.

1158
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,527
You feel fine? Hey, if I got the clap
from one of them...

1159
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,563
you got it at least three times
as bad, right?

1160
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,887
Now, listen, Archie went that way.
We go this way.

1161
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,002
Keep your mouth shut. Come on.

1162
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,442
Pike, look at that. That's The Dragons.
They're the soccer champs of I Corps.

1163
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,971
Flashy devils, ain't they?

1164
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,048
How'd you like
to beat the shit out of them?

1165
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,811
You think what that would do
for morale.

1166
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,440
All right, people set it down in here.
Take five.

1167
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,881
Okay, Jarines listen up here.

1168
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,561
It is your job to make sure...

1169
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,604
that when a coffin contains
a body bag...

1170
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,564
marked "remains non-viewable"...

1171
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,926
that no one...

1172
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,241
especially the next of kin...

1173
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:11,484
will open that body bag
under any circumstances.

1174
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,405
Okay, load them up.

1175
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,723
But make sure that the coffins
are loaded with the head down...

1176
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,684
otherwise embalming fluid
will collect in the feet...

1177
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,963
and the body will begin
to decompose.

1178
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,929
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.

1179
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,761
January 14, 1968.

1180
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,885
We've been assigned to the combat
base at Con Thien...

1181
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,810
up near the DMZ.

1182
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,281
We 're what they call
a Replacement Company.

1183
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,050
All the guys are trying
not to think about...

1184
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,600
what happened to the company
we 're replacing.

1185
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,000
I'm not worried about that.

1186
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,488
I just hope we get there
in one piece.

1187
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,524
This is supposed to be
a pacified area...

1188
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,964
but after what happened in the last
convoy, the guys are all pretty jumpy.

1189
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,681
They see Vietcong
behind every rice pile.

1190
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,246
And Vinnie almost shot
a water buffalo.

1191
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,290
Captain Collins has been so busy
looking out for another ambush...

1192
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,846
he's gotten us lost
three times already.

1193
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,248
Bisbee, get on the horn and find out
what the hell he's stopping for!

1194
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,201
- Yeah, I think you're right there.
- There! Over there!

1195
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,004
[automatic fire]

1196
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,682
Wait a minute!
Goddamit!

1197
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,970
Who gave the order to shoot?

1198
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,050
Get a hold of Archer. Get Archer.

1199
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,564
- What's everybody shooting at?
- What the hell are you pointing at?

1200
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,041
I was pointing at the road
to Con Diem!

1201
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,081
Oh, shit.

1202
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,800
Gentleman, welcome to Con Diem.

1203
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,970
Your company commander tells me...

1204
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,281
you've already had some
seasoning under fire.

1205
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,207
Here, at the first battalion will take
a lot of pride in a high body count.

1206
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,288
Now the company you're replacing
had the highest kill ratio...

1207
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,731
in the whole damn division.

1208
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,010
And I'd be mighty proud of any unit that
fought and died half as courageously...

1209
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,242
as they did.
Now to back you up...

1210
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,565
we got fire support on hill 609,
614, and right here.

1211
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,768
And we can hit any damn spot
in the valley.

1212
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,887
[explosion]

1213
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,286
Charlie can, too!

1214
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,001
Captain, get your people
on the Northeast perimeter.

1215
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,687
I wanna see all officers, staff, NCOS
in the command bunker now. Move it!

1216
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,331
Let's go! Let's move!
Go! Go! Go!

1217
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,401
[cannonade]

1218
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,010
Move! Let's go!

1219
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,286
Move! Move!

1220
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,325
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

1221
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,166
Squad leader! First squad to the tree
at the first bunker!

1222
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,960
Second squad to the first part
of the second bunker!

1223
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,170
[multiple gunshots]

1224
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,724
- Fire power!
- Lieutenant!

1225
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,810
God damn it! The Colonel wants
your ass in the CT now!

1226
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,166
On the double!

1227
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,322
- Get somebody to watch that position.
- Yes, sir.

1228
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,768
Hold your fire! Stop shooting!
Those are our own troops!

1229
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,646
Shit, the VC's got them
pinned down!

1230
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,685
Get the lieutenant. Tell him they got
pinned down by enemy sniper!

1231
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,326
Oh my god! They're being shelled
by our own artillery!

1232
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,880
Tell them, man, they're being shot at
by our own artillery!

1233
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,201
- Our own artillery is...
- What the hell he's saying?

1234
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,731
Says it's out of his hands.
The Colonel's in charged of this.

1235
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,040
What do you mean,
it's out of his hands?

1236
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,043
The colonel can't fucking see
what's happening man!

1237
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,010
What the he'll are they doing
in that god damn hole!

1238
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,445
God damn it!

1239
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,045
You can't stop this!

1240
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,443
Lieutenant...

1241
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,643
Get the hell out of here! Not a goddamn
thing you can do in here right now!

1242
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,882
Lieutenant, but you don't know
they're blowing away our own men.

1243
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,042
The Colonel knows what he's doing,
goddamit!

1244
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,168
They're walking the artillery back to
the tree line so that they can...

1245
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,562
- zap the snipers and free our patrol.
- But he's walking it right over our men!

1246
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,961
And you know that, man, you could
see that if you weren't hiding...

1247
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,690
down in this god damn hole!

1248
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,570
Man, you gave us all the jive
about playing Charlie's games...

1249
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,768
by Charlie's rules, and you're
fucking down here...

1250
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,683
staying in this place
from the god damn bench...

1251
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,167
...like Charlie's standing still
waiting for the ball to be snapped.

1252
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,527
- Back it up, man!
- Go ahead, kill me, man!

1253
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,931
Harry!

1254
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,810
Keep your goddamned mouth shut,
Washington, just for a goddamn minute?

1255
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,564
Captain... Captain...

1256
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,529
Call off the artillery.
Give me a few men...

1257
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,204
I'll go up and get those gooks
out of that tree line.

1258
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,251
Lieutenant, the colonel has decided he'd
rather commit firepower than risk manpower.

1259
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,242
Just shut up!

1260
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:42,166
And you get your black ass beck on that
line before I court martial you both.

1261
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,730
Jesus Christ!

1262
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,406
These assholes are not gonna help us.
Now go ahead now. Go ahead!

1263
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,486
[explosion]

1264
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,524
Hey, Red, I need this man.
I owe you a favor.

1265
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,841
Later.

1266
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,004
[explosion]

1267
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,047
I need this shit, man.
I will give it back to you later.

1268
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,005
[explosion]

1269
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,362
Come on, Pike!
Here, Fazio.

1270
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,171
Bisbee! Get you're ass over here
and follow me, on the double!

1271
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,690
Keep low!

1272
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,968
OK. Everybody stay down
and stay quiet.

1273
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,963
Don't you fire
until I give you the signal.

1274
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,882
Pike? Don't fuck this one up.

1275
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,361
Now!

1276
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,286
[cheering]

1277
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,766
Yeah! I did it!
And I hope I got your mama!

1278
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,161
Hey...

1279
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,368
I wonder if any of our guys
are still alive.

1280
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,486
OK, Washington, I just got my ass
chewed up by the old man.

1281
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,404
We're going out on patrol tomorrow.
Your ass is going to be on the point...

1282
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,960
right in front, And I'm going to
guarantee you some action.

1283
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,566
Because thanks to you, I had to promise
the Colonel a bigger body count...

1284
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,769
- than the company we replaced.
- Yeah? I got you a head start already.

1285
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,764
And that is the only thing
keeping your big mouth out of the brig.

1286
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:26,131
Do you mind if I get this men some help
before he bleeds to death... Sir?

1287
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,326
Corpsman,
Can we get some help please?

1288
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,965
Watch his face.

1289
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,883
- You people okay?
- Yeah.

1290
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,088
You got that patrol on time.

1291
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,209
Next time don't waste time
going to captain first, right?

1292
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,330
Next time I'll make sure
I'll get the captain out of my way first.

1293
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,522
Well, you did good.

1294
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,811
Pike! Are you fucking
with pills again?!

1295
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,163
Hey... hey... hold up!!!

1296
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,210
Lieutenant, it's okay.

1297
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,810
Fucking told your ass I don't want
no junkie on my back. Didn't I?

1298
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,327
Yeah, well the captain gave me these.
Goddamit, 'cause my fucking foot hurts.

1299
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,166
And he also said I don't have to be
in your shitty squad anymore.

1300
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,687
- it's okay.
- I know it's okay.

1301
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,201
I'm cool.

1302
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,290
Stay away from me!

1303
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,251
You stay the fuck away from me, man.
If I ever catch you near me again...

1304
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,369
I'm going to put my foot
upside your ass... sideways.

1305
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,006
Line of departure,
lock em' and load em'.

1306
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,724
Now keep those canteens full.

1307
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,009
I don't want half empty sloshing around.
VC will hear, there'll be an ambush.

1308
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,162
Yeah, you can see this line
a mile away.

1309
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,481
Get to the point Washington,
right at the point.

1310
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,211
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
What am I, Charles Atlas?

1311
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,521
- Stop it, Fazio.
- Get up front, move.

1312
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,968
Lieutenant, keep them off the roads,
they're fully mined.

1313
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,321
Captain, I'm gonna take it a little easier
today. Half my people still have the shits.

1314
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,561
All right.

1315
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,600
- Pike.
- Yes, Sir?

1316
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,240
Get the hell with that...

1317
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,005
- How's that kicking foot?
- Better. Thanks for set-up.

1318
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,367
All right, you step right next to me.

1319
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:02,651
Well, today is the start
of a new body count month.

1320
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,411
I don't have to remind you...

1321
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,327
that the company, that leads...

1322
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,925
the highest body count...

1323
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,324
will get three days of R&R
at China Beach.

1324
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,644
- Hey, Vin, you know I'm just thinking?
- Yeah.

1325
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,642
How tough it is to hump this stuff
in this muddy swamp here.

1326
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,169
No, this isn't a swamp,
These are rice fields.

1327
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,489
This is an engineering marvel,
thousands of years old.

1328
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,484
They terrace the land,
so that the water flows evenly...

1329
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,769
from one paddy, to the next,
to the next, to the next.

1330
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,684
Like this whole valley
was one giant fountain.

1331
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,247
Hell, I hate rice.

1332
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,644
I don't even eat Rice Krispies.

1333
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,287
You've got a heavy load right there,
take it easy.

1334
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,131
I wish I didn't have this M-16
to tow around.

1335
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,691
The gun doesn't weigh anything, Bisbee.
The radio weighs about 40 pounds.

1336
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,250
- You won't kill anybody with a radio.
- Say what?

1337
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,365
Can't kill anybody with a radio, sir.

1338
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,929
Damn it, Pike, put that letter away.
It's ankle breaking territory.

1339
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,049
Yes, sir. See, I read the damn thing
20 times anyway.

1340
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,641
Don't worry, she'll wait for you.

1341
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,167
It ain't that.

1342
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:26,211
She says some damn freshman broke
one of my high school track records.

1343
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,884
I ain't afraid of getting killed today

1344
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,606
so much as what's going
to happen after, I mean.

1345
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,848
Ain't nothing except a couple
of damn trophies at school...

1346
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,725
and then next year, somebody hit more
homeruns than you did and then they...

1347
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,327
change the damn names on the trophy.
There ain't nothing left at all.

1348
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,801
Don't you worry, we'll get you into
a soccer game with the Dragons...

1349
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,770
and get a whole shitload of new
records. Yep.

[clicking]

1351
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,641
Did anybody hear a click?

1352
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,083
No, no. That's just me.
I'm just taking some pictures.

1353
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,881
Oh. You idiot. Will you put that camera
away and watch out for trip wire?

1354
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,166
Sorry.

1355
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,646
Al, I'm dying of thirst over here,
I'm parched. I can't believe...

1356
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,451
we can't take a drink because of this
no sloshing canteens ruling.

1357
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,767
No sloshing... we sound like
a bunch of plumbers out here.

01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,241
Foster...

1360
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,923
- Did you just take a picture?
- No.

1361
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,520
Everybody stop!
Be still.

1362
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,083
Everybody just be cool.

1363
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,521
What're you doing?

1364
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,524
I'm taking a bath really.

1365
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,530
Oh, come on, I'm serious!
What're you doing?!

1366
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,568
- I'm on a mine.
- What?

1367
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,560
What do I do?

1368
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,927
The fuck you mean, what?
Get the hell out of the way!

1369
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,800
All right, it's a mine!
Everybody retrace your steps!

1370
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,561
Retrace you steps!
Back! Back!

1371
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,928
Damn it, don't go near that man.
Leave him alone, he is a dead man!

1372
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,525
Back it up! Back it up!

1373
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,690
Damn it! That's an order!

1374
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,969
Do not move, Washington.
It's a pressure release device.

1375
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,408
It will not detonate
unless you take your weight off it.

1376
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,050
Like I'm going somewhere.

1377
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,802
- Do not move! Do not breathe!
- Move, Lieutenant. That is an order!

1378
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,765
Get those ammo cases.
Get those ammo boxes.

1379
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,046
Right now!

1380
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,441
Goddamit, Pike!
I will not lose another life!

1381
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,045
Now, come on back here!

1382
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,566
Pressure release device. Gotta
replace Washington's weight...

1383
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,768
with the weight of ammo boxes.

1384
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,526
Find the plate, seek out the plate.
Find it first.

1385
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,330
Very carefully.
Do not move Washington.

1386
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,004
Do not move at all.

1387
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,930
Very carefully Pike, That's it!

1388
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,286
Very carefully.

1389
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,966
Will you get the fuck away from me,
Pike? I'll kick you in your ass.

1390
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,202
Shut up, you big lummox.
If you do any kicking...

1391
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,163
you'd better do it with your
god damn right foot.

1392
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,361
Let him work, Washington!

1393
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,122
You find it?
You find it, Pike?

1394
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,086
All right. Take that first box, and
you put it on the edge of the panel.

1395
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,322
Very carefully, very softly.
As he does so, Washington...

1396
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,803
you move your foot, slowly removing
the amount of weight he's replacing.

1397
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,283
All right, here comes the first one.

1398
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,486
Easy.

1399
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,086
Ease off.

1400
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,411
- Man, will you just get out of my life!
- Just shut up, you make me nervous.

1401
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,801
You both better shut up
if you wanna live!

1402
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,449
Put that second box down there,
Pike.

1403
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,408
I may not get a chance
to tell you this...

1404
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,051
but you're the biggest goddamn bastard
I have known in my life.

1405
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,361
Yeah? But your mama like it,
you motherfucker!

1406
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,122
All right, now, very slowly,
on the count of three...

1407
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,965
remove your foot and run like hell.
Do you understand me, Washington?

1408
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,802
OK, let's go.

1409
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,209
One, two, three...

1410
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,406
Let's go!

1411
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,924
[explosion]

1412
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,243
We are going on the road. This whole
area and all these paddies are mined!

1413
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,489
Dipshit!

1414
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,771
Well, I ain't gonna kiss
your skinny lips, quaker.

1415
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,450
Yeah, we're even.

1416
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,883
So fuck off.

1417
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,286
Can you imagine being
on one of those mines?

1418
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,603
- Go nuts in five seconds.
- What are sweating about, Al?

1419
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,001
Fazio would have you
off there like that.

1420
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,851
- Hey, you'd risk your life for me?
- Of course, I would.

1421
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,684
- Would you do the same for me?
- Yeah.

1422
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,250
Well, we're buddies.

1423
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,091
Washington?

1424
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,129
Slow down, Washington, we're not
running any race around here.

1425
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,369
Lieutenant, did you see
the Captain's face?

1426
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,287
- See his face when?
- When I was standing on that mine.

1427
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,728
What are you talking about,
Washington?

1428
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,649
Was the son of a bitch smiling?

1429
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,005
Son of a bitch is running.

1430
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,369
You want these back, stay out of trouble
and start taking care of yourself.

1431
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,886
- Sir, it's the Colonel again.
- You're worth shit to me!

1432
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,800
It's Collins here, sir.

1433
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,325
Lieutenant!

1434
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,684
All right, I want two scouting details.
Check out the left hand side...

1435
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,649
and the right hand side
of the river next to the bridge.

1436
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,290
Lieutenant, what the hell
is going on now?

1437
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,601
I'm sending some people to checkout
the river, find us a place to cross.

1438
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,727
We haven't got any time.

1439
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,928
That minefield caused a delay
in our operations timetable...

1440
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,368
now the Colonel is on my ass to
hump into ambush position by sunset...

1441
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,444
- so we can get some body counts.
- I understand that, sir.

1442
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,648
There's a risk factor involving
crossing the goddamn bridge.

1443
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,530
Don't you see it's a toss up anyway
we play it. Intelligence tells us...

1444
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,210
the road is mined, to stick with
the paddies.

1445
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,328
The paddies are mined, we're back
on the road. And you want me...

1446
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,051
- to send men back into the bush again.
- Yes, I do, sir. It's my opinion...

1447
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,441
Well, you forget your opinion,
because I'm in charge here...

1448
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,808
and it is my opinion that
the risk factor is minimal.

1449
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,601
I'll stake my bars on it.
I'll cross that goddamn bridge myself.

1450
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,611
Freeze!
You stay where you are.

1451
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,524
At least let me get the people
to clear the bridge for you!

1452
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,643
Goddamn that son of a...

1453
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,849
Give me two 60s on either flank
right now and four riflemen with them.

1454
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,967
Foster, Washington...

1455
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,724
C'mon, move out!

1456
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,370
Harry, get up here.

1457
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,402
Go!

1458
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,245
Let's go, Lieutenant!

1459
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,845
Bring them over.
Bring them over.

1460
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,846
Two at a time. Keep your interval,
do not bunch up on that bridge.

1461
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,131
Jesus, don't take all night.
Get them moving!

1462
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,930
- Let's go.
- Two at a time.

1463
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,329
Let's go!
Let's go!

1464
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,971
Goddamit, it's taking all night.
Move them over.

1465
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,162
All of them at a time.
Let's go!

1466
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,484
- Everybody, move it. Move it out.
- Hey, we gotta send them two at a time!

1467
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,126
You heard him!

1468
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,924
- That son of a goddamn bitch.
- [Machine gun fire.]

1469
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,160
[screams]

1470
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,847
- The M79!
- Yes, Sir! It's right here.

1471
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,290
Give it to me right now!

1472
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,764
[multiple shots]

1473
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,485
- Over there!
- Yes, yes.

1474
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,007
[yells]

1475
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,642
Pike!

1476
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,290
Move your ass out of there.
Go on!

1477
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,723
Move your ass out of there!

1478
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,610
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1479
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,402
- Get that.
- Niner.

1480
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,845
[explosion]

1481
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,287
Let's see what we got, Washington.
Let's move!

1482
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,927
Hold fire! Hold fire!

1483
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,600
Hold fire!

1484
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,247
Lieutenant!

1485
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,529
I want you to give me a body count
on the double! Let's go, go, go!

1486
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,321
All right. My IDO has been hit.
Get battalion on the line.

1487
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,647
Pike, how are you doing?
Are you all right?

1488
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,845
Hurry it up, Lieutenant!

1489
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,446
Goddamit. I could
kick the shit out of him.

1490
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,804
All right, here you are.

1491
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,281
All right, Colonel, we've engaged
the enemy on the bridge and we're...

1492
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,125
expecting a big body count.
If you just hold it a minute, Sir.

1493
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,366
What's going on? Come on!

1494
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,523
- I need that body count, goddamit!
- It's a tunnel!

1495
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,411
Colonel, we'll delay on that body count,
we've got a tunnel.

1496
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,051
We're gonna have to track it down
and I'll be right back to you...

1497
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,845
as soon as we find the source.
I got a good idea where they're going.

1498
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,649
Yes, sir.
Yes.

1499
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,601
Shit!

1500
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,967
- Where do you think they're going?
- I've got a goddamn...

1501
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,361
good idea where.
Right over there...

1502
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,808
we got us a VC village and we're gonna
light it up like the fourth of July.

1503
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,042
You get me artillery,
I'll feed you some coordinates.

1504
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,804
Sir, there are probably
a couple hundred people in there...

1505
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,770
Jesus Christ! That is an enemy village.
Will you get me artillery?!

1506
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,763
Where the hell am I?
3... 3-3-6.

1507
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,525
- Sorry, sir, I can't do that.
- 4-7-2. What can't you do?

1508
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,729
- 3-3-5.
- I'm not gonna do it with a rifle...

1509
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,484
and I'm not gonna do it
with the radio, sir.

1510
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,643
- What wouldn't you do?
- Murder another human being, sir.

1511
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,722
Bisbee, you get me that artillery...

1512
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,929
or your ass is in the brig
in Da Nang and that is a direct order.

1513
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,924
Sir, I must respectfully
refuse to obey that order.

1514
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,480
Goddamit, you're in big trouble!

1515
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,768
War Eagle,
this is Charlie One, over.

1516
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,082
War Eagle,
this is Charlie One, over.

1517
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,362
War Eagle, I got
a firing mission for you.

1518
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,684
Request 105 assistance.
Coordinates are 3-3-5, 4-7-2.

1519
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,609
The target is an enemy village.

1520
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,802
I want this man placed
under field arrest.

1521
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,967
What happened now?

1522
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:37,290
He refused to obey my direct order
to call artillery on an enemy position.

1523
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,851
I had to do it myself,
the son of a bitch.

1524
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,200
What enemy position, Captain?

1525
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,806
Goddamit, that village,
that is a VC village!

1526
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,844
- What in the fuck are you talking about?
- That is where the tunnels come out.

1527
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,247
It's right where
the tunnels come out.

1528
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,803
Bisbee, get on the horn, call artillery
and tell them to disregard that order.

1529
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,729
Now, just wait a fucking minute.
You're in trouble!

1530
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,888
Goddamit, you're going
out of your mind, man!

1531
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,647
- You're going out of your mind!
- I don't need to take that shit from you!

1532
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,842
- We don't need to take that village!
- We got to take that reaper out??

1533
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,122
I want a body count, goddamit!

1534
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,482
[continuous explosions]

1535
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,767
Holy shit...

1536
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,684
Washington, would you mind
getting your ass on the point?

1537
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,406
Lieutenant, I want you to keep
a running body count.

1538
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,689
All right, keep alert, I want you to
all be watching for a tunnel opening.

1539
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,290
Keep watching all over!

1540
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,245
[ducks quacking]

1541
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,161
That tunnel's around here somewhere.
The man who finds it...

1542
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,171
gets an in-country R&R,
three days at China Beach.

1543
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,931
Goddamit, will you put that down?
Everything could be boobied.

1544
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,646
Put it down!
Come on, back in the line.

1545
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,767
Lieutenant, you get a count yet?

1546
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,525
Yes, sir, two chickens and a duck.

1547
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,923
All right, Gunny, let's break
the men into details.

1548
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,611
We'll search and clear all the hooches,
the rice piles, everything.

1549
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,165
Let's see what we can uncover.

1550
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,251
- You got anything, Lieutenant?
- The village is deserted, sir.

1551
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,443
The hell it is. You just
don't know where to look yet.

1552
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,326
- What do you got up there?
- It's snakes, sir.

1553
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,566
Shit.

1554
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,365
- Captain?
- Yeah.

1555
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,128
We got some bodies here, sir.

1556
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,970
He's got his goddamn bodies.

1557
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,129
Here's your body count, Captain.

1558
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,329
But I guess it doesn't really count.

1559
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,242
All these people are alive.

1560
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,762
Hey, Skipper,
look what I found out here.

1561
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,365
All right, you little gook.

1562
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,681
I wanna know where that tunnel is and
wanna know where your friends are...

1563
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,644
'cause you did not blow
the shit out of us by yourself.

1564
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,848
- He can't understand a goddamn thing.
- He can talk English...

1565
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,445
as good as you or me.
Let me work on him.

1566
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,722
Harry, get on the radio
and get someone from S2.

1567
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,531
I wanna interrogate a prisoner on the
double. Get out there, go on.

1568
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,324
Jesus Christ.

1569
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,569
All right, did he have a weapon?

1570
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,960
It's just this club.

1571
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,041
Captain.

1572
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,964
Forget it. If this man had been digging
a tunnel before coming here...

1573
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,247
...his hands wouldn't be as clean as
they are, but dirtier than mine.

1574
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,322
Shit, we took so long to get here
and he could have a shower.

1575
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,607
Captain, this ain't a weapon,
it looks like a baseball bat.

1576
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,523
They know from baseball like
I know from polo.

1577
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,921
Who do you think won
the Little League World series?

1578
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,809
Damn chinks from Taiwan.

1579
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,167
Hey buddy, do you play baseball?

1580
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,805
- Grenade!!
- Grenade!

1581
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,564
Hey, let me see this.

1582
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,642
Hey, you play baseball!

1583
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,882
Come on, buddy.
Come on, little buddy, let's go.

1584
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,440
Here's the bat.
All right, buddy.

1585
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,442
All right. Let's go.

1586
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,440
Come on! You're pitching
like your granny, Fazio.

1587
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,851
Hit that ball!

1588
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,171
Colonel Trang.

1589
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,966
He's out!
He's out!

1590
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:07,328
He's out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!

1591
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,927
It's over!

1592
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,927
All right, men, this is Colonel Trang
from the National Police Field Force.

1593
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,368
And this is Major Royal, Special
Forces adviser. They are here...

1594
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,602
- to take care of the interrogation.
- What interrogation?

1595
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,170
Hell, he ain't no VC!

1596
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,561
He's just a kid who plays baseball
better than most.

1597
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
Don't worry!
Don't worry!

1598
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,046
Shut it up!

1599
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,605
Don't worry.

1600
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,649
Nothing will happen to him.

1601
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,769
If he is no VC, no worry.

1602
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,561
-I'm telling you he's not the enemy.
.-That's right, I'm with him.

1603
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,605
Relax!

1604
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,251
Look, these are
Colonel Trang's people.

1605
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,609
He understands how to deal with them.
We just take the kid, check his story out.

1606
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,006
That's strictly routine.

1607
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,004
That good enough for you, Pike?
You got the Major's word as an officer.

1608
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,811
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

1609
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,809
All right, we're gonna move it out.
Gunny, get them going.

1610
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,724
Washington, you're on the point.
Let's get moving! Out! Let's go!

1611
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,164
Goddamn body count. We'll have
to be out here again tomorrow.

1612
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,844
Let's fill those ranks in.

1613

[distant painful yell]

1614
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,089
Hey, wait a minute.
What was that?

1615
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,122
Let's move.

1616
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,646
I heard something, dammit.
Hootie, shut that radio off.

1617
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,046
Pike...

1618
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,369
Would you get your ass back
into the column. Come on.

1619
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,090
[distant screaming]

1620
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,241
- I'm going back.
- You just wait a minute!

1621
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,127
Now, wait a minute.
Listen to me.

1622
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,602
I want you to take these back
and we'll forget about this morning.

1623
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,648
Come on, take them,
because I've got big plans for you.

1624
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,165
Now, don't you blow it.
Come on!

1625
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,367
- I ain't playing soccer for you.
- Yeah?

1626
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,330
Well, you do that and you're gonna
let down the whole goddamn team!

1627
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,722
You think what that could do for morale
if we beat the dragons. Don't blow it!

1628
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,642
Take these.

1629
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,563
I wouldn't play for you
if my life depended on it.

1630
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,688
Well, it does.
You need me, Pike.

1631
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,526
A junkie needs all the help he can get.
Now, you do exactly what I tell you...

1632
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,729
or else you're a dead man. Now stuff
some of these down your throat. Go on!

1633
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,565
You're the one who's dead,
goddamit!

1634
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,322
[distant gunshot]

1635
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,646
You wouldn't have done that
if that was a white boy back there.

1636
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,281
Yeah, but to you he's just nothing but
a gook. He's just a yellow nigger.

1637
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,091
- He is the enemy.
- No, you're the enemy!

1638
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,483
Well, he finally did it, didn't he, Al?

1639
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,403
That son of a bitch
finally got a body count.

1640
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,728
And you're an asshole.

1641
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,007
If you're gonna be dumb enough
to pull a gun on a man...

1642
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,289
you better be smart enough
to pull the trigger.

1657
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:34,043
♫ But there's a guard on the inside ♫

1658
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,923
♫ With a rifle in hand ♫

1659
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,445
♫ And the guard on the outside ♫

1660
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,520
♫ Buying up government land ♫

1661
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,769
♫ Betsy Anne, tell me once again ♫

1662
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,970
♫ You will be there when it's over ♫

1663
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,050
♫ Here I am ♫

1664
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,403
♫ Here I am... ♫

1665
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:16,001
Both of you are goddamn lucky your
asses aren't gonna be sent to the brig.

1666
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,686
Gonna be joining the combined
action platoon, Tam Bak Hamlet.

1667
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,444
You're gonna be guarding the rice.

1668
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,841
Get your stuff, get on the jeep,
you move it out right now.

1669
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,570
Thank you, Captain.

1670
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,771
They're taking them away.

1671
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,810
You got anymore of this pound cake
in your C rations there? I'm almost out.

1672
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,565
Didn't you hear me? They're taking
Pike and Bisbee away in a jeep.

1673
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,967
Yeah, I heard you, Alvin.
Now, did you hear me?

1674
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,044
I want more pound cake
in your C rations there.

1675
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,648
Hey, you think they'll drive them
all the way to Da Nang in a jeep?

1676
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,605
I don't know.

1677
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,725
I'll tell you one thing I do know though.
Old Fazio over here is gonna...

1678
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,327
get himself a jug and drink his money
down before gun gets his mitts into it.

1679
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,801
That's what I'm talking about.
You coming?

1680
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,200
No.

1681
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,410
I wanna write down everything
that happened today.

1682
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,331
But who the fuck would believe it?

1683
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,566
Well...

1684
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,120
I told the Colonel not
to send them to the brig.

1685
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,329
Wouldn't mind if we got
a discipline problem around here.

1686
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,446
The old Captain jumps in
and sends them to guard the rice...

1687
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,443
in Tam Bak Hamlet.

1688
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,324
Well...

1689
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,241
At least that's better
than going to the brig.

1690
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,844
Do you happen to notice those guys in
the bags over there they were placing?

1691
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,967
Charlie mines the paddy every night.

1692
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,323
And every morning someone else
gets blown to shit.

1693
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,930
They're lucky if they last a week.

1694
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,845
Hey, buddy.

1695
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,610
Moon juice. Check it out.

1696
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,287
- They've got a still over there.
- I see you found your jug.

1697
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,725
That ain't all I found.

1698
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,923
You know those guys in Delta company
got down in their hooch?

1699
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,445
- A hooker.
- You're kidding!

1700
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,127
I swear to god. She's 15 and she's
a knockout and I may be in love.

1701
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,282
Hey, Superman,
let's you and me get laid, huh?

1702
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,408
Why don't you go?
I'm sort of busy.

1703
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,208
You can't let a chance like this pass you
by. You owe it to Pike and Bisbee.

1704
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,726
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean, "What do I mean?"

1705
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,529
Remember what I told you.
It ain't like you got forever.

1706
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,762
- You grab it as it goes by, Al.
- Nah, nah, nah.

1707
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,491
I don't feel like
grabbing anything today.

1708
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:40,408
- What is that shit you got on?
- Oh, thinking about recipes for C rations.

1709
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,443
You know, like cooking.
Stuff like that.

1710
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,363
- Cooking?
- Yeah.

1711
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,051
Hey...

1712
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:53,523
- You got checked up by the doc yet?
- No, I told you I feel fine.

1713
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,162
Hey, I'm pissing razor blades over here
and I just biffed one of them.

1714
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,050
You fucked three of them,
you feel fine?

1715
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,966
Boy... you must be the wonder
of the medical world, Al.

1716
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:07,847
Either that or maybe you
didn't even touch them, huh?

1717
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,327
- Swapping recipes with them in there?
- No!

1718
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,290
- Hey, Vinnie, I never said anything...
- I don't think you fucked any of them.

1719
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,601
I don't think girls turn you on.
Hey!

1720
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:18,445
I think you might be a little
hotel-motel, right?

1721
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,285
What are you talking about?
I thought you were my friend.

1722
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:25,968
I don't care what you thought.
I ain't that kind of friend, you know?

1723
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,206
Just stay the fuck away from me,
Foster. And I mean it.

1724
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,011
Yes, sir, Captain.
I think I see the enemy out there.

1725
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,684
Yes, sir. OP4.

1726
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,684
Be right down?
Thank you, sir.

1727
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,561
[starts shooting]

1728
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,244
VC! Down right there!

1729
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,721
Here comes the enemy.
Come on.

1730
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,723
Come on, Captain,
you motherfucker.

1731
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,122
Clear the boxes. Come on.
A little bit more. Yeah!

1732
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,361
You think that's gonna get
Pike and Bisbee back?

1733
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:12,482
I'm gonna get that motherfucker. I'm
gonna kill that sadistic son of a bitch.

1734
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,846
You probably would.

1735
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,686
But I'm not gonna watch it.
Because it's bullshit.

1736
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:20,003
Bullshit! Like everything else that's
going on around this goddamn place.

1737
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,890
[Radio Speaker]: Radio Hanoi.

1738
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,527
And just a reminder that the weather
is sweet at this time of year.

1739
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,166
It's really cool, boy.

1740
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,843
Your two minions say you
wanna see me.

1741
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,647
Well, you see me.

1742
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,690
I'm sorry I did not see you
at the village.

1743
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,446
When your company was there today.

1744
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,724
But you see...

1745
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,051
I was indisposed [chuckles].

1746
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:07,165
I'm Colonel Trang, district chief.

1747
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,283
My brother-in-law has told me
of your proposition.

1748
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,363
Fascinating...

1749
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,371
this little tag mark...

1750
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,326
"remains non-viewable".

1751
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:28,322
It will help us to keep prying eyes
from intervening with our business.

1752
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:34,007
So as soon as your contact deposits
the capital, we can begin.

1753
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,128
Unless, of course, we run out
of non-viewable remains.

1754
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,446
[chuckles]

1755
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,683
You jive ass motherfucker.

1756
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,603
What kind of games
you trying to run on me?

1757
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,208
I don't understand.

1758
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,482
- Is your name not Washington?
- Yeah, man, my name is Washington.

1759
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,770
Half the niggers in the Marine Corps
name is Washington.

1760
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,320
You got the wrong man.

1761
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,006
[foreign language]

1762
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,929
The son of a bitch
is stuck in the goddamn sand!

1763
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,408
Everybody out right now, people.

1764
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,523
On the beach. Spread out.

1765
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,400
January 23, 1968.
For once we know where we're going.

1766
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,370
Intelligence located
a Vietcong tactical operation center...

1767
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,885
and we're supposed to knock it out.

1768
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,088
The Captain thinks we 're
gonna ring up a big body count.

1769
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,607
But he's not going with us. I guess
after what happened the other day...

1770
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:55,605
he wants to be sure that when we start
counting bodies, his isn't one of them.

1771
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,650
Vinnie isn't still talking to me,
but I can understand that.

1772
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,122
I think he was really upset about Pike
and Bisbee going down to that village.

1773
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,682
And he was drunk and all. So I guess
he had to take it out on somebody.

1774
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,489
- He wants to go on foot, Harry?
- Yeah.

1775
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,206
That's a goddamn minesweeper
without a three quarter-inch armour...

1776
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,089
through a goddamned coconut grove!

1777
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,607
- I don't like the way it smells, it stink's!
- You keep these people here and down.

1778
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,887
I'm gonna take Washington in there
and sniff around there. You got that?

1779
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,325
- You be careful.
- All right.

1780
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,289
Washington, let's move out!

1781
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,730
Get your asses down there.
Down! Down!

1782
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,686
All right, Washington.

1783
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:35,048
You keep your eyes on the tree tops,
I'm gonna watch the ground.

1784
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,131
This is nice, sir.
I'm gonna take a picture.

1785
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,487
Down! Get your ass down!

1786
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,525

- Fuck. There's one over there.
- Take it easy.

01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,601
Detail your people to envelope
and contain that position...

1806
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,001
according to bravo plan,
you got that?

1807
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,842
Washington, let's reconnoiter.

1808
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,247
- Are you okay?
- I'm gonna be fine.

1809
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,802
Goddamit, I need a...
I need a corpsman up here.

All right.

1813
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,808
Third squad's in position,
fourth squad's got the back door.

1814
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,441
People?

1815
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,129
We'll flush them out now.

1816
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,726
I want you to keep
your goddamn eyes wide open...

1817
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,402
'cause Charlie may have
a network of tunnels up here...

1818
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:46,530
and he could come out anywhere.
I want you to be ready for anything.

1819
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,324
All right, Washington,
light that son of a bitch up.

[detonation]

1821
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,091
All right, people, talk to me now.
Talk to me!

1822
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,721
God...!

1823
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,962
That looks like nobody's home.

1824
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,608
May not be anybody home,
Washington.

1825
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,251
Some schmuck's gonna have
to walk over there and prove it.

1826
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,446
Let's go.

to the cool sound of radio Hanoi.

1830
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,849
Radio Hanoi?

1831
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,049
God fuck it!!

1832
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,041
All the people we lost today, for what,
for a goddamn relay booster...

1833
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:03,044
for motherfucking Radio Hanoi?

Intelligence swore it was a goddamn
enemy communications center!

1835

Hire ups and goofballs tell them
any goddamn thing they want to hear...

and they listen to him because they're
fuck heads. Goddamn fuck-heads!

1837
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,323
Washington, do you know why
we're on this goddamn mission?

1838
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:22,688
You have a battalion sitting on top
of that hill watching down at us...

1839
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,289
...because we're gonna draw fire,
Washington. We're bait.

We're goddamn
motherfucking live bait!

1841
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,091
It's all we are.

1842
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,243
We draw them out of the bush
and those bastards on that hill...

1843
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:38,211
...are gonna let loose with that big
fancy ass million dollar hardware.

1844
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,045
They can get a nice, big,
juicy body count.

Washington...

1846
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,129
if that's what those
motherfuckers want...

1847
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,283
that is precisely what those
motherfuckers are going to get!

1848
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,044
Come on, Washington.

1849
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,328
Come on out here, Washington.

1850

Give me the coordinates
of that hill over there.

1851

Ain't nothing on that hill.

1852
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,729
You have been out in the bush
too long, 'cause I can clearly see...

1853
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,609
a whole tactical operation centre
up there.

1854

An enemy communication centre too
and it's all being defended...

of MVA regulars...

- That's right!

1857

- thought you would.
- I see it.

1858
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,004
You ever think what it would be like
to spend a million goddamn dollars?

You know something?
I think about it all the time.

You'll find out what it's like right now
Washington, today.

Oh, I love that, goddamn!

1870
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,800
It's a shame the Captain
isn't here to see all those fireworks.

1871
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:58,531
And it's also a shame that he wasn't
here to catch one of those bullets...

1872
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,251
- fragged up his ass in this fireworks...
- You know something, Washington?

1873
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,561
It's about time we stopped talking about
blowing out someone's nuts off...

1874
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,404
and start listening
to what he's saying.

1875
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,845
- Listen to the Captain?
- The Captain.

1876
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,008
And that bullshit he's been talking
about playing soccer to understand...

1877
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,684
what the enemy thinks?

1878
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:13,604
And all that bullshit about
beating that gook team, the Dragons...

1879
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,125
- so we'd be the soccer champs?
- Right.

1880
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,727
Be good for morale. Do you have any
idea how good for morale that'd be?

1881
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,847
No.

1882
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,765
Washington, if we're
the soccer champs...

1883
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,161
we don't find our ass
in combat no more.

1884
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,082
Right.

1885
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,606
If we're the soccer champs, we don't
tour around the country fighting.

1886
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,843
We tour around the country playing
and behind the lines.

1887
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,170
Now you can call that son of a bitch
yellow bellied coward if you want.

1888
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,762
But you don't call in MEDEVAC
for bruised shin or damaged knee.

1889
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,327
And maybe that's the one thing
what we're out here for.

1890
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,131
Maybe it's the only goddamn thing
we can accomplish out here.

1891
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,443
Just get these little peckerwoods
out of here in one piece.

1892
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:51,241
Yeah, but you see you're talking
about a soccer team now.

1893
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,249
And we ain't got Pike.

1894
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:57,087
And you got to face the fact.
Pike is the soccer team.

for the Captain.

what I'm talking about.

- You don't. We need Pike.
- We need Pike...

- and he's not gonna play for the Captain.
- Right.

1901
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,367
But you're gonna talk
to him into playing for us.

- You.
- I'm gonna talk him into...

him into playing for us. That's your job.

1954
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,051
Here's your mail.
You and Bisbee.

1955
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,487
Get this stiff out of my jeep.

1956
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:40,042
- Move it. On the double.
- [Pike starts yelling.]

1957
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:43,408
I'm gonna be a father!
Hey, man, I'm gonna be a father!

1958
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:46,165
Betsy, she's having my kid!
She's gonna have my kid!

1959
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,884
- I thought you sent her to Tijuana?
- I did!

1960
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:50,361
I mean, I did, but I didn't.
I mean, she didn't go!

1961
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,324
- Congratulations!
- Don't you know?

1962
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:56,051
No matter what happens, there's gonna
be something left of me in this world.

1963
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,088
A little Billy Ray Junior!

1964
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,483
- God bless you man.
- Don't stand there drooling...

1965
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,528
like Pavlov's pups, come on,
let's get moving!

1966
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:03,408
What?

1967
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,687
Hell, we got a soccer game
with the Dragons, man.

1968
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,121
If we win we're out of combat.

1969
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,282
Can I take Missy and Koi?

1970
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,528
- Get them.
- All right!

1971
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:15,211
This is the luckiest day
of our lives, man.

1972
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,646
Damn, that's something, ain't it?

1973
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,046
Pike, if you can be a father...

1974
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:26,371
...I guess there's hope for the world.

1975
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,804
Let's move it!

1976
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,326
Here you go, buddy.
Kick some ass!

1977
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,289
Bring them little yellow
piss-ants on! Go!

1978
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,486
[marching music]

1979
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,403
Forward march!

1980
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,046
Vinnie...

1981
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,203
We need you out there
today, man.

1982
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:55,089
You gotta understand that what
happened to Foster is not your fault.

1983
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,646
Hell, it ain't.

1984
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:00,170
- We're gotta win this goddamn game...
- Look, I'll play okay.

1985
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,730
I'll play. Just get off me.

1986
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,081
[cheering]

1987
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,848
You think we got a hope in hell?

1988
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,682
I don't know shit about this game,
Captain.

1989
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,089
Goddamn, I ain't done
with you, man!

1990
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:23,642
Hardcore championship soccer,
the Muthuhs and the Dragons.

1991
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,570
And so far, the Muthuhs are off
to a slow start. Gunny?

1992
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:30,042
I knew there was gonna be a slow
start, but they're strong on the finish.

1993
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,884
Shit!
Pass the motherfucker here!

1994
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,402
Fuck you!

1995
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,244
OK, Fazio, that's good!

1996
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,402
Hey, Vinnie! Vinnie Fazio!

1997
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,691
Which one is the Dago Fazio?!

1998
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,084
- Alvin!
- Smile!

1999
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,004
Alvin, you're beautiful.
Look at you.

2000
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:49,162
I can't believe it,
look at his face.

2001
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:52,968
The ball is still in play.

2002
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,206
[cheering]

2003
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,769
We've got a game! We're playing
a game! Get the fuck out of here!

2004
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:08,003
Hey, Alvin!
Al, this one's for you...

2005
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:09,206
- my man!
- What?!

2006
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,045
- Come on, do it!
- Goddamn, will you play the game?!

2007
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,888
When I was in the hospital, I heard
about this game. I couldn't believe it!

2008
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,566
How did the Captain get a game
with the Dragons?

2009
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:24,326
- Remember that day you got hit?
- Yeah.

2010
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,880
Well, we stormed up
that hill that day.

2011
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,281
We wiped out an entire battalion
of MVA regulars.

2012
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,483
We got the highest body count
in Division for the whole month.

2013
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,688
The general was so pleased with us.
Well, he just pulled a few strings...

2014
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,046
we got the match.

2015
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,441
You wiped out a whole battalion?

2016
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,087
You believe that Foster?

2017
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,764
Yeah, yes, sir.

2018
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,610
Then they probably
ought to make you a general too.

2019
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:58,330
Hell, yeah, that's terrific!

2020
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:04,522
- Hey, Metcalfe, that's more like it.
- These are my boys, sir.

2021
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:08,730
- They worked very hard for this.
- Where's the goddamn photographer?

2022
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,689
There he is, sir, right here.

2023
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,489
That'll look good for you, sir.

2024
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,328
Pike, I'm in the clear!
Come on!

2025
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:29,368
[cheers]

2026
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,247
We're in the lead!
We're in the lead!

2027
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,527
That's it!
That's it! Go, Pike!

2028
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:43,965
Goddamn it.

2029
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,487
What a terrific play
by Pike out there on the field.

2030
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:56,848
The score is now 3-1.
The whistle blows, it's half time.

2031
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:59,241
Like I told you, the boy starts slow,
the other side doesn't win.

2032
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,364
We have got them by the balls
and that is the name of the game.

2033
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,920
Jesus, get them to the locker room
and I'm gonna go see Gen. Sloan.

2034
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,405
Goddamn!

2035
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:11,081
[marching music]

2036
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:20,567
Let's check your package!

2037
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,045
There seems to be some strange body
language going out there in the field.

2038
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,087
What is that?

2039
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:28,004
Well, it's probably the most intelligent
question that you've ever asked me.

2040
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,845
Lieutenant, we got the point.
Check your package!

2041
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:34,527
See, when Washington sees a good
looking woman point at his hot bottom...

2042
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,931
he checks his package.

2043
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,321
That shot was like
a good looking woman.

2044
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,323
A thing of beauty,
so he checked his package.

2045
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,482
Checked his package.

2046
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:46,930
Washington checks his package.
The boys check their packages.

2047
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,169
And I'm checking my package.
Now you little white face...

2048
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:52,447
disloyal fuck,
are you checking your package?

2049
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,931
Or do you have a package?

2050
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:59,327
I want to talk to General Sloan.
Bring me to General Sloan!

2051
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,922
Well, Colonel, I think we'll find him
right over here in the grand stand.

2052
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,723
Dragons, 1.

2053
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,051
Let's go, Muthuhs!
Let's hear it for the Muthuhs!

2054
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:10,645
Hooray for the Muthuhs!

2055
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,324
A little Buddha, huh?

2056
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,529
You rub his belly, you say,
for good luck?

2057
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,406
All right.

2058
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:33,847
Everybody, listen up!
Gather around, listen up!

2059
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,923
All right, now, Gen. Sloan...

2060
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,243
is so proud the way the Muthuhs
played the first half...

2061
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,800
that he's gone ahead and arranged
the exhibition tour and the first stop...

2062
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,167
- is Saigon.
- All right!

2063
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:48,451
After that it's Bangkok
and then Tokyo!

2064
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,245
All right, that's what I'm
talking about, Tokyo.

2065
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:55,041
Now, there's only one small change
in plans: We're not supposed to win.

2066
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:58,086
- What are you talking about?
- What the hell does that mean?!

2067
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,650
We throw the goddamn game?!

2068
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:02,610
Now, you just wait a minute.
There's another way of looking at this.

2069
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:06,890
Now, the Vietnamese go for winners.
And right now they happen to think...

2070
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,008
-that that's the Vietcong.
That's a crock of shit.

2071
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:12,602
Now, it's our responsibility to build up
their confidence in their government...

2072
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,364
and their army
and their athletic teams.

2073
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:17,444
- So we go around losing.
- That is a wrong way to look at it!

2074
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,124
They go around winning!

2075
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,202
Now, what's good
for the Allies is good for us.

2076
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,204
I know this is not easy
because we're Marines.

2077
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,566
But this is a question of priorities.

2078
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,850
Now if you're gonna disappoint
the General by beating them...

2079
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:31,002
then we will rejoin the battalion.

2080
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,526
And they're being called up
to an area called Khe Sanh.

2081
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,841
- Khe Sanh? Where the fuck is it?
- I heard about it.

2082
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,729
- What about it?
- It's a meat grinder.

2083
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,847
A meat grinder?

2084
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:41,367
All right.

2085
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,681
Now we got a job to do.
We gotta be out of here by 4:00.

2086
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,684
That's all the time the General has.
Let's go.

2087
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,007
Go!

2088
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,920
Who gives a shit who kicks
the little ball into the net more times?

2089
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,321
Come on, are you playing?

2090
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,006
Come on.

2091
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:14,888
If he's playing, I'm playing.
Let's go.

2092
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:25,441
Weren't you the man that said...

2093
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,609
...that getting your guys out
in one piece...

2094
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,488
...that's all that counts?

2095
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,731
Washington...

2096
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,490
You gotta do what's right for you.

2097
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,160
Me?

2098
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:45,366
Man, do you really believe
that I'm doing this for me?

2099
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,368
I never lost at anything
in my goddamn life.

2100
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,601
Don't fall down!
You're making it look too obvious!

2101
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,925
Oh, Jesus! You're making it
look too easy!

2102
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:26,802
Come on. Make them work for it!
Make it look that way!

2103
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,881
I tell you what, I'm gonna give them
one more, you hear me?

2104
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,611
- Make it 4:3 and we hold it.
- That's good enough for me.

2105
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,367
The Dragons have tied it up
at 3:3.

2106
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,523
Send my compliments to Cpt. Collins
for doing a beautiful job.

2107
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:56,291
All right, that's more like it.
That is more like it.

2108
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:57,361
All right, listen, Pike!

2109
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:01,967
It's gorgeous, fine. Everything
just fine, don't worry about it.

2110
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,008
They're gonna make one more goal.
2 would be great...

2111
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:06,686
- 3 would be the best we could get.
- Like hell I am.

2112
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,249
Wait a minute, Pike. I don't want you
to make this into a personal problem.

2113
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,527
You get that?
No personal problems.

2114
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,205
Alvin, get me some water.

2115
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,441
Shit, man, the Dragons is...

2116
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,045
- his fucking team.
- Who?

2117
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:22,011
That's the son of a bitch who killed
the kid I was playing ball with!

2118
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,724
Doping kids.

2119
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:28,409
- Look man, don't do nothing stupid.
- Stupid?

2120
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,967
If winning this game is good for him,
how can it be good for us?

2121
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,010
I know, I know, I know. Let's just
lose this game and go home.

2122
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:37,323
Dammit, man, I'm a dumb ass, right?
I'm a dumb ass.

2123
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:40,882
I've done some stupid things since I've
been here. I was scared shitless.

2124
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,048
The pills and all that man, I know.

2125
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,361
But I ain't never in my life done
something I'd be this ashamed of.

2126
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:48,125
Every guy in Nam is listening
to us, man, on the radio.

2127
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,567
- Gettin' out ass whupped every game?
- Hey, man...

2128
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:52,847
I know how you feel. OK?

2129
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:56,283
- I don't wanna lose.
- Damn, its hard man.

2130
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:57,885
I know it's hard.

2131
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,082
But what you gonna do?
You want us to die?

2132
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:03,721
You want to lose people in the fucking
war, or do you wanna lose the game?

2133
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:06,201
Just lose the game, OK?
It's OK.

2134
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,048
- Goddamit, it's hard, man!
- I know.

2135
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,484
We lose the game.

2136
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,841
I heard about teamwork,
but his is ridiculous, right?

2137
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,365
- Come on.
- OK.

2138
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,965
- Think of your baby, OK?
- All right.

2139
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,849
Think of your baby,
you're already a winner.

2140
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,843
- Let's lose!
- All right!

2141
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,364
All right. Let's lose this game then.

2142
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,446
All right, now they got the lead,
let's give them some insurance.

2143
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,529
Hey, look at that!
They're making fools of us.

2144
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,447
You think you got us whipped?
Come on, you little yellow piss-ants!

2145
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,762
Pike!

2146
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:43,807
Jesus!

2147
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,166
What is he doing?

2148
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:49,641
Little bastard!
How many times I've gotta tell ya?!

2149
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:50,568
Pike!

2150
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:00,687
You see that?! You beat that!
You piss-ants!

2151
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,246
All right, all right!
Coolidge, you get ready to play!

2152
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,321
Pike, you've had it!

2153
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:07,323
Major, get the General!

2154
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,727
He seems to have
forgotten something!

2155
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:13,411
Wait, Coach Collins,
is substituting for Pike.

2156
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:16,131
The Muthuhs will have to go ahead,
without their star player...

2157
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:19,090
You beautiful, disloyal fuck.

2158
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:21,362
Just couldn't resist it,
could you, twinkle toes?

2159
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:24,205
Well you just pulled a hamstring and
you're on your way to Khe Sanh.

2160
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,044
- Just fine!
- How do you like that?!

2161
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,691
And the rest of you, you wanna play like
Pike again, you can join him there too!

2162
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,764
You know a tie was not in the deal.
The Dragon need another goal...

2163
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,922
let's go and give it to them!
And, Washington...

2164
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,241
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

2165
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:38,964
Hey, Captain, how much
you got put in the game?

2166
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,540
- We don't wanna blow the point spread.
- Are you taking him out?

2167
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:44,166
Just 'cause he's the only guy
in this team with some principles?!

2168
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:46,641
- Fuck him! That's why I hate that guy.
- You idiot!

2169
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,166
Why don't we just make the goals
for them? It's easier.

2170
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:51,208
You really liked it
when he made that score.

2171
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,406
You're fucking right!

2172
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:55,211
I felt really good. How about you?
You're gonna bullshit everybody here...

2173
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,807
telling them you didn't dig it?
We can kick their ass like that!

2174
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,202
Tell everybody here, you big fucking
tree trunk, how you feel?

2175
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:05,801
You know, I had you guys
all pegged wrong.

2176
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,484
You're not smart enough
to be fools and fuck-ups!

2177
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:13,127
But you're just about dumb enough
to try and be fucking heroes.

2178
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,202
Okay, we can look at it this way.

2179
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:19,928
Uncle Sam is paying us a 137 bucks
a month, to kick some ass. Right?

2180
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,005
- Huh?!
- Yeah.

2181
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,606
OK.

2182
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,488
- Let's kick some ass!
- Yeah!

2183
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,407
It's coming down to the wire. The team
that scores next will be the champs!

2184
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,091
Jesus, Bisbee, let it go in!
Goddamit!

2185
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:38,721
Bisbee saves, the Muthuhs have
the ball, with only 20 seconds to play!

2186
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,486
Wait a minute.

2187
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,410
Oh, Christ, almighty!

2188
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,481
- Come on, that's it!
- Do it, Washington, baby!

2189
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:53,686
Come on, do it.

2190
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,361
Yeah!

2191
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,521
Washington!
[foreign language]

2192
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,206
Missy, Koi, did you see that?
I'll be right back! I'll be right back!

2193
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,131
That's our man there!

[machine-gun fire]

2195
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,128
Just listen to that fireworks.

2196
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,884
Fireworks, hell! It's incoming!

2197

Incoming!
Move, move, move!

2198

All officer's into the air raid
shelter, now! Go, go!

2199
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:32,728
Protect Colonel Trang!
Form a human shield!

2200
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,645
Grab someone!
Protect Colonel Trang!

2201
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:38,405
Don't let him die!
Form a human shield!

Squad leaders,
get your people weapons.

2204
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:45,891
There's one on that roof top!
And another over there!

2205
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,446
- Hey, you seen Missy and Koi?
- No, man.

2206
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,249
Look, we can't find anybody
in this mess!

2207
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,486
I ain't seen nobody.

2208
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:54,251
- Hey there, man!
- I can't find them!

Get away from Col. Trang!
Get away, or I'll shoot!

On the building.

Collins, goddamit, stop running!

2223
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:30,322
I gave you an order, goddamn it!
Now go and do it!

2224
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,807
You're trying to save our own ass
by selling us out!

2225
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,604
Now you're gonna go into
that goddamned hole?!

2226
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:37,809
I gave all of you a chance to save
yourselves! What more can I do?!

2227
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:39,610
You can fight.
Stay with your men!

And that bastard did it!

Doctor said, before he died he wanted
somebody tell his Mama what happened.

2239
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,163
And how he couldn't have
done all this in Canada.

2240
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,801
I don't get it, what did he mean?

2241
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:38,006
No matter what he meant,
the man's dead.

2242
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,850
Come on, keep writing now.

2243

Get everything down,
don't leave nothing out.

You're gonna get it published too, you
got Vinnie Fazio's personal guarantee.

What are you writing
in my book right now?

- See that ambulance over there?
- Yup.

2247

You're getting on it, you get to a
hospital... and you just disappear.

I told you once and I meant it.

I ain't gonna do nothing
I'm gonna be ashamed of.

2250

I'm gonna tell you
what you got to be ashamed of.

02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,447
You're gonna have a little bastard
running around calling...

2252
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:13,690
somebody else "daddy". Now that's
what you've got to be ashamed of.

2253
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,008
- Gunny!
- Uh-uh.

2254
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:17,924
- Gunny!
- Tyrone...

2255
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:20,971
We got a man here with brain damage,
he's got a concussion.

2256
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:23,765
- And he won't go to a hospital.
- That's cute, man, that's real cute.

2257
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,484
You leave me no other choice.

2258
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,568
I just gotta tell them there ain't
nothing wrong with me.

2259
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:29,728
Nobody listens to a man
with brain damage.

2260
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,605
I can't use no man
with a bruised brain.

2261
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:34,884
Now get on the ambulance...

2262
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,283
disloyal fuck.

2263
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,130
- You got it?
- Yes, sir!

2264
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:44,642
You big lummox.

2265
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,647
Now you don't deserve this.
You son-of-a-bitch.

2266
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:57,687
Now you take care of it.

2267
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:01,362
You take care of it, too.

2268
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:13,320
Old country ass boy.

2269
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,841
- Hey, Vinnie, what's his name?
- You're not gonna believe this...

2270
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:18,042
the guy's name is Hung.
What kind of a name is Hung?

2271
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:20,891
We'll name him Tony, something
like that. You put that down there.

2272
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,407
"Hung is now Tony."
You listen to this one, are you ready?

2273
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:28,087
Hey, I think there's a grenade down!
Get those kids out of the way!

2274
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:29,565
[explosion]

2275
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:34,161
Al, are you all right?
Al?

2276
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:36,891
Al?

2277
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,406
Alvin!

2278
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,167
What did you do to yourself, Alvin?

2279
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:45,602
Oh, Alvin, no, no, no!

2280
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:47,006
God...

2281
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:52,920
Oh, no!

2282
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:56,762
Oh, god...

2283
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,084
Oh, no!

2284
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:13,130
Please.

2285
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:16,405
Vinnie, you're gonna go
with Washington now.

2286
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:19,046
Wh're gonna round up our people,
and wh're moving out.

2287
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:21,401
You're still alive, you hear me?

2288
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:24,685
All right...

2289
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:26,762
Bring him along, Tyrone.

2290
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,681
- Gunny!
- Yes, Sir?

2291
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:32,128
Get our goddamn people together,
we're moving out!

2292
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,247
Yes, sir.

2293
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:37,968
Oh, please, don't let them see me.
Please don't.

2294
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:41,647
Boy, you're a man. You can cry
any goddamn time, you get ready.

2295
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,366
January 30, 1968.

2296
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:47,689
I don't know why I should even bother
to write in this journal anymore.

2297
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:51,566
Because after what happened today,
who the hell is ever gonna believe it.

2298
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:54,809
We actually had a chance
to get out of this goddamn war.

2299
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,890
All we had to do is
throw the game and walk away.

2300
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,129
But for some reason we just
couldn't. For some reason...

2301
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:05,643
winning that stupid game was
more important than saving our ass.

2302
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:10,607
So I guess we just keep on walking
into one bloody mess after another...

2303
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:13,803
until somebody finally figures out
that living...

2304
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:16,685
has got to be more
important than winning.

2305
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,326
Left right, right and left.

2306
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:22,371
