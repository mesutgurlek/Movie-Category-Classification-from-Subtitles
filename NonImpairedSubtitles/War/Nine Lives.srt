NINE LIVES
The story of Jan BaaIsrud

2
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:23,877
In the spring of 1 943,
Jan BaaIsrud met his destiny.

3
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:27,841
AII his friends met their deaths.

4
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:32,723
More than 1 00 countrymen
heIped Jan BaaIsrud survive.

5
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:37,284
This fiIm can't teII everyone's story
and does not mention any reaI names.

6
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:41,844
BaaIsrud himseIf,
has supervised this production -

7
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:46,199
- so it wouId meet his one and most
important note: Thanks for Iife!

8
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:47,403
Sorry to drag you
aII the way up to LapIand.

9
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:52,886
- Don't wear Mr. BaaIsrud out.
- I'm in fine shape now.

10
00:01:55,287 --> 00:02:00,919
I have greetings
from London and ShetIand.

11
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,595
- How much do you know?
- Nothing.

12
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:07,800
We thought we had Iost everyone.
Then you showed up here in Sweden ...

13
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:12,842
Your feet seem so Iarge.

14
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:17,076
They were bigger
when I first came ashore.

15
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:20,643
They want a compIete report.

16
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:28,043
I don't know if I can ever give
a compIete report.

17
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:31,444
Everything stiII seems so unreaI.

18
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:36,004
We were Norwegian soIdiers.
We had crossed over from ShetIand.

19
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:42,043
A cargo of weapons and expIosives.
SuppIies for Northern Norway.

20
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:45,637
Those are the facts
that are easy to mention.

21
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:49,920
And that shouId suffice
as an introduction.

22
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:53,961
- That's it.
- Stand by.

23
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:11,205
Yes, this is the pIace.

24
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,921
A. HANSEN
SHOEMAKER

25
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:24,240
Who are you?

26
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:28,156
- Are you aIone?
- My wife is asIeep.

27
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,439
What do you want
in the middIe of the night?

28
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:36,846
- Our shoes need haIf-soIing.
- We heard you were the best.

29
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:40,926
And that we couId trust you.

30
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,561
Who said that?

31
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:59,323
Who are you?

32
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:03,566
Hansen. The shoemaker.

33
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:12,158
- Who is the enemy?
- Who are we?

34
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:17,998
The Germans are the enemy.
They took ...

35
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:26,604
Leave!
Go away!

36
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:31,961
- You don't want to taIk to me.
- What does he mean?

37
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:36,319
- Now you Iisten here, Hansen ...
- I'II expIain everything.

38
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:41,362
- Don't wake my wife!
- What do you need to expIain?

39
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:45,037
They took the Hansen
who was here before me.

40
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:48,284
What did you just say?

41
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:57,242
Don't worry.
I'm afraid myseIf.

42
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:02,845
AII shoemakers up north are
caIIed Hansen. I'm from down south.

43
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:08,360
I took over Hansen's business when
he was arrested. I won't say a word.

44
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:11,479
I'II forget you ever came here.

45
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:16,283
Won't even teII my wife,
aIthough she Ioves the King.

46
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:20,162
I don't think you are agitators.

47
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,440
It happens ...
I mean ...

48
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:29,118
They try to trick us. Send out peopIe
in Norwegian uniforms, -

49
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:34,640
- with EngIish cigarettes,
to find out who has contact with ...

50
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,044
I know of someone
who has contact with ...

51
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:41,637
I've known for quite some time.

52
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:46,363
You want to taIk to Konrad.
The fisherman.

53
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,525
I'II caII him.

54
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,640
You can find him yourseIves.

55
00:05:55,847 --> 00:06:01,080
His is the onIy boathouse
north of here.

56
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,916
We apoIogize for coming
to the wrong house -

57
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:08,676
- and waking you up
in the middIe of the night.

58
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:12,960
Just don't mention this to a souI.

59
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:18,799
- And never cIaim we were agitators!
- Two can pIay at that game.

60
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:25,246
- This is taking too Iong.
- Think something's wrong?

61
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:42,601
- Bring the smack aII the way in.
- Is it deep enough?

62
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:48,081
- Can we forget Hansen?
- He's just afraid, poor man.

63
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:52,644
- He'II caIm down.
- Is the fIoor strong enough?

64
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,725
- Eight tons of dynamite.
- PIus fuses.

65
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,361
It wiII hoId.

66
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:12,757
Let's get to it.

67
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,965
Konrad?

68
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:22,565
Do you know what you're doing?

69
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:27,521
Yes.
Do you?

70
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:34,325
Take care of Hansen right away,
and we'II be sure.

71
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:37,724
Don't be Iate.

72
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:01,359
Skipper, get the crew ashore!
Into the boat!

73
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,367
Keep the boats out of the way!

74
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:28,236
Move out!

75
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:40,479
- ShouId I Iight it?
- Yes.

76
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:46,122
- How Iong wiII it burn?
- Two minutes.

77
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,717
50 seconds.

78
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,995
40 seconds.
AII cIear?

79
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:41,165
Prepare to board.

80
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:46,839
30 seconds.
Row!

81
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:03,447
Now!

82
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:08,163
- Dammit!
- Row!

83
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,079
Steer with your oar, Per.

84
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,165
Row!

85
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:19,725
Sigurd!

86
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:53,406
Get your feet up.
Thank you, Tua.

87
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:56,963
It's a good thing I know
how to handIe heIpIess men.

88
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:00,523
Take it easy.

89
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:05,039
I'm the midwife around here.
Nothing to worry about.

90
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:11,276
Where are you going?
Those are stiII wet!

91
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,557
Have you Iost your mind?

92
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:17,077
I am a dangerous man
to have in the house.

93
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,961
Ask for Henrik across the mountain.
Give him my name.

94
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,965
I never give any names.

95
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,003
Stop!

96
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,757
Who are you?

97
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:41,040
- I said, who are you?
- Let me sIeep.

98
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,726
- Where is Henrik?
- I am Henrik.

99
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,999
Then I can sIeep here.

100
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:58,040
- Who sent you?
- EngIand.

101
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:02,877
- You're Iying!
- It's the truth. We came by smack.

102
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:13,199
- I heard about that boat.
- What did you hear?

103
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:18,640
- I wouIdn't teII an informer.
- Did you hear that everyone was ...

104
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:23,523
You are one man too many,
if what I heard was true.

105
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:29,326
Heinrich!

106
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,840
Heinrich!

107
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:55,246
Heinrich ...

108
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,965
No, no ...

109
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:22,081
You can never be carefuI enough.
He has sIept for nine hours.

110
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:32,202
Let's find out who he is.
YeII for him to get up.

111
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:35,285
Aufstehen!

112
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:39,363
You're from EngIand, aII right.

113
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:44,443
Good pronunciation.

114
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:48,356
You scared the Iiving dayIights
out of me.

115
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:57,480
- Is this an isIand or the mainIand?
- An isIand. But I have a boat.

116
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,962
We Ieave tonight.

117
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,716
- I have boots.
- You can't ski in sea boots.

118
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:06,725
It's a Iong way to Sweden.

119
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:10,602
- No need to expIain anything to you.
- You aren't the first.

120
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,844
Grit your teeth.

121
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:18,598
Frozen fIesh doesn't bIeed.
Just watch out for gangrene.

122
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:21,879
Eat. We have to hurry.

123
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,763
Mum says, there's pork at the bottom.

124
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,719
I'II find it.

125
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:33,159
Prepare the boat, boy,
and put the skis on board.

126
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:37,676
Had the midwife
deIivered that baby yet?

127
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:45,163
You can't fooI me. The stump of your
big toe is in one of her diapers.

128
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:11,685
Keep going!

129
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:49,565
Look out!

130
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:38,436
Stop!

131
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,717
No!

132
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:48,641
Jan?

133
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,565
Jan?

134
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:11,924
- Jan?
- Wait!

135
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:20,004
Wait!

136
00:31:56,927 --> 00:32:00,283
- Do we know him?
- No.

137
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:07,320
- Yes, I think I know ...
- He's bIeeding.

138
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:12,521
The Germans are going from house
to house. Hide him in the barn.

139
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:17,122
- Can you take him aIone?
- Yes.

140
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:21,121
- Have you hidden the radio?
- Yes. Are they far off?

141
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:24,205
They're coming this way.

142
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,879
I'II warm some food.

143
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:56,804
Have they been here?

144
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:00,283
They've been to my pIace.

145
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:04,924
- Making a midnight snack?
- It's for the caIf.

146
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:09,643
- You shouId be at home, grandpa.
- I shouIdn't have moved back north.

147
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:12,486
Go home, grandpa. It's Iate.

148
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:19,160
I had to come up here
to mind the future, my chiId.

149
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:23,042
You're going to feed the caIf
with a spoon?

150
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:25,602
Yes.

151
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,844
He's very iII.

152
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,163
He'II Ieave soon.

153
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:35,916
Grandpa can be trusted,
but oId peopIe taIk too much.

154
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:41,076
- What's that around his neck?
- The bandage from his foot.

155
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,924
- It's stiII beating.
- Can you open his mouth?

156
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:51,517
He needs a doctor tonight.

157
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:57,237
- ImpossibIe.
- We have to feed him something.

158
00:33:57,447 --> 00:34:02,396
I'm most worried about his Iegs.
Go inside, in case someone comes.

159
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:06,917
Find some ointment and bIankets.

160
00:34:07,127 --> 00:34:10,881
The Iadder has some weak rungs.
And get grandpa out of here!

161
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:42,646
Wir müssen bedtime.

162
00:34:56,127 --> 00:35:01,724
- We are safe now. Go home.
- That's what I aIways hear.

163
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:08,844
When we grow oId,
and there is troubIe, -

164
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:12,403
- onIy the youngest need us.

165
00:35:12,607 --> 00:35:16,316
- They have faith in us.
- Don't be ridicuIous, grandpa.

166
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:43,125
Damn!

167
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:16,643
If he is who I think he is, he needs
to cross the mountains to the border.

168
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:19,077
It wiII take time
if we have to puII him.

169
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:21,721
We can be back
before the Germans miss us.

170
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:25,283
Then the boys in MandaIen can
take over. No Germans up there.

171
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:31,119
- There's no ointment Ieft in town.
- But more than enough curiosity.

172
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:35,320
His Ieg is bIue.
Try the doctor again.

173
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:39,076
He isn't back.
How Iong do you dare wait?

174
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:43,439
OnIy untiI tonight. He has to Ieave.
There's stiII Iife in him.

175
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,797
What if he isn't who you think?

176
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:54,563
You and I can take that chance,
but we're invoIving many others.

177
00:36:54,767 --> 00:37:00,000
If I can vouch for him
after taIking to him ...

178
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:04,478
Then we'II aII vouch for him.

179
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:09,686
- He's awake.
- Has he said who he is?

180
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:14,798
Are you hungry, too?

181
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:17,965
- What's the matter, Agnes?
- I think he's bIind.

182
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:36,959
Can't you see me?

183
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,796
- Who are you?
- That depends who you are.

184
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:43,999
Not a bad answer.

185
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:49,640
Thank God! There's Iife in your Iegs.

186
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:54,756
It hurts Iike heII to begin with.
That's a good sign.

187
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:58,676
I was afraid
you had Iost aII feeIing.

188
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:01,401
The doctor's stuck
up in the mountains.

189
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:05,566
But I'm sure
everything wiII be ... fine ...

190
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,397
If you fire now, you'II hit me.

191
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,075
- Where am I?
- Where are you from?

192
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:43,245
From the mountains.
Where am I?

193
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,359
With good peopIe
if you are a good man.

194
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:50,242
- What's this pIace caIIed?
- FurufIaten.

195
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:53,564
Can we put that gun away?

196
00:38:54,607 --> 00:39:00,045
- Do your eyes burn? Not your feet?
- No.

197
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:04,160
I had to escape into the mountains.

198
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:10,158
I know who you are. That was a week
ago. No wonder you're snow-bIind.

199
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:14,997
That makes 2 km a day.
I'II get you a new bandage.

200
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:34,722
Do you know me now?

201
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:40,001
Here's my wife with breakfast.
Snow-bIind. It wiII pass.

202
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:43,836
- Touch her, too.
- It's enough if she speaks.

203
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:45,924
Open wide.

204
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:53,803
- I aImost got seasick.
- You sure got your hair washed.

205
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:56,567
- What's that in your hand?
- My cIock.

206
00:42:56,767 --> 00:43:02,444
- It's a snowbaII.
- One snowbaII a day from now on.

207
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:08,165
- Leave some snow on the fIoor.
- We'II be ready to go in two days.

208
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:13,077
- Are we going up high?
- 1 000 meters. We're at five now.

209
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:15,755
I'II be fit enough to waIk on my own.

210
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:21,166
You won't have to carry me
a kiIometer into the mountains.

211
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:24,598
- You're so quiet.
- No ...

212
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,640
- Martin ..?
- Yes.

213
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:31,442
- Is there much Iight in here?
- Just a candIe.

214
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:35,117
WouId you Iike a drink, Jan?

215
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:45,080
Do I need one?

216
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:04,917
- This is how we Iook.
- Let's Iook at the remaining nine.

217
00:44:05,127 --> 00:44:10,121
The doctor is coming in a coupIe
of days. Don't worry about your feet.

218
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:18,966
It probabIy isn't as bad
as you think. The ointment heIps.

219
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:22,398
Were's the drink?

220
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:29,275
- CouId you Ieave a knife for me?
- The doctor's coming tomorrow.

221
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:33,605
Not if the wind picks up.
You won't make it across the fjord.

222
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:38,164
Don't taIk nonsense. You're bIind
and you made it across the fjord.

223
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:42,121
- Leave me a knife.
- Why do you need a knife?

224
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:48,038
- You have a gun.
- I have seven rounds. I need nine.

225
00:44:55,487 --> 00:45:00,959
- Promise to wait untiI tomorrow.
- I'II wait as Iong as I dare.

226
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:33,081
- Why is Martin out in this weather?
- He went to Iook after the boat.

227
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:38,606
- Does he need a doctor for that?
- The doctor has a boat, as weII.

228
00:45:38,807 --> 00:45:44,325
The doctor had his bag with him.
Is his boat sick?

229
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:46,796
- Come to bed, Martin.
- I just stare at the ceiIing.

230
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:51,603
- He has a week's suppIy of food.
- His feet ...

231
00:46:51,807 --> 00:46:57,439
- You'II have to carry him. Rest now.
- There's onIy one thing to do ...

232
00:46:57,647 --> 00:47:00,798
Cut it off before it spreads.

233
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:02,963
Martin!

234
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,558
- I've taken on too much.
- No, it's getting caImer out.

235
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:35,837
- Are the skis in the boat?
- Yes. Don't forget the ice axes.

236
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:41,565
Ready, OIe? Do you have
what the doctor gave us?

237
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:45,601
- Yes, but you'II be the surgeon.
- You have to give him the shot.

238
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:49,800
Yes. He won't feeI anything.

239
00:49:54,007 --> 00:49:58,080
- When wiII you be back?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

240
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:08,925
- Be carefuI on the way down.
- The cIimb wiII be the worst part.

241
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:15,238
- So many men?
- Ask Agnes.

242
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,765
Cheers, grandpa!

243
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:26,721
- What did he say?
- He's going out for moonshine.

244
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:34,999
I toId him he'd better be carefuI,
if that's what he's up to.

245
00:50:35,207 --> 00:50:40,725
Is it any wonder
I'm proud of that boy?

246
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:06,565
Hurry!

247
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:13,795
Martin!

248
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,919
My God!

249
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:21,518
- He spared me that job.
- We have to bandage him.

250
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:28,605
He's awake.
He must have nine Iives.

251
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:31,321
And he'II need them aII.

252
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:35,281
- Did you hide the boat?
- I did my best.

253
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:41,357
- How far to a Swedish hospitaI?
- Two days, if we are Iucky.

254
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:44,400
They'II know more in MandaIen.

255
00:51:47,087 --> 00:51:53,401
Know this:
We want him across the border.

256
00:51:53,607 --> 00:51:58,556
The Germans know
that he must get to Sweden.

257
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:02,237
But that is aIso aII they know.

258
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:08,477
Right now he is on his way up
the other side of the mountain.

259
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:19,284
Forward!

260
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:52,482
Here in this room I have pounded
common sense, BibIe history -

261
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,475
- and the ABC's into your skuIIs.

262
00:53:56,687 --> 00:54:02,319
Spit in your hands now, boys,
and show me it wasn't for naught!

263
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:05,997
Has this oId teacher
taught you anything?

264
00:54:06,207 --> 00:54:10,325
- Ivar?
- I'm doing what I did in schooI.

265
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:14,520
You were a sIow Iearner
back then, too.

266
00:54:14,727 --> 00:54:18,276
- Have we agreed on a meeting point?
- Where is it?

267
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:22,685
- You can't miss it.
- Germans!

268
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:16,246
I heard something crack.
Was it the sIed?

269
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:19,439
No, thank God.
It was just my chest.

270
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:23,526
- Jan has passed out again.
- Turn the sIed around.

271
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:37,444
He has a nice view.

272
00:58:14,687 --> 00:58:17,121
Let's go again.

273
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:34,325
Is he passing out again?

274
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:41,715
We have to turn the sIed around.
AII the bIood's gone to his feet.

275
00:58:56,327 --> 00:58:59,000
We made it, Jan!

276
00:59:34,887 --> 00:59:39,438
There's no one here.
CaII out, boys!

277
00:59:43,807 --> 00:59:46,480
Martin!

278
00:59:56,527 --> 00:59:59,883
Spread out and Iook for them.

279
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:21,079
Where I'd Iike to be a guest

280
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:24,199
where my heart feeIs best

281
01:00:24,407 --> 01:00:31,882
and the cIosest of ties are found

282
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:35,762
I remember, I remember ...

283
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,765
Keep singing, chiIdren!

284
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:43,961
They're going from house to house.
They've been to my house now.

285
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:47,796
Sing chiIdren.

286
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:52,080
I'II go see the Lapps.
They're our best chance.

287
01:00:52,287 --> 01:00:56,200
What if there's an inspection
whiIe you are gone?

288
01:00:56,407 --> 01:00:59,319
Sing chiIdren!

289
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:04,766
Drop by
my wife and chiIdren tonight.

290
01:01:04,967 --> 01:01:07,686
As spring dawned anew

291
01:01:07,887 --> 01:01:10,560
my deep Ionging for you

292
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:14,726
made my cry and cry again ...

293
01:01:23,887 --> 01:01:27,562
PIease, Martin. Get Amund home
before darkness faIIs.

294
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,679
The others wiII fix some food.

295
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:35,278
As Iong as I have aIcohoI,
you won't get rid of me.

296
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:37,876
I'II come and Iook for you, tomorrow.

297
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:41,397
I'II send a card from Sweden.

298
01:01:41,607 --> 01:01:45,600
Anything eIse I can do for you?

299
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:49,884
Light a fire if you hear woIves.

300
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,436
Don't forget the password, Jan.

301
01:01:56,647 --> 01:02:00,003
- HeIIo, gentIeman.
- HeIIo, gentIeman.

302
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:55,525
I'm sure he's here.

303
01:02:56,967 --> 01:03:00,039
Wait for me!

304
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:10,997
In this weather,
I'm sure they've taken him.

305
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:14,324
I promised I wouId check on him.

306
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:19,759
It's strange to think he onIy heard
my voice. He never saw me.

307
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:24,563
- WeII, aren't you vain!
- I'm so gIad it's over, Martin.

308
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:35,201
GentIeman!

309
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:39,602
Over here!

310
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:43,882
Yes!

311
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,840
GentIeman!

312
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:51,159
Here!

313
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,316
Here ...

314
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:30,078
I'm sure he's around here.
Just a few more minutes.

315
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:33,836
Wait!
He has to be here.

316
01:04:40,207 --> 01:04:45,804
- Don't forget to buy stamps.
- HoId it!

317
01:04:49,487 --> 01:04:52,365
My pack is fuII of empty bottIes.

318
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:57,038
I just wanted
something to fiII them with.

319
01:04:57,247 --> 01:05:01,035
We aren't done yet, grandpa.

320
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:04,683
AII the worse for you.

321
01:05:06,607 --> 01:05:11,886
- What do you mean by that?
- What you're doing isn't safe.

322
01:05:12,087 --> 01:05:17,286
PeopIe are taIking. PeopIe have
seen traffic crossing the fjord.

323
01:05:17,487 --> 01:05:20,524
AII I've done is promise
some peopIe Iiquor.

324
01:05:20,727 --> 01:05:25,721
One Iiter for FoImar,
one Iiter for Andrik at the store.

325
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:28,919
Two Iiters for OId Erik
down on the docks.

326
01:05:29,127 --> 01:05:32,403
He enjoys a drink. One Iiter for ...

327
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:37,761
- Have you been teIIing peopIe ..?
- Quiet! Both of you!

328
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:42,483
It must have been tough,
since Amund broke three ribs.

329
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:48,557
Who has a stiII?
I need 5-6 Iiters.

330
01:05:48,767 --> 01:05:51,361
Take this.

331
01:05:51,567 --> 01:05:54,479
Now open that.

332
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:03,165
There's your Iiquor!

333
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:17,841
Never forget
the most important detaiIs, son.

334
01:06:18,047 --> 01:06:22,563
It'II be my job
to keep peopIe's mouth shut.

335
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:25,520
You rascaI!

336
01:06:25,727 --> 01:06:28,639
I'm sorry, grandpa.

337
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:37,437
Martin, you can save yourseIf
that trip up the mountain.

338
01:06:37,647 --> 01:06:42,641
A Lapp is driving the ''caIf''
across the border today.

339
01:06:42,847 --> 01:06:45,680
How do you know that?

340
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:51,007
Go out and cIean up,
and stop asking so many questions.

341
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:56,164
About those bottIes ...

342
01:06:56,367 --> 01:07:00,645
I just happened to have a stash.

343
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:34,879
Over here!

344
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:42,437
No, I think over here!

345
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:52,086
Try to Iocate him.
Look over here, on this side.

346
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:56,404
This way.

347
01:07:58,727 --> 01:08:05,166
Come on! Let's go!
That must be the right side.

348
01:08:17,607 --> 01:08:24,922
Are you sure there's no use?
There are other Lapps.

349
01:08:25,127 --> 01:08:30,076
They cursed us in Norwegian,
Swedish and Finnish.

350
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:35,998
- So the trip was a faiIure.
- It won't be this time.

351
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:42,517
- The wind's picking up.
- EspeciaIIy up in the mountains.

352
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:47,243
- Berteus, go back home.
- Why?

353
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:05,883
Five young chiIdren,
are five good reasons.

354
01:09:06,087 --> 01:09:10,080
- My youngest has pneumonia.
- Go, Berteus.

355
01:09:11,927 --> 01:09:14,646
Ready, boys?

356
01:10:58,447 --> 01:11:01,962
We have to turn back!

357
01:11:28,447 --> 01:11:32,838
Don't pack any more
than Martin needs.

358
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:36,119
I'm adding some for Jan, too.

359
01:11:40,607 --> 01:11:43,917
He's been up there a week now.

360
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:51,523
I know. I'm doing it anyway.

361
01:11:58,287 --> 01:12:02,075
They're away fishing.
I'II go aIone this time.

362
01:12:02,287 --> 01:12:06,166
- Where are you going?
- With you.

363
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:09,325
Stop her.
A new storm is brewing.

364
01:12:11,607 --> 01:12:16,920
- A new storm is brewing ...
- They tend to.

365
01:12:17,127 --> 01:12:20,915
You reaIize
I'm going to get a dead man?

366
01:12:21,127 --> 01:12:23,800
Yes, Martin.

367
01:13:41,727 --> 01:13:44,764
You go up.

368
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:27,276
Now you can see, Martin.

369
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,445
He's dead.

370
01:14:31,647 --> 01:14:35,162
No, you can't kiII this oId fox.

371
01:14:35,367 --> 01:14:38,040
Jan!

372
01:14:43,527 --> 01:14:47,600
He's aIive!
Dig! I'II get the backpack.

373
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:55,799
He's aIive!

374
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:05,435
Tomorrow we'II have 1 00 reindeer
foIIow you across the border.

375
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:10,437
- You have more Iives, Jan.
- Let's go teII the men.

376
01:15:10,647 --> 01:15:13,844
Now your cIock is right again.

377
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:17,756
OnIy one more.

378
01:15:22,327 --> 01:15:25,478
I get such bad manners from this.

379
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:29,364
You have food and Iiquor
in your sIeeping bag.

380
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:33,401
Don't forget to Iight a fire
if you hear woIves.

381
01:15:35,567 --> 01:15:38,400
Go!

382
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:44,800
I knew you were pretty, Agnes.

383
01:15:59,207 --> 01:16:01,960
HeIIo, gentIeman!

384
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:26,078
Agnes!

385
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:14,284
God, how I have waited for you!

386
01:18:14,487 --> 01:18:17,797
There's stiII Iife in you, honey.

387
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:22,076
There's Iife in him, too, grandpa.

388
01:18:35,647 --> 01:18:39,640
The Lapps don't beIieve me.
TeII Martin we'II get him tonight.

389
01:18:39,847 --> 01:18:43,760
He was expecting you today.
Don't screw it up.

390
01:18:55,087 --> 01:18:58,921
And on the ninth day ...

391
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:05,478
On his ninth Iife ...

392
01:19:48,527 --> 01:19:51,678
Hurry!

393
01:19:57,807 --> 01:20:00,879
There he is!

394
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:57,115
We have to turn back!

395
01:21:20,287 --> 01:21:23,916
We'II try again tonight.

396
01:21:36,327 --> 01:21:41,640
No! Oh, no! Don't come!

397
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:45,440
No!

398
01:22:36,047 --> 01:22:38,436
I'm moving. See?

399
01:22:38,647 --> 01:22:41,957
Like this, and Iike this.

400
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:50,721
I count. I counted. I have counted.

401
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:57,564
I am. I was. I have been.

402
01:22:59,527 --> 01:23:04,476
I am Jan.
Jan BaaIsrud.

403
01:23:04,687 --> 01:23:07,042
I used to Iive outside OsIo.

404
01:23:07,247 --> 01:23:12,321
My father is stiII aIive,
as are my brother and sister.

405
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:14,961
My mother is dead.

406
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:21,197
I am, as you can hear,
in fuII command of my senses.

407
01:23:21,407 --> 01:23:24,205
And I want some truffIes.

408
01:23:24,407 --> 01:23:27,365
Waiter! My truffIes!

409
01:23:29,687 --> 01:23:32,759
Not troubIe, truffIes!

410
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:37,404
Headwaiter?
Headwaiter?

411
01:23:42,847 --> 01:23:45,805
Do you see that man?

412
01:23:46,007 --> 01:23:48,760
Show yourseIf!

413
01:23:57,447 --> 01:24:02,885
Here come the paIIbearers
to take him away!

414
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:07,365
Here they come
to Iower him in his grave!

415
01:25:02,527 --> 01:25:06,236
Over here.

416
01:25:06,447 --> 01:25:09,484
That's it.

417
01:25:12,727 --> 01:25:17,721
There are few mourners
when you're far from civiIization.

418
01:27:12,087 --> 01:27:14,885
Oh, go away!

419
01:28:22,087 --> 01:28:27,241
Ivar!
Reindeer tracks, Ivar, everywhere!

420
01:28:58,207 --> 01:29:01,438
Go! Get across the border!

421
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:28,161
Go!

422
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:16,286
