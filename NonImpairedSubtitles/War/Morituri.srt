1
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,016
No, it's not a sense of betrayal, sir.

2
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,354
l don't feel that.

3
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:28,319
But l was told l would have command
of our next blockade-runner.

4
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:33,024
l've seen myself on the bridge,
taking this ship...

5
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,864
from Japan into Bordeaux.

6
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:39,767
Do you know where l see myself?

7
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,906
ln Bremen, at home in bed with my wife.

8
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:48,406
-You have a wife, Kruse?
-No, sir.

9
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:52,713
Well, perhaps here in Tokyo
it's just as well.

10
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:56,447
Mr. Kruse, this cargo....

11
00:02:57,556 --> 00:02:59,956
God Almighty, how we need this cargo.

12
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:04,023
And Capt. Mueller
is a man of such experience.

13
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:05,857
Look here.

14
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:11,300
Tomorrow my experience puts me here,
on a fine new Japanese submarine.

15
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,864
l am to show our friends
the wolf-pack tactics we use...

16
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,807
to erase so much
Allied shipping in the Atlantic.

17
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:20,437
An assignment l do not cherish, you see.

18
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:23,309
l'm grateful for the way
you put it, Adm. Wendel.

19
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:27,715
The way l put it is that,
First Officer or Admiral, we do as ordered.

20
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:33,891
lncidentally, if everything goes
according to plan...

21
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,284
our paths may cross.

22
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:43,766
Sir, Capt. Mueller's here to see you.
And he's impatient.

23
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:47,430
lt's a bad morning. Nobody's satisfied.

24
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,574
Ask Capt. Mueller to come in.

25
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:53,839
Adm. Wendel, in the Merchant Navy,
the captain chooses his own crew.

26
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,774
What are you doing here?

27
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:59,281
l'll be damned if l'll ship with these.
Two murderers.

28
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,844
Two more, ''assault with deadly weapons.''

29
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:05,116
This one, ''theft of government property.''

30
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,420
Another, an outright political enemy.

31
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:09,985
lt's also a good way
to return these bastards...

32
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:12,029
to Germany for the punishment
they deserve.

33
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,121
l'm sorry, l cannot accept them.

34
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,757
But they're only a handful, Captain--

35
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,769
l don't want a handful of maggots
in my soup!

36
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:22,198
Now, we've given you
every reliable man we could find.

37
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,467
And must l remind you, Capt. Mueller,
that you can't afford to protest?

38
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:32,842
Mr. Kruse, would you leave
the two of us alone?

39
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,851
Stand right there, Mr. Kruse.

40
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:38,654
Adm. Wendel is about
to say that my last ship...

41
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:40,623
was torpedoed in the lndian Ocean.

42
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,559
-Well, that's common knowledge--
-But at the time of the attack...

43
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,152
l had a skinful of rum.

44
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:50,001
Capt. Mueller reports that he stood on
the bridge for three days...

45
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,535
with a festering jaw.

46
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,906
lt was lanced.
Drugs were administered. No avail.

47
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,473
Therefore, Capt. Mueller tried liquor.

48
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:00,841
lt is said to have afforded him some relief.

49
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,176
The torpedo didn't know
l had been drinking.

50
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:05,148
We cannot interview that torpedo!

51
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:08,516
Be satisfied that the Admiralty
retains confidence in you.

52
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:18,018
Believe me, Mueller, take the ship.
You'll save yourself a lot of consequences.

53
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:21,190
l can take any of your consequences.

54
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,398
l wasn't referring to you.

55
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,565
But you see at home,
they are inclined to believe...

56
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:30,368
that certain behavior runs in the family.

57
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,074
My son?

58
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:39,243
He's on duty in the North Sea area,
isn't he?

59
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:45,014
My son is a splendid officer.
One of the finest.

60
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:48,551
-They wouldn't.
-Yes, Mueller, they would.

61
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:51,021
They have.

62
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:07,977
The cargo, Mr. Crain,
is perhaps the single most important...

63
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,479
item in the world today.

64
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:14,143
-Col. Statter, would you like some tea?
-No, thank you.

65
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:17,710
-The cargo, Mr. Crain, is rubber.
-Rubber?

66
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:20,486
A ship called the Ingo will leave Tokyo...

67
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:23,959
carrying 7,000 tons of raw rubber.

68
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,721
7,000 tons of rubber, Mr. Crain...

69
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,769
will keep the entire
German army on wheels...

70
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,097
for at least three months.

71
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,911
-ls this music disturbing you?
-No.

72
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,971
Would you like
to hear the second movement?

73
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:45,310
No.

74
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:52,085
l'm glad you admire my painting.

75
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:55,421
l bought this Kirschner in Zurich.

76
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,657
Yeah, l paid too much for it,
but l couldn't resist it.

77
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:01,163
You come from Zurich, Mr. Crain?

78
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,361
Yes, my family lives there.

79
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:07,134
Mr. Crain...

80
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,035
you have no family.

81
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:12,772
You're a German, Herr Schroeder.

82
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:16,876
You've been living
in a British dominion here in lndia...

83
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:20,145
on a forged Swiss passport
for the last three years.

84
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:26,282
You were a reserve officer
in an engineer demolition battalion.

85
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,549
The day you received orders
to report for duty...

86
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,389
you turned your back on your country...

87
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:35,022
and managed to leave Germany
with most of your funds.

88
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:42,199
l'm not surprised, sir, that you found me.

89
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:46,900
-l'm only surprised that it took so long.
-Oh, but it didn't.

90
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,242
We've not had any need for you, until now.

91
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:56,381
What we're astonished at is that
you never gave your services to the Allies.

92
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:59,753
-But buried yourself out here.
-Buried myself?

93
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,551
l think l have here
all that l could possibly want.

94
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:09,557
l have my books and my music
and a modest art collection.

95
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:13,595
And a visit from a beautiful lady
from time to time.

96
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:17,436
And what l value most is my privacy.

97
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:21,340
Now let me save you some valuable time.

98
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:26,908
Col. Statter, l have no intention
of blowing up the ship.

99
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:31,613
We don't want you to blow up that ship.
lt's precisely what we don't want.

100
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,517
We want you to save that ship.

101
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:39,062
-To save it?
-Herr Schroeder...

102
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:42,360
as you know,
the Allies are desperately short of rubber.

103
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,527
As much as the Germans
want their cargo...

104
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:48,128
we want it more,
and we mean to capture it.

105
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:50,866
Yes. Well, why do you come to me?

106
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:56,773
German blockade-runners have orders
to scuttle at the approach of an enemy.

107
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:00,579
But if an engineer, a demolitions expert,
boards that ship...

108
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:03,246
and disarms all the scuttling charges...

109
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:08,890
when the captain goes to scuttle,
he's gonna be a very surprised captain.

110
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:14,130
And also surprised will be the engineer,
if he lives to a ripe, old age.

111
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:19,426
Obviously, there are ways in which
this adventure might not succeed.

112
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:21,801
Yeah, perhaps a 1,000, huh?

113
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,001
But if it does, the Allied governments
are gonna be very grateful indeed.

114
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,210
And if it fails?

115
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:31,881
The Germans would shoot him.

116
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:35,142
We would've preferred a professional,
of course.

117
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,452
But there wasn't a qualified man anywhere
near Tokyo to get him there in time.

118
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:40,684
Schroeder...

119
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:43,722
if we capture 7,000 tons of rubber...

120
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,987
it's gonna save thousands of lives
and shorten the war against Hitler.

121
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,394
Col. Statter...

122
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:54,501
besides from the obvious suicidal aspects
of your scheme...

123
00:09:55,507 --> 00:10:00,069
l personally don't believe that war is ever
a solution to political conflict.

124
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:02,142
What do wars ever prove?

125
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:04,978
Men, women, and children
are slaughtered...

126
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:06,983
and a generation later...

127
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:09,552
friends are enemies,
and enemies are friends...

128
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:12,987
and the whole stupid cycle
starts over again.

129
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:18,386
Certainly, l have great appreciation
for your noble effort...

130
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:21,932
and your interest
to save thousands of lives.

131
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:27,036
But excuse me if l seem
to be concerned for my own life.

132
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:31,231
lt's unfortunate you're rated so highly
by the Gestapo, Herr Schroeder.

133
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,909
Because l'm told their penalties
for deserters...

134
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:36,412
are somewhat more theatrical than ours.

135
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:41,952
No, they hold you under house arrest
until after the war is over and then...

136
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:45,581
they give you a fair trial,
as they do in England, l'm sure.

137
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,715
You realize you're my prisoner?

138
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:50,256
l can have you transported
back to England...

139
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:53,455
and parachute you out
of an RAF plane over Germany.

140
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,766
At the same time,
a valuable English officer...

141
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:00,436
held by the Germans,
will be dropped over England.

142
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:05,401
Exchange of hostages
is as old as war itself.

143
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:10,470
Perhaps blackmail is a little older, huh?

144
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:16,550
l thought the Holy British Empire
indulged in more modern ethics.

145
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:22,124
Some arrangements are being made
for you to board that ship in Tokyo.

146
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,923
But even if l am put aboard that ship,
it still might reach Germany.

147
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:27,259
That's right.

148
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,898
Or you may not be able to disarm
all the charges...

149
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,458
and the ship might be scuttled.

150
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:34,635
ln which case, you're likely to drown.

151
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,605
Or be rescued by the Germans
or by the Allies.

152
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:42,105
ln that event,
we'll still be able to make use of you.

153
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:47,274
Col. Statter, you are morally degenerate.

154
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,848
ln your case, l can't say
that l'm bothered by any moral nausea.

155
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,356
No, l'm afraid the success
of the mission is your only hope.

156
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:11,607
Couldn't you have found
a more obvious place in Calcutta?

157
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:15,134
-Like a public comfort station?
-What did you expect?

158
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:17,306
l'd hoped for something
a little more subtle.

159
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:19,680
Perhaps you'd prefer
one of our local brothels.

160
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:24,380
lt would've at least given me
some compensation for the inconvenience.

161
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:26,719
On the return trip, my dear fellow.

162
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,052
lf you return.

163
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,653
-Statter, you're a cold bastard.
-l was born on a chilly island.

164
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:47,809
Here are your personal effects:

165
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:51,638
a picture of your wife and family...

166
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:55,576
some German money...

167
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,088
a wedding ring...

168
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:04,554
book matches from your favorite bar
in Berlin...

169
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,328
more background, further instructions,
bits and pieces...

170
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,224
your dachshund.

171
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:16,566
Don't you have some sauerkraut
and knackwurst in there for me?

172
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:19,910
Your insignia.

173
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,770
Display it at all times.

174
00:13:23,214 --> 00:13:24,909
You are a standard leader.

175
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,946
A top rank member of the SS.

176
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,689
You're arrogant, rude, brutal, conceited...

177
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:38,020
which should not be difficult for you.

178
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:40,621
Perhaps you would like to hear me sing
the Horst WesseI song?

179
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,529
No, that won't be necessary.

180
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:46,899
This is a chart
used by German merchant ships...

181
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:50,236
the first 3,000 miles outside Tokyo.

182
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:52,799
We've learned the course of yours.

183
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,775
lf you place this pin...

184
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,243
at latitude 14 degrees North,
longitude 175 East...

185
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:02,948
as you see, it makes a circle.

186
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:07,990
Now, depending on winds and currents,
your ship will enter this area...

187
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:10,754
12 to 14 days out of Japan.

188
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:15,291
And within it, waiting for you...

189
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,929
will be units of the American Navy.

190
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:27,776
-What if my ship is delayed?
-Now that's a fair question.

191
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:31,806
Our friends will be able to wait
until the sixteenth day.

192
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:35,146
So you see,
you have a full 48 hours leeway.

193
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:38,012
How nice.

194
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,592
The code name for that area is
the ''Keil Circle.''

195
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:47,597
And for this operation,
you will be known as Keil.

196
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,156
Keil.

197
00:14:56,007 --> 00:15:00,444
How many scuttling charges are there
on the ship, and where are they located?

198
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:03,771
That's your riddle.
We can't be expected to know everything.

199
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,825
The crew believes this
to be a routine passage...

200
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:20,796
down the China Sea.

201
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:24,531
Yes, for a while, sir,
only the captain, you, and l...

202
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:26,830
are to be aware of our destination.

203
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:29,469
There are some of the reasons.

204
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:41,677
-You're whistling, sailor.
-Yes, sir, l like to whistle.

205
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:46,879
There's a superstition
about whistling on a ship.

206
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:49,585
-Beat it.
-l'm not on a ship yet.

207
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:53,530
Stay in character, Mr. Keil.

208
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:01,767
l am sorry but--

209
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:06,173
-Yeah. Best to enlighten them at the start.
-Correct, Standard Leader.

210
00:16:06,277 --> 00:16:08,336
Good-bye and good luck.

211
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,076
HeiI Hitler.

212
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:15,241
Mr. Keil...

213
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:19,015
good luck.

214
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:31,433
Hold your fire.
We'll jump ship in Hong Kong.

215
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:38,536
Dr. Ambach...

216
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:41,540
-injured man coming aboard.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:46,114
-Now, when do you leave us?
-At point seven.

218
00:16:46,217 --> 00:16:48,117
-Mr. Milkereit.
-Sir?

219
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:51,814
-After point seven, plot course 76.
-76, yes, sir.

220
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:52,947
All right.

221
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,291
Captain...

222
00:16:57,662 --> 00:17:00,256
l have the honor
to present Mr. Hans Keil...

223
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:03,994
of the Reich Security Agency,
Division 4E5, Far East Zone.

224
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:07,160
Oh, yes. l was told a few hours ago
there'd be such a passenger.

225
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:09,933
-You've assigned Mr. Keil a cabin?
-Yes, sir.

226
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:12,606
Hope you'll be comfortable.
Check with Dr. Ambach...

227
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:15,145
and let me know when that man is ready
to report for duty.

228
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:18,443
-He wasn't that badly hurt, sir.
-Just take care of it.

229
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,082
Capt. Mueller...

230
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:26,749
l was wondering if you had
a few moments, if perhaps l could--

231
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:31,022
After we clear the harbor, there'll be
plenty of time to get acquainted, Mr. Keil.

232
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:34,961
-Good. l was looking forward to it.
-Well, l'm not.

233
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:38,596
After all, l know your purpose
aboard my ship.

234
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:45,270
Mr. Branner...

235
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,307
starboard engine, half speed.

236
00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:49,505
Starboard! Half speed!

237
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:33,355
lt's my belief that political soldiers are
the lifeblood of a nation.

238
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:35,692
Even more than the military.

239
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:38,595
Wonderful observation.

240
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:41,030
You are a member of the party, Mr. Kruse?

241
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:42,429
Of course, l am.

242
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:48,765
Well, Captain,
l hope that everything is in order now.

243
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:51,168
-lt is.
-Good.

244
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,103
l see you're starting
your assignment early.

245
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:59,774
You're wasting your time. l don't plan
to have an infected jaw this trip.

246
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:05,515
Frankly, l'm quite surprised. l thought your
department had better use for its men.

247
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:10,425
You don't have to be discreet.
Mr. Kruse knows all about it.

248
00:19:11,762 --> 00:19:13,059
About what?

249
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:19,127
Well, l can see why the Security Office
felt it wise to take precautions.

250
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:21,796
Though, l'm certain
that the captain's drinking...

251
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:24,739
and the loss of his last ship
had no connection.

252
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,405
l don't know about this...

253
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:30,572
but l assure you this is not the reason
why l'm on the ship.

254
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:31,806
Not at all.

255
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,248
Which still means
you'll be looking over my shoulder.

256
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:37,253
l don't know why you persist in this.

257
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:43,492
lt's a long voyage, and l hope
that we could find some common interest.

258
00:19:45,596 --> 00:19:48,497
-Do you play the chess, sir?
-l do.

259
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,324
Well, then, we perhaps could have a game.

260
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,831
Mr. Keil, l have neither the time,
nor the desire to play chess with you.

261
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:00,801
Capt. Mueller...

262
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,171
l'm not accustomed to unfriendliness.

263
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:07,141
And....

264
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:12,479
l quite frankly....
l was really not prepared for it.

265
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,753
Do you have some particular quarrel
with SS, Captain?

266
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:22,089
l'm sure that you SS gentlemen
are very valuable on dry land...

267
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,661
but on this ship l have a job to do.

268
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:29,664
But how does my being on board this ship
affect your job?

269
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:34,475
My crew. Word's gotten around that
you're aboard, and they're scared to death.

270
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:37,436
This is ridiculous.

271
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:42,518
Ridiculous or not, l shall have to ask you
to confine yourself to your cabin...

272
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,485
the deck, and the salon.

273
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:48,484
l don't want you to interfere
with their work or mine.

274
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:51,491
Do you mean....

275
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:56,558
Am l to understand that l will not be free
to walk around the ship?

276
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:57,725
Yes, just that.

277
00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:00,395
The Admiralty described you
as a passenger.

278
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:04,697
So you will have all the privileges
and the restrictions of a passenger.

279
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,745
They failed to describe the captain
as not only foolish but ill-mannered.

280
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:11,314
-Well, that's their blunder.
-Capt. Mueller...

281
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:14,751
l don't have to put up
with this sort of rudeness...

282
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:18,652
and l would like to suggest that you show
a little more respect for me...

283
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:22,658
for my authority,
and for the organization that l represent.

284
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:27,093
l am the master of this ship.
You're under my authority here.

285
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:35,228
Mr. Kruse...

286
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:40,373
you will attest that the captain
is not only insulting but uncooperative.

287
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:44,709
l will make a full report of this
when we reach Bordeaux.

288
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:45,840
Bordeaux?

289
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:50,448
The only report l care about,
if we reach Bordeaux...

290
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:52,412
is that Capt. Mueller brought the Ingo...

291
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:55,458
on a 15,000 mile journey
through enemy waters...

292
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,619
with a precious cargo, successfully.

293
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:01,856
Even if he didn't play chess on the way.

294
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:05,200
l hoped that our relations
would be pleasant...

295
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:09,739
but l see that they won't. Good night.

296
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,210
lf you will allow me also, Captain?
l'm due on the bridge.

297
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,042
Mr. Keil?

298
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:26,452
-That was outrageous.
-Yeah, perhaps.

299
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:29,218
-Allow me to apologize for him.
-No, no. You're very kind...

300
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:31,318
but this is not your concern.

301
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:35,395
But, anyway, l don't intend to comply.

302
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,269
Unfortunately, Standard Leader,
l must urge you to do as he says.

303
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:42,669
He is in command until Bordeaux.

304
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:46,171
Until Bordeaux? Yeah.

305
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:48,741
-Good night.
-Good night.

306
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:28,818
-Your watch is on at eight bells.
-All right, sir.

307
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:21,141
Revolution's 1,200. Steady.

308
00:27:33,897 --> 00:27:38,834
Must have been a rat chewing on a wire.
Not much else to eat on this ship anyhow.

309
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:14,419
Hello, sir.

310
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:15,989
What?

311
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,865
l'm looking for my bird.

312
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:21,028
Are you blind?

313
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:31,239
-You work in the engine room?
-l'm the Donkeyman, sir.

314
00:29:31,615 --> 00:29:34,846
-Your name is Donkeyman?
-No.

315
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:37,419
That is what they call the stoker.

316
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:38,613
Yeah.

317
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:42,886
l hope my bird isn't disturbing you, sir?

318
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,954
Not at all.

319
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:50,458
You are one of the men
who was brought on the ship under guard.

320
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:52,400
Yes, sir.

321
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:55,530
What is the charge against you?

322
00:29:56,807 --> 00:30:00,766
-l am a political prisoner, sir.
-Political prisoner?

323
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:04,273
Falsely accused?

324
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:11,486
No, sir, not falsely accused.

325
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:53,921
Boat drill! Boat drill! To your stations!

326
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:57,164
Everybody, to your stations.

327
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:41,670
lt's time the men knew the truth.

328
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:44,810
You'll address them after the drill then?

329
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:47,509
l wouldn't make a speech
at the Föhrer's wedding.

330
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:49,381
Address them yourself.

331
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:52,418
Have you seen our passenger?

332
00:31:52,522 --> 00:31:54,353
He's supposed to be at number two.

333
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:56,915
No, but l'm sure
he can take care of himself.

334
00:31:57,027 --> 00:32:00,360
Oh, l'm sure he can,
but he's supposed to be at his position.

335
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:03,594
Perhaps he's waiting
for a personal invitation.

336
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:16,069
-Better get to your station, Dr. Ambach.
-Oh, yeah.

337
00:32:32,629 --> 00:32:34,256
Mr. Keil?

338
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:47,809
Hold the boats!

339
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:49,401
Re-stow them !

340
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:55,046
Officers and crew, assemble on foredeck!

341
00:32:58,154 --> 00:33:00,782
Officers and men,
assemble on the foredeck.

342
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:08,787
Where have you been?

343
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,734
Attending your boat drill.

344
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:15,232
Are you telling me
you've been here all along?

345
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:16,962
Certainly not.

346
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,343
There was no life jacket in my cabin,
so l was obliged to find one for myself.

347
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,113
l managed to locate one in this...

348
00:33:26,082 --> 00:33:29,779
machine shop of yours
which, incidentally, is a filthy hole.

349
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,012
That cabin wasn't
supposed to be occupied.

350
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:38,859
Well, we're not being torpedoed,
are we, Captain?

351
00:33:39,596 --> 00:33:41,325
lt's just a boat drill.

352
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:53,603
For security purposes, you had been told
that our destination was the China coast.

353
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:55,869
That is not the fact.

354
00:33:56,046 --> 00:33:58,947
This voyage, therefore,
will not end in a few days.

355
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:01,677
lt will require another 80 days.

356
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:05,112
Journey's end will be a port in France...

357
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:08,720
occupied gloriously by our countrymen.

358
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:11,886
From now on, our watches will be armed.

359
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,962
Not the slightest misconduct
will be tolerated!

360
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:17,499
Thank you, Mr. Kruse. That's fine.

361
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:24,368
The watches will not be armed.
The First Officer mistook one of my orders.

362
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,741
As to those of you with bad records...

363
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:32,345
you will toe the line, as we all will.

364
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:35,977
Dismissed.

365
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:42,155
But, sir....

366
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:45,160
l have never captained
a prison ship before...

367
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:51,762
and don't intend to now.

368
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:18,290
-How is your insane friend today?
-Fine, sir.

369
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,061
Well...

370
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:25,366
this is my first voyage on a freighter.

371
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:27,127
l find it interesting.

372
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:29,799
Very interesting.

373
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:33,271
What is this machine here?

374
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,701
-The winch.
-Winch?

375
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:37,872
The winch for lifting the cargo.

376
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:41,646
-Oh, yes, this is the cargo hold?
-Yes, sir.

377
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:46,780
-How do you get in?
-Right from the deck, sir.

378
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,058
Once you get the hatch cover off.

379
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,958
You mean there are
no connecting doorways down below...

380
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,661
-from one cargo hold to the other?
-No, sir.

381
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,965
Not on a freighter, sir.

382
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:07,000
Better be careful.

383
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,137
One day, this bird of yours might fly away
with a seagull.

384
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,356
l promise you...

385
00:36:26,863 --> 00:36:28,922
before this ship reaches port...

386
00:36:28,998 --> 00:36:31,865
there's going to be one dead
SS bastard on it.

387
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,274
Come in.

388
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,505
Oh, Standard Leader.

389
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:46,182
-Come in.
-l hope l'm not disturbing.

390
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,109
Certainly not, Standard Leader.

391
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:53,215
-Take a seat.
-Thank you very much.

392
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:55,718
Care for a cigarette?

393
00:36:55,825 --> 00:36:59,693
No, l think l won't have a cigarette.

394
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,827
My coming here is a gamble...

395
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:07,734
but l think l have not made
a mistake about you.

396
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:12,705
-May l speak directly?
-By all means.

397
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:20,412
l think that neither you or l are pleased...

398
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,912
with....

399
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:31,149
l hope you won't be offended
if l ask to see your party card.

400
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:34,156
-My party card?
-Yeah.

401
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:52,014
-This is my party card.
-Thank you.

402
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:58,710
Well, l see you've kept up
your yearly contributions.

403
00:37:58,788 --> 00:37:59,846
Yes.

404
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:01,114
You know...

405
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:05,854
what constantly confounds me, is the
irony of careers in the merchant service.

406
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:09,421
We have a man like Mueller
at the top, and...

407
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:13,065
while a man like yourself,
a genuine German...

408
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:15,564
in the best sense of the phrase...

409
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,264
is First Officer.

410
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,702
But l did not knock on your door
to flatter you.

411
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,238
Now...

412
00:38:26,883 --> 00:38:28,783
what is your opinion...

413
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:32,885
of Capt. Mueller's approach to discipline?

414
00:38:34,257 --> 00:38:35,417
Discipline?

415
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,327
He approaches it
as if we were carrying a cargo of kimonos.

416
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:44,756
Exactly. Now...

417
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,333
you must realize by now
that l'm not just a passenger.

418
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:53,775
Certainly.

419
00:38:54,077 --> 00:38:57,808
And l'm not here to count
the bottles of wine that Mueller drinks.

420
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:01,409
lt is necessary for me
to inspect this ship, all of it.

421
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:06,278
And l prefer that Capt. Mueller
is not made aware of this or anyone else.

422
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:09,082
Yes.

423
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:12,284
And you will be kind enough
to arrange this for me.

424
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:21,803
Now, l must ask to look
at your party card, Standard Leader.

425
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,471
Please drop the title when we're alone.
lt's....

426
00:39:24,707 --> 00:39:26,140
May l see it?

427
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:30,670
Here.

428
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:33,143
You know, l'm...

429
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:37,047
l'm happy that you asked me this
because if you didn't, l would know...

430
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:40,680
that you were not being as alert
as you might be.

431
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:43,487
May l ask...

432
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:46,727
the purpose of your request?

433
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,461
l am sorry, but...

434
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:52,865
under the circumstances, l cannot afford
to take anyone into my confidence.

435
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:54,526
But thank you.

436
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:58,300
l can tell you this, which is
something that you are already aware of...

437
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:01,707
and that is that there are
political prisoners on board.

438
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:06,542
And if l were a political prisoner...

439
00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:14,386
l would not be completely disappointed
if this ship did not reach Bordeaux.

440
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,221
l feel l should oblige you, Mr. Keil...

441
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,991
but to act contrary
to the orders of my superior....

442
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:26,395
Certainly, l understand, but if you should
feel the need for my support at any time--

443
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:28,868
l appreciate that very much, but...

444
00:40:30,073 --> 00:40:31,335
l must think it over.

445
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:34,205
Naturally. This is logical.

446
00:40:34,377 --> 00:40:37,107
But while you think it over,
l would like to remind you...

447
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:39,113
of our first allegiance.

448
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:42,012
-HeiI Hitler.
-HeiI Hitler.

449
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:43,885
-Thank you so much.
-Good night.

450
00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:45,011
Good night.

451
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:58,587
Mr. Keil? Mr. Keil?

452
00:41:58,694 --> 00:42:01,857
l'm sorry to interrupt you, sir,
but this is impossible for me.

453
00:42:01,964 --> 00:42:04,125
l'm not prepared for a lengthy voyage.

454
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,361
Would you use your influence, sir?

455
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:09,298
l don't believe l understand.

456
00:42:09,372 --> 00:42:13,331
Well, l have to be returned to Tokyo.
We must put about.

457
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:18,307
You have a rather
original sense of comedy, Dr. Ambach.

458
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:22,474
l know l sound absurd,
and l'm sorry to bother you with this...

459
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:25,851
but l have problems, certain problems.

460
00:42:25,988 --> 00:42:28,548
Dr. Ambach, we all have problems.

461
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:33,054
But, Mr. Keil,
these are extremely serious problems.

462
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:34,658
So...

463
00:42:35,164 --> 00:42:37,792
in this case,
l suggest that you swim back...

464
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:39,960
because it only takes three weeks...

465
00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:42,698
and the water is not cold this time of year.

466
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:47,639
This is Radio Norddeich,
in the heart of the fatherIand...

467
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,644
bringing music and personaI messages...

468
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:52,545
to our gaIIant fighters
far away on IoneIy seas.

469
00:42:53,149 --> 00:42:56,550
-Touching, isn't it?
-Get used to it, Branner.

470
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:59,014
lt'll follow us all the way.

471
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:02,820
Good to be back with you
after all these years, Doc.

472
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:04,325
Look at him.

473
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:07,055
Ten pounds of trousers
for two pounds of rump.

474
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:12,995
You weren't so funny
back in Cape Town, were you?

475
00:43:13,102 --> 00:43:17,163
When you came crying to me
with a very far gone venereal disease...

476
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,731
which l found almost impossible to cure.

477
00:43:21,944 --> 00:43:25,436
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you a buIIetin of speciaI interest.

478
00:43:25,548 --> 00:43:29,780
United States aircraft today attempted
their first raid on German territory.

479
00:43:29,886 --> 00:43:31,513
No damage was sustained.

480
00:43:31,587 --> 00:43:34,556
Our fighter pIanes shot down
1 1 of the enemy bombers.

481
00:43:34,624 --> 00:43:36,353
-Good!
-That's wonderful.

482
00:43:37,026 --> 00:43:38,857
-That'll show them, huh?
-Of course.

483
00:43:38,928 --> 00:43:41,021
But what are 1 1 planes to the Americans...

484
00:43:41,097 --> 00:43:44,589
when they claim
they are going to build 50,000 in a year?

485
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:47,396
Milkereit was always a pessimist...

486
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,801
senior grade.

487
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:53,105
''lf Adolf Hitler is steering towards war,
he's a lunatic.''

488
00:43:57,647 --> 00:43:59,911
Letter to a lady friend, 1935.

489
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,941
The lady liked to save letters...

490
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:06,488
and the Gestapo likes to collect
all kinds of odd documents.

491
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:10,284
l have that report
in your service file, Milkereit.

492
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:12,821
But l was much younger.

493
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:15,659
l don't feel that way any longer.

494
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:19,428
Yeah, just make sure that your change
of heart is permanent, Milkereit.

495
00:44:20,503 --> 00:44:24,439
And in the future, make sure
to take up with less sentimental ladies.

496
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,761
l once knew a girl who sang that song.

497
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:49,830
A girl back home.

498
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:51,690
Home.

499
00:44:52,902 --> 00:44:54,460
lt's been almost two years.

500
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:55,561
Sir?

501
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:58,134
A message from Tokyo.

502
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:00,838
Turn that damn radio off.

503
00:45:01,477 --> 00:45:03,809
''Enemy ships reported your vicinity.

504
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:07,212
''Camouflage your vessel
as British freighter immediately.''

505
00:45:52,228 --> 00:45:54,389
Raise the starboard waist!

506
00:46:07,143 --> 00:46:08,576
Get going.

507
00:46:10,546 --> 00:46:11,740
Kruse?

508
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:14,980
Come with me. lt's urgent.

509
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:16,782
What's urgent?

510
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,086
This is an emergency. Come.

511
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:26,217
-Cornelson! Take over for me here.
-Yes, sir.

512
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:33,295
Kruse...

513
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:38,006
l've decided to take you
completely into my confidence.

514
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:40,575
Sabotage.

515
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:44,779
Very clever work.

516
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:49,079
Now l think you'll know
why l am on this ship.

517
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,475
My instructions were to handle this
by myself, but now there is no time.

518
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,950
You say there are 12 of these...

519
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:25,714
-scuttling charges?
-Yes.

520
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:27,712
That's sufficient.

521
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:33,125
Two or three could probably sink the ship,
so we will have to cover them all.

522
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:36,825
Now...

523
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:41,295
how many are there in this hold?

524
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,462
Two.

525
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:43,799
Where are they located?

526
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:47,673
One is over there,
at the end of this opening.

527
00:47:57,219 --> 00:47:59,346
Run a cable from the aftermast...

528
00:48:01,323 --> 00:48:02,585
to this deck.

529
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:04,053
Yes, Captain.

530
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:19,505
The last one's down here.

531
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:21,008
What is in the barrels here?

532
00:48:21,076 --> 00:48:22,373
-Barrels?
-Yeah.

533
00:48:22,445 --> 00:48:23,503
Lard.

534
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:26,876
-Lard?
-Yeah.

535
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:30,077
A few hundred tons from Okinawa...

536
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:33,548
for making margarine and candles.

537
00:48:36,058 --> 00:48:38,788
We even have a small shipment
of oolong tea.

538
00:48:38,894 --> 00:48:40,293
Thank you.

539
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:45,261
Now tell me, Kruse, where is the
master switch for these charges located?

540
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:46,867
ln the wheelhouse.

541
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:48,732
-ln the wheelhouse?
-Yeah.

542
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:51,471
Well, then l'm sure,
the Captain has the only key, huh?

543
00:48:51,574 --> 00:48:52,905
Of course.

544
00:48:54,376 --> 00:48:56,901
l think this one
has not been tampered with.

545
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:58,276
lt's all right.

546
00:48:59,114 --> 00:49:02,777
Twelve charges and the only two damaged
are in the engine room.

547
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:05,719
The Donkeyman.

548
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:08,885
-l'll make short work of him.
-No. Wait, wait, wait.

549
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:12,319
Whoever it is,
we watch them play out their hand.

550
00:49:13,128 --> 00:49:15,460
But the captain ought to be notified.

551
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:18,464
Certainly not.

552
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:23,169
Under these circumstances,
everyone is suspect...

553
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,005
even you.

554
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:51,864
Look here. There's help.

555
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:56,297
Very fortunate circumstance
to find an alone American ship.

556
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:57,966
Very.

557
00:50:00,943 --> 00:50:03,673
We have made radio contact
with the Ingo again, Admiral.

558
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:05,838
She is on course and all is well.

559
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:22,124
-Where were your ship going?
-Australia.

560
00:50:22,998 --> 00:50:26,525
-What is your occupation?
-l am a surgical aide.

561
00:50:27,336 --> 00:50:29,236
Why were you going to Australia?

562
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:31,999
l was a member of a medical team.

563
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:34,403
You were born in Berlin?

564
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:36,571
Yes.

565
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:40,012
And your parents, also born in Germany?

566
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:41,908
Yes.

567
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:45,680
So a German girl on an enemy vessel.

568
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:50,222
Whatever gave you the absurd idea
l was German?

569
00:50:50,326 --> 00:50:52,760
lf you're not a German, what then?

570
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:56,261
l am anti-German.

571
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:42,200
Captain, luck's still with us.

572
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,575
The fog is coming in a lot thicker.

573
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:50,943
You know the chantey
of blockade-runners out of Tokyo, Bosun?

574
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,757
Nine days out, all will be fair.
Ten days out, sailor, beware.

575
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:57,451
Yes, sir.

576
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:59,254
Captain, the steward
has just made a strudel.

577
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:01,728
Good. l'd love it with a cup of coffee.

578
00:52:40,302 --> 00:52:42,270
l've had the men go over
the engines again.

579
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:45,135
Cylinder head pressure's normal,
rev's increasing.

580
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,767
You must be getting very bored, Mr. Keil.

581
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:51,204
l'm sorry we don't have shuffleboard
or a band.

582
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:55,016
Well, l've been able
to occupy myself, Captain.

583
00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:58,282
l've been studying
the animal life in my bunk...

584
00:52:59,154 --> 00:53:01,122
and the wind and waves.

585
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:04,687
Well, the wind and the waves
have been very good to us.

586
00:53:04,793 --> 00:53:08,229
They certainly have.
We're nearly a full day ahead of schedule.

587
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:10,992
Yeah, and the old tub
is still glued together.

588
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:13,034
So help me,
l'm beginning to get fond of her.

589
00:53:13,135 --> 00:53:14,159
Sir?

590
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:17,861
A number of ships.
Two different codes, very strong.

591
00:53:24,646 --> 00:53:26,671
Signals are much stronger, sir.

592
00:53:27,883 --> 00:53:30,750
They might be
a city block away in this porridge.

593
00:53:31,653 --> 00:53:34,053
-Kruse.
-Captain.

594
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,920
-Shadow!
-There! Pinned her, too, Captain.

595
00:53:40,662 --> 00:53:41,720
Englishmen.

596
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,492
lmproved D class of Lambert and Holt.

597
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:48,266
Englishmen...

598
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:51,072
like ourselves.

599
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:53,598
Three ships off port bow!

600
00:53:57,579 --> 00:53:59,012
Convoy!

601
00:54:00,415 --> 00:54:01,848
Convoy...

602
00:54:03,552 --> 00:54:05,543
and we're in the middle of it.

603
00:54:14,029 --> 00:54:15,257
What do we do now, sir?

604
00:54:15,864 --> 00:54:17,195
Mr. Kruse...

605
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:19,400
20 degrees to starboard.

606
00:54:20,202 --> 00:54:22,363
-Keep parallel to the convoy.
-Yes, sir...

607
00:54:22,437 --> 00:54:24,200
20 degrees to starboard.

608
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,633
We bluff, young man.

609
00:54:28,777 --> 00:54:30,608
And we believe in miracles.

610
00:54:31,046 --> 00:54:32,104
Captain?

611
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:37,209
Captain, there's a destroyer...

612
00:54:38,453 --> 00:54:40,148
heading straight for us.

613
00:54:40,255 --> 00:54:42,155
American, Benz-class.

614
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:45,716
Four guns, 10 torpedo tubes.

615
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:49,263
Makes 36 knots.

616
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:51,999
Good. Send them a citation.

617
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,445
Captain, it's a matter of minutes.

618
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:10,080
Mr. Kruse, sound the general alarm.

619
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:13,279
Don't sound the horn.

620
00:55:13,488 --> 00:55:15,752
He may be on routine sub patrol
and bear off.

621
00:55:15,824 --> 00:55:19,351
All men to stations
except radio, engine room, and bridge.

622
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:22,327
Sir, radio message received.
Destroyer wants identification.

623
00:55:22,431 --> 00:55:26,197
Tell Mr. Nissen to send,
"British Stonehenge in convoy.''

624
00:55:26,301 --> 00:55:28,428
-And send it slowly and garbled.
-Garbled, sir?

625
00:55:28,503 --> 00:55:29,993
Mr. Nissen knows
the meaning of the word.

626
00:55:30,105 --> 00:55:31,436
-Now move!
-Yes, sir.

627
00:55:31,506 --> 00:55:33,531
And somebody bring me a cigar.

628
00:55:40,515 --> 00:55:41,948
General alarm !

629
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:52,326
General alarm ! Don't use the horn!

630
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:02,963
They are bound to see
we are a fake pretty soon.

631
00:56:03,038 --> 00:56:06,064
We'll be sent to a prisoners-of-war camp,
maybe in Hawaii in the sun.

632
00:56:06,174 --> 00:56:08,039
Come on, darling, take us.

633
00:56:08,543 --> 00:56:10,704
Come, take us, darling. Come on.

634
00:56:10,846 --> 00:56:13,974
Donkeyman, what are you waiting for?
Let's go.

635
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:17,210
First, l've got a piece of business
to take care of.

636
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:54,383
Eight hundred yards.

637
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:58,256
Seven hundred.

638
00:56:59,594 --> 00:57:00,856
Six hundred.

639
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,690
Five hundred yards.

640
00:57:08,904 --> 00:57:10,428
Three hundred fifty.

641
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:15,204
He's changing course.

642
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,736
He's bearing off.

643
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:21,280
We are getting away with it.

644
00:57:21,383 --> 00:57:23,078
They think we are real.

645
00:57:23,218 --> 00:57:26,984
l don't know what they think,
but it's time somebody lit my cigar.

646
00:58:10,332 --> 00:58:14,098
You there! Hoffman!
Get off the deck and kill the whistle!

647
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:24,635
Captain, the destroyer has ordered us
to stop immediately for boarding.

648
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:25,873
Here, sir.

649
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:33,844
-Mr. Kruse, halt engines.
-Halt engines, sir.

650
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:38,988
-Halt engines.
-Halt engines.

651
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:41,058
Engines halting.

652
00:58:41,296 --> 00:58:42,695
Abandon ship.

653
00:58:43,365 --> 00:58:44,627
Abandon ship.

654
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:47,191
Abandon ship!

655
00:58:47,302 --> 00:58:48,530
Abandon ship!

656
00:58:49,204 --> 00:58:50,671
lnto the boats!

657
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:54,201
-Are we scuttling, sir?
-Get on. l'll take care of it.

658
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:57,541
Get in the boats, men!

659
00:59:01,216 --> 00:59:03,150
And hurry up there! Hurry up!

660
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:04,976
Hold the line!

661
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,010
Capt. Mueller, wait!

662
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:41,248
Why aren't you in the lifeboat?

663
00:59:41,356 --> 00:59:43,722
Don't throw your life away needlessly.

664
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:45,517
You're insane.

665
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:48,457
l'll be over the side as soon as l finish this.

666
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:00,073
Mr. Kruse, hold the lifeboats.

667
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,372
Everybody, back to stations!

668
01:00:08,383 --> 01:00:10,544
Sir! Sir!

669
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:13,720
Mr. Branner reports engine room ready.

670
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:19,555
Full ahead.
Give me everything you can deliver.

671
01:00:21,129 --> 01:00:23,222
-Hard to starboard.
-Hard to starboard.

672
01:00:23,565 --> 01:00:25,430
We'll make for that fog bank.

673
01:00:26,768 --> 01:00:28,793
Maybe we can sneak out of here.

674
01:00:29,971 --> 01:00:32,166
Helmsman, what's your reading?

675
01:00:33,074 --> 01:00:35,099
One, one, zero, sir.

676
01:00:35,443 --> 01:00:36,501
Port two points.

677
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:38,738
-Port two points, sir.
-Mr. Milkereit? Mr. Kruse?

678
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:40,576
-Sir.
-Radical change of course.

679
01:00:40,649 --> 01:00:43,083
-Which alternative, sir?
-Put us on course beta.

680
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:44,175
Yes, sir.

681
01:00:46,588 --> 01:00:47,919
-Mr. Cornelson?
-Yes, sir.

682
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:50,924
They'll send our description
to every skiff between here and Midway.

683
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:53,654
Call Bosun to my quarters.
We change camouflage again.

684
01:00:53,762 --> 01:00:54,922
Yes, sir.

685
01:00:57,999 --> 01:01:01,435
-Mr. Keil?
-Yes.

686
01:01:03,972 --> 01:01:05,963
l have misjudged you, Mr. Keil.

687
01:01:06,775 --> 01:01:09,141
l never for one moment thought that...

688
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,671
you might try to save my life.

689
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:17,716
You gentlemen of the SS don't usually
display the humanity of a sand crab.

690
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:21,482
Well, to be honest with you,
l couldn't help myself.

691
01:01:34,803 --> 01:01:38,398
Well, gentlemen, was it God
or the Föhrer that brought the fog?

692
01:01:40,008 --> 01:01:42,568
Thank both, and the captain as well.

693
01:01:43,011 --> 01:01:46,037
-l must say, he used his wits.
-Yeah, he was brilliant.

694
01:01:46,147 --> 01:01:47,171
Yeah.

695
01:01:50,652 --> 01:01:53,246
Milkereit, in which direction
are we headed?

696
01:01:53,688 --> 01:01:56,418
Sorry, our course is classified.

697
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,416
Don't you think that perhaps by now
l am an exception to the general rules?

698
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:12,162
-As navigation officer, l can't allow that--
-Just for once, use a little common sense.

699
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,434
lt's your responsibility, sir.

700
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,365
Mr. Keil...

701
01:02:21,576 --> 01:02:23,339
-this is our present position.
-Yeah.

702
01:02:23,411 --> 01:02:25,936
This was the old course, almost due east.

703
01:02:26,514 --> 01:02:29,381
Now this will be our new course. See?

704
01:02:31,018 --> 01:02:32,042
Yeah.

705
01:02:36,424 --> 01:02:39,416
-ls that coffee over there?
-Yeah.

706
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:41,222
-Can l have a cup please?
-Of course.

707
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:42,557
Thank you.

708
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:45,394
-Do you take sugar?
-One teaspoon full.

709
01:02:48,302 --> 01:02:51,430
-Here's your coffee.
-Oh. Thank you, very kind.

710
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,236
-Yeah, now, this is the new course.
-This is the new course. Yeah.

711
01:02:58,546 --> 01:03:02,380
-But we lose a lot of time this way--
-Oh, yeah, several days.

712
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,213
-You must have dropped your pin.
-No, no.

713
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:07,277
l never can measure distance on the map.

714
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:11,586
l was trying to find out
how far it is from here to here.

715
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:13,149
That's very easy.

716
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:15,994
Just a moment, from here to here.

717
01:03:16,898 --> 01:03:19,662
lt's 220 miles.

718
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:25,061
You know, it's strange.
lt's only about two inches, and yet it's...

719
01:03:25,173 --> 01:03:29,337
-further than Leipzig to Dösseldorf?
-Yeah, you're right.

720
01:03:32,947 --> 01:03:35,108
This island, it's not....

721
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:39,441
-lt's not dangerous to go so close?
-No, it's uninhabited.

722
01:03:39,821 --> 01:03:42,790
lt's no tactical value for us
or the Americans.

723
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,823
lt has such a strange shape.
lt's like a starfish.

724
01:03:50,932 --> 01:03:54,527
-What are you laughing for?
-That's its name. Starfish lsland.

725
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,933
Yeah, l guess.

726
01:03:58,673 --> 01:04:01,540
This is certainly interesting. l've never...

727
01:04:03,711 --> 01:04:07,169
seen it before.
Kruse, would you excuse me, please?

728
01:04:07,248 --> 01:04:09,580
-l'll see you a bit later.
-Sure, sure. Thank you.

729
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:30,597
Standard Leader?

730
01:04:37,712 --> 01:04:39,270
Standard Leader.

731
01:04:42,283 --> 01:04:43,409
All right.

732
01:04:44,185 --> 01:04:45,880
Shall we go to my room?

733
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,887
Mine's right here.

734
01:05:05,806 --> 01:05:07,398
Your swindle is over.

735
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:09,470
What swindle?

736
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:13,740
lt's damn plain that you don't want
this ship to reach Bordeaux.

737
01:05:20,554 --> 01:05:22,078
What do you want of me?

738
01:05:22,156 --> 01:05:24,716
We want to hear what you've got to offer.

739
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:27,127
And if we don't like it...

740
01:05:27,628 --> 01:05:30,222
we turn this over to Kruse or the captain.

741
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:36,163
Milkereit.

742
01:05:37,338 --> 01:05:40,466
-How many are there of you?
-We have four others.

743
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:43,503
-Four. And there are no officers?
-No.

744
01:05:46,614 --> 01:05:49,344
How long have you been together
with these men?

745
01:05:49,951 --> 01:05:54,183
We started to talk during the camouflage.
And then l saw you jam the whistle...

746
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:57,018
and realized you also were in the fight
against Hitler.

747
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:59,456
l see l am surrounded by patriots.

748
01:05:59,961 --> 01:06:01,087
Not these others.

749
01:06:01,162 --> 01:06:03,596
lf they reach Germany,
they will be finished.

750
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:06,155
Yeah, l think you will be finished also.

751
01:06:07,668 --> 01:06:08,828
Yes, l know.

752
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:12,799
l keep wondering if that's why
l was assigned here on this ship.

753
01:06:12,974 --> 01:06:15,602
We all have the same goal,
to keep our heads on our shoulders.

754
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:21,478
Every time we bump into each other,
it's near a scuttling charge. Am l right?

755
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:24,211
Yeah, l was trying to disarm them.

756
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:27,219
-What's your plan?
-Now there's no plan.

757
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:30,954
Before we changed course, we were
headed straight for an Allied ambush.

758
01:06:31,025 --> 01:06:32,049
An ambush?

759
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:36,186
Yeah, there were American warships
waiting for us, but now it's finished.

760
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:41,034
-What is your plan?
-We haven't any plan.

761
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,604
There's only one chance then.

762
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:46,867
This island, Star something.

763
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:50,208
-Starfish lsland?
-Starfish lsland. How far is it?

764
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:52,611
About 3,000 miles.

765
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:54,709
How many days?

766
01:06:55,649 --> 01:06:57,048
Roughly 15 days.

767
01:06:57,885 --> 01:06:58,943
Fifteen.

768
01:07:00,654 --> 01:07:03,054
How close do we come to it
when we pass?

769
01:07:04,658 --> 01:07:06,990
About 70 or 80 miles.

770
01:07:14,402 --> 01:07:15,528
Milkereit!

771
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:21,331
-Milkereit!
-Just a second, sir.

772
01:07:26,313 --> 01:07:29,578
Excuse me, sir, l was just lying down.

773
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:32,683
That's all right.

774
01:07:32,753 --> 01:07:35,984
Milkereit, what l need is a report
of all the winds and currents...

775
01:07:36,057 --> 01:07:37,752
of the new course beta.

776
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:40,719
-As soon as possible.
-Yes, l will do it.

777
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:43,921
-Okay?
-Yes.

778
01:07:52,673 --> 01:07:54,368
Would it be possible...

779
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,677
when we pass this island...

780
01:07:57,745 --> 01:08:01,112
to take one of those rubber boats
and put it over the side?

781
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:04,010
-lf it's night.
-And nobody sees us.

782
01:08:04,085 --> 01:08:07,054
The chances of making the island
would still be 15-to-1 .

783
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:09,589
We must take whatever chance we have.

784
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:14,125
Now, there are three scuttling charges
that l have not yet disarmed.

785
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:16,719
l will continue to disarm the charges...

786
01:08:16,797 --> 01:08:19,789
in the events that we are intercepted
by an Allied warship.

787
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,731
Now, are we all agreed?

788
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,600
Yes, we do.

789
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:15,278
Stop engines. Slow us down.

790
01:09:15,456 --> 01:09:17,856
Stop engines. Slow us down, sir.

791
01:09:18,459 --> 01:09:21,292
-Lower the gangplank.
-Lower the gangplank, sir.

792
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:28,924
-Lower the gangplank!
-All you men here...

793
01:09:29,203 --> 01:09:30,636
lower the gangway.

794
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:55,352
Hurry up! Get it over with!

795
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:05,833
We'll continue to observe radio silence
until after transfer of prisoners.

796
01:10:06,006 --> 01:10:09,134
-What transfer of prisoners?
-Shall l send a reply, sir?

797
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:12,570
Yes. Tell them Capt. Mueller
just jumped overboard.

798
01:10:54,288 --> 01:10:57,121
-Did you disarm it?
-Yeah, there are only two left.

799
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:19,076
Welcome aboard the steam ship Christina.

800
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:20,545
Thank you, Captain.

801
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:23,640
lt's always nice to meet
an honest Swedish skipper.

802
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:28,087
You must enjoy being a neutral.
You're lit up like a Christmas tree.

803
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:29,417
Well, l'm glad l'm no longer English.

804
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,482
You came within 100 yards
of putting a torpedo in my belly.

805
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:36,120
And your destroyers almost put
a depth charge down my throat.

806
01:11:36,497 --> 01:11:38,488
-Back to stations.
-Back to stations, sir.

807
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:40,499
Back to stations! Everybody!

808
01:11:44,672 --> 01:11:48,130
l can certainly see why you were
so obstinate back in Japan.

809
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:52,844
l now hand you custody of 15 prisoners.
lnterrogation report on each.

810
01:11:53,314 --> 01:11:55,145
As well as one on the girl.

811
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:57,439
Nothing is spared me.

812
01:11:57,518 --> 01:11:59,782
You will find that one very interesting.

813
01:11:59,853 --> 01:12:01,946
-Mr. Kruse?
-Captain.

814
01:12:02,022 --> 01:12:04,183
Escort the prisoners
to twin decks number five.

815
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,020
Yes, sir. Move!

816
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:08,623
Just a minute.

817
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:13,422
Mr. Cornelson, you certainly wouldn't
put her up with them.

818
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:17,103
Mr. Cornelson, take her to my cabin
for the time being.

819
01:12:17,438 --> 01:12:18,666
Now, Adm. Wendel--

820
01:12:18,772 --> 01:12:22,003
l know. l know.
This new cargo is a burden, Captain.

821
01:12:22,209 --> 01:12:24,040
l suppose that's why
you radioed the request...

822
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:25,771
but not the reason for this rendezvous.

823
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:28,474
Were you afraid
l might get a bit too obstinate this time?

824
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:31,279
We thought of that Mueller,
we thought of that.

825
01:12:32,653 --> 01:12:35,520
Now that you're here,
would you join me for a drink?

826
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:36,949
Fine.

827
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:40,621
l wouldn't have missed this chance
to congratulate you personally.

828
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:44,152
Slipping in and out of that convoy.
Remarkable seamanship.

829
01:12:44,231 --> 01:12:45,357
Thank you.

830
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:49,499
Very gratifying for a captain
who has to have a keeper on his tail.

831
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:51,995
Keeper?

832
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:54,834
lnsist on playing games? Very well.

833
01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:57,508
The passenger you gentlemen put aboard.

834
01:13:00,514 --> 01:13:02,209
Someone we put aboard?

835
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:04,411
HeiI Hitler.

836
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:06,744
-HeiI Hitler.
-HeiI Hitler.

837
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:08,685
Adm. Wendel, Cmdr. Busch...

838
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:12,755
this is my passenger, Mr. Hans Keil
of the Security Office.

839
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:15,192
Adm. Wendel, it's a pleasure to meet you.

840
01:13:15,262 --> 01:13:16,752
l am delighted, Mr. Keil,
to meet you here.

841
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:17,854
Thank you.

842
01:13:17,931 --> 01:13:19,159
Glad to meet you.

843
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:22,225
Your department didn't notify me
of your assignment.

844
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,331
Oh, that's strange.

845
01:13:25,406 --> 01:13:27,374
l presented my credentials
to the embassy.

846
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:31,844
Naturally. Well, then, your venture
was authorized after l left Tokyo.

847
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:34,180
Yeah, perhaps.

848
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:39,686
Anyway, this is not a venture.
l'm just here as a passenger.

849
01:13:39,953 --> 01:13:41,887
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

850
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:45,749
Where were you before Tokyo?

851
01:13:47,895 --> 01:13:49,954
l'm not able to reveal this.

852
01:13:50,798 --> 01:13:52,766
Secret information, no doubt.

853
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:55,461
Classified.

854
01:13:57,237 --> 01:13:58,363
Gentlemen.

855
01:14:03,977 --> 01:14:05,774
l'll wager one thing.

856
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:07,605
When you left port...

857
01:14:07,714 --> 01:14:11,980
you didn't expect to run into
two officers from the German Admiralty.

858
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:14,450
Never hoped for such luck.

859
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:18,417
Well, as my friend
Bernhard Weber used to say...

860
01:14:18,492 --> 01:14:21,086
if you can't imagine a situation it is....

861
01:14:22,062 --> 01:14:24,121
You knew Brigade Leader Weber?

862
01:14:25,098 --> 01:14:26,463
-Weber?
-From SS leadership school.

863
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:28,125
You went there, of course.

864
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:30,829
Yeah, sure, class of 1938.

865
01:14:31,505 --> 01:14:34,065
General Ordenlichter
was the commandant then.

866
01:14:34,741 --> 01:14:36,641
Are you acquainted with him?

867
01:14:36,944 --> 01:14:40,004
-Yes.
-He was a wonderful man.

868
01:14:40,347 --> 01:14:41,780
Class of '38.

869
01:14:43,283 --> 01:14:45,581
Well, then you must know
Brigade Leader Weber.

870
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:47,779
The Chief of Political Evaluation.

871
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,248
Weber. Weber.

872
01:14:53,093 --> 01:14:54,856
Yeah, l remember him.

873
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,000
l see you smoke an English briar.

874
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:05,037
An amazing observation.

875
01:15:05,372 --> 01:15:07,772
You should be in counter-intelligence.

876
01:15:08,609 --> 01:15:09,633
l am.

877
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:12,972
-Really?
-And frankly...

878
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,106
what we would like to determine is...

879
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:18,378
what you're doing onboard this ship.

880
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:21,980
Nothing more important than...

881
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:24,122
being a passenger.

882
01:15:24,858 --> 01:15:27,520
But l'm so flattered with your interest.

883
01:15:29,396 --> 01:15:32,627
Well, l never did finish my remark
about Brigade Leader Weber.

884
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,463
-The Political Evaluation Chief.
-Right.

885
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:40,533
An astonishing fact is
that he doesn't exist.

886
01:15:41,808 --> 01:15:43,298
l invented the man.

887
01:15:53,587 --> 01:15:55,418
Of course, he doesn't exist.

888
01:15:56,924 --> 01:15:59,757
Gentlemen, l don't wish
to embarrass you...

889
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:04,695
but really this kind of
interrogation technique is childish.

890
01:16:06,366 --> 01:16:09,824
We learned this in the first two weeks
of leadership school.

891
01:16:10,037 --> 01:16:12,665
But l am fascinated by your curiosity.

892
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:17,172
You would be less fascinated if l told you
that perhaps you, too, are an invention...

893
01:16:17,444 --> 01:16:20,004
-Standard Leader Keil.
-Now, gentlemen...

894
01:16:20,347 --> 01:16:24,044
if it wasn't for Mr. Keil,
we wouldn't be aboard this ship.

895
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:27,418
He stopped me from scuttling her.
l had my hand on the switch...

896
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:29,921
and Mr. Keil thought
that l was going to stay with her...

897
01:16:30,023 --> 01:16:31,581
and did his best to stop me.

898
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:34,354
And while he was doing that,
your wolf-pack...

899
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:36,351
blasted the convoy.

900
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,092
So, you see, if he hadn't delayed me
for a few seconds...

901
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:43,135
7,000 tons of precious rubber
would have been at the bottom of the sea.

902
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:47,199
So Mr. Keil is capable
of a nice, sentimental gesture.

903
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,707
-That doesn't clear up my doubts.
-l see no reasons...

904
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:55,779
to discuss matters that concern
only my department.

905
01:16:56,617 --> 01:17:00,314
And now, Adm. Wendel,
let me notify you in very simple terms.

906
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:04,891
The Security Office will be informed
in every exact detail...

907
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,392
as to your interference, is that clear?

908
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:10,155
-Mr. Keil, l will not permit you--
-Now, gentlemen.

909
01:17:10,263 --> 01:17:13,790
There is no real problem.
All you have to do is radio Berlin.

910
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:19,899
Yeah, excellent idea.

911
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:27,276
This is logical.

912
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:42,083
Capt. Mueller, are you willing
to be answerable for Mr. Keil?

913
01:17:42,295 --> 01:17:43,319
Yes.

914
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,433
l'll accept that.

915
01:17:49,302 --> 01:17:51,634
l don't think we need trouble Berlin.

916
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:53,969
l realize that we have offended you.

917
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:57,439
But you must understand
our need for caution.

918
01:17:57,711 --> 01:17:59,440
lf l didn't, who would?

919
01:17:59,646 --> 01:18:01,671
At any rate, my regrets.

920
01:18:02,716 --> 01:18:03,978
Adm. Wendel.

921
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:07,480
And thank you
for your excellent hospitality.

922
01:18:08,455 --> 01:18:09,945
Good night, Mr. Keil.

923
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:19,798
Naturally, l'll radio Berlin.

924
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,292
By this time tomorrow,
you should have a complete report.

925
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:26,533
Meantime, keep an eye on him.

926
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:53,889
Capt. Mueller, thank you for your gesture.
lt was very kind.

927
01:18:54,267 --> 01:18:57,031
You gentlemen wouldn't trust
your own embalmer.

928
01:18:57,504 --> 01:19:00,530
Enjoy your next 24 hours.
They may be your last ones.

929
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:03,876
They're checking with Berlin.

930
01:19:15,222 --> 01:19:18,623
Did the officer who brought you here
ask your name?

931
01:19:19,559 --> 01:19:21,083
-No.
-Good.

932
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:25,354
You must promise
to keep your mouth shut.

933
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:28,260
Keep my mouth shut about what?

934
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:33,205
About the fact that you're....

935
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,764
A Jewess?

936
01:19:35,642 --> 01:19:37,872
ls it so difficult to say the word?

937
01:19:41,248 --> 01:19:44,149
l have nothing against you
because you are Jewish.

938
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:46,912
One can't choose one's parents.

939
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:50,047
-ls that what you mean?
-No, that is not what l mean.

940
01:19:51,391 --> 01:19:52,415
Sit down.

941
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:56,152
Sit down!

942
01:20:05,672 --> 01:20:06,934
That's my son.

943
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:09,270
He'd like you.

944
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:13,470
On the other hand, he might prefer
to lop off my head.

945
01:20:15,182 --> 01:20:17,810
Why do you resent being treated
with respect?

946
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:23,782
Let's see. Your name: ''Esther Levy.''

947
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:27,191
Levy won't do. What shall we call you?

948
01:20:27,761 --> 01:20:29,626
Cohen? Shapiro?

949
01:20:30,363 --> 01:20:34,197
Look, there's a long trip ahead.
Put a lid on your pride.

950
01:20:34,768 --> 01:20:36,702
lt's worth it to make yourself comfortable.

951
01:20:36,803 --> 01:20:38,668
And let you feel decent.

952
01:20:40,273 --> 01:20:41,467
lf you wish.

953
01:20:44,044 --> 01:20:45,875
Then lend me a needle and thread.

954
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:48,277
l'd like to make this outfit
a little more attractive...

955
01:20:48,348 --> 01:20:50,179
for the concentration camp.

956
01:20:55,822 --> 01:20:57,551
When we reach Bordeaux...

957
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:01,222
this report will be lost.

958
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:10,468
And with luck...

959
01:21:11,137 --> 01:21:14,573
perhaps you may find a way
to lose yourself there, too.

960
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:19,574
l'm sorry. lt's the most l can do.

961
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,519
Do you want to sleep with me?

962
01:21:30,423 --> 01:21:33,586
Or you're just doing this
because you're kindhearted?

963
01:21:36,696 --> 01:21:39,995
Young lady, even this kind
of impudence will not stop me...

964
01:21:40,066 --> 01:21:43,661
from treating you simply
as another member of the human race.

965
01:21:51,111 --> 01:21:52,237
All right.

966
01:21:54,047 --> 01:21:58,006
ln America, l lived
with a family named Goddard.

967
01:21:59,619 --> 01:22:03,282
Milkereit, since you are on the bridge,
you can take the captain by surprise.

968
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,790
-Alone?
-No, Boeck will be with you.

969
01:22:06,559 --> 01:22:10,723
Donkeyman, you and Hoffman
will overpower the guard on the rear deck.

970
01:22:10,964 --> 01:22:13,023
But how do we get
those prisoners with us?

971
01:22:13,099 --> 01:22:16,466
Well, l will have to find a way
to speak with them as soon as possible.

972
01:22:16,569 --> 01:22:19,060
l would first like to consider
all the risks before making--

973
01:22:19,139 --> 01:22:20,629
There is nothing to consider.

974
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:23,766
Consider how your face will look
with a piano wire around your neck...

975
01:22:23,877 --> 01:22:26,573
when Kruse sends his report
into the Gestapo.

976
01:22:29,115 --> 01:22:31,811
But without those prisoners,
we have no chance.

977
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:33,442
Not even with them.

978
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:39,050
lf we take over the ship, we are only
two days away from the American navy.

979
01:22:42,429 --> 01:22:45,057
You know what looks
very good to me now?

980
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,233
Starfish lsland.

981
01:22:50,403 --> 01:22:51,597
Donkeyman...

982
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:55,635
you said the odds against
this island were...

983
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:57,299
what, 15-to-1?

984
01:22:57,777 --> 01:22:59,836
What are they against this plan?

985
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:02,412
14-to-1 .

986
01:23:05,418 --> 01:23:07,249
We must make a decision.

987
01:23:08,788 --> 01:23:10,085
Yes.

988
01:23:11,091 --> 01:23:12,115
Let's go.

989
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:22,124
Miss Goddard, this is...

990
01:23:23,003 --> 01:23:24,595
Standard Leader Keil.

991
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:25,995
How do you do?

992
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:29,207
Miss Goddard is an American girl.
She studied in Germany.

993
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:32,367
Well, we are delighted
to have you with us.

994
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:40,319
ls it my insignia that disturbs her?

995
01:23:42,389 --> 01:23:45,119
-Captain, where is my room?
-Right here.

996
01:23:47,494 --> 01:23:51,521
lt's obvious that you share
the captain's sentiments about the SS.

997
01:23:52,332 --> 01:23:55,893
As l told Capt. Mueller,
it was a long voyage.

998
01:23:58,571 --> 01:23:59,629
Yes.

999
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,507
Chess partners are very difficult
to come by Mr. Keil.

1000
01:24:03,576 --> 01:24:04,702
Evidently.

1001
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:24,724
Miss Goddard?

1002
01:24:26,099 --> 01:24:28,567
-Miss Goddard?
-Who is it?

1003
01:24:28,668 --> 01:24:31,364
lt's Mr. Keil.
Could l speak with you one moment?

1004
01:24:31,538 --> 01:24:33,597
There is a crack under the door.

1005
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,673
lt should be easy
for you to crawl through it.

1006
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:43,348
At 7:00 every morning,
an officer and two crew members...

1007
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:45,350
will supervise the prisoners exercise.

1008
01:24:45,418 --> 01:24:48,353
After this duty, the weapons
will be locked in the ordinance room.

1009
01:24:48,788 --> 01:24:52,417
Now l understand the hatch covers over
the prisoners hold were closed last night.

1010
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:54,425
You must like steam baths.

1011
01:24:54,527 --> 01:24:56,893
From now on, the hatch covers
will remain partially open...

1012
01:24:56,963 --> 01:25:00,364
and therefore, the regular watch
in the area will be armed.

1013
01:25:01,301 --> 01:25:05,431
l acted for our well-being, sir,
not towards the enemy's.

1014
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:10,607
Well, l won't let it spoil my appetite
for breakfast.

1015
01:25:11,077 --> 01:25:12,704
l'm glad of that, sir.

1016
01:25:38,638 --> 01:25:42,005
There's international rules!
We got a right to be heard.

1017
01:25:42,108 --> 01:25:44,076
Shall we arrange it for them?

1018
01:25:48,181 --> 01:25:49,808
l would like to be there...

1019
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:53,317
when you try to convince
these birds to join the Gestapo.

1020
01:25:56,990 --> 01:26:00,084
Some day it will be a pleasure
to pay a visit to America.

1021
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,755
-This will be wonderful.
-Meanwhile, let's eat. Thank you.

1022
01:26:05,698 --> 01:26:07,598
Keep moving. Let's go.

1023
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:13,261
Keep moving! Call Dr. Ambach.

1024
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:16,772
Take him over to the hospital right away.
You, follow them.

1025
01:26:18,645 --> 01:26:23,446
Captain, emergency! A prisoner's hurt.
We can't rouse Dr. Ambach.

1026
01:26:25,718 --> 01:26:27,276
Get me the morphine.

1027
01:26:35,795 --> 01:26:38,855
lt's bad, but not as bad
as the racket you're making.

1028
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:42,968
-What's the matter?
-There's no morphine here.

1029
01:26:46,472 --> 01:26:47,666
l'll get it.

1030
01:26:53,713 --> 01:26:56,580
You can be of use. Go up there and help.

1031
01:27:18,271 --> 01:27:21,570
You, up here. Us, sweating in a dungeon.

1032
01:27:21,774 --> 01:27:24,766
-Your kind always wind up living rich.
-Shut up.

1033
01:27:25,411 --> 01:27:28,574
Shut up, you crackpot.
We're sick of hearing that garbage.

1034
01:27:28,681 --> 01:27:30,672
What's this? What do you mean?

1035
01:27:30,883 --> 01:27:32,578
He means l'm a Jew.

1036
01:27:36,422 --> 01:27:38,447
Where do you hide the ship's morphine?

1037
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:42,585
-This damn fever gets me now.
-Where is the morphine, Mr. Ambach?

1038
01:27:43,062 --> 01:27:46,520
Morphine? There is no morphine.

1039
01:27:51,037 --> 01:27:54,404
No, no, no. lt's mine.

1040
01:27:54,741 --> 01:27:58,370
l brought it aboard the ship myself.
lt's mine. This stuff's mine.

1041
01:27:58,444 --> 01:28:02,642
lt's private property. No!
You can't have that. Captain!

1042
01:28:02,749 --> 01:28:04,740
l'll die without it. l'll die.

1043
01:28:05,218 --> 01:28:06,879
You'll live, Mr. Ambach.

1044
01:28:09,656 --> 01:28:13,057
They told me voyage to China coast...

1045
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,059
only a few days.

1046
01:28:16,095 --> 01:28:17,562
They lied to me.

1047
01:28:18,464 --> 01:28:21,661
l had to take it. l had to take it.

1048
01:28:22,568 --> 01:28:23,592
l had to.

1049
01:28:40,987 --> 01:28:43,012
Do you want me to clean it now?

1050
01:28:43,156 --> 01:28:46,648
When a Jewish bitch takes over
the sick ward then....

1051
01:28:47,193 --> 01:28:50,128
Miss Levy is perfectly able
to attend to this.

1052
01:28:52,131 --> 01:28:53,621
Miss Levy?

1053
01:28:54,534 --> 01:28:55,933
You knew.

1054
01:28:56,869 --> 01:28:59,133
Have you thought of the effect
on the officers and men?

1055
01:28:59,205 --> 01:29:01,639
l didn't know it was contagious.

1056
01:29:02,575 --> 01:29:04,975
Now, what do you have to say about this?

1057
01:29:05,845 --> 01:29:07,142
l think you're out of your mind...

1058
01:29:07,246 --> 01:29:09,077
but, after all,
you are the master of the ship.

1059
01:29:09,148 --> 01:29:10,342
That l am.

1060
01:29:11,317 --> 01:29:14,650
Now, take care of it.
l'm sure you can do it better than l can.

1061
01:29:20,693 --> 01:29:23,526
You're saying that she will continue
to have a stage room?

1062
01:29:23,629 --> 01:29:25,597
That you will go on feeding her
in the salon?

1063
01:29:25,665 --> 01:29:27,292
The lady's privileges will remain.

1064
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:30,097
Now the steward will be glad
to serve your meals in your cabin...

1065
01:29:30,169 --> 01:29:31,261
if it's all too much for you.

1066
01:29:31,337 --> 01:29:34,636
-l must remind you of the consequences.
-l recognize that word.

1067
01:29:34,707 --> 01:29:37,608
lf all Germans had conducted
themselves like this...

1068
01:29:37,677 --> 01:29:40,805
-where do you suppose we'd be today?
-Certainly not where we are now.

1069
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,974
-You are speaking to a party member.
-This is not a party office.

1070
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:46,644
You had better remember
there's nothing chalked up against me.

1071
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,313
-Now don't you carry me--
-Not even an ounce of Jamaican rum.

1072
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:50,515
Now you listen to me!

1073
01:29:50,623 --> 01:29:53,456
l've been at sea too long for this.
l know all your talk.

1074
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:57,519
l'll take the responsibility for what l do.
You young men...

1075
01:29:59,499 --> 01:30:01,490
who keep the world breathless.

1076
01:30:02,869 --> 01:30:04,860
lt's your time, l know.

1077
01:30:06,906 --> 01:30:09,636
But to realize your dreams...

1078
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:13,304
you'll need something more than brutality.

1079
01:30:15,081 --> 01:30:17,879
You'll need, if you can manage it,
a little mercy.

1080
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,384
Now, what could you know of our dreams?

1081
01:30:35,735 --> 01:30:37,430
l'm all right now. Thanks.

1082
01:30:55,354 --> 01:30:56,548
l'm not going to hurt you.

1083
01:30:56,622 --> 01:30:58,385
l'm not going to hurt you. Listen.

1084
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:00,016
Just listen and be quiet.

1085
01:31:00,092 --> 01:31:02,959
lf you scream,
you will only place your life in danger.

1086
01:31:03,062 --> 01:31:05,030
Now, understand that l'm not an SS man.

1087
01:31:05,097 --> 01:31:07,429
l am a German,
working for the British lntelligence...

1088
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:09,558
and l am planning to take over this ship.

1089
01:31:09,635 --> 01:31:11,933
Now, l am going to take my hands away
from your mouth...

1090
01:31:12,038 --> 01:31:14,632
and l don't want you to scream.
Don't scream.

1091
01:31:18,377 --> 01:31:19,639
l'm not an SS man.

1092
01:31:19,745 --> 01:31:24,409
l'm working for British lntelligence.
l'm planning to take over this ship.

1093
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:25,815
l don't believe you.

1094
01:31:26,586 --> 01:31:28,076
You have no choice.

1095
01:31:28,154 --> 01:31:30,918
You are a Jew on your way to Germany.

1096
01:31:31,057 --> 01:31:34,220
And if you value your life,
you will need my help...

1097
01:31:34,293 --> 01:31:35,624
and l will need yours.

1098
01:31:35,728 --> 01:31:37,457
How can l be of help to you?

1099
01:31:37,563 --> 01:31:40,657
Well, l cannot take over this ship
without the American prisoners...

1100
01:31:40,766 --> 01:31:43,234
and l may need your help to contact them.

1101
01:31:43,302 --> 01:31:45,270
Why don't you contact them yourself?

1102
01:31:45,338 --> 01:31:46,600
l am going to try.

1103
01:31:46,672 --> 01:31:49,573
But the message exposing me
is on its way from Berlin.

1104
01:31:49,642 --> 01:31:52,133
And if it comes by 8:00 tonight,
when the watch changes...

1105
01:31:52,245 --> 01:31:55,146
then you will have to slip into the hold
and persuade them.

1106
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:57,944
They will not believe
any of the men with me.

1107
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:02,587
And if our plan succeeds, we'll be finished
with this idiotic war in a few days.

1108
01:32:02,655 --> 01:32:04,520
You think this war is idiotic?

1109
01:32:04,824 --> 01:32:06,416
All wars are idiotic.

1110
01:32:06,492 --> 01:32:08,323
One is not different from the other.

1111
01:32:09,262 --> 01:32:10,695
Then why are you here?

1112
01:32:10,796 --> 01:32:12,286
Certainly not by choice.

1113
01:32:12,598 --> 01:32:16,432
l was blackmailed by a Britisher
to the strains of Mozart.

1114
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:21,033
l am not concerned about this war.
l don't care who wins or loses.

1115
01:32:21,607 --> 01:32:23,939
But l am concerned about the Gestapo.

1116
01:32:24,677 --> 01:32:28,010
You have no idea
what these people are capable of.

1117
01:32:30,449 --> 01:32:31,473
Like....

1118
01:32:32,885 --> 01:32:36,514
Like maybe force me to have sex
with my brother?

1119
01:32:37,523 --> 01:32:38,990
Or something like that?

1120
01:32:40,526 --> 01:32:45,225
And maybe kill Bernie
if he's not able to have sex with me?

1121
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:50,397
And, then, maybe make me sleep
with all of them...

1122
01:32:51,637 --> 01:32:55,630
all 17 of them, hour after hour.

1123
01:33:00,913 --> 01:33:02,904
Quiet. Quiet.

1124
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:05,475
Be still.

1125
01:33:08,154 --> 01:33:11,590
While you were listening to your Mozart...

1126
01:33:12,425 --> 01:33:15,758
my mother and my father were marched...

1127
01:33:16,495 --> 01:33:19,396
to the gas chamber
where they were killed.

1128
01:33:19,865 --> 01:33:22,993
You want to tell me about the Gestapo?

1129
01:33:23,903 --> 01:33:25,871
Get out! Get out!

1130
01:33:25,938 --> 01:33:26,996
Be quiet.

1131
01:33:27,106 --> 01:33:28,903
-Get out!
-Quiet!

1132
01:33:29,308 --> 01:33:31,105
HeIIo, Midshipman EmiI Brinkmann...

1133
01:33:31,243 --> 01:33:35,202
your father, GeneraI Franz Brinkmann,
awarded the Knight's Cross with swords.

1134
01:33:35,281 --> 01:33:37,613
Engineer Mark Leicht,
we hope you are Iistening.

1135
01:33:37,717 --> 01:33:41,244
Your brother, Major Martin Leicht
awarded the Knight's Cross...

1136
01:33:41,354 --> 01:33:44,585
after a daring bombing mission
over Rostov on the Russian front.

1137
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:47,420
HeIIo, Capt. RoIf MueIIer,
on duty in the Far East...

1138
01:33:47,526 --> 01:33:49,585
your son, Lt. KarI MueIIer...

1139
01:33:49,695 --> 01:33:52,721
commanding a motor torpedo boat
off the French coast...

1140
01:33:52,798 --> 01:33:55,790
having sunk his fifth ship
in the Iast three months...

1141
01:33:55,901 --> 01:34:00,031
the Iatest, a soIo dayIight attack
which sank the British vesseI Carapace...

1142
01:34:00,106 --> 01:34:01,733
awarded the Knight's Cross.

1143
01:34:01,807 --> 01:34:03,866
-Wonderful.
-Congratulations, sir.

1144
01:34:03,943 --> 01:34:05,035
This is a great moment.

1145
01:34:05,111 --> 01:34:08,569
lt's only fitting to say, sir, that everyone
in your command feels honored.

1146
01:34:08,648 --> 01:34:10,707
That's very kind of you, Mr. Kruse.
Thank you.

1147
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:14,246
The Carapace.
Let's see what's her tonnage.

1148
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,810
lt must be in the Talbot.

1149
01:34:15,921 --> 01:34:18,788
Congratulations, Captain.
lt must be a proud moment.

1150
01:34:18,891 --> 01:34:19,949
Thank you, Mr. Keil.

1151
01:34:20,059 --> 01:34:21,219
Come in, gentlemen.

1152
01:34:21,994 --> 01:34:23,461
Congratulations, Captain.

1153
01:34:24,096 --> 01:34:26,394
-Congratulations.
-lt's wonderful.

1154
01:34:29,101 --> 01:34:32,400
-Carapace on Page 131, sir.
-To your health, sir.

1155
01:34:32,505 --> 01:34:34,405
-Good luck, Captain.
-And to your son.

1156
01:34:34,473 --> 01:34:35,599
To your health, sir.

1157
01:34:35,675 --> 01:34:37,302
He must be quite a seaman.

1158
01:34:51,257 --> 01:34:52,451
HeiI Hitler!

1159
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:54,615
HeiI! HeiI!

1160
01:35:00,599 --> 01:35:02,624
Hail the Knight's Cross.

1161
01:35:06,972 --> 01:35:08,940
He's a crazy drunk.

1162
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,504
HeiI!

1163
01:35:15,648 --> 01:35:17,616
-Half the ship can hear you.
-Can they?

1164
01:35:17,683 --> 01:35:20,880
Tell me about the consequences.
Tell me the consequences.

1165
01:35:22,455 --> 01:35:24,013
Read me the sentence.

1166
01:35:25,624 --> 01:35:27,353
What is the worst?

1167
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,892
To fight war alongside you!

1168
01:35:32,064 --> 01:35:33,395
Milkereit...

1169
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,468
you poor fool.

1170
01:35:36,535 --> 01:35:38,901
Raised your voice against them.

1171
01:35:39,572 --> 01:35:42,336
You don't know about the consequences.

1172
01:35:50,349 --> 01:35:52,044
Wouldn't it be wonderful...

1173
01:35:52,151 --> 01:35:55,416
if it turned out
you're not an SS man at all?

1174
01:36:05,197 --> 01:36:08,064
Oh, they will turn you into one of them...

1175
01:36:08,567 --> 01:36:10,228
into a cannibal.

1176
01:36:13,272 --> 01:36:17,436
The most wonderful, gentle boy....

1177
01:36:20,846 --> 01:36:22,507
HeiI cannibals!

1178
01:36:24,517 --> 01:36:25,609
HeiI!

1179
01:36:26,218 --> 01:36:27,242
HeiI!

1180
01:36:29,722 --> 01:36:31,781
Take your stations. Everybody.

1181
01:36:31,957 --> 01:36:33,447
Come with me.

1182
01:36:33,559 --> 01:36:35,891
Tell all the officers to assemble
in the salon at once.

1183
01:36:35,961 --> 01:36:37,019
Yes, sir.

1184
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:41,396
The point we spoke about.
lt's here, and l need you as a witness.

1185
01:36:48,407 --> 01:36:49,567
Now, go on.

1186
01:37:04,056 --> 01:37:06,115
Things are falling apart.

1187
01:37:06,592 --> 01:37:08,389
Keil can't do it.

1188
01:37:09,628 --> 01:37:10,890
l will.

1189
01:37:15,835 --> 01:37:18,998
Sure, he is on a spree, but he'll work it off.

1190
01:37:20,172 --> 01:37:22,800
l've made this entry in the ship's diary.

1191
01:37:22,908 --> 01:37:26,344
''Capt. Mueller is mentally
and physically irresponsible...

1192
01:37:26,445 --> 01:37:29,073
''due to alcoholic over-indulgence.''

1193
01:37:29,248 --> 01:37:30,977
Dr. Ambach will confirm this.

1194
01:37:31,517 --> 01:37:34,145
l wouldn't take coke-head's diagnosis
of a cockroach.

1195
01:37:34,253 --> 01:37:37,188
Mr. Branner, Mueller's illness is chronic.

1196
01:37:37,957 --> 01:37:40,790
He was drunk
when his last ship was torpedoed.

1197
01:37:41,927 --> 01:37:43,827
lt's hard to believe.

1198
01:37:43,996 --> 01:37:45,327
Mr. Keil?

1199
01:37:45,865 --> 01:37:46,923
Yeah.

1200
01:37:47,366 --> 01:37:50,130
lt's unfortunate, but he is correct.

1201
01:37:51,303 --> 01:37:55,364
And under the circumstances, l think
we must follow Mr. Kruse.

1202
01:37:58,177 --> 01:38:01,977
For the protection of the ship,
l am now taking command.

1203
01:38:02,948 --> 01:38:05,314
lnform your men. Dismissed.

1204
01:38:05,384 --> 01:38:06,544
Capt. Kruse?

1205
01:38:06,652 --> 01:38:08,950
Captain, it's for my health.

1206
01:38:09,021 --> 01:38:11,888
Mueller didn't understand this.
l can't live without it.

1207
01:38:11,991 --> 01:38:14,482
l'll see you get what you need,
but it won't be morphine.

1208
01:38:17,563 --> 01:38:20,862
This one here was caught trying to sneak
into the prisoners' hatch.

1209
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,394
Really?

1210
01:38:22,568 --> 01:38:25,196
Well, perhaps that's where
she prefers to be.

1211
01:38:29,074 --> 01:38:31,565
Take her down in the hold with the others.

1212
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:37,974
Go ahead.

1213
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:43,811
l don't mean to interfere,
but this is disgusting.

1214
01:38:43,923 --> 01:38:45,720
Thank you very much
for your help, Mr. Keil.

1215
01:38:45,824 --> 01:38:46,848
Yeah.

1216
01:38:54,033 --> 01:38:55,762
-Steward?
-Yes, sir.

1217
01:38:56,368 --> 01:38:59,826
-l have been told that you are now--
-Correct. Here.

1218
01:39:00,205 --> 01:39:02,537
Sew the fourth stripe on the sleeve.

1219
01:39:02,608 --> 01:39:04,098
-lt's regulations.
-Yes, sir.

1220
01:39:34,406 --> 01:39:36,237
lf this works out...

1221
01:39:37,242 --> 01:39:41,542
l want a front row seat
when we nail Kruse to the mast.

1222
01:39:43,148 --> 01:39:45,207
-Are the men ready?
-Yes.

1223
01:39:45,584 --> 01:39:46,608
They will be.

1224
01:39:47,653 --> 01:39:50,747
But suppose the girl can't persuade
those prisoners?

1225
01:39:50,823 --> 01:39:53,587
Then l'll have to try to get down there
when the watch changes...

1226
01:39:53,659 --> 01:39:55,149
and persuade them myself.

1227
01:39:56,228 --> 01:39:58,822
All right, but that will be a while.

1228
01:39:59,298 --> 01:40:01,789
Suppose we believe this guy Keil.

1229
01:40:02,134 --> 01:40:03,761
What's his plan?

1230
01:40:03,836 --> 01:40:05,736
You start a fire down here.

1231
01:40:05,804 --> 01:40:06,998
Then you scream your lungs out.

1232
01:40:07,106 --> 01:40:09,438
You climb up the ladder,
and when you get to the top...

1233
01:40:09,508 --> 01:40:10,668
you yell, run, and scatter.

1234
01:40:10,776 --> 01:40:12,334
Are you kidding, lady?

1235
01:40:12,444 --> 01:40:15,106
They'll be waiting up there
to shoot us full of holes.

1236
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:18,809
No. The fire will confuse the guards,
and Keil's men will overcome them.

1237
01:40:18,917 --> 01:40:22,250
Honey, you can't win a battle
just by yelling. You need guns.

1238
01:40:22,421 --> 01:40:23,820
We'll get guns.

1239
01:40:23,922 --> 01:40:26,152
Guns, guns.
Where are they gonna get guns?

1240
01:40:26,258 --> 01:40:27,850
One of the officers is with us.

1241
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,622
He'll attack the captain and take the keys
to the ordnance room.

1242
01:40:30,696 --> 01:40:34,029
The whole stunt's cockeyed.
Let them try it alone.

1243
01:40:34,433 --> 01:40:36,663
They're outnumbered. lt's nine against 40.

1244
01:40:36,769 --> 01:40:37,963
So?

1245
01:40:38,037 --> 01:40:41,973
So we join them, huh?
And then it's only 2-to-1 against us.

1246
01:40:42,041 --> 01:40:43,099
That's enough.

1247
01:40:44,676 --> 01:40:47,008
Let's suppose we make this Keil circle.

1248
01:40:47,112 --> 01:40:50,309
We get a cup of coffee
and a first class ticket to the Golden Gate.

1249
01:40:50,449 --> 01:40:53,213
-Then what?
-Then we get good and drunk.

1250
01:40:54,386 --> 01:40:56,354
Sleep for a month, huh?
Get a bath tub of beer.

1251
01:40:56,455 --> 01:40:59,686
We'll see if the girls
are still at Shany's bar.

1252
01:40:59,792 --> 01:41:01,384
That's for me. l say aye.

1253
01:41:01,493 --> 01:41:02,892
Well, don't be such a hero.

1254
01:41:02,995 --> 01:41:05,691
You'll get a kiss and a drink
and two weeks shore leave.

1255
01:41:05,798 --> 01:41:07,959
And after that, you'll be back
on the frontlines again.

1256
01:41:08,033 --> 01:41:10,365
Swimming in burning oil
and boiling like a mackerel.

1257
01:41:10,469 --> 01:41:12,630
l say, let's vote on it. And l'm for it.

1258
01:41:12,704 --> 01:41:14,831
-l'm with you.
-Good man. What do you say?

1259
01:41:14,907 --> 01:41:15,965
l'll go along, fellas.

1260
01:41:16,041 --> 01:41:17,508
-Okay.
-That's it. Come on, huh?

1261
01:41:17,576 --> 01:41:20,409
-All right, l'm in.
-Ten, huh?

1262
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,002
-Against five.
-Majority rules.

1263
01:41:22,081 --> 01:41:23,742
-Yeah.
-The hell it does.

1264
01:41:23,849 --> 01:41:25,009
This ain't the Congress.

1265
01:41:25,084 --> 01:41:27,575
-Okay, man. Then we'll try it without you.
-The hell you will.

1266
01:41:27,686 --> 01:41:29,210
You blow this, and they'll kill us all.

1267
01:41:29,321 --> 01:41:30,345
That's not true.

1268
01:41:30,422 --> 01:41:32,982
Come on. Do you think those bastards
will string you up...

1269
01:41:33,058 --> 01:41:35,151
and serve us ice cream
just because we laid off?

1270
01:41:35,227 --> 01:41:36,854
-Listen--
-Start a fire here...

1271
01:41:36,929 --> 01:41:39,420
and they'll be damn sure
every one of us is in on it.

1272
01:41:39,531 --> 01:41:40,555
He's right.

1273
01:41:44,169 --> 01:41:45,830
Look, l'm sorry.

1274
01:41:46,105 --> 01:41:48,266
We'd take the chance, you see...

1275
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:51,168
but it'd have to be all of us.

1276
01:41:52,444 --> 01:41:54,844
l'd rather take my chances
in a prison camp.

1277
01:41:54,913 --> 01:41:57,108
Hell, l'd like to take mine right here.

1278
01:41:57,216 --> 01:41:58,877
-You and me both.
-Sure.

1279
01:41:58,951 --> 01:42:02,250
Don't look so worried, baby.
We're all nice guys.

1280
01:42:02,788 --> 01:42:03,846
Sure.

1281
01:42:04,089 --> 01:42:07,081
You kept too much to yourself
on the old BIue DoIphin.

1282
01:42:07,192 --> 01:42:10,127
lf you'd spent a little time with us,
you might have had some fun.

1283
01:42:10,229 --> 01:42:13,255
And, baby, we've got nothing but time
from now on.

1284
01:42:13,365 --> 01:42:15,026
Are you kidding? Get your hands back.

1285
01:42:23,976 --> 01:42:26,035
There's one thing you're good for.

1286
01:42:31,216 --> 01:42:32,740
Stop it. Break it up.

1287
01:42:38,323 --> 01:42:40,553
You can have it if you want it.

1288
01:42:54,106 --> 01:42:55,232
And you.

1289
01:42:56,909 --> 01:42:59,139
Or you. Join the others.

1290
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:10,845
Make them keep their word.

1291
01:43:12,591 --> 01:43:14,081
Make them keep it.

1292
01:46:39,231 --> 01:46:41,358
-Mr. Kruse?
-Yeah?

1293
01:46:43,969 --> 01:46:46,563
Sir, a radio message from Adm. Wendel.

1294
01:46:46,671 --> 01:46:47,797
Wendel?

1295
01:46:57,549 --> 01:46:58,982
Thank you.

1296
01:47:03,722 --> 01:47:06,657
l'll handle the so-called Mr. Keil.

1297
01:47:12,164 --> 01:47:14,098
Milkereit! Milkereit!

1298
01:47:27,913 --> 01:47:32,247
Now you will kindly tell me
what this is all about.

1299
01:47:38,290 --> 01:47:40,349
l can start a new one now.

1300
01:47:40,525 --> 01:47:41,787
You see?

1301
01:47:42,861 --> 01:47:44,294
lt's very nice.

1302
01:47:49,434 --> 01:47:50,594
Yes. Branner.

1303
01:48:24,402 --> 01:48:25,801
Fire! Fire!

1304
01:48:26,938 --> 01:48:28,838
Brandt, come with me.

1305
01:48:29,007 --> 01:48:31,100
Lutz, you cover them.

1306
01:48:33,745 --> 01:48:35,679
Donkeyman, the ordnance room.

1307
01:49:08,313 --> 01:49:09,541
Surrender!

1308
01:49:09,648 --> 01:49:11,013
All right! All right!

1309
01:49:11,116 --> 01:49:13,346
We give up here. Don't shoot.

1310
01:49:15,554 --> 01:49:17,146
We are finished.

1311
01:49:24,529 --> 01:49:25,723
Come up.

1312
01:49:31,503 --> 01:49:33,198
Up. Get in line.

1313
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,237
All right.

1314
01:50:09,941 --> 01:50:12,501
Let's find the other two. Branner?

1315
01:50:13,111 --> 01:50:15,705
Mr. Branner, take the engine room.

1316
01:50:16,014 --> 01:50:17,447
Cornelson, the foredeck.

1317
01:50:21,553 --> 01:50:24,181
There is a rubber boat.

1318
01:50:24,255 --> 01:50:25,620
Midships.

1319
01:50:26,758 --> 01:50:30,057
We can heave it over the side
and jump after it.

1320
01:50:30,695 --> 01:50:33,095
We'll disappear in two minutes.

1321
01:50:35,367 --> 01:50:36,698
Come on.

1322
01:50:37,569 --> 01:50:39,127
We can make it.

1323
01:50:41,206 --> 01:50:42,434
Why not?

1324
01:50:47,045 --> 01:50:49,138
Now l blow up the ship.

1325
01:50:56,154 --> 01:50:57,382
Do it.

1326
01:51:11,169 --> 01:51:12,966
Anybody seen my bird?

1327
01:51:13,071 --> 01:51:14,766
l can't find him.

1328
01:51:16,074 --> 01:51:18,508
My baby hates the sound of guns.

1329
01:51:19,177 --> 01:51:20,769
Scares the feathers off him.

1330
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,606
Where's Keil?

1331
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:30,115
Where's Keil?

1332
01:51:30,388 --> 01:51:31,480
Keil?

1333
01:51:34,559 --> 01:51:35,992
Where's Keil?

1334
01:51:40,465 --> 01:51:41,727
Where's Keil?

1335
01:51:42,901 --> 01:51:45,131
He is hiding in the propeller shaft.

1336
01:51:45,937 --> 01:51:46,961
Move!

1337
01:51:47,172 --> 01:51:48,969
-Take the prisoners below.
-Yes, sir.

1338
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:04,411
Search the lifeboats.

1339
01:54:12,083 --> 01:54:13,744
Capt. Mueller?

1340
01:54:15,553 --> 01:54:17,885
-So Adm. Wendel was right.
-Yeah.

1341
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:20,653
But there is no time for this.

1342
01:54:21,559 --> 01:54:22,890
Why not?

1343
01:54:23,628 --> 01:54:26,153
-Your mutiny has failed.
-Not yet.

1344
01:54:26,564 --> 01:54:28,429
You once said that...

1345
01:54:29,601 --> 01:54:32,399
the worst consequence would be
to have to fight...

1346
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:34,563
alongside men like Kruse.

1347
01:54:34,839 --> 01:54:35,999
There is another way.

1348
01:54:36,241 --> 01:54:39,802
There is a rendezvous point where
American warships are waiting for us...

1349
01:54:39,911 --> 01:54:43,108
at 14 degrees North, 175 degrees East.

1350
01:54:44,015 --> 01:54:45,778
You have a choice.

1351
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:50,844
Whatever else l am, l'm not a traitor.

1352
01:54:52,323 --> 01:54:54,188
Neither was your son.

1353
01:54:59,364 --> 01:55:02,458
Get out. Get out.

1354
01:55:03,134 --> 01:55:04,999
Yeah, l will.

1355
01:55:09,641 --> 01:55:11,268
There! On the bridge!

1356
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:14,143
Out! Get out!

1357
01:55:14,212 --> 01:55:15,304
Move!

1358
01:55:18,316 --> 01:55:19,442
No.

1359
01:55:19,617 --> 01:55:21,016
Mr. Keil, please, don't.

1360
01:55:47,845 --> 01:55:50,040
The engine room is torn to pieces.

1361
01:55:50,214 --> 01:55:51,681
She's flooding.

1362
01:55:51,983 --> 01:55:53,007
Abandon ship.

1363
01:55:56,387 --> 01:55:58,150
Abandon ship!

1364
01:56:01,993 --> 01:56:03,858
Abandon ship!

1365
01:56:05,596 --> 01:56:06,995
Hurry up!

1366
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:17,502
Hurry up!

1367
01:56:23,915 --> 01:56:25,075
Here.

1368
01:56:27,552 --> 01:56:28,917
Over here.

1369
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:30,687
But, sir, please--

1370
01:56:30,755 --> 01:56:34,191
Now l am where l belong.
l intend to stay here.

1371
01:56:34,359 --> 01:56:36,259
Now over the side, all of you.

1372
01:56:41,632 --> 01:56:43,759
-Captain.
-Do as l say.

1373
01:57:43,094 --> 01:57:44,493
Mr. Kruse!

1374
01:57:45,329 --> 01:57:46,694
Over here!

1375
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,624
Over here!

1376
01:58:01,112 --> 01:58:02,306
Here.

1377
01:58:04,816 --> 01:58:06,215
Come on, Mr. Kruse.

1378
01:58:06,951 --> 01:58:08,350
Over here.

1379
01:58:58,169 --> 01:58:59,830
Capt. Mueller.

1380
01:59:44,315 --> 01:59:45,714
Mr. Keil?

1381
01:59:47,451 --> 01:59:49,476
You won't need that raft for a while.

1382
01:59:49,587 --> 01:59:51,282
But what is it?

1383
01:59:52,623 --> 01:59:54,284
What's happened?

1384
01:59:54,492 --> 01:59:55,754
Well...

1385
01:59:57,161 --> 02:00:00,324
the lard. lt solidified.

1386
02:00:00,831 --> 02:00:02,423
Plugged up the hole.

1387
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:05,298
How much longer will we remain afloat?

1388
02:00:05,803 --> 02:00:08,067
Well, it's lasted two hours.

1389
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,068
Maybe another two, maybe 10...

1390
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:14,505
unless we break up first.

1391
02:00:17,481 --> 02:00:18,914
Ten hours.

1392
02:00:23,354 --> 02:00:25,914
ln what direction are we drifting?

1393
02:00:27,758 --> 02:00:30,318
We couldn't drift that far in days.

1394
02:00:30,595 --> 02:00:34,326
lt would take a warship going full ahead
a good six or seven hours.

1395
02:00:34,432 --> 02:00:36,161
Capt. Mueller...

1396
02:00:37,501 --> 02:00:42,302
l don't suppose you would consider
sending a radio message for me?

1397
02:00:45,009 --> 02:00:47,534
You're not very subtle, Mr. Keil.

1398
02:00:49,013 --> 02:00:51,174
But l must admire your courage.

1399
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:54,845
You're the one with courage, Mueller.

1400
02:00:57,722 --> 02:00:59,451
lt takes real courage...

1401
02:01:00,625 --> 02:01:03,958
to see your son
turn into a merciless fanatic...

1402
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:10,690
and still believe in your mildewed
concepts of the fatherland.

1403
02:01:13,738 --> 02:01:15,171
l envy you.

1404
02:01:15,506 --> 02:01:18,066
l wish l had so much to believe in.

1405
02:01:23,247 --> 02:01:26,978
lf you have nothing to believe in,
why did you blow up the ship?

1406
02:01:31,522 --> 02:01:33,752
That doesn't matter now.

1407
02:03:10,888 --> 02:03:11,855
English
