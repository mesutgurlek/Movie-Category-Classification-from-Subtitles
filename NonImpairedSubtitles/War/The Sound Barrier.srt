a sort of intellectual look.

jumped on by 20-plus Focke-Wulfs.

22
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,249
I tried to pull out
of a flat-out dive just now.

as if the controls were reversed.

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,874
And were they?

28
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,749
Of course not, you clot,
or I wouldn't be here, would I?

29
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,499
There was a lot of buffeting too.

as if I'd suddenly run into a...

00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:07,166

00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,833
Really?

33
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:12,541
Why don't you marry her?

34
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,374
You know, all prospective
father-in-laws are a bit frightening.

35
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,708
- After all, mine was.
- Yours wasn't the great John Ridgefield.

36
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,874
What, just because he makes
a few aeroplanes?

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,041
A few aeroplanes? He owns
a hundred ruddy acres of factory,

38
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:28,583
he's a millionaire twice over
and Sue's his only daughter.

Anyway, heiress or not,
I'm meeting her train,

40
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,708
I shall take her for a quiet little drive

41
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:36,458
and ask her to marry me
simply, firmly and directly.

What's the matter?

43

Oh, I don't know, I just thought it was

- Er, no. As a man.

Oh. Well, I... I told you, I...

- Why Ridgefields, though?

You're thinner.

to pick a flyer.

you were my father-in-law.

103

Oh, your dad's at a board meeting.

104
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,999
I was asked to tell you
he won't see you before dinner.

105
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,291
- Are you coming to dinner?
- No, I haven't been asked.

106
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,124
- Oh.
- I suppose he wants to keep it family.

107
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,041
But you are family, Will.

108

- How many people work here?
- 12,000.

115
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,874
- 12,000?
- Yes, we've got another 8,000 at Hillbank.

117

120
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,374
Is this top-secret
going to win the war, Will?

121
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,624
A good deal more than win the war,
if you ask me.

122
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:49,416
- Hello, Factor, how are you?
- Very well, thank you, madam.

123

- This is my husband.

I've been "Miss" for far too long.

I simply love being madam.

126
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,249
However hideous your threshold,
do you know what my duty is?

127
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,208
- No, what?
- I'll show you.

128
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,458
- Tony, no!
- Hang on to your hat.

129
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,958

You're not strong enough.

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,416
- Not strong enough?
- No, you're not.

133
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,333
- Which way?
- This way, sir.

134
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:22,958
- Right, here we go.
- This way.

136

141
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,083
Chris!

142
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,791
- How are you, darling?
- Hello, Sue.

143
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:00,958
- Meet your new brother-in-law.
- How do you do?

144
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:03,791
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Too late to say congratulations?

145
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,708
- Not at all.
- Congratulations.

146
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,833
- Oh, Chris, what is that?
- You ought to know. It's the RAF badge.

147
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,041
- You get it when you pass the interview.
- Oh, I had no idea.

148
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,708
I thought you were going
into the navy.

149
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,958
I've changed my mind.
Did you get my present?

150
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,874
Oh, darling, thank you so much.
It was a lovely present.

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,249
- We adored it, didn't we?

00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:30,583
In the meanwhile, I'm learning to fly.

156
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,666
Dad's put one of his ex-pilots on
to teaching me over at Hillbank.

157
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:34,874
Tiger Moth.

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,416
Darling, how exciting.
Have you gone solo yet?

159
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,499
Not yet. I think I may tomorrow.

160
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,333
- Whisky?
- No, thank you, darling.

161
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,958
Not for me, thanks.
No, it's too early.

162
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:45,083
Since when have you taken
to swigging whisky?

163
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,833
I'm not at school now, Sue,
I'm in the RAF.

164
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,458
Well, practically, anyway.

165
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,124
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Good luck tomorrow.

166
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,749
- Thank you.
- How many hours dual have you done?

167
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,333
Rather a lot, 14.

168
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,791
That's not too bad. I remember a fellow
who did 20 before they passed him.

169
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,374
I don't suppose his name
was Ridgefield, though.

170
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,416
How many hours dual did you do
before you went solo?

171
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:10,083
Tony's an exceptional case.
One of the great geniuses of the air.

172
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,083
Ah, like Dad.

173
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,666
He went solo after only
two-and-a-half hours dual.

174
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:17,708
Really?

175
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:22,791
Would you like to know something
rather shocking? I get airsick.

176
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,499
You shouldn't worry,
you'll soon get over that.

177
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,541
- Yes?
- Yes.

178
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,249
(Chiming)

179
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,208
- What the heck is that?
- Dressing gong.

180
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,124
Chris, give me a quarter of an hour
for my bath,

181
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,999
and then come up
and talk to me, will you?

182
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:40,833
- I won't be a second.
- Mm-hm.

183
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:47,291
- Approve?
- Terrific.

184
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:50,083
He's just been telling me about
that do on the Gestapo prison.

185
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,208
You must have used a thumbscrew
to get that out of him.

186
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:54,708
I had to, practically.
It was a wonderful thing, Sue.

187
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:57,916
They had to come in at 50 feet
and fly slap down the main street.

188
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:00,124
But of course you'll know it all.

189
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,291
I'll be able to shoot a line
about my new brother-in-law now.

190
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,374
Looks as if I'll need one.

191
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,708
You're a bit unhappy about it all,
aren't you, darling?

192
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:15,958
Oh, no. Not really.

193
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,416
Why don't you reapply
for a ground job?

194
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,958
- What would Dad say if I did that?
- Well, does it matter?

195
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,958
You know it does.

196
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,833
Anyway, I don't want to let him down,
Sue. Heaven knows I don't.

197
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,541
- Chris.
- Hm?

198
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,874
Would you let me talk to him?

199
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,374
No, thanks awfully, Sue.
If anyone's got to talk to him, I've got to.

200
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,583
As a matter of fact, I half thought
I might tackle him about it tonight.

201
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,166
Not about a ground job,
I mean RAF ground job.

202
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:53,374
- But, well, commandos or something.
- Commandos?

203
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,749
Well, I've jolly well got to show him
it isn't a matter of guts.

204
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:02,666
Look, you're either born to fly
or you're not. I'm not, I'm really not.

205
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:09,458
Darling, you go downstairs
and give yourself another whisky,

206
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,708
then take him aside
and tell him exactly how you feel.

207
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:15,583
- It's going to be jolly difficult.
- Well, I'll be there behind you.

208
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:32,124
- Darling. I'd almost forgotten.
- Come on, you two.

209
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,499
Here's to you both.

210
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,166
- To us.
- To us.

211
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,291
- (J. R.) You can tell them that from me.
- Father.

212
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:43,374
(Man) I don't like it, J. R. We may find
the Ministry will never agree to it at all.

213
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,791
(J. R.) There's a simple answer.
We stop production on the 696 altogether.

214
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:49,999
- Nervous?
- Nervous? I'm scared stiff.

215
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,083
- I haven't a second. Good night.
- (Man) Good night, J. R.

216
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:56,791
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Susan.

217
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:04,249
- This is Tony.
- So, this is Tony.

218
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:08,208
The DFC and Bar I know about.
What's the AFC for?

219
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,291
Oh, just for bumbling around.

220
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,833
They don't usually give that
for bumbling around.

221
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,499
Well, I'm very glad
to meet you at last, Tony.

222
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,999
I must say, I'm surprised at Susan
falling for a flyer.

223
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,541
Christopher, lad,
I've just had Fletcher on the phone.

224
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,583
He says he hopes
you may go solo tomorrow.

225
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,624
- Yes, Dad, I know.
- Well done.

226
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,749
Who knows, we may make
a pilot of you yet.

227
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,666
- What time is it to be?
- At 10:30.

228
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,499
Well, let's go in.

229
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:42,416
You sit here, will you, Tony?
Place of honour.

230
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,749
- Quite a room, eh?
- Yes, quite a room.

231
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,833
I hope you like the pictures.
There's some of them quite well known.

232
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,958
Of course, Susan hates them all,
I know that.

233
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,374
Yes, I sent her to Oxford
to get an education,

234
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,999
and all she comes back with is
a passion for donkey-tailed daubs

235
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,208
and modernistic music.

236
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,416
Where she gets her tastes from,
I don't know.

237
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:02,041
- Certainly not from me or her mother.
- Mother liked modern music very much.

238
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,624
First I've heard of it.
If she did, she didn't let on to me.

239
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,999
- No.
- This is lobster Dominique.

240
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,999
A sort of speciality de la maison.

241
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,791
No, not for Mr Christopher.
He's flying tomorrow.

242
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,041
Fletcher says young Jackson's
gone solo after six hours.

243
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,083
Yes, he's rather good.

244
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:21,916
Is this fellow running a sort
of flying kindergarten over there, sir?

245
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,833
No, just the two boys.
Jackson, that's my head of airframes,

246
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:29,333
his son's waiting to go into the RAF too,
so I've let Fletcher take him on as well.

247
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,749
Won't do them any harm
to get a start, eh, Tony?

248
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,999
No, you'll probably shatter
your RAF instructor

249
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,833
by going solo in about 20 minutes.

250
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,999
That's right, something like that
won't look so bad on the record.

251
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,208
14 hours wouldn't have been so good.

252
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,666
(Distant jet engine thrust)

253
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,624
That's the same noise
we heard this afternoon.

254
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,499
- It comes from the test-beds, doesn't it?
- Yes, I heard you were asking questions.

255
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,624
Well, I tell you what. I'm giving
this party down at the works,

256
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,208
and on our way - well, you're
a member of the family now -

257
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:04,749
I don't suppose it'll do any harm
for you to have a look at our little secret.

258
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,541
(Thrust continues)

259
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,958
I think it's the most exciting sound
I've ever heard.

260
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:12,374
It isn't only the sound
that's exciting, Tony boy.

261
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,249
- Evening, Joe.
- Good evening, J. R.

262
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,874
- How's the missus?
- She's all right. That stuffs done her good.

263
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,374
- Told you it would. Good evening, Mike.
- Good evening, J. R.

264
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,499
Hm. Put up the lights.

265
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:39,708
- What the heck is it, sir?
- It's the aircraft engine of the future.

266
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,833
- Where's the propeller?
- There is no propeller.

267
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,749
How does it keep the aircraft
in the air, then?

268
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,708
- By propulsion.
- Propulsion?

269
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:49,624
Yes. Jet propulsion.
Come on, I'll show you.

270
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,583
You two had better stay there.

271
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,458
- By the way, don't call me sir.
- What do I call you?

272
00:19:57,584 --> 00:20:01,124
Susan calls me Father, Chris calls me
Dad. You can take your choice.

273
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:08,083
Now, this is something
quite extraordinary.

274
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:12,749
Like all great inventions,
from the wheel to radar, perfectly simple.

275
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,208
Yes, you can smile, I know
it looks complicated, but the beauty is

276
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:19,583
how little there is to it
and how much power comes out of it.

277
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:23,291
Now, there's a fan here
in the front which draws in air.

278
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,999
- The air's heated here with paraffin.
- Paraffin?

279
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,874
Ordinary paraffin.
Hot air blows out here at the end.

280
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,333
It comes out at such terrific force
that that alone drives the aircraft.

281
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:37,416
- Who invented it? One of your men?
- No, a chap called Whittle.

282
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,458
- Whittle? Englishman?
- Yes.

283
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:44,083
We aren't the only firm working on them.
De Havilland and Rolls are ahead of us.

284
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,083
(Klaxon blares)

285
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:02,083
(Engine warms up)

286
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,583
(Thrust intensifies)

287
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,958
Excuse me.

288
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:09,499
(Engine turns off)

289
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,749
Well, Susie,
how do you like our new toy?

290
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:16,416
- What did you think of it, Chris lad?
- Wizard, wasn't it?

291
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,958
- Wizard, Dad.
- Come on, we'll be late for the party.

292
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,499
Come on, now.

293
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,541
Come on.

294
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,124
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, J. R.

295
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:45,083
I'm getting out now.
Are you ready for the joyride?

296
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:46,249
Yes.

297
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,749
Sure you wouldn't like to have
another circuit with me?

298
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,124
No, thanks.

299
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:55,166
You'd rather not have me bawling
in your ear, eh, I suppose?

300
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,541
- Are we in time, Chris?
- Bang on.

301
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,583
- Thanks for coming.
- Is that your rival?

302
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:06,041
Yes. Good approach.

303
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,791
- Good morning, Fletcher.
- Morning.

304
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,541
- Have some food with us afterwards.
- Thanks, I'd love to.

305
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:14,291
- All set?
- There's nothing to it.

306
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,208
All the best, darling.

307
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:21,874
By the way, Ridgefield, just for once
you can make any sort of landing you like.

308
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,666
I'm going to have a drink.
Only try to get her down in one piece,

309
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,333
there's a good chap.

(Engine purrs)

311
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,416
A very bad turn.

312
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:33,708
Hm, better.

313
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:59,166
Hasn't he learned anything at all?

314
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:24,041
He'll be all right.
You can't get hurt from those things.

315
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,749

316
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,208

317
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,916
- Chris!
- Sue! Sue, stay here!

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,041
What about that?

322
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,374
Why, it's fantastic.

323
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,583
- It's the future 901?
- That's it.

324
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,874
- What's her landing speed?
- It's high at the moment,

325
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,208
but we're working on that.

326
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:57,749
Well, I have to go to the works at 1:00
so I shan't be back before your train goes,

327
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,708
so I'll say goodbye now.

328
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,833
Goodbye, Tony, it's nice to have you
in the family. Especially now.

329
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,624
Thanks, it's nice being in the family.

330
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,208
- Come and see me again soon.
- I will.

331
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:09,583
You... You know how I feel
about this awful business.

332
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,416
Mm. I had Fletcher
on the phone today,

333
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,291
he says it need never
have caught fire at all

334
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,416
if he hadn't forgotten
to switch off.

335
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:21,083
- Heaven knows he had plenty of time.
- Here, I'm awfully sorry.

336
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,166
- What are your plans for after the war?
- Plans?

337
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,416
I only ask because
if you've nothing definite in mind,

338
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:29,374
I'd like you to know there's always
a job at Ridgefields for you.

339
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,708
- Well, what sort of a job?
- (He chuckles)

340
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,624
- You mean... test pilot?
- Well, that's the thing I had in mind.

341
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:46,208
Well, don't say anything now.
Think it over. You've plenty of time.

342
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,791
- Well, goodbye, Sue.
- Goodbye, Father.

343
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,249
Write to me and let me know.

344
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:03,708

- Oh, yes, you have. I've got a job for you.

383
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,124
Yes, just a few minutes ago.
Hey, what's for dinner?

384
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:39,249
No. Piece of cake.
No, really.

385
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,208
I shan't be long.
Goodbye.

- Here, Windy, let's have that back.
- Here, I say...

387
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:49,916
I just remembered
there's a type I know in Cairo

388
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:51,624
and I could do with a little sun myself.

389
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,874
Never mind, you have a nice
quiet weekend at Shoreham.

390
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,166
- Well, how was it?
- All right.

391
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,291
- Did you take her flat out?
- No, nothing like.

392
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,166
- Pity.
- Why pity?

393
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:05,916
I thought our intrepid air ace might be
the first man through the sound barrier.

394
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,083
There ain't no such thing.

395
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:08,833
You ought to check up
on your supersonics,

396
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,708
not to mention the popular press.

397
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:13,958
What's so ruddy peculiar
about the speed of sound?

398
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,249
We all know exactly what it is,
don't we?

399
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,624
750 miles per hour
at ground level.

400
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,291
If we go slower than that,
we can hear ourselves going,

401
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,874
and if we go faster,
we can hear ourselves coming.

402
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,541
It's a mere matter of acoustics.

The whole ruddy issue's disintegrating.

Don't do that.
You'll give me heart failure.

to be sure.

412
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:16,249
- Coming for a drink?
- No, got too much work to do.

How's the 902 coming along?

414
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,458
I want J. R. to find a name for her.

415
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,416
Something that would suggest
the highest speed yet flown.

416
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:33,541
- How about the "Line Shoot"?
- There won't be any line shoot about her.

417
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,874
- She'll do it all right.
- Do what?

418
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,583
The speed of sound.

419
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:47,166
What would happen if you put
the wings on back to front?

420
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:50,874
Oh, go away. Go away.

421
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:55,958
- Will...
- What?

422
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,624
- Seriously...
- Uh-huh.

423
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,416
Apart from the buffeting
and heavy controls

424
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:04,583
and general wangling about
and other little things we know about...

425
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:10,874
what exactly does happen
to an aeroplane at the speed of sound?

426
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:16,708
I don't know.
And shall I tell you something, Tony?

427
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,083
- What?
- No one else in the world does either.

428
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:42,791
- Darling?
- Cooee!

429
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,458
- How was it?
- Piece of cake.

430
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,624
It's always a piece of cake.

431
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,124
- Sherry?
- A little one.

432
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:58,749
- What was your day like?
- Pretty good.

433
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,291
- Tony?
- Uh-huh?

434
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:05,583
- I've got the most wonderful news.
- Have you?

435
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,916
Two bits of wonderful news, in fact.

436
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:13,374
Only one's not quite so wonderful
as the other.

437
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,041
- So I'll start with the less wonderful.
- Uh-huh.

438
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,999
You know that little house
at Andrew's Corner, Broom Cottage?

439
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,291
- Mm-hm?
- I think we can have it.

440
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:26,416
- But that belongs to that fellow Franklin.
- Mm, but he's leaving.

441
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:31,583
- Oh. But this place isn't so bad, is it?
- No, of course not.

442
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,999
But, darling, don't you see
what a difference it would make

443
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,916
if we had a place
that really belonged to us?

444
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:39,666
Oh, I see all that.
But the old man will hate us leaving him.

445
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,541
- He'll hate you leaving him.
- He'll hate his daughter leaving him too.

446
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,499
Oh, darling, don't you yet know
after two years

447
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,458
what Father and I really feel
about each other?

448
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:50,499
- I know you don't exactly see eye to eye...
- Eye to eye?

449
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,874
He's always despised me
for not being born a son.

450
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,999
- Darling...
- It's true.

451
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,624
Just as later he despised Chris

452
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,166
for not turning out
the sort of sort of son he wanted.

453
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,166
Well, I can't despise him in return,
because I admire him.

454
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:08,666
I admire him tremendously
for what he's done.

455
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:14,249
As for what he is... Well, all I can say,
it's best I should live out of his house.

456
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:18,749
(♪ Gentle piano music)

457
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,458
What was the other
wonderful piece of news?

458
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,916
It'll keep.

459
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:28,958
Dinner.

460
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:33,541
Were there any other symptoms
besides this buffeting?

461
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:40,374
Well, I noticed that the controls got...
hard at Mach 0.85, in rather a funny way.

462
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,124
- What height was that?
- 18,000.

463
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,583
Hm. There's no doubt about it,
we're just on the fringe of the problem.

464
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,583
- Father?
- Mm?

465
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:53,499
- What problem?
- Supersonics.

466
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:57,166
- The sound barrier?
- Yes. That's a newspaper phrase.

467
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,916
And like most of them,
pretty misleading.

468
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:02,208
- You mean there isn't a barrier?
- Oh, there's a barrier all right.

469
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:07,041
But it's... spread out,
on either side of the speed of sound,

470
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:11,499
- from roughly between Mach 0.85...
- Mach? What Mach?

471
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:15,791
You see, it's a way we have of measuring
the speeds at which we fly.

472
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:19,333
We no longer fly at miles per hour,
we fly at Mach numbers.

473
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,458
Now, Mach 1 is the speed of sound.

474
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,958
But why sound?

475
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:27,749
What makes a barrier?
Is it sound?

476
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:31,249
- It's a combination...
- It's air.

477
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:35,458
You see, Sue, there's a limit
to the speed at which air itself can move.

478
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:40,541
Now, this rule's travelling
at 30 mile an hour, let's say.

479
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,541
(Swishing)

480
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:47,833
You can hear the air whistle
as it moves out of its way.

481
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:51,249
But if it were travelling
at 750 mile an hour,

482
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,416
the speed of sound, Mach 1,

483
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:55,791
the air could no longer
move out of its way,

484
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,916
because it just can't move that fast.

485
00:40:58,042 --> 00:41:01,458
It'd pile up in front of the rule,
or the aircraft,

486
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,791
making, if you like, a barrier.

487
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:07,708
Now, we don't exactly know
what happens to an aircraft

488
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:10,249
when it gets into these conditions.

489
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,958
Tony knows it buffets
as he gets near to them.

490
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:16,958
Some say the craft would go
right out of control,

491
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:20,791
others that it'll break up altogether.
Now, I don't believe that, Sue.

492
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:24,916
I believe that with the right aircraft
and the right man,

493
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,624
we can force our way
through this barrier,

494
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,333
and once through, there is a world.

495
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:37,916
A whole new world, with speeds
of 1,500 to 2,000 mile an hour,

496
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,791
within the grasp of man.

497
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,541
And Tony here may be the first man
to see that new world.

498
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,916
Well, let's go, shall we?

499
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,791
Do you think the Americans
will beat us to it?

500
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:54,833
They may, but we're two years ahead
in jet-engine development.

501
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:58,124
I think it's between ourselves, Vickers
and De Havillands at the moment.

502
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,166
It's a pity De Havillands will have
their 108 up before our 902.

503
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:05,749
Oh, by the way, Will wants a name
for her. Got any ideas, Dad?

504
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:10,249
- Yes. Prometheus.
- Prometheus? Who was he?

505
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:13,708
- (Susan) He was a Greek god.
- Who stole fire from heaven.

506
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,916
Oh, yes, I remember.
Came to a sticky end, didn't he?

507
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:19,458
He did. But the world got fire.

508
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:22,958
How long before I can have a crack
at this thing, Dad?

509
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:25,458
Not long, but you've got quite
a bit of homework to do first.

510
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,291
You'd better get started
right away.

511
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:32,916
"A Theory of Supersonic Shockwaves."
I shan't understand a word of this.

512
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:35,124
There's nothing to understand.
That's the trouble.

513
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,166
That fellow spends 50 pages
telling us he doesn't know a thing.

514
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:41,583
- But you'd better read it, all the same.
- I shall need you to do some explaining.

515
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,916
You go up to the observatory,
I'll be with you in a minute.

516
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:45,708
All right.

517
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:48,999
- How's the new telescope working?
- It's good, but it might be better.

518
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:53,958
I think one day I'll build myself
a proper observatory out in the park.

519
00:42:54,084 --> 00:42:57,416
- Father, answer me a question, will you?
- Yes?

520
00:42:59,084 --> 00:43:01,999
Is the ability to travel
at 2,000 miles an hour

521
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:04,541
going to be a blessing
to the human race?

522
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,749
Well, I'd say that's up
to the human race.

523
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:12,083
As a member of it,
I can't feel unduly optimistic.

524
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:17,333
In fact, if that's all that lies
beyond this barrier,

525
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:20,333
what purpose is there
in risking lives to pierce it?

526
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:27,291
Well, I could talk about national security,
beating the potential enemy bomber,

527
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:31,166
flying to New York in two hours,
but that's not the real point.

528
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:33,583
The real point is,
it's just got to be done.

529
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,083
What purpose did Scott have
in going to the South Pole?

530
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:44,083
I wish I knew.
I really wish I knew.

531
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:50,458
Hm. This coffee's bitter.

532
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:58,291
Yes, I got it at Weymouth's
in the high street.

533
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,416
Franklin tells me
you've been looking at his house.

534
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,249
Yes, Father, I made him an offer.

535
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:07,708
That house is not suitable either
for my daughter or my chief test pilot.

536
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:10,999
Franklin won't accept your offer.

537
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,249
- How do you know?
- For, my dear Susan,

538
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,749
Mr Franklin likes
his present job very much.

539
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:21,708
And I have no doubt, no doubt at all,
he'll be anxious to keep it.

540
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:35,999
Goodnight, darling.

541
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:40,083
- Tony?
- Mm?

542
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:42,874
Will you try not to use
"piece of cake" talk for a moment?

543
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,416
I'll try not to.

544
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,291
How dangerous is it going to be?

545
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:54,458
Well, exploring the unknown
must always be a little... chancy.

546
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:57,041
Yes, I see.

547
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:00,666
Darling?

548
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:04,833
I did go and see the doctor
this morning.

549
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,291
When?

550
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:15,666
- End of December.
- Oh, how clever of you.

551
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:18,041
We'll save money on
the little brat's birthday presents.

552
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:21,708
Certainly not. Even if arrives on
Christmas Day, he will still get two lots.

553
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:24,124
We might give him
a false birthday in June.

554
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,499
That's right, darling. Say "him".
Say "him" whenever you think about it.

555
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,208
A psychologist chap I know says
there is something in that theory.

556
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:32,541
- Tony?
- What?

557
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:35,749
Must it be you?
This sound barrier...

558
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:38,624
- Must it be you?
- Yes, darling, I'm afraid it must.

559
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:44,833
- Couldn't someone else?
- No, Sue, it's my pigeon.

560
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:51,833
I promised myself when you took this job
that I'd never nag you about it, Tony,

561
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:56,666
and I really wouldn't have done
if you'd just gone on testing aeroplanes,

562
00:45:56,792 --> 00:46:00,333
but I find now I'm married
not only to a test pilot,

563
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:06,458
but married to an explorer as well.
It's a bit unfair, Tony, really it is.

564
00:46:06,584 --> 00:46:08,499
Darling, I hate it.

565
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,291
I'll think about it, darling,
I promise you.

566
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:13,458
I'll think most awfully hard about it.

567
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:20,791
- Hey. Do you remember Philip Peel?
- Of course.

568
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:23,083
Like to fly with me tomorrow
and have lunch with him?

569
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:28,041
- Fly... Hey, will he be all right?
- According to modern theory, yes.

570
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:31,458
- He'd like to very much.
- Good.

571
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:35,833
(Whispers) Now, it's strictly unofficial,
so not a word to anyone.

572
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,583
Not even Dad.
We should be back by dinner.

573
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,916
- All right?
- Yes.

574
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:49,958
- Where are we going, Tony?
- Cairo.

575
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:53,374
- Funny, I thought you said Cairo.
- Oh, I did say Cairo.

576
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,124
Don't be silly.

577
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,541
(Tony) You all right?

578
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,333
Fine.

579
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:21,333
Ridgefield Tower from Glassjar 1 -0,
clear for take-off?

580
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:24,708
1 -0, clear for take-off.
Have a good time.

581
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:31,416
(Engine revs up)

582
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:21,874
We're starting to climb now.
We use too much fuel down here.

583
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,166
- How high are we going?
- About 40,000.

584
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:26,666
Eight miles.

585
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:36,541
- Is our engine all right?
- I think so. Why?

586
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:40,916
- I can hardly hear it.
- (Tony chuckles)

587
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:45,499
Glassjar 1 -0, this is Ridgefield Tower.
Transmit for a fix.

588
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:51,374
(Tony) 'Ridgefield Tower,
this is Glassjar 1 -0 transmitting for a fix.

589
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,416
'On course, 156,
altitude 25,000 feet. Over.'

590
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,083
(Controller) Your position is Dover.

591
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:10,541
Darling. France.
Cap Gris-Nez.

592
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:17,749
Belgium, and Holland on the horizon.

593
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:27,083
Paris.

594
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:32,458
There you are. See the Arc de Triomphe
and all the avenues branching off it?

595
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:37,291
- (Susan) I can't see the Eiffel Tower.
- Well, look ahead, you can see the Alps.

596
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:44,791
We'll go over the top
if the weather's OK.

597
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:47,416
Geneva Tower,
this is Glassjar 1 -0.

598
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,791
Mediterranean.

599
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,749
You'll be able to see Athens
in a moment.

600
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:43,041
(Susan) The Earth is beginning to look
awfully small and insignificant.

601
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:46,499
- I don't know that I like it.
- You're being old-fashioned, darling.

602
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:50,249
Why worry about the poor old Earth?
Look up there!

603
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,624
There's our future. Space.
You can't make that insignificant.

604
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,916
Down there's had it.

605
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,249
(Jet engine overhead)

606
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:43,833
Hey. There's the Comet.

607
00:51:50,209 --> 00:51:53,791
- One ladder!
- You're lucky to have one.

608
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,541
(Man) Tony!

609
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,333
Phil!

610
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:01,083
- It's good to see you.
- How are you?

611
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:04,208
- And Sue, how are you?
- Wonderfully well, Phil.

612
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:05,541
Isn't this exciting?

613
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,041
- Good trip?
- Piece of cake.

614
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:10,958
I see you haven't widened
his vocabulary much.

615
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:14,958
- I say, this is the Vampire, isn't it?
- Uh-huh. Night fighter.

616
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:17,499
I suppose I couldn't take her
on a quick circuit, could I?

617
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,499
No, you certainly couldn't.

618
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:21,749
I always said you'd get bored
becoming an oil magnate.

619
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:23,124
I'm not bored with it.

620
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,874
It's just that I haven't flown anything
for 18 months, that's all.

621
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,791
If you want to fly,
you'd better take that job at Ridgefields.

622
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:32,583
The offer's still open.

623
00:52:32,709 --> 00:52:35,333
I'd better go and check in
at the flight office.

624
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:38,208
- Look, meet us over there by the Jeep.
- Ah-ha. OK.

625
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:42,499
- What job at Ridgefields, Philip?
- Test pilot.

626
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:45,458
He mentioned it in his last letter,
but I didn't take him seriously.

627
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:47,874
I didn't think he was high enough
to scatter jobs about.

628
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,624
- He is, you know.
- Does he get on with the great man?

629
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,624
- He calls him Dad.
- Oh.

630
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,708
Phew, it's hot.

631
00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:58,666
Oh, Tony, why did you bring
that awful thing?

632
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:01,124
You know how I hate it.

633
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,333
When I got your wire,
I thought you must be tight.

634
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:05,499
I probably was.

635
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:10,124
- I say, how are you going to get back?
- Get back? Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

636
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:14,291
Why don't you try going by sea?
It's a nice restful trip. Only 15 days.

637
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:18,416
- Fifteen...? Tony, you mean to say...?
- Don't worry, we'll think of something.

638
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:19,791
Why not ask Cunningham?

639
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:22,208
He tests the Comet between here
and London most days.

640
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:25,041
No, rival firm.
No, we'll catch a lift somewhere.

641
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:27,624
Hey, where are you taking us
for lunch?

642
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,708
To an open-air place.
Jess is meeting us there.

643
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:31,458
- Oh, good.
- It's the best food in Cairo.

644
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,624
Hooray!

645
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,958
To think you were in England only
this morning, it seems like a miracle.

646
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:39,333
I can't quite believe it myself.

647
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:41,666
- I'm so glad, Jess, to meet you at last.
- So am I.

648
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:44,041
I can never realise
you don't know each other.

649
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:47,708
- Here's to us.
- (All) To us.

650
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:49,708
- How are the children?
- Fine, thank you.

651
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:53,124
- Isn't that Cunningham?
- Yes, I think it is.

652
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,541
Darling, do you think I ought to swallow
my pride and cadge that lift home?

653
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,666
I certainly do.
If we have to go back by boat,

654
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:02,958
I shall be wearing these trousers
for a fortnight.

655
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,999
(Engines roar)

656
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:10,624
How much would they pay you
as a test pilot?

657
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:14,541
What? Oh, about 200 a year less
than I'm getting at the moment.

658
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:18,541
Oh well, I expect
we'll manage somehow.

659
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:22,708
They're off!

660
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:44,333
Home. In five hours.

661
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:54,374
Thanks, John,
she's a nice steady old crate.

662
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,291
(John) Go on!

663
00:55:56,417 --> 00:56:00,958
- Who was it said, "Oh, to be in England"?
- Browning. But he wasn't!

664
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:09,458
- Oh, Tony, it was a wonderful trip.
- I knew you'd love it.

665
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:12,999
Love it? I shall treasure it
all my life. Every single moment.

666
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,958
Darling, stop a minute, will you?

667
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:17,083
(Whistles) Paper.

668
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,166
Thank you.

669
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:24,374
I remember you telling me once that one
of the reasons you love flying so much

670
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,708
was that you found
a sort of peace up there

671
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:29,291
that you couldn't find
anywhere on Earth.

672
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:32,249
When we seemed to be hanging
up there between heaven and Earth,

673
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:35,458
I found a strange,
secure sort of peace too.

674
00:56:35,584 --> 00:56:39,083
Almost like the feeling one gets in
one of those especially comfy dreams.

675
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:41,374
I never thought it would be like that.

676
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,708
Darling, will you stop
at the office block for a moment?

677
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,999
- I want to see Dad about something.
- Of course.

678
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,208
I've just spoken to them.

679
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:54,333
- And do they know what happened?
- No more than you read there.

680
00:56:54,459 --> 00:56:55,583
And what speed?

681
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:58,458
The fastest yet achieved
anywhere on Earth.

682
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:09,333
"Disintegrated... Wreckage lies
scattered over a mile-wide area."

683
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:14,249
It looks as if it really
had exploded in the air.

684
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:18,416
- But they must know more than this.
- They don't. There's nothing left to tell.

685
00:57:18,542 --> 00:57:22,041
- They may have hit something.
- Aye, he hit something, all right.

686
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:25,791
He hit the speed of sound.

687
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:28,958
Well, it looks as if I might
have been wrong after all.

688
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:30,624
You can't get through this thing.

689
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,999
That was a great aircraft,
flown by a great pilot.

690
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:37,166
- Yes, I know.
- Well...

691
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:39,499
Do we go on?

692
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,583
Well, that's for you to decide, isn't it?

693
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:51,083
Yes, I suppose it is.

694
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:52,999
I wanted to know
how you feel about it.

695
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,583
Could we get a full report on all this
and could I look at it? It might help us.

696
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,249
Oh, and if you're sending a wire,
you might put my name on it too.

697
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:11,208
He was a good bloke,
old Geoffrey.

698
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:23,958
I'd better say it at once. I'm going on
with this sound-barrier business.

699
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:26,999
Why, Tony?

700
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:30,708
It's difficult to explain.

701
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:33,833
I just feel it's got to be done,
that's all.

702
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:35,499
By you?

703
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:38,499
Yes, by me.

704
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,833
Was... he married?

705
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,583
Yes, I believe he was.

706
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:02,833
Is there anything I can say
that will stop you, Tony?

707
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:07,458
No, Sue. Nothing.

708
00:59:07,584 --> 00:59:10,541
Don't you see, I...
I can't let the show down now?

709
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:14,708
Let the show down? Is there no thought
in your mind of letting me down, or him?

710
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:18,291
- Oh, Sue...
- If only I could understand, Tony.

711
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:20,874
But I can't, you see.

712
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,958
I can only see a great wall
in the sky

713
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:25,791
strong enough
to smash an aircraft to pieces.

714
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:29,708
And beyond it, nothing.
Nothing at all.

715
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:35,416
I'm sorry, Sue.

716
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:46,208
Darling...

717
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:48,041
I promise you
I did mean to speak to Dad

718
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,833
and ask him whether I mightn't
give up this job, but after...

719
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:53,666
Well, after this, how could I?

720
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:57,041
Don't you see what he'd
have felt about me if I had?

721
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:59,708
I've heard those words before, Tony.

722
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:03,083
Christopher said them to me
the night before he was killed.

723
01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:07,249
He was scared too
Father might think he was a coward.

724
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:09,708
Oh, it isn't that.

725
01:00:09,834 --> 01:00:12,874
It's just... I don't want him to think
I'm ratting on a job

726
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,874
because someone else
got killed doing it.

727
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,583
- Where are you going?
- I can't face him tonight.

728
01:00:19,709 --> 01:00:22,583
- Oh, darling.
- Leave me alone.

729
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:34,458
Oh, Sue is not feeling very well.
She's not coming down.

730
01:00:34,584 --> 01:00:37,124
Oh. Sorry.

731
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:53,499
You know,
when I first started flying,

732
01:00:53,625 --> 01:01:00,291
some people, religious people,
thought what we were doing was wrong.

733
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:03,833
They thought it was
breaking a law of nature.

734
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:07,666
Sounds funny now, of course,
but they used to say,

735
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:10,874
"If God had meant us to fly,
he'd have given us wings."

736
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:16,708
Now, this sound barrier...

737
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:22,666
People might feel again that God had
put it there for his own good purpose.

738
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:27,916
That it can't be broken.
That it would be wrong to try.

739
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:35,541
Now, I wouldn't blame anyone
who believed that. I...

740
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:37,958
I wouldn't blame them at all.

741
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:42,499
Do you believe that, Tony?

742
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:46,208
No, Dad. If I believe anything,
it's the exact opposite.

743
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:52,999
Oh, if only I were 30 years younger.

744
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,583
Well, sorry about Sue.
We'll get Factor to send her up a tray.

745
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:57,833
Let's go in, shall we?

746

(Engine roars)

748
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:59,916
(Intensifying engine thrust)

749
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:46,166
(Jet engine thrust)

750
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,416
- (Doorbell rings)
- (Boy) Mummy, somebody at the door.

751
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:02,916
Yes, dear, I know.

752
01:05:04,709 --> 01:05:07,749
Oh, Sally, don't play on the stairs, dear.
I've told you before.

753
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:14,208
- Hello, Jess. Am I disturbing you?
- No, of course not. Do come in.

754
01:05:14,334 --> 01:05:17,083
I was shopping
and I thought I'd drop in.

755
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:19,083
- Hello, Bobby.
- I made this.

756
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:20,833
Oh, isn't that lovely?

757
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:24,499
Jess, I wanted to speak to Philip
rather urgently. Is he in?

758
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:27,499
No, but he'll be back quite soon,
I expect. Let's go in here.

759
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:31,708
Oh, I do think
you've done this charmingly.

760
01:05:31,834 --> 01:05:34,874
You know this is the house
I'd set my heart on, don't you?

761
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,041
Why did you want this when you've got
that big house almost to yourselves?

762
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,166
I just did.

763
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:43,208
Here he is and I haven't got
the pie in the oven. Excuse me.

764
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:45,874
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, sweetie.

765
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,124
- Look who's here again. Isn't that nice?
- Oh.

766
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,124
I'm just getting lunch.

767
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,916
- Hello.
- Hello. I was passing and I thought...

768
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:57,833
Well, it was a nice thought.
Come on, come and sit down.

769
01:05:57,959 --> 01:05:59,499
- How was the flight?
- Wonderful.

770
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:01,541
Tony was kind
about my flying too.

771
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:04,041
- No regrets, then?
- None at all.

772
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:06,624
Why does everyone I'm fond of
have to be a test pilot?

773
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,958
Why can't they sit in offices
like the rest of humanity?

774
01:06:09,084 --> 01:06:11,458
The rest of humanity
doesn't know what it's missing.

775
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:14,958
(Jet engine overhead)

776
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:22,999
When Tony's flying these days...
I try to go to the cinema.

777
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:25,333
You can't hear the sound
so clearly in there.

778
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,374
Philip...

779
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,916
How does Jess feel about all this?

780
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:35,749
Oh, I think she accepts it
just as a job like any other.

781
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,958
I wish I were like Jess.
I'm not very brave, I'm afraid.

782
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,791
When's he testing
the Prometheus at full speed?

783
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:48,624
- I don't know.
- You do, I think.

784
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,791
But perhaps
it's best you shouldn't tell.

785
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:57,166
- What's he doing at this minute?
- He's up for half an hour on a routine test.

786
01:06:57,292 --> 01:07:00,749
- Will you stay for lunch?
- Oh, won't that be difficult for Jess?

787
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,749
- Has she enough?
- She'll manage somehow.

788
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:08,374
Susan, you mustn't worry, you know.
There's no better pilot in this country.

789
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:17,083
Philip, I believe to have courage,
one must also have understanding.

790
01:07:17,209 --> 01:07:19,749
If only I could understand
the purpose of it all.

791
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:26,999
You know, I don't think that sort
of understanding comes from up here.

792
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,583
Only from here.

793
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,833
Oh, Jess, lay on another place,
will you? Susan's staying for lunch.

794
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:39,833
- Well?
- Tomorrow at 3:00.

795
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:42,291
- What, the full test?
- Yeah.

796
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:45,791
That's good work, Will.

797
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,666
She's still nose-heavy
over Mach 0.90.

798
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:56,458
- Well, give up the test if you're worried.
- Of course I'm worried! Wouldn't you be?

799
01:07:56,584 --> 01:07:59,874
Tony says it's not serious.
He can correct easily.

800
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,249
He doesn't want to wait any longer.
Nor do I.

801
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:05,041
- You need a rest, Will.
- Of course I need a rest!

802
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:08,249
I've needed a rest for over 35 years.

803
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,083
- Give me a drink.
- You know where to find it.

804
01:08:18,459 --> 01:08:21,791
- Where is Tony now?
- He's over with the new test pilot.

805
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:25,374
That boy's a good flyer, by the way.
Tony says he's better than him.

806
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,541
That's not true.
No one's better than Tony.

807
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:34,499
Tony hasn't got it up here.
That's what a pilot needs nowadays.

808
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:36,374
Brains and imagination.

809
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,958
- Isn't that what they've always needed?
- Maybe. Well, here's hoping.

810
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,958
(Jet engine overhead)

811
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:04,458
- Well, what is it, Dad?
- A galaxy in Andromeda.

812
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:11,916
- And how far away is that?
- Oh, about 700,000 light years.

813
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:13,583
You mean that what I am seeing now

814
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:16,708
is the way this galaxy looked
700,000 years ago?

815
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:19,624
- That's right.
- Hm.

816
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:24,624
- I'm looking at the past, then, aren't I?
- In a manner of speaking.

817
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,374
- Is there a way of looking into the future?
- Yes.

818
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,791
- How?
- Through that telescope.

819
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:37,666
What you see there is the past,
the present and the future, all in one.

820
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:45,333
The process of continuous creation.
Stars die, stars are born.

821
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:48,041
No beginning, no end.

822
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:51,041
Yes, you can see into the future
out there, all right.

823
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:57,208
- Nice hobby you've got here.
- Passes the time.

824
01:09:57,334 --> 01:10:00,833
- Well, goodnight.
- Tony?

825
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:06,166
- You hardly knew Christopher, did you?
- Well, just that one night.

826
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,958
Susan blames me for his death,
doesn't she?

827
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:15,166
Oh, that you needn't answer.
I know she does.

828
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:20,874
I just wondered if you blame me too.
You can tell me the truth, I can take it.

829
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,458
Do you, Tony?

830
01:10:24,584 --> 01:10:25,624
No.

831
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:32,416
Hm. Well, goodnight, Tony boy.
Happy landings for tomorrow.

832
01:10:33,542 --> 01:10:34,999
Piece of cake.

833
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:51,416
Oh, sorry, darling.
I didn't mean to wake you.

834
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:56,166
- You're very late, Tony.
- I've been gassing with the old man.

835
01:10:57,542 --> 01:10:59,291
Are you flying tomorrow?

836
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:03,208
Just the usual bumble around.

837
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,958
- What time?
- Three o'clock.

838
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,958
- I'll see that film at the Palace.
- Mm.

839
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:12,708
It's a good one, I hear.

840
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,208
- Darling?
- Mm-hm?

841
01:11:17,334 --> 01:11:19,458
Do you mind if we call him John?

842
01:11:21,584 --> 01:11:23,333
I think I do.

843
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,916
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, my love.

844
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,333
- Pity.
- What?

845
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:37,416
- That I didn't meet you ten years ago.
- Why?

846
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,624
I'd have had ten years longer
of being married to you.

847
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,583
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

848
01:11:56,042 --> 01:11:57,291
Tony?

849
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:04,499
Oh, Tony.

850
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:11,916
Crash crew, this is Control, testing.
How do you hear me?

851
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:16,583
Roger. Stand by in crash position
on runway 2-0.

852
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:18,708
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

from Glassjar 1 -0. Clear for take-off?'

OK, here we go.

Mach 0.90.

Hello, Tony, this is Will.

881
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:28,791
Did you correct that nose-heavy trim
before opening air brakes?

882
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:31,416
All right, Will, you old hen.

883
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:34,916
Everything you said would happen
did happen. All in order, don't fuss.

884
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:37,708
What about your nose-heavy trim?
Did you correct?

885
01:18:37,834 --> 01:18:42,874
'Of course I corrected.
I told you I was climbing again, didn't I?'

- Bail out.

897
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:50,041
It's coming up to Mach 1!

898
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:55,083
Bail out. Bail out!

899
01:21:00,042 --> 01:21:01,749
(He screams)

900
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:03,249
Tony!

901
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,874
(Alarm wails)

902
01:21:10,334 --> 01:21:12,124
(Controller) Crash, square able 7.

903
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:14,083

01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:17,374
(Truck bells ringing)

905
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:08,958
(Crowd cheers on screen)

906
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:16,374
(Moans)

907
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,249
Get back!

908
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:29,749
- Why did you come here?
- I wanted to.

909
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,916
I wanted to.

910
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:36,083
Halt!

911
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:43,541
(She pants)

912
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:45,958
Here, you'd better sit down.

913
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:51,708
- Is... Is Father here?
- No.

914
01:23:52,834 --> 01:23:55,583
He was here for an hour or more,
but he's gone now.

915
01:23:57,084 --> 01:23:58,499
Oh, Will.

916
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:04,458
I don't know what to say to you,
Susie, love. I don't know what to say.

917
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:11,791
I can't go on, of course.
I've had my fill of designing aeroplanes.

918
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:17,624
Still I don't know where it went wrong.
I can't fathom it.

919
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,208
Oh, I suppose I've got too old.

920
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,249
What are you going to do?

921
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:30,249
I don't know. I... hadn't thought.

922
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:35,708
- I must go somewhere, I think.
- No, Susie love, please, don't.

923
01:24:35,834 --> 01:24:37,958
I'm thinking of J. R.

924
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:42,958
I know how things are between you,
but don't leave him alone now.

925
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:44,666
Not for a bit, anyway.

926
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,041
I must go now, Will.

927
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:54,291
Please don't blame yourself.

928
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:58,166
Tony knew... he was up against
something he couldn't beat.

929
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:02,791
Come on, I'd better take you home.

01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,833
Come along, we'll go upstairs.

- Yes.

Oh, it's Tony.

- We name this child...
- John Anthony.

950
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:49,583
John Anthony, I baptise you
in the name of the Father,

951
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:51,333
and of the Son,

952
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:55,333
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

953
01:28:56,459 --> 01:28:58,583
Now, smile, please.

954
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:02,291
He's here. The car's outside.
Oh dear, I hoped he wouldn't.

955
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:04,416
Oh, don't panic, Jess.

956
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:10,083
Ah, how do you do?

957
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:18,916
- Well, hello, Sue.
- Hello, Father.

958
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:22,208
Hello, young fella.
Did you christen him Tony?

959
01:29:23,084 --> 01:29:26,749
No, John.
It was what Tony wanted.

960
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:31,999
- Hm. He's a fine baby.
- Yes, isn't he?

961
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:35,541
- Oh, Sir John, can I tempt you to this?
- Oh, thank you, Mrs Peel.

962
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:38,624
- It's a charming house you have.
- Glad you like it, Sir John.

963
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:42,708
I haven't had a chance yet
of congratulating you, Father.

964
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:44,958
Mm. Quite a surprise.

965
01:29:45,084 --> 01:29:47,416
I hear the new airliner
is a great success.

966
01:29:47,542 --> 01:29:52,624
Mm. We hope so.
Now, here's a small present for... John.

967
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,541
Thank you.

968

"Me no likey plitty lady.
Me likey plitty drinky."

970
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,666
- Hello, Will.
- Hello, J. R.

971
01:30:04,792 --> 01:30:07,291
Delighted to see you looking
so much better. How was Bognor?

972
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:10,333
- Oh, very restful, very quiet.
- I'm glad you're back.

973
01:30:10,459 --> 01:30:12,833
- I'm not back.
- Oh.

974
01:30:12,959 --> 01:30:16,666
Well, when you're at Bognor,
you might have a look at this.

975
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:19,583
I'd like your views.

976
01:30:19,709 --> 01:30:21,416
- Byfield's work?
- Yes.

977
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:26,083
- What's his idea in that?
- To increase stability.

978
01:30:27,709 --> 01:30:31,374
The way I see it, J. R.,
a good aircraft has...

979
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,999
It's got to have something
sort of... inevitable about it.

980
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:38,291
Now, look. This thing could be
changed a hundred different ways.

981
01:30:38,417 --> 01:30:39,999
For example...

982
01:30:40,834 --> 01:30:44,833
Do you know what you are, J. R.?
You're a vile seducer.

983
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:51,291
Oh, by the way, I hear
you've made a new Prometheus.

984
01:30:52,209 --> 01:30:55,083
- What's the idea?
- It's too good an aircraft to lose, Will.

985
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:58,208
It's the best that came out
of England since the war.

986
01:30:58,334 --> 01:31:04,124
- No. It failed, J. R.
- It wasn't the aircraft that failed, Will.

987
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:07,541
Now, you come
and see me on Monday.

988
01:31:25,792 --> 01:31:27,624
Well, this may not be
the time to tell you,

989
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,874
but I've been watching
your work very closely,

990
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,458
and now Makepeace is leaving us,

991
01:31:31,584 --> 01:31:34,333
I've decided to promote you
to chief test pilot.

992
01:31:34,459 --> 01:31:37,249
- Oh, thank you, Sir John.
- In the firm, I'm still known as J. R.

993
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:40,333
- Take up the new Prometheus tomorrow.
- Yes, J. R.

994
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:42,166
Take her up every day
for the next few weeks.

995
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:44,666
- No specific tests, just get used to her.
- Right.

996
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:47,666
Goodbye and thank you.
A charming party.

997
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:54,749
Oh, and Peel? Not above Mach 0.90
until further orders.

Hello, darling.

1003
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:03,499
Come on. Up we get.

1004
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:07,624
- Has John been good?
- Yes.

1005
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,374
He doesn't seem to mind
the noise at all.

1006
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:15,041
- Jess?
- Mm-hm?

1007
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:17,541
You've both been
very good to me here.

1008
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:20,374
I don't think you'll ever realise
how grateful I am.

1009
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:24,416
- Why this all of a sudden?
- I think I've got that flat in London.

1010
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:27,416
Oh dear, I'm sorry.
We shall both miss you terribly.

1011
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:28,874
I shall miss you.

1012
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,374
Couldn't you find something
a little nearer here?

1013
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:35,791
I don't want him to grow up at Ridgefields
in the shadow of his grandfather.

1014
01:33:35,917 --> 01:33:37,916
(Jet engine overhead)

1015
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:42,916
Come on, darling.

1016
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:56,624
- Why not stick the nose on the tail?
- I'll stick your nose on your tail.

1017
01:34:00,209 --> 01:34:02,541
- Will?
- What?

1018
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:05,583
Is it possible that at the speed of sound,
the controls are reversed?

1019
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:10,208
At the speed of sound, Philip,
anything's possible. Why?

1020
01:34:10,334 --> 01:34:14,124
During the war once,
I put a Spitfire into a flat-out dive.

1021
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,916
No particular reason,
just youthful high spirits.

1022
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:19,791
I think now that I hit
the sound barrier.

1023
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:24,749
I remember that the more
I pulled on the stick,

1024
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:28,499
the harder the nose went down.
The same thing happened this morning.

1025
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,874
You're not supposed to do
a high Mach number!

1026
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,499
I know, but I did.

1027
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:37,666
Both times, I had the feeling that
if I'd had the guts to put the stick forward

1028
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:40,374
instead of pulling it back,

1029
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,249
I could have pulled out
without having to lose speed.

1030
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:46,291
What do you think?

1031
01:34:46,417 --> 01:34:49,333
There's nothing in the books
to suggest for one second

1032
01:34:49,459 --> 01:34:51,708
anything so Edgar Allan Poe-ish.

1033
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:54,666
Rather depends on the books,
doesn't it, Will?

1034
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:58,249
There were books once
that said the Earth was flat.

1035
01:34:59,084 --> 01:35:01,083
(Phone ringing)

1036
01:35:05,917 --> 01:35:09,708
Yes?
Oh. He's here.

1037
01:35:11,667 --> 01:35:13,333
It's J. R., for you.

1038
01:35:15,792 --> 01:35:18,083
- Hello?
- (Jet engine overhead)

1039
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:25,166
Peel here, J. R.
Yes? What, now?

1040
01:35:25,292 --> 01:35:27,874
Well, yes, of course.

1041
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,208
What have I done?
He sounded grim as blazes.

1042
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:41,833
Here's Daddy.

1043
01:35:41,959 --> 01:35:43,166
I'm sorry I'm late, darling.

1044
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:45,749
We started, darling.
The children have to have their hair cut.

1045
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:47,833
- I had to see the old man.
- You've got it, then?

1046
01:35:47,959 --> 01:35:50,291
- I've got what?
- Well, the rise, of course.

1047
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:53,874
Oh, blast it. I forgot to ask him.

1048
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,499
- You forgot to ask him?
- Yes. I'm sorry, darling.

1049
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:59,208
Oh, really! What a husband.

1050
01:35:59,334 --> 01:36:03,666
- (Girl moans)
- Bobby, go out and play on the lawn.

1051
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:05,791
Here we are.
That's it, you come with me.

1052
01:36:05,917 --> 01:36:08,374
- Nice flight, dear?
- Yes, thanks. Wonderful.

1053
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:12,499
I've got something hot for you
in the oven.

1054
01:36:15,084 --> 01:36:16,416
What does he want?

1055
01:36:18,084 --> 01:36:20,499
- You won't tell Jess, will you?
- No.

1056
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:22,666
He asked me to take
the Prometheus up

1057
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:26,458
and reproduce exactly the conditions
under which Tony crashed.

1058
01:36:29,334 --> 01:36:31,291
Could I have the bread, please?

1059
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:36,583
Thanks.

1060
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:41,333
- At the same speed?
- Well, faster, if possible.

1061
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:44,041
When?

1062
01:36:44,167 --> 01:36:46,708
I shall take her up this afternoon
for a high Mach number,

1063
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:49,874
and if that's all right,
full crack tomorrow.

1064
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,374
Are you going to do it?

1065
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,708
Look, I don't have to, you know.

1066
01:36:54,834 --> 01:36:57,333
This was merely a suggestion,
not an order.

1067
01:36:58,667 --> 01:37:00,874
Hm.

1068
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,208
That's the situation, Sue.
I don't have to, but I must.

1069
01:37:05,334 --> 01:37:08,708
- Why must you?
- Well...

1070
01:37:08,834 --> 01:37:10,583
It's a bit hard to explain.

1071
01:37:10,709 --> 01:37:13,874
I only know that if I don't accept
your father's suggestion,

1072
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,541
I should never want to fly again.

1073
01:37:16,667 --> 01:37:21,124
And as flying, I've now found out,
is my life, well, I...

1074
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:24,916
There we are, darling.
I hope it's still all right.

1075
01:37:25,042 --> 01:37:26,624
It looks lovely.

1076
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:29,124
Fancy you forgetting to ask
for the rise.

1077
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:32,791
I shouldn't worry about it.
I don't think he'll... object now.

1078
01:37:32,917 --> 01:37:35,333
Is it safe to buy the coats
for the children?

1079
01:37:35,459 --> 01:37:39,666
Oh, good. Now they'll look smarter
than those stuck-up Harrison kids.

1080
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,874
"A complaint from one of our most
important customers in Mexico

1081
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,958

1082

"in the Marlborough Mark III

1083
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:56,249
Ah. Hello, Will.

1084
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:59,583
What's the test scheduled
for the Prometheus tomorrow?

1085
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:00,958
The details are on the sheet.

1086
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,874
There's one quite important detail
that isn't.

1087
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,291
At what Mach number
is my machine to fly?

1088
01:38:06,417 --> 01:38:08,291
Mach 1.

1089
01:38:08,417 --> 01:38:10,541
Wasn't Tony enough for you?

1090
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:14,666
We learnt a lot from Tony's crash.

1091
01:38:14,792 --> 01:38:18,874
Just enough to know that to fly
at the speed of sound is death.

1092
01:38:23,959 --> 01:38:26,833
- Haven't you had enough of that?
- No.

1093
01:38:28,334 --> 01:38:30,874
Ever heard of pilotless aircraft?

1094
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,291
This problem can't be solved
with pilotless aircraft.

1095
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:36,374
Not in years, anyway.

1096
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:39,208
Well, what are a few years
one way or another?

1097
01:38:39,334 --> 01:38:42,416
Important to me.
I may not have so many of them.

1098
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:46,041
Trying for a peerage now, huh?

1099
01:38:46,167 --> 01:38:50,166
- You'd better get out, Will.
- I'm sorry for you, J. R.

1100
01:38:50,292 --> 01:38:53,541
I don't know what devil it is
that's eating you up.

1101
01:38:53,667 --> 01:38:56,791
And it can't make life
any too happy for you.

1102
01:38:59,209 --> 01:39:00,708
Cable to Mexico City.

1103
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:04,291
"Your letter received,
and will receive our attention. Stop."

1104
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:41,166
Oh. Good evening, Sue.

1105
01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:42,374
Good evening, Father.

1106
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:46,624
Well, you don't often give me
the pleasure of seeing you these days.

1107
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:49,083
How's my grandson?

1108
01:39:49,209 --> 01:39:51,249
- He's very well.
- Good.

1109
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,958
- Father?
- Yes?

1110
01:39:55,084 --> 01:40:00,166
- Are you going on with this test tomorrow?
- What's that to do with you?

1111
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:02,666
Did Philip tell you what happened
to him this afternoon?

1112
01:40:02,792 --> 01:40:05,791
Yes. I've just been reading
his report.

1113
01:40:07,125 --> 01:40:10,291
For a good ten seconds,
he was completely out of control.

1114
01:40:10,417 --> 01:40:12,249
What are his chances
if that happens tomorrow?

1115
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:14,291
Well, it might not happen tomorrow.

1116
01:40:15,584 --> 01:40:17,291
Please put off the test, Father.

1117
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,374
No.

1118
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:23,249
You're prepared to let Philip
go the way of Tony?

1119
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:26,208
Well, we don't know the way of Tony.

1120
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:29,749
That's Philip's job tomorrow,
to find out how Tony was killed.

1121
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:32,916
And Tony was finding out
how Geoffrey de Havilland was killed,

1122
01:40:33,042 --> 01:40:35,791
and another pilot will find out
how Philip was killed.

1123
01:40:35,917 --> 01:40:37,583
And each time,
we'll learn a bit more.

1124
01:40:37,709 --> 01:40:40,958
So that one day in the distant future,
Ridgefields will build an airliner

1125
01:40:41,084 --> 01:40:42,791
that'll go to New York in three hours.

1126
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:43,999
Two.

1127
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:45,791
So that a few people
who can afford the fare

1128
01:40:45,917 --> 01:40:47,499
will spend an occasional weekend
in New York,

1129
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,583
and Ridgefields shares
will go up and up.

1130
01:40:49,709 --> 01:40:53,041
My dear Susan, what kind of man
do you think I am?

1131
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:57,833
I don't know.
I... really don't know.

1132
01:41:00,917 --> 01:41:04,791
What sort of a man
with two deaths on his conscience

1133
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:06,458
could risk burdening it with a third?

1134
01:41:06,584 --> 01:41:09,083
A man whose only human feeling
is a passionate worship

1135
01:41:09,209 --> 01:41:11,249
for a pile of bricks and mortar
called Ridgefields?

1136
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:14,583
My dear Susan, if you were to tell me
that only by giving up Ridgefields

1137
01:41:14,709 --> 01:41:17,249
and going back to where I started,
could I find out

1138
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:19,916
what happens to an aircraft
at the speed of sound,

1139
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:22,791
I'd say, "All right, Susan,
my girl, it's a deal."

1140
01:41:22,917 --> 01:41:26,208
- I don't believe that.
- That's because you can't understand it!

1141
01:41:26,334 --> 01:41:28,124
You make imaginary sacrifices
for yourself,

1142
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,333
but it's other people's lives
you really sacrifice.

1143
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,583
You think I felt nothing
at Tony's death?

1144
01:41:32,709 --> 01:41:35,499
What else can I think,
when a few hours after his death

1145
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:37,208
I find you listening to his voice?

1146
01:41:37,334 --> 01:41:40,208
Our ways are different
in so many things,

1147
01:41:40,334 --> 01:41:43,624
I expect our ways of feeling grief
are different too.

1148
01:41:44,584 --> 01:41:48,416
Well, I don't suppose
you've any more to say to me.

1149
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:52,416
Yes, I have, Father.
I'm taking John to live in London.

1150
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:54,916
Oh? Indeed?

1151
01:41:55,834 --> 01:41:58,666
You know why I'm taking your grandson
away from you, don't you?

1152
01:42:00,209 --> 01:42:03,124
You want me to think of you
as a man with a vision.

1153
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:06,333
Well, that vision has killed
both my husband and my brother.

1154
01:42:06,459 --> 01:42:08,833
And while I'm alive,
it's not going to kill my son too.

1155
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,916
There are evil visions as well
as good ones, you know, Father.

1156
01:42:14,417 --> 01:42:16,874
That's why I'm taking my baby away.

1157
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:46,666
Thanks, Windy. Tell them I'll be out
in two minutes, will you?

1158
01:42:46,792 --> 01:42:48,249
OK.

1159
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:14,208
You sent for me, Father.

1160
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:19,291
Well, thank you for coming.
I've... I've got something to say.

you've got John down for.

- Is that all you wanted to say?
- No.

1168

You've got to think.

01:46:44,334 --> 01:46:48,041
Can a vision be evil, Sue?
Can it? Can it?

1212
01:46:48,584 --> 01:46:50,249
I shouldn't have said that.

1213
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:54,166
It's a terrible thing to make a man
doubt everything he's ever lived for.

1214
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:59,499
If I've killed them both for nothing.
Well, it can't be true, can it? Can it?

steepest possible dive.

business by reversing the controls.

Stick forward!

It's all right. He's got through.

(Jet engine approaching)

1259
01:52:01,709 --> 01:52:05,499
You'll...
You'll do me a favour, will you?

1260
01:52:05,625 --> 01:52:07,166
Of course.

1261
01:52:07,292 --> 01:52:12,833
You don't tell anyone what happened
in this office this afternoon.

1262
01:52:14,084 --> 01:52:15,666
Do you think I would?

1263
01:52:53,042 --> 01:52:57,708
I say, a chap called Sound just looked in.
He's absolutely livid with you, old boy.

1264
01:52:57,834 --> 01:52:59,916
He says he's going to bump
his speed up next time.

1265
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:03,916
Oh, good, I've found you in.
I want to show you this.

1266
01:53:04,042 --> 01:53:06,458
- Lord & Mason's won't take it back...
- Look, darling...

1267
01:53:06,584 --> 01:53:09,874
we've got to make up our minds now.
Do you think the colour's too much?

1268
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,458
They've got a sort of beigey colour
with stripes going down here, and I...

1269
01:53:13,584 --> 01:53:15,166
It seemed a bit dull to me, but...

1270
01:53:15,292 --> 01:53:17,749
Look, darling, pay attention.
This is very important.

1271
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:21,124
- Is it all right?
- Yes, I'm sorry, darling. Yes, it's fine.

1272
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:24,208
Good, that's lovely.
I'll be able to get back in time.

1273
01:53:24,334 --> 01:53:26,999
Well, bye-bye, darling.
See you at home.

1274
01:53:28,209 --> 01:53:30,124
(Chuckles)

1275
01:53:38,584 --> 01:53:40,208
(Sobbing)

1276
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:04,499
Hm. I thought I heard a car.

1277
01:54:05,209 --> 01:54:07,333
I wondered if it could be you.

1278
01:54:10,542 --> 01:54:12,708
He has a look of Tony.

1279
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,291
His eyes.

1280
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:20,708
- What's that?
- It's the moon.

1281
01:54:20,834 --> 01:54:22,833
I never knew it could look
so unfriendly.

1282
01:54:22,959 --> 01:54:25,624
It's an unfriendly universe.

1283
01:54:27,542 --> 01:54:28,999
Do you believe that?

1284
01:54:29,125 --> 01:54:32,666
Unfriendly only because
it's unconscious of our existence.

1285
01:54:32,792 --> 01:54:36,249
- That's a depressing conception.
- Doesn't depress me.

1286
01:54:36,375 --> 01:54:39,541
In our fight with the universe,
it gives us the advantage.

1287
01:54:40,792 --> 01:54:44,541
- Must it always be a fight?
- Well, I think it must.

1288
01:54:44,667 --> 01:54:47,666
It wasn't for nothing we were given
so many weapons to fight with.

1289
01:54:47,792 --> 01:54:52,083
- Such as?
- Imagination, for one thing.

1290
01:54:52,209 --> 01:54:54,916
Which some people call vision,
don't they?

1291
01:54:56,084 --> 01:54:58,374
Yes, some people do.

1292
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:01,333
And I suppose another weapon
is courage.

1293
01:55:02,084 --> 01:55:05,291
- Daddy, why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?

1294
01:55:05,417 --> 01:55:08,041
How alone you must've been.

1295
01:55:08,167 --> 01:55:10,999
Even Will had more imagination
than me...

1296
01:55:12,292 --> 01:55:13,749
I am sorry.

1297
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:16,208
You've no need to be.

1298
01:55:18,542 --> 01:55:20,041
(John exclaims)

1299
01:55:20,167 --> 01:55:22,124
- I must put John to bed.
- Yes.

1300
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:26,541
- He's no right to be up as late as this.
- And you mustn't keep your car waiting.

1301
01:55:26,667 --> 01:55:30,624
The car's gone, Father.
We've come home.

1302
01:55:33,209 --> 01:55:34,999
Oh...
