2
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,430
THE WAR IS OVER!

3
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,235
Sir, I have Silver.

4
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,949
Would you like to buy some?

5
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,551
Mr. Sorowitsch? I have to
ask for an advance, please.

6
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,427
200 Dollars is more then enough.

7
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:35,198
Is this your first time in Monte Carlo?

8
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:55,312
Very nice, it's gonna be fine,
a little adjustment, that's all.

9
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:09,272
What's a matter?

10
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:14,754
You where in the [KZ] camp?

11
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:41,754
Is this mine?

12
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,345
Thank you.

13
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,109
Solly!

14
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:26,911
Schmitz!

15
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:29,386
Where's the rest of the 150.00?

16
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,708
It's not the time right now,
to hand out counterfeit money!

17
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:34,469
Solly!

18
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:40,593
Can I borrow? Twenty?
- Sascha!

19
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:44,790
Talking about politics?
- Ludwig dragged me this politicle party.

20
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:49,235
"Heil, Heil, Heil!" And you
know what? I became a member!

21
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:52,673
Here, check it out, look!
That's the present he gave me.

22
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:56,625
Because I'm so nice to him.
- In bed or with the Party?

23
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,353
You know what, Schmitz...

24
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:03,668
If I let you let you get away with this,
Then everybody else gonna try to fuck me.

25
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:07,067
It's not because of the 150.00, It's
the fucking Princible, you understand?

26
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:13,664
This is my damn lifelyhood, and
I'll go to any extreme to protect it.

27
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:18,545
Solly, you old bandit! I want to
introduce you to a friend of mine.

28
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:22,834
Solly Sorowitsch, The
biggest Bandit of all Berlin!

29
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:28,191
Sorowitsch? Are you Russian?
I hope you're not a communist!

30
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:33,227
Enough of a communist, to
share my Champagne with you.

31
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:38,026
Solly, it's just an unusual
name, where're you from?

32
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:42,745
It' short for Salomon.

33
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:45,389
Salomon?

34
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:46,990
Ah...

35
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:53,908
You can spill the Champagne on
the floor, it's not a Rothchild.

36
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:02,112
I do trust you.

37
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:09,069
How come they're saying? "Don't
buy anything from the Jews!"

38
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:16,030
You have to act normal, or you stand out.
Don't you guys learn that from the resistence?

39
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:19,063
Exuse me, Solly.
- In 2 hours, at my place.

40
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,146
Okay, Solly, that's fine!

41
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:36,790
Are you leaving?
- Tonight. I got the word, I've been here to long.

42
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:48,004
If you can counterfeit the
Dollar, you can do a lot of things.

43
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:50,747
It's not perfect yet,
but sooner or later...

44
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:52,713
Did you bring the money?

45
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,587
You know, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

46
00:07:57,994 --> 00:08:02,909
These are my People.
- I'm me, and then there are the others.

47
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:09,864
Don't you understand, what's going
on? What the Nazis doing to us?

48
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,265
Why do they always pick on the Jews?

49
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,904
Because they don't try to fit in.

50
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,873
Solly! You don't have any...
- No!

51
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:19,911
Do you need an Arien-ID?

52
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,986
I'll make you one, that'll show Siegfried
and the Dragon in your family history.

53
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:25,065
Do you know Schiele?

54
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:30,024
Yea, I ran in to him once
in Vienna, He's the Master.

55
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,590
Your pictures...

56
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,032
I don't believe, that you're
this kind of an ass-hole.

57
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,111
I didn't think Hans was the type
to be used by beautyfull women.

58
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:48,984
Listen...
- Your jewlery isn't worth half that,

59
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:52,992
I need a passport from Argentinia.

60
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:56,946
I'm already packed, and ready to go.
- Hans, you can go.

61
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:00,864
I'll straighten it out
with Mr. Sorowitsch.

62
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:16,343
You're in luck...

63
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:19,745
about the argentinian passport.

64
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,063
Home of the Tango.

65
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:14,103
You could be a great artist.
- What do you know?

66
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:16,227
A lot.

67
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:19,547
Or I wouldn't have stayed here with you.

68
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,832
Earning money as an Artist?

69
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:27,702
Earning money with printing money?
Printing money is quicker, it's a shortcut.

70
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,585
I've got to go.

71
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:51,786
May I?

72
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,623
Friedrich Herzog, Criminal-Squad
Berlin, Counterfeit Dept.

73
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,511
It is with great Pleasure,
to arrest the best...

74
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:03,790
Counterfeiter in the world, if
that makes you feel any better.

75
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:08,499
The Dollar!

76
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,589
Did we get a little
bid ahead of ourselfs?

77
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:37,340
No!

78
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,460
Stop! Let's move!

79
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,620
Get up, lazy Jew-fuck!
Now get the fuck up!

80
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,498
You there! Take this pig away!

81
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,262
They're making us all!

82
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,979
Solly!

83
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,668
That's not a jail...
They want to kill us!

84
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,341
They're making us all.

85
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,220
The Capo! Melzer.

86
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,620
Watch out for him.

87
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,183
Double Murderer!

88
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,188
With the Green Patch: Professional
Criminal. Worse then the SS.

89
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,179
You don't look like...
- Hey!

90
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:53,947
If you hit me, I'll stab you to death!

91
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:02,786
I'll be watching you
guys close. Fucking pigs!

92
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,305
I'll finish you all!

93
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,098
Are you nuts? You just can't...

94
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,787
You can't loose Respect, you have
to have some kind of moral values.

95
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:15,825
In every jail it's the same thing.

96
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,939
Everybody up!

97
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:33,299
Who made this drawing?

98
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:49,220
Number 75517.

99
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,016
I like it.

100
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:05,703
It's looks very real, Jew.
- With color it would...

101
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:07,665
What?
- With...

102
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:11,623
With color it would
look even better, Sir.

103
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,380
The uniform the booths...

104
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,785
I did it from memory.

105
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:26,825
Die Fahne hoch, die Reihen

106
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,536
dicht geschlossen,

107
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,858
SA marschiert...

108
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,739
What is this?

109
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,861
Herr Hauptsturmführer, This is...

110
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:48,179
It's like this: I...

111
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:54,058
Kameraden, die Rotfront und Reaktion

112
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,583
erschossen,

113
00:15:56,987 --> 00:16:02,505
marschieren im Geist
in unseren Reihen mit.

114
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:13,094
Sorowitsch!

115
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,057
Look at this, such a joker,

116
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:21,062
I thought so.
- I'll paint, Sir. What ever you want.

117
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:23,901
You're being relocated.
Sachsenhausen. Tomorrow morning.

118
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:30,054
But I haven't finished the painting.
I have to finish the painting first.

119
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,616
He's worried about his jew-skin.

120
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,621
A little jew-boy like you,
we can find anywhere.

121
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,779
Shit!

122
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:10,019
He smells terrible, this Jew here!

123
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,182
Hey...

124
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,139
Eat...

125
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:54,702
I always admired the russian
Avantgardisten: Kandinski, Rodschenko.

126
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:57,983
At the Academie in Odessa we had a Professor, Lebed...
- Lebed?

127
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:01,494
At my time at the academie
I became Lebed Assistend.

128
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:04,578
You went to the Academie?
Are you also Russian?

129
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:09,540
I don't like to speak Russian.
it brings back bad memories.

130
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:14,054
You rather speak german?

131
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,774
I...

132
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:20,501
I had a Familie.

133
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:27,302
We had a saying, Lebed
and the art is like...

134
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:30,457
a fair maiden and a good...
- Fuck.

135
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:31,979
You know it too.

48, 41.

160
00:20:28,703 --> 00:20:30,739
Welcome to Sachsenhausen.

161
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:36,094
You'll see, here it's a differnd
attitute and atmosphare...

162
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:39,380
then in the camps you just came from.

163
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:42,012
I would like to think
of you as my assistances,

164
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:44,617
and togather we're...

165
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:48,731
Yea...

166
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:52,211
This clothes are used.

167
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:56,253
If you rather wear prison
clothes... you can wear the stripes,

168
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:59,894
it'll make you look thinner.
What's his name?

169
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,533
Attantion, let's form 2 rows!

170
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:12,697
What's with this shit?

171
00:21:13,102 --> 00:21:15,741
A symbolic move, looks like we're
being led to the slaughter House?

172
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:26,741
Open!

173
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:45,014
Everybody up!

174
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:50,176
Did you distribute the tooth brushes?
Taken care of the teeth is importend.

175
00:21:56,221 --> 00:21:59,293
My dear Jews, I want you to meet a...

176
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:03,819
Specialist with international
Fame: Salomon Sorowitsch.

177
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:07,611
He will be the head of
the Counterfeit-Department.

178
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:09,570
Sorowitsch?

179
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:14,460
Operation Bernhard. We're counterfeiting
in a Grand Style mass production...

180
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:18,340
Passports, Documents, Banknotes...

181
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,733
With the newest and best
technoligy availible today.

182
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:26,737
I think, the new arivals want
to freshen up and rest a while.

183
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:28,779
Our technical assistent Atze...

184
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,891
is going to bring you up to date,
I wish you all good luck and sucssess.

185
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:42,940
That was a nice speach
from the Commander.

186
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,813
Nice beds.

187
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,693
Why are the giving us such nice beds?

188
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,460
This is still a [KZ] prison camp.

189
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,137
But the beds are soft.

190
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,973
That's good.

191
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,810
Anny Ondra only cleans with Sarinol.

192
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,571
Sarinol!

193
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,894
I was a Commercial
photographer in Berlin.

194
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:17,216
It's realy peacefull and quiet here.

195
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,579
I'm not used to it,
I forgot how nice it is.

196
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:24,177
Where are they all going?

197
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,250
Shoe-Testing Punishment.

198
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,492
They make all the
prisoners walk in a circle,

199
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:33,333
To test the Shoes.
- Testing how?

200
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:37,209
It's a punishment, if the shoes are to
small, they put sandbags on their back.

201
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:38,893
A lot of them die.

202
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:42,209
You're better off not
to watch or listen to it.

203
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,575
Nah? Music!

204
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,811
Guys, let me show you your work area.

205
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,053
We have men from differnd prison
camps, all are professonals:

206
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:59,929
Graphicer, printers, type-setters,
tool and die makers...

207
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,296
Why are they letting us
Jews do the work here?

208
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:06,692
I think they're gonna do away with
us after the war, to keep it a secret.

209
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:10,613
A Exact-Tiegel... you
ever use one of these?

210
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,617
Lazy pig! Faster, you
lazy god-damn bastards!

211
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:20,331
Don't worry, that's Dr. Klinger, the
Capo, the SS has to hear him scream.

212
00:25:29,258 --> 00:25:32,614
You're the new arrivals? I'm
Dr. Klinger, internal Medicin.

213
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:35,690
Welcome to the golden cage.

214
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:38,528
Get this guy to me right the way.

215
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:42,135
Your foot it looks
terrible. Realy terrible.

216
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:51,256
I almost started to cry myself,
when I saw a printing machine again.

217
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:54,377
It brings back good memories. Zilinski?
- yea?

218
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:56,097
Zilinski, dark room!

219
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:59,092
Matti, can you show him our
routine of what we're doing?

220
00:25:59,498 --> 00:26:01,773
And Karloff...

221
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:06,376
You're in the Graphic Dept. Go out
this door down the hall, you'll see it.

222
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:10,453
And you and I where
going to Quality Control.

223
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:21,496
Dr. Viktor Hahn, Prussen
Credit Dept. Hamburg.

224
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:24,855
Sorowitsch is going to be in
charge of the Counterfeit-Retusche.

225
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:28,090
Do you also have a financial
back ground, Mr. Sorowitsch?

226
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:33,494
Yea, our biggest problem is the Paper.

227
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:35,376
It don't feel right.

228
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,847
The English Pound has
the same structure...

229
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:39,656
as the linnen they use in Turkey.

230
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:44,175
We've been doing verios experiments,
but the results have been very poor.

231
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:47,971
Green Patch?

232
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:51,016
A professionel Criminal? Mr. Laube!

233
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:55,456
Mr. Sorowitsch is so to speak
a professionel Counterfeiter.

234
00:26:55,857 --> 00:27:00,328
All the Criminals here so far, have
been wearing Nazi-Uniforms, Sir!

235
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:06,733
You're having a problem working
togather with a fellow prisoner?

236
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:12,211
We're not criminals, like you...
and it wont be easy for you here.

237
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:14,486
Continue.

238
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:16,852
Kiss my ass.

239
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:32,611
Free weekend! And sunday
we get to use the showers.

240
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:35,450
You fraternise with criminals?

241
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:38,654
The real criminals are your high class
citizens who've been plundering...

242
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,092
the masses and letting fashisum flurish.

243
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:44,010
But if a regular guy just
a piece of bread steals...

244
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,691
Are you talking about what I did?.

245
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:51,414
You gave one of the inmates a
peace of bread, that's solidarity.

246
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,570
It was soup.

247
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:58,975
You have a very low number, how did
you manage to stay alive in Auschwitz?

248
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:04,452
Good attitute.
Let's play a game?

249
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,490
What are we playing for?
- Our Honor.

250
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:14,285
I also win if I don't cheat.

251
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:30,809
What's a matter? Are you lazy?
This is not a vacation spot!

252
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:34,571
Here everybody works! Understand?
- Holst!

253
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:38,370
Leave the man alone.

254
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:42,330
To think is also like working,
Holst, you should try it sometimes.

255
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:48,811
Sorowitsch, just Amateurs und Idiots.

256
00:28:49,415 --> 00:28:52,452
Vorgetting the
circumstances now and then.

257
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:55,972
Just us, you and me. The
perfect counterfeit of all time.

258
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,331
First the Pound,

259
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:00,805
and then the Dollar.

260
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:05,247
People, machines, material...
everything you need.

261
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,611
You know, Sorowitsch...

262
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:11,934
It's an oppertunity, to stay alive.

263
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:15,725
I can't garantee this for
everybody, but for you...

264
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:17,649
When...

265
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:41,014
Please! Can you turn
off that Nigger music?

266
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:43,723
As if the germans don't
have any Music of their own.

267
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:47,843
Something to put you to sleep:
Why is God not in Auschwitz?

268
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:51,087
He couldn't get passed
all the Skeletons!

269
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:56,493
Canada.

270
00:29:59,654 --> 00:30:01,326
My Number.

271
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:04,646
I was in "Canada".
The clean-up command.

272
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:09,172
We always had food, we unpacked
the luggauge of the Newcomers,

273
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:12,527
while their owners where
sent to the Gas champer.

274
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,492
You try to fit in, or
you're the next one to die.

275
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:22,371
I just don't want it...

276
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:29,406
For us to have it good here,
while others out there...

277
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:34,404
My wife is still in Auschwitz.

278
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:40,610
I'm not giving the Nazis the pleasure,
of me feeling ashamed, to be alive.

279
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:46,609
Everybody attention,

280
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:52,566
So, also for the new arrivals...

281
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:57,130
Not even the Camp-Commander
knows, what we're doing here.

282
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:02,807
Don't smuggle anything out!

283
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:13,608
Everything, don't have to get out.

284
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:15,403
Everything!

285
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:39,563
Hey you, what's a matter?
- They're taking us to the Gas champer.

286
00:31:39,973 --> 00:31:44,410
They need us, nothing's gonna happen.
- Come on, get undressed!

287
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:50,082
Burger!

288
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:55,450
Can you hear me? Are
you hurt? Who are you?

289
00:31:55,852 --> 00:31:57,365
Leave him be! Come here!
- Dr. Klinger!

290
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:03,206
Dr. Klinger!
- Hey, you there!

291
00:32:04,532 --> 00:32:07,649
What you're doing here? Who are you?
- Nr. 56484. I have...

292
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:11,089
Did anyone talk to you? Did
anyone here talk tou you?

293
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:15,201
56... Commander Hasel did...
- He was laying on the floor...

294
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:17,807
Sut up! Did he talk to you?
- I don't know him.

295
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:22,604
What did he say? Commander Hasel has...
- Are you nuts? Let's go.

296
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,490
Sorowitsch... What did
you talk to him about?

297
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:32,044
I did not talk with him, it's forbidden,
to talk with another prisoners, Sir.

298
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:40,485
So, come on. - Mr. Burger is
our only Dark room-Specialist.

299
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,326
And he did not talk to him.

300
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:46,971
Take your showers.

301
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:52,648
In the showers!

302
00:32:58,892 --> 00:33:00,449
I just wanted to help him!

303
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:13,326
Let's go! Come on!

304
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,210
Odessa?

305
00:34:00,211 --> 00:34:01,439
That's for you.

306
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,683
I'm sorry about what
happend in the shower.

307
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:07,207
It reminds me a little of Lukanow.

308
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,650
Yea?
- Do you know his scene's from the city?

309
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,325
Color! To bad there're no colors here.

310
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,688
Odessa is blue in my opinion, dark blue.

311
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,408
At the Academie they told
me, my style wasn't very good.

312
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,882
But it's my Style.
and I like it...

313
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,524
Thank's.

314
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,079
You're welcome.

315
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,247
Let me.

316
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,885
I can do it better. Why
don't you let me try it?

317
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,167
Everybody up!

318
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,409
Continue.

319
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,721
Number 93...
- Ahh!

320
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,645
So, getting everything organized?
Do you have everything you need?

321
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,965
The passports, we're working on...
the problem is the cover and the Paper.

322
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,083
With used originals we could get a...

323
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:20,722
Sorowitsch, you need to
concentrate on the british Pound.

324
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:23,684
It's very importand, to
get some results soon.

325
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,319
The SS-commander is
loosing his patience.

326
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:32,361
And what's that supose to be? My
five year old can do a better job!

327
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:35,318
I...

328
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,282
A Parazystose.

329
00:35:49,169 --> 00:35:53,447
A material-flaw in the copper, plus
Loszek is a Chraphic-Specialist.

330
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:56,921
We should put him in the passport-dept.

331
00:35:57,849 --> 00:35:59,202
Parazystose.

332
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:02,965
A material-flaw? a Parazystose?

333
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:09,965
Get out!

334
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:15,044
Thank you, thank you.

335
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,962
Don't ever try to bull-shit
me again, Sorowitsch.

336
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,643
We're supose to be on the same side.

337
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:32,564
Atze, the sample from the Dinar.
- Yea, it's ready.

338
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:23,922
Is this with the linnen from turkie?
- Oh, yea, that's what I thought...

339
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,966
Hey, get rid of it!

340
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:28,883
Rags!

341
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,276
The English they're using rags! Strands of
fibre with a thousent breaks and then pressed,

342
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:01,086
Everybody up!

343
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:12,120
Most of the English don't use wallets.

344
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:15,883
They use a Safety-pen to
keep the bills togather.

345
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:20,200
That's why we put the
little holes around the edges

346
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:22,996
Please.

347
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:25,404
The Negative.

348
00:38:55,406 --> 00:38:58,443
We don't wont some small
time oporater out there,

349
00:38:58,846 --> 00:39:01,280
spending a few lousy pounds.

350
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:06,245
Our plan is to destroy
the british economy.

351
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:11,475
If they found out to early, that
we're using counterfeit money,

352
00:39:11,886 --> 00:39:14,081
That would be the end
of this program here.

353
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:17,125
And we'd have to send you all back

354
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:19,005
to the prison camps.

355
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:39,120
She realy isn't wearing any panties!
Amagine a Movie scene.

356
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:43,075
With an Agent, Producer ext. ext.
and this hot chick without panties.

357
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,965
Only a skirt.

358
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:48,163
Mr. wouldn't you like to take
my picture?"

359
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:51,796
"Sure, I wont even need
a (?) for it. "

360
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,196
Burger, You're standing in the Sunlight.

361
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:00,960
Solly...

362
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,559
if it don't work out with the pound...

363
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:07,001
we should get organized.

364
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,718
Yea, we have a lot of guys.

365
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:13,435
We all are in good shape,
healty and we can fight.

366
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:17,520
We also have tools.
- What? With knifes?

367
00:40:17,925 --> 00:40:20,359
Against an
SS-Company? - Yea.

368
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:22,995
Before they send us to the gas-champer.

369
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:30,519
I rather wait for the gas tomorrow, then get
killed by a bullit today, one day at a time.

370
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:32,714
A rebellion.

371
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:35,434
At least that would be a sign.

372
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:42,678
Zilinski is right: You're
standing in the Sunlight.

373
00:40:52,804 --> 00:40:55,716
Kolja, when did you get the fever?

374
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:01,043
It comes and goes, get's real
bad then it's good for a while,

375
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:06,281
We had TB-Cases before, I was
trying to get the medicine...

376
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:09,039
Kleinfeld, Stiasny and
Jilovsky. They just killed them,

377
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:12,277
To keep it from spreading,
Can you help him?

378
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:16,400
Let's see what I... Without medicine?

379
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:19,836
Maybe isolate him.

380
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:25,761
I'm a Doctor. Internal Medicine.

381
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:30,999
How bad is it?

382
00:41:31,844 --> 00:41:35,359
No, you'll be fine, the Doctor
will get you well again.

383
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:40,874
Have to continue to live,
after KZ prison camp.

384
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:44,078
Exactly.

385
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:04,796
Quick, get the First Aid Kid!

386
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:14,954
Here are the original Documents, that
you wanted, direct from Auschwitz.

387
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:18,116
Loszek found his kids Passports
in that box from Auschwitz.

388
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:24,362
Loszek, come on don't do this.

389
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:28,839
You got to keep on living.

390
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:33,042
Only if we keep on living,
are we gonna win.

391
00:42:33,443 --> 00:42:36,560
You must survive this.
Loszek, you can't give up.

392
00:42:37,283 --> 00:42:39,877
You hear me? Loszek!

393
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:49,119
Hey, wake up! Everybody up!
- God-Damn Jew-basterds!

394
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,198
Move it!

395
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:06,835
What's going on back there?

396
00:43:07,522 --> 00:43:08,637
What does it look like?

397
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:12,238
Stand straight!

398
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:20,715
Sorry to wake you guys,
I have something of interest:

399
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:25,599
A few days ago a Buisness Man
enters a Bank in Zürich.

400
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:28,914
He's has a Briefcase
full of Money.

401
00:43:30,762 --> 00:43:32,161
Pound Notes.

402
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:41,920
Our Agent goes to the Manager,
to open an Account.

403
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:45,075
With pleasure, Monsieur.
I hope you understand,

404
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:50,033
for the Banks interest we have to
verify the authentisity ot the Money.

405
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:52,034
Of course.

406
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:54,637
Please. In times like this...

407
00:43:57,402 --> 00:44:02,317
For a half an hour the
Experts checking our Work.

408
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:04,553
and finely they're ready.

409
00:44:11,002 --> 00:44:11,878
Monsieur...

410
00:44:12,922 --> 00:44:14,355
Your Bank Notes...

411
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:19,950
After a carefull and thourough
Test, we know...

412
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:25,795
without a thought they're good.

413
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:33,072
Now the agent is getting
overconfident.

414
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:35,597
Monsieur le Directeur,

415
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:41,519
Since i got the Bank Notes from kind
of of a shady Buisness Source.

416
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:45,240
I would like to be 100%
sure that they're real.

417
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,201
We're accepting your Pounds.
It's not nessessary...

418
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:50,557
Absoluty Sure, Monsieur.

419
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:55,270
If you realy want to do this,
I recomment you take them...

420
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:57,273
to the Bank of England
and let them do a Test.

421
00:44:57,921 --> 00:45:01,880
The Bank of England. Lets see
what they had to say.

422
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:04,841
Maybe we can learn someting.

423
00:45:05,481 --> 00:45:07,358
Bla,bla,bla,bla...

424
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:09,951
"... we have come the Conclution,

425
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:14,639
The Bank Notes in the
denamonation ot 5 Pounds,

426
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:17,714
10 Pound and 20 Pound,

427
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:21,391
are not counterfeit bills.

428
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,753
The Bank of England gives the garantee
the Bills are legal and tender.

429
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,269
The SS-Commander is very happy
and satisfied with our Work.

430
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,069
Our Money is so real, that the
plans have been changed.

431
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,789
It would be a waste, to just
drop them over England.

432
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,875
The German Reich is going to use it
in Buissness Transactions Worldwide.

433
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,589
And that's why it gave
me the Reason,

434
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,230
To bring you a little happyness.

435
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,471
As kind of an uplift.

436
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,669
Yea...

437
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,919
I thought like...

438
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,999
after Work or on Weekends...

439
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,199
Sir, I want to thank you for
the Oppertunity.

440
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,989
Motivation, Klinger. Motivation.

441
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,877
Ich befasse mich viel mit Menschen
- führung. Eine große Sache der Zukunft.

442
00:46:31,279 --> 00:46:33,349
If you treat People like Dirt,
they wont be to productive.

443
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,109
How about if you treat Dirt
like People?

444
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:42,516
You damn Jew's... with Trick's and
Counterfeiting you're good at.

445
00:46:42,919 --> 00:46:46,958
But if you look a litte deeper
at your...

446
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,875
Sir, I have been an upstanding
Citizien all my life.

447
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,955
I have to remind you, that I was
forced in to doing this work.

448
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:11,671
Very good Job, Sorowitsch.

449
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,867
Put yourself a Team togather,
we're starting with the Dollar next.

450
00:47:42,038 --> 00:47:44,347
Don't anybody see, what's going on?

451
00:47:44,758 --> 00:47:46,510
The Germans are Broke.

452
00:47:46,918 --> 00:47:51,469
With out Money no Raw Material.
We're financing the War for the Nazis.

453
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:55,826
And? You gonna sabotage them?
In KZ Prison Camp?

454
00:48:38,478 --> 00:48:40,389
The Americans work with Lowpress.

455
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:44,347
We use Lightpress, we can
produce greater quanitys faster.

456
00:48:45,437 --> 00:48:48,190
Lightpress is also better for
sharpness and halftone.

457
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:52,991
We still have a few Problems,
but we're getting them worked out.

458
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,469
We have a Specialist who has
expierience with the Dollar.

459
00:48:59,757 --> 00:49:01,190
Noch 'ne offene Rechnung mit dem Dollar?

460
00:49:01,597 --> 00:49:03,827
We arrested you for
counterfeiting the Dollar.

461
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:07,274
That time I didn't have all
the technicel Equipment.

462
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:09,315
And now?

463
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,708
How much do you want?

464
00:49:13,437 --> 00:49:15,871
Maybe a few hundert Million.

465
00:49:17,357 --> 00:49:20,793
Atze, about the 20-Pound-Notes...
Can you show me the Testplate.

466
00:49:21,477 --> 00:49:23,547
You little Whore!

467
00:49:23,957 --> 00:49:27,506
Be glad that you're
in here. Idiot!

468
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:36,193
Shit, Shit, Shit.

469
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:56,065
Maye it's not the Negative, but
the mixture.

470
00:50:01,196 --> 00:50:03,869
Sorowitsch's Negative's
have always been perfect.

471
00:50:07,516 --> 00:50:08,915
But?

472
00:50:14,116 --> 00:50:18,906
I got arrested because my wife and I
printed Anti-Nazi Flyers,

473
00:50:20,396 --> 00:50:22,512
I'm not gonna print Money for
the Nazis now.

474
00:50:30,156 --> 00:50:31,589
You know...

475
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:34,669
Family, small Buissness, im Wedding...

476
00:50:35,076 --> 00:50:38,671
I always made sure not to have
Problems with the Law.

477
00:50:39,076 --> 00:50:41,510
I didn't get involved in politics.

478
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,713
Gisela, my wife always said:

479
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:48,352
"We're printers, to let the truth
be known. "

480
00:50:48,756 --> 00:50:50,826
Where did you learn that slogan?

481
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:54,751
Communist Printers-Union,
Youth-Group?

482
00:50:56,236 --> 00:50:57,464
Sorowitsch,

483
00:50:58,276 --> 00:51:01,392
If we print a lot of Dollars it could
change the outcome of the war.

484
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:04,263
We actualy could fight the Nazi's
right here!

485
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:06,586
That wouldn't only just be symbolic.

486
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:10,704
We're a live, if that means anything.
- I'm saying the same thing!

487
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:13,788
It isn't just about your stinking
little existence.

488
00:51:14,195 --> 00:51:17,824
Well it's the only one I have!
- What's your reason? To want to live,

489
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:21,545
or to proof that you can actualy,
make the Dollar?!

490
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:29,434
I'm gonna keep fucking up
your negatives.

491
00:51:29,835 --> 00:51:32,713
If you want, you can turn me
in and tell Herzog.

492
00:51:35,235 --> 00:51:37,829
We have to pay for it,
if we don't deliver.

493
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:41,630
We all gonna have to pay for it.

494
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:45,029
Yea.

495
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:47,264
Yea.

496
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:56,554
The Bridge was blown and the
Russian Advance was stopped.

497
00:52:03,755 --> 00:52:07,031
Can you believe this shit!
Warschau! Can't be happening!

498
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:11,543
Warschau! The Krauts
are being pushed back.

499
00:52:26,754 --> 00:52:28,107
Continue.

500
00:52:31,634 --> 00:52:34,432
You guys can't get the Dollar to work.

501
00:52:35,074 --> 00:52:39,625
We're still having a Problem with
the Plate, Herr Hauptscharführer.

502
00:52:40,034 --> 00:52:44,505
The Pound we can handle now ourselfs.
You know what you are, without the Dollar?

503
00:52:44,914 --> 00:52:47,872
Nothing but a criminal, dirty,
fucking old Jew.

504
00:52:49,554 --> 00:52:53,433
Fuck Herzog and
his "Motivation"!

505
00:52:56,074 --> 00:52:59,146
I know how to get you guys,
to pay fucking attention

506
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:18,109
You're nothing but Jew-Bastards,
and do anything to save your Skin.

507
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,746
Realy disgusting.

508
00:54:02,913 --> 00:54:04,426
Plappler!

509
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:09,031
Get Hotte. One of the sinks is
busted, tell him repair it.

510
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:30,422
I saved your fucking Ass with the
English Pound I made for you!

511
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:45,230
Dr. Klinger said you've got to eat.

512
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:46,951
Why?

513
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:54,747
A spoon for the Expressionists,
A spoon for the Avantgardists...

514
00:54:55,152 --> 00:54:57,461
Eat, or I'll give you a Knuckle sandwich.

515
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:04,030
You know about raising Kids.

516
00:55:11,032 --> 00:55:13,307
What's the story with your Family?

517
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:19,427
Arrested, Killed...

518
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:26,341
I could have bought their Freedom,
if I had the Money then.

519
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:45,584
14:6. 6:14, Serve Burger.

520
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:56,785
Get up!

521
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:00,150
Keep walking!

522
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:03,304
I can't anymore.

523
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:09,306
What's going on?
- I wanted...

524
00:56:09,711 --> 00:56:11,064
What are you waiting for?

525
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:15,387
No, please no!

526
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:26,902
Are you guys crazy?

527
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:29,500
Attention, Soldier!

528
00:56:29,911 --> 00:56:32,186
What's your Name, Lame-Brain?
- Rottenführer Wegener.

529
00:56:33,151 --> 00:56:36,507
You're an Idiot. Man, Man, Man,
what's with all the shooting!

530
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:39,663
You could have shot one of my Jews,
by Accident!

531
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,868
Those are your Jews?
- That's classified.

532
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,419
Game.

533
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,105
15:6.

534
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:55,861
It's a KZ Prison Camp. Every Day
Dozends get killed. We just close our eyes

535
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,665
16:6.

536
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:10,348
One in a Thousent. We should
be glad, we're on this Side,

537
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:11,865
Solly, hm?

538
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,463
Solly, stop it! Relax!

539
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,785
Listen up!

540
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:40,103
If you don't live to over come,
why do you want to continue living?

541
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:06,938
Sorowitsch. Atze told me,
we haven't had...

542
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:09,305
any good results, in months...

543
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:12,624
It's the copper plate, Sir.

544
00:58:13,029 --> 00:58:15,497
Yea! Yea, Yea, Yea.

545
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:19,580
The other Jew told me
the same fucking Lie.

546
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,304
Are you guys doing it on purpose?

547
00:58:31,389 --> 00:58:32,822
Sorowitsch!

548
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:36,503
Sir, we do...
- Shut up!

549
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:39,707
You guys think you can't be
replaced!

550
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,024
So.

551
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:49,425
Berlin wants the Dollar.

552
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:52,703
These five. Klinger,
make a list of their names.

553
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:57,340
If the Dollar isn't here in 4 Weeks
these 5 People will be shot.

554
00:58:57,748 --> 00:58:59,340
Hey, Sorowitsch not there. Here.

555
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:04,224
And don't think, I can' do with out you.

556
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:07,826
Hey, Klinger!

557
00:59:10,788 --> 00:59:13,256
Carnivale. A fun Evening,

558
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:16,705
Music, Dance, a little
Cabaret, Remmidemmi, yea?

559
00:59:17,108 --> 00:59:20,020
There should be some talented
guys around.

560
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:23,303
Sir, you can't...

561
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:26,302
I always did my best...

562
00:59:35,148 --> 00:59:38,663
He's not gonna kill us, he has to deliver,
that's why he's putting pressure on us.

563
00:59:39,068 --> 00:59:42,185
What would you do in his place...
- Me in his place?

564
00:59:42,588 --> 00:59:45,705
I would never put myself in
the place of an SS-Criminal.

565
01:00:06,987 --> 01:00:08,545
The problem is Burger.

566
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:11,986
I have the sneake Suspision,
that he's doing it on purpose...

567
01:00:12,787 --> 01:00:15,745
I watched him yesterday...
- He does it on purpose. I know.

568
01:00:16,147 --> 01:00:17,341
What?

569
01:00:18,507 --> 01:00:21,226
If he don't stop, then I'm...

570
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:29,582
Herzog saved everyones Life here.
He's fair.

571
01:00:29,987 --> 01:00:33,263
You can talk to him.
- Keep your mouth shut, Zilinski.

572
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:36,101
You don't snitch on your Friends.
- Friends?

573
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:40,864
So your saying that we all should
die because of your politics? - Quiet!

574
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,417
Sit down.

575
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:47,782
Burger, the Hero!

576
01:00:48,787 --> 01:00:52,382
He wanted to be a Martyre right
from the start! So let him,

577
01:00:52,787 --> 01:00:54,186
But without me!

578
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:59,261
In Buchenwald I lost four Toes
because of cold weather.

579
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:01,623
In Dachau they broke my back.

580
01:01:02,027 --> 01:01:06,941
In between I almost starved to dead!
I think I earned, to keep on living!

581
01:01:07,346 --> 01:01:09,541
You don't squeal on Friends.

582
01:01:10,946 --> 01:01:12,379
Never!

583
01:01:13,266 --> 01:01:16,497
What'd you call that? Jailhouse-Honor?

584
01:01:18,746 --> 01:01:19,735
Zilinski!

585
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:26,745
I'll kill you, if you snitch on him.

586
01:01:29,346 --> 01:01:31,098
Burger?

587
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:39,581
Burger...

588
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:46,184
You've been stalling the Dollar
for Months. You had your Fun.

589
01:01:47,066 --> 01:01:50,775
But now the Life's of our Friends
are on the line. You can't...

590
01:01:54,386 --> 01:01:57,856
Gisela. My Wife.

591
01:02:02,226 --> 01:02:04,103
She also was in Auschwitz.

592
01:02:05,946 --> 01:02:07,061
"Escape Attempt".

593
01:02:08,986 --> 01:02:10,339
That...

594
01:02:11,026 --> 01:02:12,539
You're sorry about that?

595
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:18,334
Thank's.

596
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:30,700
But now the Dollar, hm?

597
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:34,621
We have to continue.

598
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:39,455
It's about our comfortble
Life's here.

599
01:02:39,865 --> 01:02:41,662
About the nice Beds. The nice...

600
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:43,784
and soft Beds!

601
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:05,225
I thought I could cry about it,

602
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,461
Serios, But stabile.

603
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:25,140
It's a Race against time.
But with out Medicine...

604
01:03:25,544 --> 01:03:27,660
What do you need?

605
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:31,502
But how...
- The Medicine!

606
01:03:33,384 --> 01:03:36,820
In Theresienstadt, there was
never enough Medicine,...

607
01:03:38,784 --> 01:03:41,344
...I had to choose who's,

608
01:03:42,824 --> 01:03:44,303
gonna live,

609
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,342
and who's gonna die.

610
01:03:53,184 --> 01:03:55,982
Herzog is a Bandit, with him I can.

611
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,420
Sorowitsch!

612
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:08,576
Sorowitsch! You need an
Invitation, or what?

613
01:04:29,623 --> 01:04:32,660
Sorowitsch! Nice,
for you to drop by.

614
01:04:35,023 --> 01:04:38,459
Why don't you take the Man's
Handcuffs off, my God.

615
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:40,455
It's a little chilly, or?

616
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:50,132
I wish you could see, some parts
of the U.S. East Coast.

617
01:04:50,783 --> 01:04:54,662
You wont believe the terrible
Propaganda about the Prison Camps.

618
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,815
Friedrich, get
Mr. Sorowitsch a refill.

619
01:04:58,503 --> 01:05:01,222
Can you take Kandis, as a Jew?

620
01:05:01,623 --> 01:05:05,298
Friedrich told me, you've been
a dangeres Criminal, and now?

621
01:05:05,703 --> 01:05:10,015
Working for a greater Cause! I don't
know anything about Politics, but...

622
01:05:10,423 --> 01:05:14,701
So, Kids. Let's give Dad and his
Visitor some privacy.

623
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:22,896
Leni, Lotte,

624
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:25,575
little Friedrich...

625
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,820
To raise the Kids, Sorowitsch.

626
01:05:30,503 --> 01:05:32,733
For them to become responsible
and good Citizens,

627
01:05:33,143 --> 01:05:35,179
and to have a positive outlook on Life.

628
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:38,460
I don't hit my Kids. Never.

629
01:05:39,462 --> 01:05:41,373
The power of Suggestion.

630
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:43,932
To point them in the right direction.

631
01:05:45,022 --> 01:05:46,978
That's what's important, Sorowitsch.

632
01:05:52,342 --> 01:05:54,856
Who knows what the Future,
has in store for us.

633
01:05:58,062 --> 01:05:59,859
Wenn der Russe kommt,

634
01:06:00,982 --> 01:06:05,260
dann muss sich jeder seinen Platz
neu in der Gemeinschaft erkämpfen.

635
01:06:05,702 --> 01:06:10,901
Did you know, I was in the past,
way in the past, a Communist.

636
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:17,494
Freedom, Equality, Human-Rights.
The complete Program.

637
01:06:17,902 --> 01:06:19,540
Don't think, that I'm a Nazi.

638
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:21,136
No, no, no.

639
01:06:21,782 --> 01:06:24,455
It's over with those big Ideas.

640
01:06:24,862 --> 01:06:28,616
I'm just doing my Job, where
I'm needed. Do you understand?

641
01:06:29,022 --> 01:06:31,490
Everyone is his own Person.

642
01:06:34,102 --> 01:06:38,493
You have to make me the Dollar
I can't wait any longer...

643
01:06:39,982 --> 01:06:43,372
I know someone, is preventing it.
And you wont tell me who it is.

644
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:45,737
But I have to deliver.

645
01:06:46,141 --> 01:06:47,938
No matter what the Price is.

646
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:08,780
For who?

647
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:12,974
For this I get the Dollar?

648
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:16,380
You Jews!

649
01:07:16,941 --> 01:07:19,136
You even make deals with the
Life of your Friends.

650
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:21,855
Yea, Well...

651
01:07:25,781 --> 01:07:29,535
Oh, It's Burger...
- Very reliable.

652
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:32,853
Lightpress. Our most importent Man.
- Oh, Yea.

653
01:07:42,381 --> 01:07:44,372
Burger?

654
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,653
We only have 6 Days left.
You gonna make the Dollar?

655
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:55,210
Leibowitz is Tiefprinter. Show him.
- No, Zilinski.

656
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,408
We have a Responsebility toward
our Familys and our Friends.

657
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,613
Because we have it good here...

658
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,693
I can't listen to this shit anymore!

659
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:09,496
You desite if we're gonna live or die?
- It's the Princible.

660
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:12,573
No one here wants to die
because of Princibles!

661
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,699
That's why the Nazi-System works!

662
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,017
Burger, you gonna stay here!

663
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:23,050
And you gonna make the fucking Dollar!

664
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:25,457
Adamovic.

665
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:30,853
Burger.

666
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:35,893
Leibowitz.

01:09:41,459 --> 01:09:42,608
Stein.

668
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:48,172
Zilinski.

669
01:09:57,339 --> 01:09:58,328
Na.

670
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:03,657
Let's see if you made any advances
with the Dollar.

671
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:11,090
Herr Sturmbannführer...

672
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:15,450
We still have a little
Problem with the Gelatine.

673
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:18,531
Herr Sturmbannführer,
No! It's like this...

674
01:10:18,938 --> 01:10:20,769
...Burger here...

675
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:31,811
Let's see if you can pick out
the real one...

676
01:10:40,378 --> 01:10:42,050
Sorowitsch!

01:10:44,378 --> 01:10:45,606
The Dollar!

678
01:10:46,698 --> 01:10:48,336
That's brillant!

679
01:10:48,938 --> 01:10:50,769
It's a Masterpiece!

680
01:10:52,298 --> 01:10:57,497
With the Lightpress knowlige we
could do one Million in a week...

681
01:10:59,618 --> 01:11:01,848
Yeap, It's a fantastic suprise and
makes the Carnival realy special!

682
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,293

685
01:11:36,617 --> 01:11:42,055
I want to welcome you to our
1945 Carnival Celebration.

686
01:11:42,457 --> 01:11:46,496

687
01:12:21,377 --> 01:12:24,413
Try not to cough when Herzog
is here.

688
01:13:30,735 --> 01:13:32,373
Okay!

689
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:33,924

I have one! I have a joke,
I have one Joke...

691
01:13:37,415 --> 01:13:38,734
You haven't heard yet.

692
01:13:39,255 --> 01:13:41,644
This Nun goes to a Lady Doctor
with a Hamster.

693
01:13:42,055 --> 01:13:44,967
It's not over yet!

697
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:08,406
Add "Jew" here.

698
01:14:11,095 --> 01:14:14,485
You should watch it, so you wont
catch it, Sorowitsch.

699
01:14:14,895 --> 01:14:18,854
What's important at the End is, that you
have out lived the expierince here.

700
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:23,643
Sorowitsch...

701
01:14:25,975 --> 01:14:30,844
We're having hard times. Believe me,
for me it's not easy anymore either.

702
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,086
Good?

703
01:14:48,094 --> 01:14:49,812
Great.

704
01:14:51,014 --> 01:14:53,164
Now we have a Chance.

705
01:14:53,574 --> 01:14:55,485
Where is Kolja?

706
01:14:56,334 --> 01:14:57,562
Kolja?

707
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:00,562
Kolja!

708
01:15:29,134 --> 01:15:30,886
How old are you?

709
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,493
Twenty.

710
01:15:33,894 --> 01:15:36,010
Where're you from?

711
01:15:36,414 --> 01:15:38,564
Odessa.
- Odessa?

712
01:15:39,174 --> 01:15:40,846
Nice. The Black Sea...

713
01:15:42,014 --> 01:15:43,766
Get on your Knees.

714
01:16:10,773 --> 01:16:12,889
Let's have some Quiet!

715
01:16:15,413 --> 01:16:16,846
Karloff...

716
01:16:17,933 --> 01:16:22,563
Karloff had TB. wich is a dangeres
sickness and spreads fast.

717
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:25,441
He didn't want anyone here
to catch it.

718
01:16:25,853 --> 01:16:27,923
That's why I shot him.

719
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,688
Yea, he was the best, Guys!

720
01:16:31,693 --> 01:16:34,571
We also had a smoke togather...

721
01:16:34,973 --> 01:16:36,964
He knew, what was gonna happen.

722
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:39,284
I'm telling you, he was realy brave.

723
01:16:40,693 --> 01:16:44,163
He was a Jew, but he died like a Man.

724
01:16:46,173 --> 01:16:50,803
Good, it's Water down the River.
Commander Herzog had to leave early,

725
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:54,010
but he left this here for
the celebration.

726
01:16:54,412 --> 01:16:56,323
Let's give him a 3 cheer salute

727
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:57,847
"Prosit!"

728
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,805
Continue.

729
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:21,799
Atze?

730
01:18:23,731 --> 01:18:28,407
Stop working this and start taking
the Machines apart.

731
01:18:30,851 --> 01:18:32,204
The Tiegel-Exact,

732
01:18:32,611 --> 01:18:36,570
The Tret-Tiegel and the Boston-Tiegel
gonne be loaded first.

733
01:18:38,411 --> 01:18:42,689
Hey,Guys, didn't you hear what I said?
Start taking the Machines apart!

734
01:18:43,091 --> 01:18:45,889
You have one Week, to take
everything apart and pack.

735
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:49,249
If something wont function, when it
get's there, then that's Sabotage.

736
01:18:49,651 --> 01:18:51,721
What's a matter? Move your feet!
- Move!

737
01:18:52,131 --> 01:18:53,962
Standing around like statues.
- Yea.

738
01:18:54,371 --> 01:18:59,968
Important is theTiegel-Exakt,
the Tret-Tiegel and the Boston-Tiegel.

739
01:19:00,371 --> 01:19:03,443
Herr Hauptscharführer...
Where are they sending us?

740
01:19:03,851 --> 01:19:07,047
How do I know? Do I look like
a Travel agent?

741
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:09,881
Are you stupid, or what?

742
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:14,647
Are you a dumb fucking Jew?
You are a dumb fucking Jew!

743
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,770
Let's go! Hurry, hurry!

744
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,441
Let's move it! Hurry up, Man!

745
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:31,918
Those are not Bombers.

746
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:36,085
Those are not Bombers,
That's Artillerie.

747
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:38,560
The Allies are outside Berlin.

748
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:47,686
When the War ends,
They'll kill us all.

749
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:09,006
Guys, the Machines and equipment
is gonna be send to a save place.

750
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,328
Alpenfestung!

You all be following later.

752
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:21,683
Holst,

753
01:20:22,089 --> 01:20:25,718
Pass this out to all the Guys
Don't worry, Guys!

754
01:20:26,129 --> 01:20:28,882
After the war...
everybody's gonna have it good.

755
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:07,166
The Shoe-Testing Commando...

756
01:21:08,169 --> 01:21:09,807
They're not walking anymore.

757
01:21:47,648 --> 01:21:50,560
Sorowitsch! What're you doing?

758
01:21:52,488 --> 01:21:55,605
I... I... I forgot something.

759
01:21:56,008 --> 01:21:57,441
Sorowitsch, I'm warning you!

760
01:21:57,848 --> 01:22:00,362
If something happends to me,
I'll eliminate all of you!

761
01:22:00,768 --> 01:22:03,407
I'm the only one,
that can save you Guys.

762
01:22:10,088 --> 01:22:11,157
Sorowitsch!

763
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:16,960
You want the Money? Sorowitsch,
we can split the Money!

764
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:21,606
Are you pissed because of Kolja?

765
01:22:22,008 --> 01:22:24,203
Kolja... Holst shot him.

766
01:22:24,608 --> 01:22:27,680
I know what you think:
Holst is just an Order-taker.

767
01:22:28,088 --> 01:22:31,523
But what do you think I am? Solly!

768
01:22:33,167 --> 01:22:37,718
I always treated you guys good! In no
other Camp did you have it as good as here.

769
01:22:38,727 --> 01:22:41,366
I can't save the Jews all by myself!

770
01:22:41,767 --> 01:22:44,486
Sorowitsch!

771
01:22:44,887 --> 01:22:47,401
You have to see for yourself,
where you stand!

772
01:22:47,807 --> 01:22:49,957
You have to know that yourself!

773
01:22:58,007 --> 01:23:00,157
You pissed all over yourself.

774
01:23:53,126 --> 01:23:54,241
Solly!

775
01:23:59,806 --> 01:24:01,683
What's going on here, Solly?

776
01:24:02,726 --> 01:24:05,001
Herzog...
- You let him...?

777
01:24:05,526 --> 01:24:07,915
I wanted to kill him, but...

778
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:11,036
...I let him go.

779
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,844
They... They'll put
us up against the Wall.

780
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:27,037
You probably would like that, hm?
For them to kill you too.

781
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:33,274
It's over. The War is over.

782
01:24:35,366 --> 01:24:37,436
Nobody's gonna come anymore.

783
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:42,245
I realy don't have the Talent for being
Marthyr. Did you bring the Cards?

784
01:24:46,285 --> 01:24:47,638
Dr. Klinger!

785
01:24:54,325 --> 01:24:58,796
Our People have taken over the Camp.
It's over, we're free.

786
01:25:00,365 --> 01:25:02,276
Dr. Klinger, Internal Medicine.

787
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:06,474
We're the Inmates
from Block 18 and 19.

788
01:25:07,005 --> 01:25:09,155
I know him. He's SS!

789
01:25:09,765 --> 01:25:13,155
No. No, no, no...
Oporation Bernhard.

790
01:25:13,565 --> 01:25:15,715
We're Prisoners.
- Shoot the Bastards!

791
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:18,161
We're Jews!
- Kill the Fuckers!

792
01:25:18,565 --> 01:25:20,999
Jewish Nose, big Ears!
- We're Prisoners!

793
01:25:22,085 --> 01:25:23,359
Here! Auschwitz!

794
01:25:23,765 --> 01:25:27,599
Plappler, Adamovic, Hahn!
Who else was in Auschwitz?

795
01:26:26,844 --> 01:26:30,075
With the Dollar-Negative
we let it get to hot,

796
01:26:30,484 --> 01:26:32,839
That way the contrast was blurry.

797
01:26:33,844 --> 01:26:36,519
Then they warned us and told us if
it happends again they'll kill us.

798
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:38,801
Here, Burger. That's a Hero.

799
01:26:39,564 --> 01:26:40,792
Say something.

800
01:26:41,804 --> 01:26:45,877
Hey? Yea... Then it was to late,
With the Dollar it would have...

801
01:26:46,524 --> 01:26:49,482
changed the war. Because it would
have givin them plenty of Money.

802
01:26:49,884 --> 01:26:52,034
And, oh... Here...

803
01:26:52,444 --> 01:26:55,083
Sometimes we could hear
beautyfull Music.

804
01:27:03,923 --> 01:27:07,677
Oh, here... The Pound, we put
the holes on the wrong Side...

805
01:27:08,203 --> 01:27:10,034
Pfiffig, Hey?

806
01:27:13,283 --> 01:27:16,195
So, Guys.
Now you can ask Questions.

807
01:27:26,323 --> 01:27:28,883
I told him, not to give up.

808
01:27:30,723 --> 01:27:34,511
I just told him, to hang in there
till it's over with.

809
01:27:37,123 --> 01:27:38,442
That Idiot!

810
01:27:38,843 --> 01:27:40,481
Nothing but away from here.

811
01:27:42,483 --> 01:27:44,474
Just forget everything!

812
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:52,672
Where...

813
01:27:54,123 --> 01:27:56,842
Where should I...? He's dead.

814
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:16,114
Full House.

815
01:28:27,082 --> 01:28:28,800
Full House.

816
01:28:32,442 --> 01:28:33,841
Monsieur?

817
01:28:49,762 --> 01:28:52,879
Gentlemen, Place your Bets.

818
01:28:55,762 --> 01:28:57,718
36, red, over 18.

819
01:28:58,722 --> 01:29:00,440
Place your Bets.

820
01:29:08,842 --> 01:29:10,719
All bets are closed.

821
01:29:11,122 --> 01:29:13,272
30, red, over 18.

822
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:15,956
Place your Bets.

823
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:20,393
All bets are closed.

824
01:29:32,481 --> 01:29:35,279
Change?
- No, Tip for the Staff.

825
01:29:35,681 --> 01:29:37,114
Thank you very much, Monsieur.

826
01:29:40,601 --> 01:29:44,719
Monsieur, Can I offer you a bottle
of Champagne it's on the House?

827
01:30:08,841 --> 01:30:12,197
You realy had bad Luck.

828
01:30:17,081 --> 01:30:18,673
So much Money...

829
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,710
So much Money.

830
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,475
We can make new Money.

831
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,271
A Total of 132 Million Pounds,

832
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,831
Had been Produced
in Sachsenhausen

833
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:48,472
Wich was four times the value
of Englands Bankreserves.

834
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,718
Because of the stalling tatics by
the inmates at the prison camp,

835
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:54,435
Only a very small amount of the
Dollar was Produced.

836
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:59,516
Oporation Bernhard was the biggest.
Counterfeit Program of all Time.
