1
00:00:57,167 --> 00:01:01,160
I was 11 when I realized
how dangerous it was to be a Jew.

2
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,286
My father called me
to his study one day,

3
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:10,883
and said in order to survive,
we had to separate.

4
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:15,924
Papa then began to pound the
Catholic prayers into my head,

5
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:18,798
so that I would pretend
to be a Catholic,

6
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,843
assuring me
that God would understand.

7
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:25,277
But when he began
to put me in the closet,.,

8
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:28,083
my mother and father began
to argue,

9
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:31,118
And once I heard him cry,

10
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:41,200
Does the holy communion
really taste like blood and flesh?

11
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:47,762
Hail Marys,
Can't let go until you're finished.

12
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:52,237
Hail Mary, full of grace,

13
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:54,081
The Lord is with thee.

14
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:57,196
Blessed art thou among women,

15
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:00,446
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus,

16
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,645
Holy Mary, mother of God,.

17
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,243
pray for us now
and at our deaths later.

18
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,800
No, that's not it.

19
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:11,159
You need to be strong.

20
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,120
I brought the potatoes.

21
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:24,806
I can't lift my arms.

22
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:28,719
Don't make me do it anymore.

23
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:32,484
Max!

24
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,079
Max, he's here. You told me
he was coming on Thursday.

25
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,800
He wants to take him right away.

26
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:43,564
What happened?

27
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,237
Professor, if you want me to take
the boy, it has to happen now.

28
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:47,523
Wait.

29
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:50,601
There's no time.
It has to be now. Yes?

30
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:53,243
But he's not ready.
He has nothing packed.

31
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,286
Professor, yes or no?

32
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,439
Do you have
the baptismal certificates?

33
00:02:58,087 --> 00:02:58,724
Here.

34
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,842
A priest arranged them
for all three of you.

35
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:06,204
Romek!

36
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:08,000
Sarah, bring him here.

37
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,718
Mama, I don't want to go!

38
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:14,480
Go get him some clothes.
Quickly!

39
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,756
He's not going anywhere!

40
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,996
No!

41
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,238
Romek, you have to go now.

42
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,201
Please let me stay!

43
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,201
Let go! Mama!

44
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:36,876
Boy, get down.

45
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,598
Papa... Let me stay.

46
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,161
Romek, please.

47
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:23,523
Halt! Can't pass!

48
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,041
Papers.

49
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:27,916
What are you carrying?

50
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:29,444
Potatoes.

51
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,843
Jew! Stop him, he's a Jew!

52
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:43,524
It's him.

53
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,603
Let's go.

54
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,444
On your way. Fast.

55
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:22,523
Praise the Lord.

56
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:29,044
So... this is the boy.

57
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:30,644
Yes.

58
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:36,484
Father!

59
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:37,764
Oh no!

60
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:39,876
Father!

61
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,761
She's driving me crazy.
You must talk to her.

62
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,963
She's telling me again I stink.

63
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,166
Maybe it's time to jump
in the river.

64
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,006
But I can't swim.

65
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:52,766
Find a shallow spot.

66
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:02,324
As we approached the village,
Mr, Lipa said,

67
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,644
that the Germans
loved to kill and eat a lot

68
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,598
They took
from the Poles almost all,

69
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:11,401
the cows, goats,
and pigs,

70
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,043
Vladek! Open the gate!

71
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:18,484
Hello, neighbor!

72
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,082
You have a visitor.

73
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:23,085
Yes.
This is my wife's cousin's son.

74
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,046
They lost their house in a bombing.

75
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:27,040
He's going to stay with us
for a few months.

76
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,205
What nice, noble features.

77
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,406
He looks like a precious music box.

78
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:35,756
Vladek, faster!

79
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:42,963
I'm glad Mr. Lipa
was such a good lier,

80
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:47,078
He said: "You'repart
of my family from Cracow. "

81
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:13,682
His name is Romek.

82
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:35,640
Vladek, say Grace.

83
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:42,924
Bless... Bless us...

84
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,361
Bless us for these...

85
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:47,436
Bless us for...

86
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:50,960
Bless for...

87
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:58,560
Why don't you make him say it?

88
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:00,925
No. You say it.

89
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,881
Bless us, oh Lord, for these,
thy gifts, which we...

90
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:10,275
are about to receive from the bounty
through Christ our Lord.

91
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:12,957
Amen.

92
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:15,999
Vladek, I want you
to go to the quarry...

93
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,964
and wash the cart
for Sunday Mass.

94
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:27,683
Papa...

95
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:30,959
Can I show him the pig?

96
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:33,964
What?

97
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:35,766
Can I show him the pig?

98
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:38,557
After the meal.

99
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:44,956
Romek, come.

100
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:49,883
Listen, boy...

101
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,040
Don't tell anyone about this pig.
Anyone!

102
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:54,563
You understand?

103
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,879
It wasn't very smart
for Mr. Lipa to hide the pig,

104
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:02,438
and the Jew in the same house,

105
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:10,846
If the Germans find out
about the pig,

106
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,599
He's going to get us all killed.

107
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,845
It's just for a few months.

108
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:24,842
Vladek, not a word
of this to Tolo.

109
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,638
For hiding a pig from the Germans,

110
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:31,517
there was a penalty of death,

111
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,835
Go! Go!

112
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,565
No, Vladek! Stop it!

113
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,162
No, Vladek!

114
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,036
Stop it, Vladek!

115
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,119
Pyra, stop it!

116
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,001
My mother said that the world
was upside down,

117
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:18,484
Two plus two equaled seven,
Or even one hundred.

118
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:20,640
But never four,

119
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,280
Right answers were dangerous,

120
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:25,961
And so were the kids,

121
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,126
Especially Maria,
Vladek's girlfriend,

122
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:32,960
And Robaland Pyra.

123
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:36,559
Look! Vladek's cousin.
He's a spy. Get him!

124
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,119
He's too pretty.
Let's hang him.

125
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:51,717
Come on, you guys.

126
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,756
Hey, where is Romek?

127
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:08,684
Tolo?

128
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,646
In the pig house.

129
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,644
Why?

130
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,316
Vladek put him there.

131
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:19,483
Go and get him in here.

132
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:21,283
Now!

133
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:36,603
Get out!

134
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:49,164
Stop it!

135
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:52,644
You two better get along.

136
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:56,201
You understand? Answer me.

137
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:02,721
You sleep together tonight.

138
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,887
My brother knows
how to break noses, you know.

139
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:12,325
Vladek, show him!

140
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:19,116
If Papa hadn't stopped me,...

141
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,004
you would have gotten this.

142
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,041
You are dead.

143
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,000
Come sleep in my bed.

144
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:55,358
She's having her nightmare again.

145
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:56,484
Shut up.

146
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,003
She works so hard during the day...

147
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:04,641
and it all comes
back to her at night.

148
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,358
Tolo is so stupid.

149
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:55,802
On Sunday, I went to a church
for the first time in my life,

150
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:57,957
I was scared,

151
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:01,397
I knew all the other children
would be there,

152
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:13,561
Of course, when you really look...

153
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,525
at the group that Jesus
surrounded himself with,...

154
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:20,521
They were all human mongrels.

155
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,526
"Mongrels!"

156
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,321
We are all lucky to be alive.

157
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,642
Everybody here
who goes to the toilet...

158
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:38,960
every day for one minute
should be happy.

159
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:40,044
But...

160
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,279
can you smile
like this little child?

161
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:46,044
No.

162
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,957
All I ever hear from you are grunts,
groans and complaints.

163
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:55,120
But somehow, you survive
another day to fill your mouth...

164
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,795
with the food your wife
is feeding you.

165
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:01,404
How can you be so ungrateful?

166
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:05,757
How can you be so unkind to God?

167
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:10,439
Today I'm starting
catechism classes.

168
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:14,922
For all those lost souls,
who because of the war,...

169
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,558
haven't had
their first communion yet.

170
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,805
Vladek, Pyra,...

171
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:27,036
Maria, Romek...
And you too, Tolo.

172
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:30,004
I want you all at the first class.

173
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:32,637
This afternoon. After the Mass.

174
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,725
Be there, or you're dead.

175
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:40,198
What is the holy communion?

176
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,444
A wafer.

177
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,320
Tolo thinks it's a wafer.

178
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:48,879
Vladek, what do you think?

179
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:52,764
Romek?

180
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,956
It is the feast of the body
and blood of Christ.

181
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,606
Exactly.

182
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,166
Kick his ass.

183
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:06,602
Who has got a knife?

184
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:11,684
Pyra.

185
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:21,196
You little fools.

186
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:25,438
You think it's wine I'm drinking...

187
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:27,717
at the altar every Sunday
at Holy Communion?

188
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:32,239
No. It's the blood of Christ.

189
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,001
And it is not a wafer.

190
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,640
It's Christ's flesh.

191
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,161
Can I have my knife back?

192
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:49,682
Father!

193
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,919
The Germans came to Batylin's Field!

194
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,645
They're looking for pigs!

195
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,005
Father, he's going to kill me.

196
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,202
No!

197
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:16,316
Officer...

198
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:20,800
Please... take the pigs,
and forgive them.

199
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,356
Catch me these pigs.

200
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:29,924
What?

201
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,920
Catch me these pigs.

202
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,440
For every pig you catch,...

203
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:41,276
save one life.

204
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,601
Now you're a pig catcher.

205
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:00,397
I'll give you one minute
for each one.

206
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:06,724
Begin.

207
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,482
You still have one minute.

208
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:52,997
Come on.

209
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,522
Come on.

210
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:12,480
Why did Maria run away?

211
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,807
She saw her parents
being killed like that.

212
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:18,363
Now she acts weird sometimes.

213
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,400
Did you go to the trains?

214
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,966
None of your business.

215
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:27,237
Go to sleep.

216
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:39,196
What trains?

217
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,641
I can't tell you.

218
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,037
Why not?

219
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,038
Vladek told me not to.

220
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:07,726
The day after the killing in the
fields, I saw the priest in the barn.

221
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:24,598
I think he was arguing with God,

222
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,203
Hey, Tolo!

223
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:33,167
You ever see your cousin
before he came here?

224
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:34,324
No.

225
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,640
Why aren't you
with your parents, boy?

226
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,525
Our house was bombed
by the Germans a few weeks ago,...

227
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:46,482
and my parents...

228
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:48,560
Ah, yes.

229
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,361
My mother got hurt,...

230
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:56,041
and she is with other relatives
who are taking care of her.

231
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:58,718
You should be
with your family, boy.

232
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:11,400
One day, the priest
gave us a game to play.

233
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:17,640
I think that's where Tolo
began to get his strange ideas,

234
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:20,039
I want you to play a little game.

235
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,558
Vladek, take these sticks.

236
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,515
The names of the apostles
are written on them.

237
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:29,560
There are lots.
Take two apostles each.

238
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:32,765
Learn about them.
Become them.

239
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,759
And study this book.
It has pictures.

240
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:43,796
You almost caught those pigs,
Father.

241
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:45,322
What did you say?

242
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,405
You almost caught them.

243
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:49,716
We saw you.

244
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:41,406
You, get lost.
Jesus didn't play with girls.

245
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,717
Go to hell, Vladek.
I'm not going anywhere.

246
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:49,357
Vladek, there is a blank stick.
We can put Jesus in there.

247
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:51,239
The priest didn't say to do Jesus.

248
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,165
You can't have apostles
without Jesus.

249
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:57,317
Give me that blank Jesus stick!

250
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:02,604
Okay, fine.

251
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,479
The blank one is Jesus.
Fair enough?

252
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:14,204
Okay. Everybody draws
at the same time.

253
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:16,444
Close your eyes.

254
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:19,001
Here we go. No peeking.

255
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:31,563
Hey, give that back!

256
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,764
She got Judas! The traitor!

257
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:54,596
You can keep it.

258
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:00,241
But who got Jesus?

259
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:01,644
I did.

260
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:03,357
I should get it.

261
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:04,683
Hey, give me that.

262
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:05,524
No.

263
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:07,763
Fine. You have to hang
on the cross then.

264
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:08,964
Okay.

265
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,635
At night.
When it's cold and dark.

266
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:12,763
Okay.

267
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:16,284
But Vladek can't throw me
in the water,...

268
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:21,045
and he can't hit me anymore.
I'm Jesus.

269
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:33,759
Tolo asked me why Jesus wanted
to be crucifiied,

270
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:36,722
"To save all the people"
I told him.

271
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,717
I think he liked my answer.

272
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,116
Pound it hard.

273
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:45,437
No, I don't want to do it.

274
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:51,964
That hurts.

275
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,878
What are you doing?

276
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,796
I know what they're doing.
Playing Jesus games.

277
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:06,204
You know, you can do exercises
that will make it hurt less.

278
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:07,476
What exercises?

279
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,565
You can put your hand in a fire.

280
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:14,284
Or you can run naked in the rain.

281
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,676
Or you can make a crown
with a rose bush...

282
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:23,356
and wear it on your head.

283
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:25,876
Pyra! Come here!

284
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:30,163
Stop it! You're drunk!

285
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:33,717
You shut up.
I want to talk to my neighbor.

286
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,441
Praise the Lord!

287
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:44,126
Praise the Lord!

288
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:45,242
Neighbor...

289
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:48,367
You know we have to be
very careful.

290
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:53,240
Germans everywhere.
Batylin is finished!

291
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:54,204
I know.

292
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:08,398
You are the most beautiful woman
in this entire village.

293
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:14,042
I'm sorry, my wife.
You too are very beautiful.

294
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:19,325
But in a different way, I mean.
Lucky devil.

295
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:23,484
Beautiful wife, beautiful farm,...

296
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:25,400
beautiful cousin.

297
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:29,486
Is that what you came here for?

298
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,082
It's time to go home.

299
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,637
Gniecio,... You are not doing...

300
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:40,839
something stupid
that could get us all killed?

301
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:44,922
Or are you?

302
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:48,082
Okay. Let's go.

303
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,002
Father.

304
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,358
Vladek says that Jesus
didn't play with girls.

305
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:13,804
Is that true?

306
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:21,363
Are you still Vladek's girlfriend?

307
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:28,283
Did you ever... kiss him?

308
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:37,643
You must be without sin...

309
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:40,638
when you take
your first communion.

310
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:44,284
Pure.

311
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,162
Do you know
about Mary Magdalen?

312
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:57,404
No.

313
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:02,916
Read about her.

314
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,837
Professor Pyra!
Where was Jesus born?

315
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:17,557
In the Vatican.

316
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:20,117
Oh, so he was Italian?

317
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:21,403
Yes, father.

318
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:23,598
No. Jewish.

319
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:25,764
He was a Jew.

320
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:29,924
Jew?!

321
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:43,563
Quiet!

322
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:47,035
Get up!

323
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,282
I have an idea.

324
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:53,240
I will spend an hour
in the barn with my beloved.

325
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:59,157
When I come out, you will play
the villagers and stone me.

326
00:30:00,847 --> 00:30:02,041
Ready?

327
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,036
No chance.

328
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:25,163
I wanted to scream for help,

329
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:28,158
But it was too late,

330
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:04,082
What are they doing?

331
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,527
They are lying naked
on top of each other.

332
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,764
That's awful.

333
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,801
Do you want to see me?

334
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:46,483
Can I see you?

335
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:49,844
No.

336
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:52,403
Why not?

337
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:55,444
Because.

338
00:32:51,127 --> 00:32:52,242
Did she show it to you?

339
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:55,926
I've seen it twenty times already.

340
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:58,802
And what did you do to stop me
from going into the barn?

341
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:02,555
You coward.
I'm through with you.

342
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,039
Soldier,juden!

343
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:13,359
Soldier, jew!

344
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:16,480
Vladek, are you crazy? Stop it.

345
00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:22,285
Let's go!

346
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:26,597
What did you say?

347
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:29,524
Jew.

348
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,960
Where is the Jew?

349
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:42,723
I'm a Jew.

350
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:47,604
You are?

351
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:50,084
Yes.

352
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:52,403
No, he's not. He's joking.

353
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:57,679
Hans! Hurry up. I'm melting.

354
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:04,716
Coming.

355
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:08,963
Hans, help me!

356
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:14,563
Wait for me!

357
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,361
Tolo, take off your hat.

358
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:33,676
Take that hat off.

359
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:38,719
Take that hat off!

360
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:41,522
Old witch.

361
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:42,564
What did you say?

362
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:44,243
Gniecio!

363
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:47,802
You haven't gotten a good spanking
in a long time.

364
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:48,877
I need it!

365
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,926
Gniecio! I think you better talk
to this boy!

366
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,239
Look what he's wearing
on his head.

367
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:55,476
Take the hat off.

368
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,519
Tolo, take the hat off.

369
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:02,486
Take it off.

370
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:33,156
Why are you doing this?

371
00:36:05,527 --> 00:36:09,679
For a while, I set one stone
for each day that passed,

372
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:15,679
But time passed, and there were
more and more stones,

373
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:17,356
And no one came,

374
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:58,279
Tonight we are raising the pig.

375
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:00,604
Why?

376
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:02,766
It's getting too dangerous
to keep it.

377
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:05,480
Kluba will go with me.

378
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,923
Kluba's been snooping
around here for months.

379
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,160
He asked me to get rid of it.

380
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:22,000
He has found a buyer
in town.

381
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:24,164
Don't.

382
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:32,163
Come on, Romek.

383
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:35,604
All you have to do is push
on its belly with your hands.

384
00:37:37,447 --> 00:37:38,163
Ready?

385
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:40,564
Now.

386
00:37:43,407 --> 00:37:44,317
Harder.

387
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:48,482
Harder!

388
00:37:57,407 --> 00:38:00,399
She's having
a big nightmare tonight.

389
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:44,957
Alright, back up!

390
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:51,841
I'll be back in the morning.

391
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:56,956
Mr. Lipa was like my father,
He would do anything for his family,

392
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:03,041
-Be careful.
-I will.

393
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,441
Get up!

394
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:35,682
Get up!

395
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:38,802
Get up!

396
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:44,402
Get up!

397
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:47,762
Get up!

398
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,125
-Mama, please stop!
-No!

399
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:53,243
-Please stop!
-No!

400
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:56,205
I don't know what happened.

401
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:59,115
Gniecio left with the man
who bought the pig.

402
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:02,999
I waited for hours.
Then I went to look for him.

403
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:06,440
And some people told me
the Germans shot somebody.

404
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:09,766
I found him in a ditch
and I brought him here.

405
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:12,002
That's all I know.

406
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:13,442
What about the money?

407
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,155
I checked. He didn't have any.

408
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:23,843
Get up! Get up!

409
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:27,918
You stupid fool!

410
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:31,636
Get up!

411
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:11,995
-Praise the Lord!
-Praise the Lord!

412
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:38,406
Just watch Tolo.
He loves you so much.

413
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:08,878
Tolo comforted his mother,

414
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,158
but he never cried,

415
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:19,437
Then, on the night
of the funeral,

416
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:23,118
he did something very odd.

417
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:43,722
Tolo!

418
00:42:45,807 --> 00:42:46,922
What are you doing?

419
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:48,926
-Tolo!
-Get off me!

420
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,761
Tolo! Are you insane?

421
00:42:56,367 --> 00:43:00,724
Leave me alone!
I have to do my exercises!

422
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:02,400
-Tolo!
-No!

423
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:04,406
Get off of me!

424
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:05,920
Stop this game!

425
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:07,037
Tolo!

426
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,516
Romek, what's going on?

427
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:20,880
What did you do with him?

428
00:43:22,007 --> 00:43:23,122
He was running in the rain.

429
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:25,566
Why did you let him?

430
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:27,402
I didn't.

431
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:29,319
-What?
-I went to get him.

432
00:43:29,527 --> 00:43:32,485
-I told you to watch out for him.
-I did.

433
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:36,317
It was the only thing I asked you
to do in this house for me!

434
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:37,444
Get out!

435
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:39,195
-Get out!
-Mama, don't do it!

436
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,278
I said get out.

437
00:43:42,007 --> 00:43:43,884
Romek, don't go!

438
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:46,796
Mama, stop him!

439
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:49,277
Oh, my baby, you are going
to get sick again.

440
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:58,956
What happened?

441
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:03,926
Did Vladek do something to you?

442
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:06,802
They threw me out.

443
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,236
Who's that?

444
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,398
Don't worry. She can hardly see.

445
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:18,006
Come here, boy.

446
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,165
Closer.

447
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:30,965
City boy.

448
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:43,556
Lie next to me.

449
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:09,526
You are so wet.

450
00:45:25,687 --> 00:45:28,121
I felt safe with Maria.

451
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:29,237
Look at me.

452
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:31,796
I liked how she smelt like strawberrys,

453
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:34,682
It remindme of my mother,

454
00:46:10,607 --> 00:46:11,676
Vladek is coming.

455
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:16,638
It's okay. I will talk to him.

456
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:20,197
What do you want?

457
00:46:21,287 --> 00:46:22,481
I want to talk to Romek.

458
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:24,003
Romek isn't here.

459
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:27,644
Romek?

460
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:31,845
Tolo is very sick.
He wants you to come back.

461
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:34,122
He wants all the kids to come.

462
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:36,481
He asked especially for you.

463
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:38,404
Romek!

464
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:52,440
Mama, go away.

465
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:54,204
What?

466
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:57,241
Please, Mama.

467
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:11,363
Romek,...

468
00:47:14,327 --> 00:47:15,442
I'm sorry.

469
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,125
I have a plan.

470
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:32,558
And all of you are in it.

471
00:47:34,407 --> 00:47:36,318
On that special night...

472
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:42,322
What special night?

473
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:43,877
One night...

474
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:48,085
I'm going to hang on the tree.

475
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,035
All night.

476
00:47:54,647 --> 00:47:56,558
And I am going...

477
00:47:58,007 --> 00:48:01,522
to make them all come back.

478
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:03,204
Who?

479
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:05,122
Everyone.

480
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,683
Who, Tolo?

481
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:08,444
Papa.

482
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:15,485
And yours. And yours too, Romek.

483
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:19,516
And we all have to take...

484
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:22,159
a bath together...

485
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:24,161
Get baptized.

486
00:48:25,287 --> 00:48:27,118
Get baptized together.

487
00:48:28,087 --> 00:48:29,486
To get ready.

488
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:39,725
Say "yes", everybody.

489
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:41,203
Yes, Tolo.

490
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:46,883
Yes, Tolo.

491
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:50,957
Yes, Tolo.

492
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,081
I'm not putting my head in it.

493
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:54,357
You have to.

494
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:55,956
You promised Tolo.

495
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:12,800
Please stand on the side.

496
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:18,242
Please do it.

497
00:49:25,687 --> 00:49:28,804
Thank you. Could you lean down?
I have to kiss you.

498
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:30,966
Oh, no!

499
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:17,436
Because you shiver,...

500
00:50:22,407 --> 00:50:23,681
by this holy river,...

501
00:50:25,247 --> 00:50:26,805
and you might get cold.

502
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:29,518
Listen to me. And remember...

503
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:31,998
that you all put your heads
in the bucket.

504
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,204
And now you have
to follow me.

505
00:50:35,207 --> 00:50:36,959
I'm going to suffer for you.

506
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:44,644
But I'm going to make things better.

507
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:48,195
You did a good job.

508
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:02,642
Vladek, come here.

509
00:51:09,447 --> 00:51:10,084
It's Robal.

510
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,403
They've been to the trains.

511
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:14,765
I knew to avoid Kluba.

512
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,927
But, how could I stay away
from his sons?

513
00:51:20,087 --> 00:51:21,202
Well, well, well,...

514
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,479
Mr. Very Late Apostle.

515
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,118
I'm not playing these games anymore.

516
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,005
Robal says they're stupid.

517
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:30,083
Stupid!

518
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:33,156
What are you going to do?
Stop the war?!

519
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:34,962
You promised.

520
00:51:39,287 --> 00:51:42,882
Make my tooth grow back.
Now!

521
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:44,763
Come up the ladder.

522
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,361
Close your eyes.

523
00:51:56,727 --> 00:51:59,958
Evil demons
that stop tooth growth,...

524
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:01,562
go away!

525
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,998
Nothing!

526
00:52:14,527 --> 00:52:17,519
He can't do shit.
Teeth should be easy.

527
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,798
You did that on purpose,
you little dwarf.

528
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:27,203
If you go, you can't come back.

529
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:28,204
I'm going.

530
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:29,317
You creepy traitor.

531
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:33,685
A bunch of kids and a girl...

532
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:36,876
And this sissy here, playing Jesus.

533
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:40,723
Pyra! Don't go!

534
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:42,326
I love you.

535
00:52:42,487 --> 00:52:44,637
Stop! Right now.
Don't touch me.

536
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:47,641
You are not Jesus!

537
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,480
And you should be on those trains.

538
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:58,002
Romek! Head!

539
00:53:03,207 --> 00:53:05,641
My nose!

540
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:08,162
Pyra!

541
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:11,122
Pyra!

542
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:15,686
Pyra, don't go!

543
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:18,997
My nose is broken!

544
00:53:31,287 --> 00:53:33,164
I had to go for myself.

545
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,525
People were whispering that you use
for going in one direction only,

546
00:54:39,087 --> 00:54:41,806
Did your father jump after you?

547
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:43,283
Yes.

548
00:54:44,527 --> 00:54:45,243
Who's that?

549
00:54:46,847 --> 00:54:47,836
Papa?

550
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:50,876
Is that you?

551
00:54:52,807 --> 00:54:53,637
There's nobody there.

552
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:27,281
You went to the trains.

553
00:55:31,807 --> 00:55:33,525
Were they jumping tonight?

554
00:55:37,047 --> 00:55:37,684
Yes.

555
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:53,119
I told you. I really don't know
what happened.

556
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,679
Gniecio sold the pig
to the man. I saw him.

557
00:55:56,847 --> 00:56:00,123
The man in town said Gniecio
never sold him the pig.

558
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:01,243
He's a liar.

559
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,438
He said another man
sold him the pig.

560
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:11,399
A man with a big mustache
like you.

561
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:17,196
What are you going to do?
Rat on me?

562
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:19,563
To who?

563
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:27,923
That boy across the road.

564
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:31,920
How much money
did you make on that?

565
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:33,845
Get out of here!

566
00:56:46,047 --> 00:56:47,526
How long have you been there?

567
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:49,764
Kluba knows about me.

568
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:52,957
What's he going to do?

569
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:55,802
Probably nothing.

570
00:56:56,607 --> 00:56:57,642
What's going to happen to me?

571
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:01,803
Don't worry about him. Come.
Let me show you something.

572
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:11,597
What are these?

573
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:12,917
Holy hosts.

574
00:57:14,527 --> 00:57:15,801
-Do you want some?
-No.

575
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:20,680
Don't worry.
They aren't hosts yet.

576
00:57:21,927 --> 00:57:24,964
They are just the edges.
I never bless the edges.

577
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:33,002
Are we blessed?

578
00:57:34,847 --> 00:57:36,280
Or are we just the edges?

579
00:57:36,647 --> 00:57:38,603
We are all scraps, Romek.

580
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:41,400
And we are all blessed the same.

581
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:47,920
But not all the people. Right?

582
00:58:03,127 --> 00:58:04,321
For Batylin.

583
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:07,276
His wife.

584
00:58:13,487 --> 00:58:14,522
Vladek's father.

585
00:58:21,087 --> 00:58:22,440
Maria's parents.

586
00:58:30,327 --> 00:58:32,602
I went to the trains last night.

587
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:36,004
My parents aren't coming back
for me, are they?

588
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:38,442
Probably not.

589
00:59:16,127 --> 00:59:19,005
What will you do with me
if my parents don't come back?

590
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:21,556
They will come back.

591
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:26,037
What if they get a sickness?
Or die in the war?

592
00:59:33,087 --> 00:59:34,679
You can stay here.

593
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:49,116
Take those nice shoes off.

594
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:57,082
Okay, you can look.

595
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:02,922
What are you doing?

596
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:04,204
Follow me.

597
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:10,118
Come on. All the way.

598
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:22,121
What now?

599
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:26,597
I promise I will love you always.
And I don't love Vladek.

600
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:30,717
I'm glad you came to our village.
And I'm glad they didn't hang you.

601
01:00:31,407 --> 01:00:34,126
And I like your nose
and your hair and your skin.

602
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:36,638
Now, you promise.
Don't let go!

603
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:42,445
I promise I'll work hard
to buy you lots and lots of perfume.

604
01:00:43,047 --> 01:00:46,483
And I'll always be your boyfriend.
I mean husband.

605
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:48,799
I always wanted
to marry a city boy.

606
01:00:49,247 --> 01:00:49,884
My arms!

607
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:04,039
Tolo took the part of asking God
to bring our parents back,

608
01:01:04,447 --> 01:01:05,721
very seriously,

609
01:01:06,887 --> 01:01:09,276
I don'tknow
why we didn't stop him,

610
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:22,283
Harder.

611
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:52,325
I want to be alone.

612
01:02:03,247 --> 01:02:04,043
Papa?

613
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,241
I'm hanging!

614
01:02:35,727 --> 01:02:37,558
Hey, dwarf in the tree.

615
01:02:39,247 --> 01:02:41,807
How did you get up there?
You are so skinny.

616
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:44,358
No food, huh?

617
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,318
What do you want?

618
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:54,838
Hey, Robal, how are the sheep?

619
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,286
Everybody knows.

620
01:02:57,687 --> 01:02:58,324
What sheep?

621
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:03,760
Sheep are better than girls.

622
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:04,843
You better shut up.

623
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:06,766
Stop it, everybody!

624
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:11,800
Shut that little slut up.

625
01:03:12,087 --> 01:03:13,122
Get out of here.

626
01:03:13,287 --> 01:03:15,676
No, Vladek.
If you dwarfs weren't so busy...

627
01:03:15,847 --> 01:03:18,759
playing games with each other,
you could make some money.

628
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:20,116
Piss on you!

629
01:03:20,607 --> 01:03:22,518
You're so stupid.
Just like your father.

630
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:26,519
Let me go, you bastard!

631
01:03:36,487 --> 01:03:38,045
Come on. Let's get out of here.

632
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:44,882
We're going home.

633
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:55,525
Vladek, what are you doing?

634
01:03:56,807 --> 01:04:00,641
Don't touch it. Don't untie me.

635
01:04:01,047 --> 01:04:03,322
Tolo, stop it. We're going home.

636
01:04:03,527 --> 01:04:07,406
No! Don't untie me!
You promised!

637
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,236
You put your head in the bucket.

638
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:13,041
Mongrels.

639
01:04:13,887 --> 01:04:17,926
Now Papa is never coming back.

640
01:04:19,047 --> 01:04:21,800
You killed him, Vladek.

641
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:51,203
Zyta!

642
01:05:51,927 --> 01:05:53,519
Leon! I'm here.

643
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:57,276
Where's Moshe?

644
01:05:57,647 --> 01:05:59,603
I don't know. He jumped first.

645
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,361
Go find him.

646
01:06:05,567 --> 01:06:06,522
Moshe...

647
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:09,442
Moshe...

648
01:06:15,007 --> 01:06:16,235
Bring him.

649
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:19,916
Can you walk?

650
01:06:22,207 --> 01:06:23,196
Hurry up!

651
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:29,323
Hurry up!

652
01:06:34,727 --> 01:06:35,716
Stop!

653
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,201
Where are you going?

654
01:06:40,047 --> 01:06:40,843
What do they want?

655
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:43,965
You will tell your story
at the police station. Come on.

656
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:48,641
-We don't have any money.
-We have no money.

657
01:06:48,847 --> 01:06:50,121
No money?

658
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,635
If he sees us here, he'll kill us.

659
01:06:58,207 --> 01:07:00,926
Then what about gold or jewelry?
You have that?

660
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,643
Vladek, slow down.

661
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:18,044
Kluba...

662
01:07:21,527 --> 01:07:23,643
Kluba killed your father.

663
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:25,244
What?

664
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:28,883
I over heard Kluba arguing
with the priest.

665
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:31,887
The priest went to town
and found out...

666
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:35,277
it was Kluba
who sold the pig.

667
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:05,882
Your mother's?

668
01:08:09,927 --> 01:08:11,121
Somebody's mother's.

669
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:15,926
Hey, city boy.

670
01:09:16,127 --> 01:09:18,402
What did you mean by what you said,
"somebody's mother"?

671
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:21,275
-Are you spying on me?
-Romek, let's go.

672
01:09:28,647 --> 01:09:30,046
What do you know, Jew boy?

673
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:46,806
Robal, stop it, you idiot!

674
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:48,760
Shut up, you little whore!

675
01:09:55,807 --> 01:09:57,206
Let's throw him in.

676
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,406
-No.
-Yeah.

677
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:00,684
Okay.

678
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:00,002
What are you doing, Robal?

679
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,357
Get lost!

680
01:11:02,327 --> 01:11:03,282
Get lost!

681
01:11:22,287 --> 01:11:22,924
Vladek!

682
01:11:31,727 --> 01:11:32,876
Maria...

683
01:11:40,487 --> 01:11:41,124
Romek!

684
01:13:33,447 --> 01:13:37,520
Be careful, son. You have
your mother to take care of.

685
01:13:38,807 --> 01:13:41,196
And Tolo. And Romek.

686
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:45,844
Your father would be proud
of you.

687
01:14:19,767 --> 01:14:20,404
Let's go.

688
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:29,841
Are you coming?

689
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:26,396
Take your shoes off.

690
01:15:44,847 --> 01:15:46,838
Put your head down.

691
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,201
Hey, Robal!

692
01:16:15,807 --> 01:16:17,206
You're not going to shoot.

693
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:34,157
Stuff that in his mouth.
Shut him up.

694
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:46,480
We have no father.
Your father will have no son.

695
01:16:46,647 --> 01:16:47,602
Vladek, no!

696
01:17:01,047 --> 01:17:02,526
That was for you, Papa.

697
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:15,080
Vladek, give me the gun.

698
01:17:22,327 --> 01:17:22,964
Hands up!

699
01:17:23,927 --> 01:17:24,723
Romek, run!

700
01:17:26,087 --> 01:17:27,236
Hands up!

701
01:17:27,927 --> 01:17:29,201
Wait a minute!

702
01:18:02,607 --> 01:18:04,325
The boy is robbing the Jews.

703
01:18:17,047 --> 01:18:18,082
Pick it up later.

704
01:18:21,207 --> 01:18:21,844
Come here.

705
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:38,566
How much money
did you make tonight?

706
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:51,964
Look at me.

707
01:18:53,447 --> 01:18:54,641
Good job, Colonel.

708
01:19:01,967 --> 01:19:03,764
Would you like
to go for a ride?

709
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:07,084
Come.

710
01:19:50,607 --> 01:19:51,244
Franz!

711
01:19:56,407 --> 01:19:57,283
Stop here.

712
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:00,725
I've got to show you something.
Just wait.

713
01:20:03,767 --> 01:20:05,598
Come with me.

714
01:20:08,487 --> 01:20:09,681
Listen...

715
01:20:11,367 --> 01:20:12,243
When I say "go",...

716
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:16,325
you do the same thing you did
in the forest, all right?

717
01:20:17,447 --> 01:20:18,084
Come with me.

718
01:20:18,967 --> 01:20:20,878
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

719
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:26,398
Look at this boy.

720
01:20:27,207 --> 01:20:27,844
Romek!

721
01:20:29,967 --> 01:20:31,002
Go!

722
01:20:32,047 --> 01:20:32,718
Now watch.

723
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:08,316
Take the coat off.

724
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:12,996
Faster.

725
01:21:15,247 --> 01:21:16,760
And the vest.

726
01:21:26,207 --> 01:21:27,720
Good boy, huh?

727
01:21:43,927 --> 01:21:44,723
Take your shoes off.

728
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:53,443
Take your shoes off!

729
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:20,637
Come here!

730
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:24,160
Faster!

731
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:26,517
Shut up!

732
01:22:26,687 --> 01:22:29,804
I'm a Pole! I'm not a Jew!
Let me go!

733
01:22:30,007 --> 01:22:31,918
See? He's going something there.

734
01:22:34,127 --> 01:22:34,764
Beautiful.

735
01:22:35,527 --> 01:22:36,721
Good boy!

736
01:22:37,887 --> 01:22:40,685
-Shut up!
-Let me go! I'm not a Jew! I'm a Pole!

737
01:22:41,567 --> 01:22:42,886
Hey, what's going on there?

738
01:22:44,807 --> 01:22:46,081
I'm not a Jew! I'm a Pole!

739
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:48,485
-Bring him here.
-I know him.

740
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:50,679
-You know him?
-Yes. He's a Pole.

741
01:22:52,047 --> 01:22:54,845
I'm not a Jew! I'm a Pole!

742
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:00,723
-How do you know him?
-He was helping me.

743
01:23:00,887 --> 01:23:01,956
Where?

744
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:04,677
-In the forest.
-In the forest?

745
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:06,801
Let's see.

746
01:23:08,887 --> 01:23:09,956
Pull down your pants.

747
01:23:11,887 --> 01:23:12,842
Pull down your pants!

748
01:23:16,767 --> 01:23:17,882
Come here.

749
01:23:24,407 --> 01:23:25,920
I'm so sorry, Colonel.

750
01:23:26,367 --> 01:23:27,959
I'm so sorry.

751
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:30,082
Keep up the good work.

752
01:23:30,247 --> 01:23:32,715
And son, pull up your pants.

753
01:24:04,367 --> 01:24:05,720
-Tolo!
-Catch him!

754
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,078
-What do you think you doing?
-I know him.

755
01:24:09,247 --> 01:24:10,805
-That boy?
-Yes, Tolo.

756
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:14,642
That's my brother.

757
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:17,444
Come here.

758
01:24:25,087 --> 01:24:26,281
Do you know that boy?

759
01:24:27,447 --> 01:24:28,641
Do you know him?

760
01:24:36,927 --> 01:24:39,157
That boy says he is your brother.
Is he?

761
01:24:51,807 --> 01:24:52,444
Tolo!

762
01:24:56,287 --> 01:24:58,562
Do you want to go with them?

763
01:24:59,207 --> 01:25:00,401
So shut up!

764
01:25:33,567 --> 01:25:34,795
That's my brother!

765
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:07,719
Tolo!

766
01:26:55,447 --> 01:26:56,846
This is the lamb of God...

767
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:00,317
who washes away the sins
of the world.

768
01:27:01,607 --> 01:27:04,326
Happy are those
who He calls to His supper.

769
01:28:10,207 --> 01:28:11,196
Romek.

770
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:33,362
I will never forget Tolo,

771
01:28:35,647 --> 01:28:38,923
nor the kindness
of those who helped me,

772
01:28:41,087 --> 01:28:44,238
to remain who I am.
