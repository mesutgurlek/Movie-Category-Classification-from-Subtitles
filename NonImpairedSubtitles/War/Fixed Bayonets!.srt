Hey, did you hear
what happened?

4
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,323
The general went up in the line companies.
A shell got his jeep.

He's in the C.P.

I had a general like that in the last war,
General McNair. Remember him?

00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,980
All right, we've been
ordered to withdraw.

32
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,449
The boys upstairs want the whole division
pulled back right away.

33

What do you think our chances
are of ever getting back to this area?

34

It'll be rough, sir.
It means getting across this river.

35
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,257
There's a bridge right there at
that point. It's the only exit open.

36
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,491
Then we got to get to that bridge, cross
it and blow it up to give us a breather.

37
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,159

John, how's the enemy
picture look?

39
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,465
Very strong, General.
If I were the enemy...

40
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:06,205
and became aware of your withdrawal from
here to there, I'd start a full-scale attack.

41
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,770
The Reds have got
two armored divisions here...

42
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,875
a field division here and elements
of a regiment behind this hill.

43
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,444
Now, once we start moving
along this road to the river...

44
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,822
the Reds are going to form an iron triangle
that'll trap us and smash us in the gut...

45
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,020
unless they didn't know
we were withdrawing.

46
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,065
Well, in that case...

47
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,727
we'll have to withdraw without the Reds
knowing about it.

48
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,794
You should be evacuated, sir.
You're liable to lose your arm.

49
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,706
I'm more worried about losing my division.
Now clean it, dress it, tape it and forget it.

50
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,971
Will you hold that, sir?

51
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:48,243
There's only one way we can pull this off.
That's rearguard action.

52
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,551
We'll have to put up a front
and fool them.

53
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,558
We'll have to make them think
our rearguard is not a delaying action...

54
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,186
but a forward outpost
to this division's bivouac.

55
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,096
General, the spot is there.
Now, I looked over this terrain yesterday.

56
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,657
The hills are steep
on both sides of this pass...

57
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,193
and the road narrows down so that
only one tank at a time can get through.

58
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,400
All right, if we move down
that road, around that bend...

59
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,909
and set up a roadblock
right here at Bayonet Pass...

60
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,845
we stand a chance.

61
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,781
I suggest we leave
a full regiment to hold the pass...

62
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,411
so the enemy won't suspect that
we're pulling back the division.

63
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,752
Yes, but what happens to the regiment
after the division is across the river?

64
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,783
That might be just as costly for a regi ment
to try to pull back as a division.

65
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,852
We can do it with
a battalion or a company.

66
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,696
It should be a small, specially selected
unit of platoon strength.

67
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,430
Forty-eight of our toughest,
most experienced combat men.

68
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,904
It would mean sacrificing
less men in a gamble...

69
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,908
and an easier withdrawal
for the group if successful.

70
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,967
In other words,
what you're saying is...

71
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,776
if we can make a platoon sound
and look like a regiment, it'll work.

72
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,215
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,457
Well, that's it. Order the division
to move out right away.

00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,519
Yep. They're here now.

82
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,083
Nope. No time.
Get them on the road.

83
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,995
Somebody's got to get left behind
to get their bayonets wet.

84
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,728
It's tough picking out an outfit,
but it's got to be picked.

- Sir?

86
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,136
Pick a platoon
out of your regiment.

87
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,376
I know there's nothing dirtier
than a rearguard action...

88
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,475
especially at
platoon strength.

89
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,386
But in this case, it's 48 men-
unlucky men, maybe-

90
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,050
giving 15,000 men a break.

the platoon throw up the roadblock, huh?

107
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,681
We got to use our heads and make
these Reds think regiment's behind us.

[Rock] They ain't gonna hit us
with a lot of guys.

112
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,189
They're gonna smell us out first,
try and find out our strength.

113
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:37,429
We'll run into some small patrols.
Maybe one joker, maybe two, maybe three.

114

But whatever happens,
we don't want them to find out...

115
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,570
we're just a small rearguard
holding a delaying action.

- Rearguard? That's us?
- Yep.

What is this rearguard?

118
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,439
The object of the rearguard is to
check enemy pursuit and harassment...

119
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,576
and thus allow the main body
to retire unmolested.

Lieutenant Gibbs
was different.

298
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:10,646
Yeah, he was a young guy, sure,
but I don't hold that against him.

299
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,089
He was more like a sergeant.
He was on the ball.

300
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:18,093
- Now you move your butt out of here.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:21,460
- What's eating him?
- Aw, you know those sergeants.

302
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:24,125
All alike.

303
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:27,329
Frustrated
second lieutenants.

304
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:30,737
- Making noises like officers.
- [ Both Chuckling ]

305
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:34,436
He's ichiban now.
Mm-hmm.

306
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:37,639
- Big deal!
- [ Chuckling ]

307
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:42,583
- Number one boy.
- [ Both Laughing ]

308
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:45,678
Very funny.

309
00:28:45,755 --> 00:28:50,055
Bigmouth, climb out.
Climb!

310
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,996
So I'm frustrated, huh?

311
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:57,932
Look, Bigmouth, that is
the general direction.

312
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:00,196
Get out there
about a hundred yards...

313
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,001
keep your eyes open and stay there
till I send a relief.

314
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:08,238
If you see any people that don't look
exactly friendly, send up one flare.

315
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:13,337
If they got tanks,
send up two flares.

316
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:17,477
Oh, and, Bigmouth, be careful of the minefield.
I'd hate to lose you, all right?

317
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:19,613
Move out, Bigmouth.

318
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:28,295
Hey, you guys,
on your feet.

319
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,731
[ Spits ]

320
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,132
Get out there
and spread the word.

321
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:37,299
One flare, people.
Two flares, tanks.

322
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:39,899
- Tanks?
- You mean we're fighting tanks?

323
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:42,069
Spread the word.

324
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,204
Hey, you guys.
Okay up there?

325
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:47,375
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

326
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:51,680
They told me this was
going to be a police action.

327
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:54,223
- Why didn't they send cops?
- Hmm.

328
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,350
- Sarge.
- Hmm?

329
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,917
I've been watching you, Sarge.
I've been watching you out there...

330
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:01,862
and you came close to stepping in
some of the land mines.

331
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,764
- Ah, come on, Fitz. Will you cut out worrying?
- I mean it, Sarge.

332
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:08,930
You know, I got used to Lieutenant Gibbs,
and he got it just like that.

333
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:11,098
So?

334
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:15,270
Well, I feel like I'm a bad luck piece
'cause I'm getting kind of used to you.

335
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:20,977
[Coughing]

336
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,545
All right,
kill that fire!

337
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:29,058
- I thought the smoke would go down that drop.
- I cook the hot chow.

338
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,559
- I just want to get some heat.
- Well, kill it!

339
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:34,096
Bunch up. Heat will
come from your bodies.

340
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,629
Hey, Wolowicz,
did you find Lemchek?

341
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:46,643
Yeah. You were right, Corporal.
He was on the 30.

342
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,144
- He's had it.
- Yeah. What about my helmet?

343
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:51,612
Oh, I couldn't find yours.

344
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,644
Hey, how come we weren't
issued those stoves?

345
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,745
You're too young
for this kind of luxury.

346
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,620
- You looted that in Germany, didn't you, Rock?
- Yep. Aachen.

347
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:04,888
- Hey, Sarge, you know the fellow you got?
- Yeah. Which one?

348
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:07,088
The one that got
Lieutenant Gibbs.

349
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,154
A funny thing
about that joker.

350
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:11,496
When I stuck him,
he made a booming sound.

351
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:15,971
- Yeah, like a bass drum.
- Yeah. How'd you know?

352
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,599
Well, I heard it.

353
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:23,476
- What about him, Wolowicz?
- He had an extra pair of shoes on him...

354
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:25,946
just like my old
bowling sneakers.

355
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:29,507
- Let's see.
- Wolowicz, did he have any dry socks on him?

356
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:32,350
- [Wolowicz] No.
- I never could figure them Chinese.

357
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:37,189
Well, you know what I heard? I heard they're
doped up before they're sent into charges.

358
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,957
Oh, it isn't a question of opiates.
Now as a student of atavism-

359
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:46,366
What a crock! Mr. Belvedere
knows everything. Ha! I need a fumigator.

360
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:48,768
You've been around
a lot, Whitey.

361
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:53,244
When you get out, are you going on another
safari to Africa in your private plane?

362
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:58,110
No. All I want to do
is roll a couple of lines.

363
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,878
You mean, you like to bowl?

364
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:05,479
Wolowicz, there's nothing like
the thrill of a good, clean strike.

365
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:09,117
Good, clean strike. Instead of pulling that
dope's leg, why don't you drop dead, Whitey.

366
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:14,153
- Give your mouth a 10-minute break.
- Is that an order, Corporal?

367
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:17,132
-If you're looking for a fight,
there's a lot of people outside.
-Let's go.

368
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,396
- Who's gonna follow who?
- Meaning what?

369
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,167
-Whatever you think it means, Corporal.
-I think I'll slap your ears in.

370
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,504
There they are.

371
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:29,672
You bucking for his stripes? You want him
to get busted for taking a poke at you?

372
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,841
'Cause if he does, I didn't see a thing.
I'm snow-blind.

373
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:37,478
What's the matter with you, Mainotes?
We've got a good cover here. Ain't you happy?

374
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:39,988
I just don't
like that guy.

375
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,185
Well, then why don't you
get a transfer?

376
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,251
They got the buddy system now.

377
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:48,321
If you got a buddy, they'll put you
both together in the same outfit.

378
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,560
I got a buddy
in Pittsburgh.

379
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:55,196
Ah, she's a blonde and operates
her own pool hall.

380
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,740
Tell me, Sarge, whywere we picked
for this job?

381
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,902
Regiment's saving the cream
for the rougher stuff ahead.

382
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:04,436
Cream? Well, what are we,
skimmed milk?

383
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:08,076
So far,
we've just been lucky.

384
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,178
They blew them horns
to make us jumpy.

385
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:15,248
They knocked us off the hill
to see if we'd answer back with artillery.

386
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:19,262
They shellacked the pass
hoping we'd start a rout.

387
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,925
But we're still in luck.
Know why?

388
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,594
'Cause they think
we're the whole regiment.

389
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,728
So far, we got them fooled.

390
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,536
I wonder how long it'll be
before they get wise to us.

391
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:35,942
When you hear a tank, that's the main
event. That means they're wise to us.

392
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:39,540
A tank means they'll hit us with
more tanks and a lot ofpeople.

393
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:44,383
A tank means they'll push through us
like we were a paper bag.

394
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,787
So until you hear one,
take it easy.

395
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,220
We'll each take
two hours on O.P.

396
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,424
When I come off, it'll be time
to pull out for the bridge.

397
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:58,434
- Who's relieving Ramirez?
- Denno.

398
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:00,561
Ha. So you're putting
the corporal to work, huh?

399
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:05,506
Corporal's got to be able to do
something besides draw extra pay.

400
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,841
How did you get those stripes, Denno?
Dog rob for the colonel?

401
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:39,432
Only three things you got to worry about
in the infantry-your rifle and your two feet.

402
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,674
Pull off your boots and your socks.
Both pairs.

403
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,477
Come on. Bunch your canal boats
together like bananas.

404
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:52,181
Massaging's good
for beetle crushers.

405
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,315
Yours is purple, Denno.

406
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:58,327
Next, it'll be blue,
then trench foot, then frostbite.

407
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:01,831
Then they got to be chopped,
all 10 of them.

408
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,232
Ah, you've got to rub
harder than that. Here.

409
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:09,136
All we've got to worry about's where the Reds
are gonna hit us from in the morning.

410
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:12,733
If we can draw their fire without
losing a guy to locate their guns...

411
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,903
that's using our noodle.

412
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,578
- How's that?
- I don't feel anything.

413
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,742
Oh, yeah?

414
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:24,351
- Feel that?
- No.

415
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:26,480
Hey, Doc, come here.

416
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,255
Take a look
at Denno's foot.

417
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,833
You got it bad,
Corporal.

418
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:42,235
Hey.

419
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,367
Hey, you better start
stomping around on that, Denno.

420
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,741
Get the blood circulating.

421
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,644
Ah, that one always
did go to sleep on me.

422
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,122
Let's hit the sack.

423
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,161
[ Snoring ]

424
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:39,313
[ Snorts ]
Hmm? Hmm?

425
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:41,880
- Hey, Rock.
- Huh?

426
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,359
Whatever made you
stay in the army?

427
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,825
You woke me up
just to ask me that?

428
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,098
Well, I've been meaning to ask you,
but I just never got the chance.

429
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:59,438
Get some shut-eye before those
people start hitting us again.

430
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:07,316
- You want to gab, huh?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:12,048
That's something I been trying
figure out myself for a long, long time.

432
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:15,888
What makes a guy
stay in the army?

433
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:19,156
I wish I knew the answer.

434
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:22,096
Some of us 'cause
we're dumb, I guess.

435
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:24,599
Some are poor.

436
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:27,501
Some are a little lazy.

437
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,838
Some of us got some vanity.
Know what I mean?

438
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,968
Yeah.

439
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:40,375
Some of us old pros stay in even when we
know that after the fighting's over...

440
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,250
some of us will rest in peace
and rot in hospitals.

441
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:48,348
Even when we know all that,
we stay in 'cause-

442
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:52,418
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

443
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,624
Maybe it's something
that just happens to you.

444

I wish I knew the answer.

447
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:09,639
- I don't want to be a corporal. I want to get busted.
- You what?

448
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,442
I always wanted to lead.

449
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,816
When I was in officers' school,
I was head of the class.

450
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,653
They said I had the makings of a leader-
the education, the brains...

451
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:23,818
the knack of solving
tactical situations.

452
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:27,261
And one day, we had a problem with
live shells. We had to knock out a tank.

453
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,061
There was a red flag there warning
not to send any men in that area.

454
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:33,534
I was in command
of the platoon.

455
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:37,433
I don't know
what happened, Rock.

456
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:40,772
The minute that stuff started flying through
the air and I had to deploy my squad...

457
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:44,143
something happened
right in the pit of my gut.

458
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:47,980
I got panicky and I sent a squad
to the danger zone.

459
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,246
Four men were hit,
one seriously.

460
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,153
I was there when
they amputated his leg.

461
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:58,286
They gave me another chance. Again I got
into a sweat the minute I had to give orders.

462
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:02,195
Then they found out
what I'd known all the time.

463
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:04,790
I can take an order.

464
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:07,769
I can't give one.

465
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,639
Hmm. Some men are afraid of high places,
some are afraid of water...

466
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:17,703
and some are afraid to be responsible
for the deaths of a lot of other guys.

467
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:20,807
That's me, Rock.

468
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,875
I don't want to
carry that load.

469
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:27,481
Yeah. Well, a lot of guys
sweat out leading an outfit.

470
00:40:27,557 --> 00:40:31,391
I mean, nobody goes out
looking for responsibility.

471
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:34,191
Sometimes you find it whether
you're looking for it or not.

472
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:38,064
But I'm not looking for it.
It takes brains to be a leader.

473
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,535
I'm just smart enough
not to want any part ofit.

Even a two-striper like you,
you'll find out.

to be a corporal.

- Hey, Griff.
- [ Griff.] There's nobody out there, Rock.

Hey, I think I spotted
a movement out there...

01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:28,634
about 200 yards to the left
of that little hill.

01:08:28,702 --> 01:08:31,296
It looks like a Chinese hat.
Do you see it?

01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,599
[Rock] Hey, stay away from back there.
There's a deep drop there.

766
01:10:52,613 --> 01:10:54,672
I've been hit.

- Start cuttin'.
- I can't cut it myself.

Sure you can.
Here's your chance to be a real medic.

769
01:11:11,298 --> 01:11:13,562
At least they can't
hit us in here.

770
01:11:13,634 --> 01:11:17,570
You know what I think? I think they're
trying to knock off that top ledge.

771
01:11:17,638 --> 01:11:19,868
And then they'll drop one
on the lower ledge...

772
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,067
and hope that the fragments
get us inside.

That's what I think.

What's the idea? You crazy?
You want to blow your top?

Well, go out there
and blow it.

- Telepathy?
- Telepathy.

778
01:11:39,093 --> 01:11:43,223
It means if you think something hard enough,
the thought waves go through the air.

779
01:11:43,297 --> 01:11:47,495
Sometimes they go this way.
Sometimes they go this way.

Sometimes they go
straight up.

781
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:51,996
If you think hard enough,
the thought wave...

782
01:11:52,072 --> 01:11:54,267
is gonna hit them up there,
and they'll do it.

783

- Hmm? Oh.

Look at the size of that!

I could handle a wound.

No, what would you do
if you was a Commie?

805
01:14:58,492 --> 01:15:01,484
I'd plant myself right in the middle
of that hill out there.

01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:07,991
Then all I'd do is fire one bullet
smack into this cave.

Just one bullet. I know

Move the casualties down first.
Come on. Everybody's in the act!

Go out there,

[Rock's Voice ] When you hear a tank,
that's the main event.

902
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:51,219
That means they're wise to us.
A tank means they'll hit us...

with more tanks
and a lot of people.

Uh-oh.

905
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:21,423
They're sending a guy out
in front of the tank.

906
01:23:21,493 --> 01:23:24,621
You know what that means. It means
they're gonna blow up the minefield...

knock out our roadblock,
then that joker's...

01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:30,631
gonna come out here to see if we got an
antitank gun planted around the bend.

909
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:45,250
If we can knock out
that tank right here-

Yeah!

If we could suck that guy out here
where he don't smell us...

we could knock out
that tank right here.

Right on this spot.
We gotta do it.

Jonesy, be sure you
camouflage that 75.

And hide the bazooka. Hide it good, huh?
And Jonesy. Come here.

before you let her have it, ya hear?

Hey, I thought you'd never fire.
