< The Tiger And The Snow >

2
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,828
Dear Attilio,
we are all gathered here together...

3
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:47,227
Who's the half-wit who left his car outside?

4
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,637
- That's mine.
- Well you can't leave it there

5
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,830
- Ten Minutes!
- Too long.

6
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,573
- Five!
- No more than five.

7
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,079
ln five minutes l'm going to clamp you!

8
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,150
Gang of loonies, here every bloody night...

9
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,378
This woman has something to say to you.

10
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:17,153
Attilio De Giovanni,

11
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:21,993
l sing your name,
it opens the gates of Paradise.

12
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,360
You will be mine forever,
so grant me gods.

13
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,902
When you kiss me, the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse gallop forth

14
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,635
and when l think of your body,
so troubled and vague,

15
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,813
the ground opens beneath my feet.

16
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,209
Your divine manhood ascends to heaven,

17
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,446
you're beautiful!

18
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,448
You sunflower crazed by light,

19
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,148
when you raise your eyes you
set the sky ablaze.

20
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,619
Friends, see how the Earth,

21
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,493
like a mother,
gives suck to her most precious child.

22
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,365
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passion,

23
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,702
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth burst forth this cry.

24
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,172
l love you.

25
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,610
l want to make love to you now.

26
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,746
That's the best line
l ever heard in my life.

27
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,216
Still not here?

28
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,788
No.

29
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,060
Here he is!

30
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,392
- On the dot!
- You're 20 minutes late, Daddy!

31
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:05,799
- Yes, 20 minutes on the dot.
- You couldn't find the car?

32
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,099
- Hi Carla, everything okay?
- Fine, thanks.

33
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,370
l have a programme and tomorrow
l'll have them at school at 9:00 sharp.

34
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,013
- At 8:30!
- l know.

35
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,150
- l'll remind him.
- l'll remember all right!

36
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,717
Mamma doesn't trust you.

37
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,852
She doesn't trust me?

38
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,317
She doesn't trust you.

39
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,290
- Where are we going?
- A surprise!

40
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,467
- Sure l'm not hurting him?
- Course you are not.

41
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,501
Shall l wash his feet too?

42
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,606
l honestly couldn't care less.

43
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,402
Still the same guy, what's-his-name?

44
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,478
Yes, Francesco Verri,
he's not even in my class.

45
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:52,444
- The less l see him the better.
- ls he really that bad?

46
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,084
Very bad, hateful

47
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,356
- Hateful?
- Hateful.

48
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,424
- ln other words, you love him.
- Yes.

49
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,228
- A lot?
- Lots and lots.

50
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,023
- Emilia, Daddy!
- Rosa!

51
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,222
Hang on!

52
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,427
- The best camel driver ever.
- What a fantastic present!

53
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:16,335
Thank the director here, thanks Camillo.

54
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,874
Now we're in Rome l hope
we'll see you more often.

55
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,841
- Want to have a go?
- Me?

56
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,278
- You're scared.
- Daddy's not scared of anything.

57
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,186
He's all right?

58
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,117
- Does he spit?
- No.

59
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,687
This is great,
how do you get him to stand up?

60
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,897
lt's twice as high as a horse!

61
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,436
No seat belt!

62
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,095
How about that then, eh?

63
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,871
Just when l'm on a camel!

64
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,469
Attorney!

65
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,475
You've got the hearing this morning.

66
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,376
For the furniture you shouldn't have sold,

67
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,551
ignoring a summons back in '98...

68
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,722
l can't right now, can we do it tomorrow?

69
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,360
You've got to be here within three minutes
or they'll sentence you!

70
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:12,292
Three minutes, make that two!

71
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,498
Down, boy.

72
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,361
Slowly.

73
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,005
Ubruk!

74
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,665
How about that?

75
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,145
Camels may be smelly, but they're smart.

76
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,396
- What's that?
- A bat!

77
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,365
Get down, keep down!

78
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,130
lt's casing the joint,
let's see what it's up to!

79
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,536
Let's get under the bed.

80
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,837
Go away, beastly bat!

81
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,311
Don't say that.

82
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,719
You'll offend it if you call it a beastly bar,
you've got to be nice.

83
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,324
Oh bat, sweet creature of the night,

84
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,355
you'll find the window on your right!

85
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,297
''What luck!''

86
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,597
That's what poetry's all about,
you called it a beastly bat...

87
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,132
lt always works.

88
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,934
l was shaving in the bathroom yesterday.

89
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,473
A spider climbed in

90
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,305
and l said to it,
''Spider dear, get out of here''.

91
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,972
- lt went!
- And if you find a mouse?

92
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,381
''Mr. Mouse, leave this house''
then run for it.

93
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,255
Will you teach me to write nice poems?

94
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,058
How did you become a poet?

95
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,386
How do you start?

96
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:52,553
l was small, younger than you are now,
eight or nine.

97
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,961
l was with my mother,
l loved her so much...

98
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,469
We were at Uncle Giustino's
and there was a wood.

99
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,905
- Do you know what happened?
- What?

100
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:12,917
A little bird flew by,
singing, flying lower...

101
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,686
and lower.

102
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,749
He landed right here on my shoulder.

103
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,621
l swear!

104
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,161
He'd chosen me, of all people.

105
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,733
l was afraid he'd fly away,
so l pretended to be a tree,

106
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,664
l didn't move a muscle.

107
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:42,677
l started to feel my heart beating,
thumping actually.

108
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,115
- And then?
- lt flew away.

109
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,810
l wanted to tell my mother.

110
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:53,149
''Mamma, a little bird, flying and singing...

111
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,393
landed on my shoulder
and sat there for an hour.''

112
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,791
She said, ''l thought something awful happened''
and carried on chatting.

113
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,831
That was mean of Granny,
didn't she like birds?

114
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,529
No, Granny wasn't mean,
and she did like little birds.

115
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,571
lt wasn't her, it was me.

116
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,071
lt was my fault for not telling
the story properly,

117
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,473
for not making her feel what l'd felt.

118
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,151
l was so upset l told myself,

119
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,484
''There must be people whose job
it is to use the right words,

120
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,917
put things in a way...

121
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,654
who when their hearts beats,
can get other people's hearts to beat.''

122
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,424
That day l decided to become a poet.

123
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,866
- My heart beat.
- Mine too, but Granny's didn't.

124
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,367
lf the words aren't right, nothing's right.

125
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,870
lf l say now, ''go to sleep'',
those are the right words.

126
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,607
- And if another bat comes in?
- Off to bed with you.

127
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,251
l've got to get you to school
at 9:00 tomorrow.

128
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,851
At 8:30!

129
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,889
l know.

130
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,064
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passions,

131
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,066
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth bursts forth this cry,

132
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,529
l love you!

133
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:19,575
My love, l want to stay
with you here forever,

134
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,471
for all eternity.

135
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,448
Don't you have to take
the girls to school at 8:30?

136
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,577
Give me five minutes, be right back.

137
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,530
You don't remember
where l left the car, do you?

138
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,702
- Same bloody car parked outside...
- lt's mine, l'll move it.

139
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,894
Five minutes.

140
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,874
Come along, don't hang around,

141
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,634
take your time.

142
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,143
Don't start writing love poems,

143
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,508
they're the hardest,
wait till you're at least 80.

144
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:04,679
Write about something else, the sea,
the wind, a radiator,

145
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,951
a tram running late,
no one thing's more poetic than another.

146
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,020
Poetry isn't without, it's within.

147
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,598
Don't ask what's poetic or true,
look in the mirror, poetry's you.

148
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:20,127
Dress your poems up,
choose your words carefully,

149
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,639
be selective, some things you need
eight months to find one word.

150
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,972
Beauty started when people began to choose,

151
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,238
since Adam and Eve.

152
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:34,112
You know how long Eve took
to pick the right fig leaf?

153
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,022
How about this one? She stripped bare
all the fig trees in Paradise.

154
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:45,027
Fall in love,
if you don't love it's all dead!

155
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,165
Fall in love and
everything will come to life.

156
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,632
Squander yourjoy,
dissipate your cheerfulness.

157
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,863
be sad and silent with enthusiasm,

158
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,339
hurl your happiness into people's faces.

159
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,512
And how? Let me look at my notes,
l've forgotten.

160
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,715
That's what you should do.

161
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,811
l can't read 'em.

162
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,785
To convey happiness you must be happy,

163
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,155
to convey pain you must to happy.

164
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,929
Be happy, you must suffer!
Don't be scared of suffering,

165
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,727
the whole world suffers!

166
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,971
lf you don't have the means, don't worry,

167
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,405
only one thing is necessary
to write poetry, everything.

168
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,774
Don't try to be modern,
it's the most old-fashioned thing there is.

169
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,642
lf a line doesn't come to
you in this position,

170
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,287
chuck yourself on the ground like this!

171
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,951
lt's lying down that you see the sky.

172
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,821
Why didn't l do that before?

173
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,223
What are you looking at?
Poets don't look, they see.

174
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,333
Make words obey you.

175
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:01,000
lf the world ''wall''
doesn't take any notice,

176
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,936
don't use it again for eight years,
that'll teach it.

177
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,974
What's that? No idea!

178
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,673
That's true beauty, like those lines there,

179
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,281
that l want left there forever.

180
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,384
Erase it all, we've got to start,
the lesson's over.

181
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,851
See you Wednesday... Thursday.

182
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,655
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.

183
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,197
The room's all yours, Professor Browning.

184
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,928
Thank you Signor De Giovanni.

185
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,907
Please don't, l'll do it.

186
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,105
Still having problems with the principal?

187
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:47,479
Lots, about the course,
l'd like to discuss it with you.

188
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,814
Can we sleep together tonight?

189
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,055
Nancy!

190
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,061
Last time we slept together it snowed,

191
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,427
it was the coldest
most beautiful day in January.

192
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,043
- Lets sleep together.
- The kids'll be back.

193
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,372
lt's laying down that you see the sky.

194
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,549
Don't you like me anymore?

195
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,787
l had such a wonderful time with you,

196
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,827
why did you want to cut it so short?

197
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,089
When l fell in love with you...

198
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,067
l fell in love with you
because you fell in love with me.

199
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,035
And a wonderful fall it was.

200
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,968
What are you doing this evening?

201
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,668
- Nothing.
- Let's sleep together tonight.

202
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,314
Attilio, we've gotta go.

203
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,543
Hi Ermanno.

204
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,084
Do you remember where l left the car?

205
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,457
- Near the entrance.
- Thank you, Nancy.

206
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,127
Knock-knock, l look through the peep-hole,
all l see is hair.

207
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:12,930
l open the door and a bear says,
''Hello Ermanno, give me a Kiss.''

208
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,200
l ask, ''Who are you?''

209
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,535
and she, ''Don't you recognize me, my son?''

210
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,534
No!

211
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,842
And she starts crying.

212
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:27,417
l say, ''l'm sorry, Mamma'',
and put my arms around her,

213
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,553
then this morning
when l woke up l felt so happy.

214
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,715
- Your mother was a bear?
- l'd just never realized it before.

215
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,454
l kept dreaming about vultures,
hyenas, crocodiles...

216
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,764
Good for you.

217
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,230
l always have the same dream.

218
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,062
The same animal?

219
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,861
No, no animal at all.

220
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,336
l'm at a kind of wedding
with lots of people,

221
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,841
and then in she walks,
the woman l'm crazy about.

222
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,174
She ends up telling me,
''l want to make love with you, kiss me.''

223
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,180
So what do you do?

224
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,714
l pass out.

225
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,851
- lt's wonderful.
- What kind of animal is she?

226
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,354
lt's her, the love of my life.

227
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,585
What kind of a dream is that?

228
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:16,333
lt's like saying l like cherries
and in my dream l eat cherries.

229
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,499
lt denotes a primitive subconscious.

230
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,066
- A Dream that won't come true?
- Come true!

231
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,143
lf l like a woman,
l dream about her in a symbolic fashion,

232
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,009
she's a penguin bearing
the mythological baggage of penguins,

233
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:35,050
or she's a iguana, that's a mature dream.

234
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,984
- You think?
- What, me? Sigmund Freud thinks so.

235
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,052
Freud.

236
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,317
Dream about an animal?

237
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,036
Right on time, just starting.

238
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,305
Love thou thy dream,
all base love scorning.

239
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,345
Love thou the wind, and here take warning.

240
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:10,580
That dreams alone can truly be.
For this dream l come to thee.

241
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,856
He's the greatest living Arab poet.
Beautiful that poem, eh?

242
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,155
- Rips you apart.
- Sure does.

243
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,559
You'll hear the rest.

244
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,804
Fuad concluded with a homage to one
of his inspirational mentors.

245
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,806
Fuad, in these difficult days
for his home country,

246
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,307
decided to leave France
and go back to Baghdad.

247
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:38,748
Let's hope this senseless war
never breaks out.

248
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,713
Let's thank Fuad, goodbye to all.

249
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,657
Damn, l think it's over!

250
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,357
- Shall we go eat?
- l want to go and say hello to him.

251
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,052
Fuad, remember that name.

252
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:56,394
ln four, five years' time,
he'll get the Nobel Prize.

253
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,129
lt'll be a wrench to leave
Paris after 18 years...

254
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,070
- When will you go back to Baghdad?
- As soon as possible.

255
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,110
How much time do you need
to finish the book?

256
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,271
The publishers want it in September,
but l refuse to rush.

257
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,713
l'd like to spend at least
a week with you.

258
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,011
We'll find the time.

259
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,417
Goodbye, see you soon.

260
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,987
Attilio!

261
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,028
- Fuad!
- Where were you?

262
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:29,162
Back there, l got here a bit late
but l enjoyed the whole thing.

263
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:34,235
You've got fans here,
when l quoted you at the start

264
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,033
they all cheered, did you hear it?

265
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,637
Vittoria!

266
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,142
Your book.

267
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,910
Oh, thank you.

268
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,147
l'm losing my mind.

269
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,657
- Do you have time for dinner?
- Let's have dinner together.

270
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,830
Then l'll leave you to it.

271
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,457
Goodbye.

272
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,502
Dear Attilio, it's as
if no time has passed at all.

273
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:09,899
Attilio?

274
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,838
Fuad, thanks, l'll say goodbye then.

275
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,444
Goodbye, Fuad, goodbye.

276
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,979
- When are you leaving?
- Right after dinner.

277
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,174
Plenty of time!

278
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,354
Love you.

279
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,024
- What about dinner?
- Sure, any time.

280
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,121
- You coming to eat then?
- Sure, any time.

281
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,033
- l came here to have tea by myself.
- So did l.

282
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:17,197
We can have it together! Two teas.

283
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,875
Mr. Poet Attilio De Giovanni,
there's absolutely no question.

284
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,442
l don't want to disturb you, heaven forbid.

285
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,980
Since we don't see each other often...

286
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,918
You see,

287
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,322
the two of us, not immediately...

288
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,960
Why do you keep pestering me?

289
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,795
Haven't you got anything else
to think about?

290
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,536
Me think about you?
Whoever thinks about you?

291
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,711
Someone said they even saw you in Verona!

292
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,107
No, wait!

293
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,944
What's that? Me, in Verona?

294
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,244
- Who told you that?
- Settembrini.

295
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,647
He saw you outside my hotel for hours.

296
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,950
Listen, l was not in Verona.

297
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,425
Why on Earth should
l care if you're in Verona

298
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,894
or Piazza dell'Esquilino?

299
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,633
l don't believe it, you were there too?

300
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:21,465
l never know where you are
and l don't care.

301
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,038
Why don't you come to my place?

302
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,551
To see where l live,

303
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,285
sleep, read, write, wash the dishes.

304
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:42,586
Come on, let's walk round Rome,
you can come over and...

305
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,019
We can be together.

306
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,032
Yes? Huh?

307
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:52,067
You tell me who's speaking, you called me.

308
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,538
Valeri who?

309
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,174
Yes, l was at Fuad's, why?

310
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,502
ln fact, this jacket isn't mine.

311
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,805
This phone isn't either!

312
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:09,214
This jacket is five times too big,
yours must be too small.

313
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,978
Pay more attention!

314
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:14,556
He took my jacket instead of his.

315
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,720
l can't, l'm in a meeting.

316
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,465
Yes, okay.

317
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:28,934
l'm in the bar round the corner,
but right away, l'm busy.

318
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,799
Signor Valeri, over here,

319
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,628
how did you mistake my jacket for yours?

320
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,434
- lt's three sizes larger!
- Yes in fact, l didn't...

321
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:10,206
Signor Valeri mistook my jacket for his.

322
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,283
- Didn't you realize it was tight?
- l didn't put it on.

323
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,115
Now l know why you didn't realize it.

324
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,382
All's well that ends well, goodbye.

325
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,653
Some people are so scatter-brained.

326
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,056
He hardly knew what to say,

327
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,497
at one point he said, l love you,

328
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,931
l dream of you every night,
let's get married.

329
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,705
What would you have said?

330
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,504
- The check, please.
- No, let me.

331
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,577
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

332
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,044
Vittoria!

333
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,251
How much is it?

334
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,752
Keep the change.

335
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,456
The tea had absolutely no taste.

336
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,103
l want to see where you wash your dishes,

337
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,703
take me home.

338
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,131
''SURPRlSE!''

339
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,687
- Let's walk up, l prefer it.
- Me too.

340
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,531
''l've walked down millions of
stairs holding your arm,

341
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,966
now you're no longer here,
there's a void beneath every step.''

342
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:25,037
- Dammit, l tripped...
- Serves you right.

343
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,110
We're here, this is me.

344
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:33,316
l trip on that wretched step every day.

345
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,249
Go ahead.

346
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,991
Please do come in, Vittoria.

347
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:51,794
Here we are,
Vittoria and l together at home...

348
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,806
l always leave the candles on.

349
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,303
And the television.

350
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,815
l always like to have things ready
in case Vittoria comes...

351
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,149
l'll go make some coffee,

352
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,453
l'll make you some too,
it won't take a sec...

353
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,223
What's the matter?

354
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,630
Nothing, l just burnt myself slightly.

355
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:29,432
- The coffee is ready?
- l make it in case Vittoria comes.

356
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,934
Have a seat.

357
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,110
lt was coming to the boil as we came in.

358
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,201
Here.

359
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,847
l always like to tell the truth.

360
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,014
seeing you sitting here
at night alone with me,

361
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:45,018
drinking coffee, it makes my heart race.

362
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,824
You're so beautiful!

363
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:53,253
Women are so beautiful
when they're about to make love.

364
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,658
Why not live together
for the rest of our lives? lt's easy.

365
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,671
As easy as seeing a tiger in the snow.

366
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,272
When l do, we will be together forever.

367
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,077
Off to Tibet with us then,
it always snows on tigers there.

368
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,777
But we live in Rome.

369
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,916
Snow falling on a tiger in Rome!

370
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,041
l get it.

371
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,622
Please stay and sleep with me.

372
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,123
You've got a man here who loves you.

373
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,197
A man who loves you is
a sight worth seeing, isn't it?

374
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,597
lt's a cold, grey world outside, stay here.

375
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,398
We can have a nice hot bath together.

376
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:40,576
l'll dry you,
l'll wrap you in a blue bathrobe.

377
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,978
You know what you are, Blondie!
You're on big son of a bitch!

378
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,447
All this, every evening for me,

379
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:59,024
you've forgotten one thing though,
the champagne.

380
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,567
Explain the rest later,
but l want to know how you did that.

381
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:10,036
You know, tricks of the trade.

382
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,141
But just as l said ''champagne''.

383
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,776
A bit of luck.

384
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,940
Here, Vittoria.

385
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,443
l want to do with you
what the spring does with cherries.

386
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,680
Now, now, now.

387
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,154
You haven't said anything about the house.

388
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,523
l'd move this table,
l'll finish my champagne then go...

389
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:37,030
and your books, don't try and stop me,
shouldn't be on the floor,

390
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,702
it's a bit too bohemian.

391
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:42,930
There's a time for everything,
peach trees don't bloom in December.

392
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,209
This green wall's hideous.

393
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,978
l long to feel your arms around me.

394
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,704
This floor...but l can't...

395
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,473
is office-like.

396
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,853
l'm not sure if l should stay or go.

397
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:59,217
What'll l do? You decide.

398
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,558
My compliments on your apartment.

399
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:10,060
l think l know what you're getting
at about the apartment,

400
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,698
l think this is the best solution.

401
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,873
As far as the floor's concerned,
let's leave it as it is.

402
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,302
About the table,
l agree with you, l'd move it,

403
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:25,278
and make more space,
l'd put two armchairs there.

404
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:30,614
For the fittings, l know
a carpenter downstairs, so that's sorted.

405
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:35,882
The floor we said leave as it,
the ceiling isn't great...

406
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,995
l wasn't really planning
on staying here long,

407
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:46,035
l'm only renting and
l can't remember when my lease ends.

408
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:51,131
All l know is
that tonight'll never come back.

409
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:55,977
There's just one word
on the great clock of time, now.

410
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,413
But you're right about one thing, my love.

411
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,918
That green wall has got to go.

412
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,060
Where are you going?

413
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,795
l'm going to put on the blue bathrobe.

414
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:23,337
lf only you knew what l have inside of me,

415
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:29,844
fleets of minesweepers dropping
death-charges into my chest,

416
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,016
torpedoing my thorax,

417
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,844
circumnavigating my heart.

418
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,480
Now l can tell you, l was Verona,

419
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,488
and in Piazza dell'Esquilino.

420
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,456
Two and a quarter hours!

421
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,930
l'm ashamed to say,

422
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:50,193
l was in Catania too, l never told you.

423
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:55,362
l dream of you every night,
always the same dream, always you.

424
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,669
l see you everywhere,
my whole life hears you.

425
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:04,114
ln all creation
l feel the beating of your heart.

426
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:08,146
You these books,
the bubbles in my champagne,

427
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:12,453
you're the flame of these candles,
these trees,

428
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,955
you're down the street...

429
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,362
Vittoria?

430
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,561
Vittoria!

431
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,267
l'll fix her, when l catch her!

432
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,267
Vittoria, l'll sue you!

433
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,500
l'll take you to court!

434
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:38,613
Vittoria! Vittoria!

435
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:39,907
Wait!

436
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,582
Vittoria!

437
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:50,055
Stop!

438
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,694
Vittoria!

439
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,557
Stop this tram!

440
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:58,600
Driver, stop!

441
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,239
Vittoria!

442
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,908
You know what you are?

443
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:10,110
You're one big daughter of a bitch!

444
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,952
lt's raining!

445
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:22,092
lt rains on the city,

446
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,827
like tears in my heart.

447
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,027
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passion,

448
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,036
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth bursts forth this cry.

449
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,468
''Kiss me!''

450
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,009
Please my love.

451
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,373
l said kiss me.

452
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,879
Attilio. Attilio!

453
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,180
lt's her, the symbolism is so obvious!

454
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,549
l know, l guessed it right away

455
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,191
but l'm not kissing a kangaroo,
it's revolting.

456
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,760
Revolting? Goodbye then,
you'll never see me again.

457
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,590
Oh!

458
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,866
Vittoria!

459
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,531
l wasn't talking to you.

460
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:06,494
Vittoria!

461
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,331
Stop!

462
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,171
What a coincidence!

463
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,674
Vittoria!

464
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,940
l was walking along thinking of
everything except you...

465
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,511
Vittoria!

466
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,252
What are you doing, leaving?

467
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,444
Okay, l get the message.

468
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,522
Since l know you're leaving,
l just came to tell you this.

469
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:33,095
lt's all over between us,
you'll never see me again.

470
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,959
Goodbye forever!

471
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,533
Sorry, l forgot to tell you something.

472
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,705
Oh Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!

473
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,851
Peace! Peace!

474
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:59,887
You tell him,
l can't in half an hour, Attorney.

475
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,891
Go to prison? But l'm in the right!

476
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:07,724
- This is an act of violence.
- War's an act of violence.

477
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,366
Hanging out the peace
banner never hurt anyone.

478
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,965
l can't in half an hour.

479
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:16,799
Professor!

480
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,168
Yes?

481
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:28,846
Mamma Mia, what a bang!
Almost killed me!

482
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,415
What the...

483
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,959
Stop hopping about like that.

484
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:41,393
Will you please stop hopping?

485
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,965
Vittoria, l will not get into your pouch,

486
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,627
l won't fit, be a good girl.

487
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:52,965
Don't kiss me,
l know it's you but stop it.

488
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:57,271
Behave, Vittoria.

489
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,507
Vittoria...

490
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:28,435
Yes, speaking.

491
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,312
Who is it?

492
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,077
Who?

493
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:37,616
Fuad, what a nice surprise!

494
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,387
l'm glad, how are you?

495
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,222
What's wrong?

496
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,328
Vittoria? Of course.

497
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,398
She's there with you, right?
She talked about me, eh?

498
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,130
What happened?

499
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,254
ls she dead?

500
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:15,084
l don't know,
l just came back from the hospital.

501
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,694
The doctor is afraid she won't make it
through the night.

502
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,726
She's alive but there's nothing to be done,

503
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,424
We've got no medicine or supplies here.

504
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,302
We'd nearly finished out work,

505
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:34,103
we were walking in Baghdad,
there was an explosion, a building fell.

506
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,207
What?

507
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:41,915
l don't know, when l opened my eyes
she was lying there unconscious.

508
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,485
What's the hospital called?

509
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:50,659
l'll be there right away, see you soon.

510
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,419
See you soon in Baghdad.

511
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,031
l'll call you as soon as l arrive.

512
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:15,051
Carla, it's me, l know, sorry but...

513
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,843
Everything's fine, don't worry.

514
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,488
They're both fine, they're asleep.

515
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,157
l've got to go away right now.

516
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,953
l'm not sure when, please don't start.

517
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,527
l've got to go, l don't know when.

518
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:31,725
Come early tomorrow morning,
l'll leave the keys out,

519
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,769
you look after Rosa and Emilia.

520
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,015
- Good morning.
- Yes?

521
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,722
l'd like a ticket to Baghdad,
first available flight.

522
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,821
What?

523
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:01,993
l said l'd like a ticket to Baghdad,
first available flight.

524
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,195
- Maybe l misheard.
- What's the problem?

525
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,701
Not again.

526
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,433
- l am at the airport, aren't l?
- Of course.

527
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,734
l'd like a ticket to Baghdad please.

528
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,203
Perhaps you haven't heard,
but there's a war in lraq.

529
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,814
There are no flights,
there's no longer an airport!

530
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,312
- l have to go to Baghdad.
- You can't!

531
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,512
There must be an airport near Baghdad!

532
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,419
Give me a ticket for
an airport near Baghdad

533
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:34,622
then l'll take a taxi, boat, or walk,
that's up to me.

534
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,665
- Give me the nearest airport
- Nearest to what?

535
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:38,630
''Baghdad!''

536
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,030
Where do you want to go?

537
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:45,971
No, just wanted to know...
no time to waste.

538
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:50,307
You're very kind, extremely kind, goodbye.

539
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,415
Everything okay?

540
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,185
A ticket for Baghdad!

541
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,187
Was he joking?

542
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:10,094
Hi Eleonora, what's for dinner?

543
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,898
They sent the certificate back,
you've got to call them.

544
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:18,404
- How are you? You look tired.
- The usual stuff...

545
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:22,940
Apart from this morning
some guy comes in all agitated

546
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,377
asking for a ticket to Baghdad!

547
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,245
lmagine, wanting to go to Baghdad
that game day!

548
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,579
A ticket for Baghdad? What was he like?

549
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,415
Quite ordinary looking.

550
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,883
Like that guy there.

551
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,826
That guy there unloading
the crates in lraq.

552
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,333
lt's the splitting image!

553
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,403
Eleonora!

554
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,271
That's him!

555
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,966
Will you help me drain the pasta?

556
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,410
How the hell did he manage that?

557
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:06,284
No, these stay here in Basra,
those are got Baghdad.

558
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,254
Where's Gauzzelli?

559
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,156
- What is it?
- We've got to leave for Baghdad.

560
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,730
- We haven't gotten the okay.
- Yes we have, from Mrs. Serao.

561
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,027
- Come on, let's go now.
- Start it up!

562
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,501
- Mrs. Serao!
- Finally found you.

563
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,608
You're a marvelous, wonderful person.

564
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:31,507
Sorry if l pressed you,
but l'm so happy to be here!

565
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,149
Thank you, Doctor,

566
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,517
Sorry if l seemed doubtful in Rome.

567
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:45,093
So many people want to help
but just end up wasting our time,

568
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,123
but we can't get enough of
surgeons like you.

569
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:51,426
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you, goodbye.

570
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,101
Let's go!

571
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:07,450
- Can't you go a bit faster?
- No.

572
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,445
- Shall l drive?
- Why don't you take a nap?

573
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,437
What's the problem?

574
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,670
Doctor Guazzelli, why've we stopped?

575
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,970
We just got the order to go back to Basra.

576
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,774
Back to Basra?

577
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,176
You crazy?

578
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:45,219
Stop, counter-orders!

579
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,413
- How far is it to Baghdad?
- About 100 kilometers.

580
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,527
Wait, stop.

581
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:55,492
l've got to get to Baghdad.

582
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,065
- But it's all desert.
- l've got to get to Baghdad.

583
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,931
Thanks, l'll tell Guazzelli, don't worry.

584
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,266
Go, go!

585
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,056
Fuad, it's Attilio.

586
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,627
l'm glad you called,
l've been trying to reach you all day.

587
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,299
l've found a way to get you
to lraq in a few days.

588
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,775
- l'm in Baghdad!
- What do you mean?

589
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:55,748
There are two huge hands
holding two scimitars.

590
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,487
- Where's the hospital?
- l don't believe it!

591
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,554
l'll take you, don't move.

592
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,101
Fuad!

593
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,367
You took your time!

594
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,878
- How are you?
- Fine. How'd you get to Baghdad?

595
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,482
By bus.

596
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,309
Where's the hospital? Let's go.

597
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,251
We're off.

598
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,348
Come along.

599
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,781
- Where is she?
- Over here.

600
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,459
- That's odd...
- What?

601
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,222
She was here last night.

602
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:21,335
- l'm afraid it's a bad sign.
- You're joking!

603
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:25,072
lt's a good sign, they've probably moved
her to a convalescent ward.

604
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:30,144
Let's ask, there must be a doctor,
a surgeon, a sister a brother...

605
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,713
l'll try and find someone, don't worry.

606
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,740
l'm quite happy.

607
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:39,149
lt's a very good sign,
l'm happy she's recovered,

608
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,423
l'll go look for her...

609
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:21,894
Vittoria?

610
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,026
Vittoria.

611
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,093
See who it is?

612
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,067
See who it is?

613
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,244
What a coincidence!

614
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,540
You in Baghdad, too!

615
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:48,324
With that blanket on your face you seemed...
but you're breathing!

616
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,458
You're looking great.

617
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,390
Really great.

618
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:57,593
They told me you weren't well,
l got a bit scared.

619
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,575
What was that?

620
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,414
Thought you said something.

621
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,518
You know...

622
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:23,022
Fuad's gone to talk to this doctor

623
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,021
who is just great.

624
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:31,299
The whole of Baghdad's talking about him.

625
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,398
l said, ''Who is he?''

626
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:39,268
The hospital's empty, he's cured everyone.

627
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:44,908
l've spoken to him,
l'll have you home in a couple of days,

628
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,171
l promise.

629
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,576
Found her.

630
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:54,280
Bed stuck away at an angle,
a blanket covering her face,

631
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,287
l thought she was dead.

632
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,325
The doctor doesn't speak ltalian,
l've spoken to him.

633
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,664
- The prospects aren't good.
- Why?

634
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,265
Great colour in her cheeks...

635
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,395
Look, Fuad's here, see?

636
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,103
She's all right.

637
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,969
She's better, she can leave now?

638
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,212
She's better?

639
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,346
What did he say?

640
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,245
There's no hope.

641
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:28,180
Are you nuts, in front of her?
She can hear every word.

642
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,723
So she's better, l knew it.

643
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,620
He said there's no hope,
but he didn't say she's dead.

644
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,662
- ls she dead or alive?
- She's alive but...

645
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,030
What does ''she's alive but'' mean?
She's alive!

646
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,398
Couldn't be better!

647
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,908
What needs to be done? Ask him.

648
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,747
- What did he say?
- Vittoria has a cerebral edema.

649
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,178
She's not reacting,

650
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,188
we've got no drugs to treat edemas,

651
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,625
this means

652
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,989
she'll die soon.

653
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:11,493
Unless we find the right medicine,

654
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:16,165
she takes it, the edema goes
and she'll be up and about.

655
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,469
How long do we have to find the medicine?

656
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:25,607
- There must be a pharmacy open!
- There are no medicines in Baghdad!

657
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,181
l got that, but...

658
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,480
Ask him how long she's got
without this medicine,

659
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:36,591
30, 34, 47 minutes,
get him to tell you something.

660
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,760
- What's he say?
- lt's all written here.

661
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,834
He wrote the name of the medicine?
How long have we got?

662
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,208
No more than four hours.

663
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,376
Four hours!

664
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,811
More than enough!

665
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,577
Give us time to have a coffee too!

666
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:08,188
Let's go get it, four hours...

667
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,554
Let me say goodbye to Victoria.

668
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:15,130
The doctor said you could come with us,

669
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,358
but l reckon more bed rest won't hurt you,

670
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,133
get your strength back.

671
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,931
Then l'll find you a better spot,

672
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,509
l saw a fancy spot under the stairs
where no one comes by.

673
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,769
Goodbye.

674
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,470
Okay, Fuad.

675
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,216
Here's one open.

676
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,484
Pharmacist! Anybody there?

677
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,725
Pharmacist!

678
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,758
Clients!

679
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,858
This one's closed too, now what?

680
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,893
Maybe there's one there.

681
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,593
Look!

682
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:59,205
How do you say in Arabic?
Bazaar, they've got everything.

683
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,843
Give me the prescription, thanks.

684
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,612
They'll have everything there.

685
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:10,185
Good morning, l'm ltalian.
Do you have this medicine?

686
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:15,552
l need that. l look around, maybe you have
the medicine and maybe you don't remember...

687
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:22,028
...in this confusion. l have a look.
Where is medicine?

688
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,396
Medicine?

689
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,092
Come along.

690
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,470
You don't have...

691
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:33,575
They've got Etruscan vases,
diving equipment,

692
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,608
motor-cycle helmets,

693
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,871
and they don't have any medicine!

694
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:42,245
- lt's no use, this medicine...
- What does it do?

695
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,486
- lt's an anti-edema.
- Let's get it made!

696
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,679
- Who by?
- Don't you know a pharmacist?

697
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,757
- A pharmacist?
- You're from Baghdad!

698
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,518
l know one!

699
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:55,792
Al-Giumeili, an old friend of my father's,

700
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,631
a formidable man.

701
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,272
- ls he home?
- Yes.

702
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:12,504
- l told you so, come on.
- She's gone to ask permission.

703
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,344
He's extremely old,
l wonder if he remembers me.

704
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,548
My father used to hold him up
as an example

705
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,655
of the most noble man he ever knew.

706
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:24,458
- Why, what did he do?
- He as a real poet.

707
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,821
He was young, fell in love
with a woman and married her.

708
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,765
A few years later while he was
fighting in some war,

709
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:35,597
he heard his wife and contracted smallpox
and had been disfigured.

710
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,406
So Al-Giumeili said, ''My eyes hurt''.

711
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,511
And then, ''l've gone blind''.

712
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:48,379
When his wife died, 12 years later,
he opens his eyes again.

713
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,613
So as not to upset his wife,

714
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,189
he pretended to be blind for 12 years?

715
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,321
Every person is a chasm,
it makes you dizzy to look down...

716
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,690
He never explained to anybody

717
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:10,729
l'll go and talk to him first then l'll call you.

718
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,155
For me?

719
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,159
lt's a present for me?

720
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:41,331
lt's a beautiful present.

721
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:44,505
Come.

722
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,938
- Bye.
- Bye.

723
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,379
Attilio.

724
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,817
Hello.

725
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:05,795
Thank you.

726
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:12,157
What did he say?
Can we make it in three hours?

727
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,937
l'm sorry,

728
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,273
he can't make the medicine we need,

729
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,169
he hasn't got any of the equipment,

730
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:25,811
he needs mannitol, cortisone,
and various other things.

731
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,513
lt's not possible.

732
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:33,184
Maybe l didn't make myself clear.

733
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,090
Mannitol, cortisone, what are they?

734
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:38,157
Can you tell him something else?

735
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,489
Tell him in Arabic, fifty years ago

736
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,394
there was no mannitol or cortisone.

737
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,402
When someone got a bump on the head,

738
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,403
people did say, ''He's got an edema,
he'll be dead soon''...

739
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:02,507
So what did he,
lraq's foremost scientist, do?

740
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:13,722
- We tried gastric treatment.
- What did they pump into the stomach?

741
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:17,726
Glycerine.

742
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,195
Glycerine.

743
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,429
l've heard of that, you see.

744
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,577
Where do we buy it?
Forget it, l know everything's closed...

745
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:34,273
Can we make some glycerine
and feed it into her stomach?

746
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,889
There's a way.

747
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,091
Really!

748
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,133
He's trying to remember.

749
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,204
What time is it? How long do we have?

750
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:19,521
Al-Giumeili my old friend,
find me this glycerine.

751
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:25,328
l know you can,
otherwise she's going to die.

752
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,524
lf she dies,

753
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,935
they can close
this whole show of a world...

754
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:37,340
They can cart if off, unscrew the stars,

755
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:42,608
roll up the sky and put it on a truck,

756
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:47,222
they can turn off this sunlight
l love so much,

757
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,182
you know why l love it so much?

758
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,054
Because l love her
when the sun shines on her.

759
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:58,161
They can take everything away,
these carpets, columns, houses,

760
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:03,268
sand, wind, frogs, ripe watermelons,

761
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:08,706
hail, seven in the evening,
May, June, July,

762
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:13,975
basil, bees, the sea, courgettes...

763
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,945
Courgettes, Al-Giumeili!

764
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,915
Get me this glycerine!

765
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,674
- What's he say?
- Butter, palm oil, olive oil.

766
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:55,152
The base is soda,
but ashes will do, fat and ashes.

767
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,191
lt might work, l've got it all,

768
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,885
we can do it in a couple of hours.

769
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,299
A thousand thanks, Al-Giumeili.

770
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,376
Thank you.

771
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,282
l reckon it's ready, come here!

772
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,289
- A little more ash.
- No, we've got quite enough.

773
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:34,895
- Doesn't need any more.
- Just another spoonful.

774
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,429
Thank you, Fuad, for everything.

775
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,601
l'll do this, go have a rest.

776
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,793
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little, in this chair.

777
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,873
Al-giumeili intimidated me a bit.
Was that his daughter?

778
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,236
She's the last wife of his son Ali.

779
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,639
He was murdered six months ago,

780
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,083
he was a real free spirit.

781
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,652
Saddam Hussein didn't like free spirits.

782
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,812
Poor Al-Giumeili.

783
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:06,056
Time has left me nothing

784
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,822
to sustain my eyes

785
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,727
and my heart.

786
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,559
Come on, Fuad,

787
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:18,673
if this stuff works
we'll have dinner and celebrate.

788
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,788
Good, eh?

789
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:39,394
lt's home made, hand-made by me and Fuad,

790
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:42,462
no preservatives, colorings, chemicals,

791
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:47,034
just like home-made tagliatelle,
''butter please, oil please,

792
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,534
chop some onions, put in garlic'',

793
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:54,870
really delicious,
Fuad and l both had second helpings.

794
01:01:55,078 --> 01:02:00,038
Fuad wanted a third but l said,
''No, leave some for Vittoria!''

795
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:04,375
You're looking well, l tidied you up...

796
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,282
Really well.

797
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,893
l was forgetting, look what l've got!

798
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,295
Hang on, close your eyes.

799
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,031
Close 'em!

800
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,269
Open your eyes.

801
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:22,799
Open!

802
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:28,437
l'll hang it here, okay?

803
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,777
How's that? l banged my head!

804
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,283
l'll be getting an edema next!
lt's full of flies here!

805
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,215
You like it? Look.

806
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:45,618
Take a quick look,
tell me whether it's okay or not.

807
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,822
One second...

808
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:14,850
Did you move?
l thought before you were like that...

809
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,860
She looks worse than ever to me.

810
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,159
That brew didn't do much good.

811
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:33,932
l'll go have a word with the doctor,
a personal matter,

812
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,142
be right back.

813
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,746
Doctor?

814
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:45,754
Doctor, excuse me, doctor.
Excuse me, but ahh...

815
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:50,123
...she seems worse.
The glycerine didn't help.

816
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:51,326
- Didn't help at all?
- No.

817
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:55,486
Without it she'd be dead already.
lt's a miracle she's still alive.

818
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:59,634
Now we must wait and hope
that the medicines arrive soon.

819
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:05,899
Doctor, if l can lend a hand,
if you need anything l...

820
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,736
Thank you, l will get to her
as soon as possible.

821
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,139
Yes...

822
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,751
Hey, what are you doing?

823
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,083
Doctor! Who the hell is he?

824
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,321
Where do you think you're going?

825
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:31,596
Who are you?

826
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,960
What have you done to her?

827
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:40,105
Doctor, he was leaning over Vittoria
like this. What did he want?

828
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:42,442
This, l suspect.

829
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:46,206
Vittoria's chain.

830
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:49,551
You have thieves in the hospital?

831
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:55,953
l think it's better if you keep that.
lt's a nightmare...

832
01:04:56,158 --> 01:05:00,788
...looters everywhere. The Americans
promised us some security people...

833
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,496
...let's hope they get here soon.

834
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:05,929
Doctor, how is she, she looks very pale.

835
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,966
Do you think she can breathe all right?

836
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,434
She could probably do with some oxygen.

837
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,938
Goodbye for now.

838
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,176
Thank you, excuse me Doctor.

839
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,643
You breathing?

840
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,473
Breathe, Vittoria.

841
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:28,650
The only ones breathing are the flies.

842
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:32,122
Damnit, where do they get so much oxygen?

843
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:37,161
lt's a nightmare.
l'll go find you some oxygen right away.

844
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,832
Hang on.

845
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:45,038
Poor doctor, hasn't even got any band-aids.

846
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:49,071
Hi, it's Attilio.

847
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:53,479
By any chance to you
have an oxygen tank at home?

848
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,682
Yes, oxygen tank.

849
01:05:55,885 --> 01:06:00,083
You might have forgotten you had one...

850
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:07,658
You don't know anyone
who might have some oxygen?

851
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:11,727
Got it!

852
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:14,960
Don't worry, don't need it any longer.

853
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,763
Thanks bye.

854
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:21,775
l'll get you some oxygen, l know where.

855
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,410
l'll go fetch it.

856
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,448
Goodbye Vittoria.

857
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:47,565
Mamma Mia!

858
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,139
lt's total hell!

859
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,451
Look out!

860
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,318
lt was here, who pinched it?

861
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,158
Excuse me, did you see where...

862
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,795
Where've they put it?

863
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,634
Have you seen

864
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,261
A wet-suit with a mask?

865
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,573
Stop!

866
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,512
Hey Mr. Arab, stop!

867
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,405
l said stop!

868
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:37,813
Mr. Arab, whatever your names is, stop!

869
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,778
You crazy?

870
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,854
Stop!

871
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:46,017
Friend. ltalian. l am ltalian.

872
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:55,233
l need the oxygeno.
Oxygen tank, for me. Oxygen.

873
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:58,464
l need. l pay. l pay. l pay.

874
01:07:58,674 --> 01:07:59,698
Dollar?

875
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,900
Like Dollar. Euro...Do you know?

876
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,080
ltaly, France, Germany,
Luxembourg...l pay...

877
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:12,186
More? How much does he want?

878
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,251
He's left me the whole cart!

879
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,250
The tank!

880
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,030
lt's stuck.

881
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:29,334
l'd better go, if anyone comes

882
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,597
tell him l paid for all this lot!

883
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,899
l paid for it!

884
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,339
Hang on, there's more, there's this too.

885
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,347
A dog, where shall l put it?

886
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:47,620
Next to you?

887
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:52,153
Here, that way he can keep an eye on you.

888
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:53,383
Looks good here.

889
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:58,465
l spent a fortune but it was worth it,

890
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,761
above all because
l found something absolutely fantastic.

891
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,834
Really close your eyes.

892
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:08,900
A fly whisk! l've found the weapon
of mass destruction.

893
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:10,544
l found it!

894
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:15,611
l'm going to have myself a massacre,
you're dead!

895
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,483
Breathing okay?

896
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:25,455
What's the weather like up
in the mountains?

897
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,788
ls it snowing?

898
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:34,599
lf only you know
how pretty you are in blue.

899
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,904
l've put some tape here, hope it works,

900
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:44,310
Do you like music? l'll show you.

901
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,710
l've found an old record player,
it's all Arab music,

902
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,145
but they're nice, l bet.

903
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,013
Can't figure out a thing here...

904
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,418
Look who's here in Baghdad.

905
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:59,653
Look who l've found, close your ears,

906
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,127
this is incredible, just listen.

907
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:27,020
As soon as you're better
we'll go to Granada together and dance.

908
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,852
how are you muchacha, breathing okay?

909
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,961
The light's gone again.

910
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:45,770
Fuad, yes, hello.

911
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,766
Fuad, is that you?

912
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,775
lt's you Attorney, l can't hear you well.

913
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,443
Be in my office at 8:00 tomorrow,

914
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:58,484
you've got to sign the charge sheet,
or off tojail with you!

915
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,980
No messing around.

916
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,590
Attilio! Attilio!

917
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,726
Hello? Hello?

918
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,926
Thank goodness.

919
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,802
Doctor, good evening. Doctor, excuse me,

920
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,376
l have done everything you said, but...

921
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:27,071
...she doesn't answer. She doesn't move,
she doesn't react in anyway.

922
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,315
She's like ahh...dead.

923
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:31,611
l don't know what else...

924
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:35,881
But ahh, how can l tell
if she's getting better, recovering.

925
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:41,453
lf there's the slightest movement,
a finger, a hand, an eye.

926
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:44,656
You'll know she has made it,
any movement is from the mental.

927
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:48,834
What on earth? Claudio Villa!

928
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,202
What is that?

929
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:01,010
An old record l found,
the music might cheer her up.

930
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,882
ls the oxygen okay?

931
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:04,617
Yes, but it's finished.

932
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,511
Already?

933
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,086
Yeah. This can be removed.

934
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:10,781
You hear that? The oxygen's done you good.

935
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,488
How is she?

936
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:15,822
She is alive.

937
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:20,196
Alive? But Doctor. Doctor...

938
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:24,099
Without water, without food,
how can she go on.

939
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,733
lsn't there anything we can give her?

940
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,100
lf only l had...

941
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,368
Had what?

942
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,910
Some sort of nutritional drip
l could give her...

943
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:36,414
along with the cortisone
and the antibiotics...never mind.

944
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,186
But what can we...

945
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:39,820
lt will help a lot.

946
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,489
Goodbye for now.

947
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,223
Now he tells me one thing at a time!

948
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,559
The nutritional drip is crucial.

949
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,989
l'll find you something to eat,

950
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,193
don't worry, l'll get food for you.

951
01:12:55,971 --> 01:13:00,840
Right away, if l say l will, l will.

952
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,772
Nunzio, how are you?

953
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:08,210
lt's De Giovanni.
Doctor Guazzelli, l've missed you!

954
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:12,478
l'm in Baghdad, l'm all right.

955
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:13,810
And you?

956
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,991
Where are you? When'll you get here?

957
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:22,021
Yeah right! We need things now,
there are sick people here!

958
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:28,067
They won't let the Red Cross through
the road blocks? Knock'em down!

959
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,200
You know what, l'll come to you.

960
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,871
Goodbye, Nunzio. Goodbye.

961
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,544
l'll get you some food.

962
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:41,041
l'll get a couple of candles
so we can have dinner together.

963
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:45,647
l'm off, they're not far, 50 kilometers,

964
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,254
l'll borrow the doctor's bike,

965
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:51,392
if l go at 100,
l'll be there in half an hour.

966
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:52,821
Don't move,

967
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:57,931
actually do move...
a finger, a hand, an eye, whatever.

968
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:42,104
Might have know it, now l've hurt...

969
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:45,912
my foot.

970
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:59,089
Out of gas in lraq, it's too much!

971
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:03,222
On we go, then we'll see.

972
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:24,051
Hello! Hello! l am ltalian!

973
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,515
Anyone there?

974
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,413
Hello! Please!

975
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,385
l'm borrowing a camel.

976
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:35,120
l'll bring it right back.

977
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:44,130
You're much more beautiful than him,
my favorite camel.

978
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,564
Now be good, down.

979
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:51,212
Let me get on,
how do you say ''down'' in Arabic?

980
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:58,149
You've got to get down!

981
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:11,423
You're more beautiful than he is,
and he's deaf too!

982
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:13,191
Now let's go.

983
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:17,799
Hang on.

984
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:23,410
Slowly!

985
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:28,348
Now this is a real camel,
you're ugly and dead too!

986
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:31,481
That way!

987
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,582
Other way, camel!

988
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:38,123
This is the way back to Baghdad!

989
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,588
He's taking me back to the hospital.

990
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,365
Camel, can you hear me?

991
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,568
Go that way!

992
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,336
Down boy!

993
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:52,798
l can't jump off, l've hurt my foot.

994
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:58,569
Look where we are,
he must be used to going to Baghdad!

995
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,044
Stop!

996
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:14,021
Just my luck, the dumbest camel
in the whole of Arabia!

997
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:15,723
Goodbye.

998
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,467
What is it?

999
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,666
What do you want?

1000
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:26,904
Go away!

1001
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:31,304
Before you couldn't wait to get to Baghdad!

1002
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:32,946
Other way!

1003
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,748
Go away, camel.

1004
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:39,315
What on earth are you following me for now?

1005
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:44,121
Mamma Mia, you smell disgusting.

1006
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,627
How come you have such bad breath?

1007
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:52,562
- The ltalian Red Cross?
- Doctor!

1008
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:55,736
ls Nunzio around, Dr. Guazzelli?

1009
01:17:58,974 --> 01:17:59,998
That's the lot.

1010
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:05,305
Did you remember some decent anti-edema,
syringes and cortisone?

1011
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:09,712
Everything, don't know how you'll
manage this lot on your bike.

1012
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:14,355
What l can't squeeze in,
you can bring back with you.

1013
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:17,553
You put some gas for the bike?

1014
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,489
Did you recharge my cell phone?

1015
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:30,664
What do you think, Chemiotina or Talamagil?

1016
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:31,770
Chemiotina.

1017
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:37,468
l might as well take both,
except l've got no more room.

1018
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:45,381
- When will you get to Baghdad?
- They won't let us in.

1019
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:49,717
lt's a real nightmare in Baghdad,
they haven't even got band-aids.

1020
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,151
- Are they in here?
- Right there.

1021
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:56,053
Thanks a million.

1022
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,027
Could you give me a push?

1023
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:03,034
l'll tell you when.
One, two, three... push hard!

1024
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,666
Good luck!

1025
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,844

1030
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,469
Take cover! Take cover! Take cover!

1031
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:47,914
Hold your fire!

1032
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,549
Don't you move!

1033
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:53,151
Put your hands on your head!

1034
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:57,218
Hands on your head l said! Don't move!

1035
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,017
He's a fuckin' powderkeg!

1036
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,353
Don't shoot!

1037
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,928
Are you crazy! l'm ltalian!

1038
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:03,790
These are medical...

1039
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,899
Stop! Don't touch those!

1040
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:07,159
They're medical supplies!

1041
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,337
- Medical what?
- Medical supplies!

1042
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,871
Stay there or we'll shoot you!

1043
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,341
l don't move!

1044
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:17,338
Put your hands on your head!

1045
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:18,638
Okay!

1046
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,775
Tell him to stay calm.

1047
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,075
He is very nervous.

1048
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,515
''He's going to shoot me!
He's shaking!''

1049
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,712
Stay calm! Put that gun machine down!

1050
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,358
Stay calm! l am having heart attack!

1051
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,857
Shut up!

1052
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:38,463
Williams, Johnson, check him out!

1053
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,761
Careful, watch for the trigger, careful!

1054
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:47,132
You're...ow! You're...ow!

1055
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,071
- Tell him...
- He's clean sir.

1056
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:54,180
Aspirin. Got saline. He's clean.

1057
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,749
Okay. He's just some nut!
Some crazy ltalian!

1058
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,719
Who the fuck is he!

1059
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,483
Now you listen to me, Sir. Who are you?

1060
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:07,159

1061
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,727
Yeah, we got that.

1062
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,397
What do you do?

1063
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,926
- l am a teacher.
- Of what?

1064
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,031
Poetry.

1065
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:15,396
What poetry.

1066
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:18,767
- Poetry.
- Poetry.

1067
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:20,168
Poetry.

1068
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,334
He's a poet!

1069
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,239
What?

1070
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:25,344
What did you say?

1071
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,775
Poet!

1072
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,047
So you're a poet?

1073
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,348
Yes. Like ahh...

1074
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,579
Dante. Walt Whitman.

1075
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:36,955
Walt Whitman.

1076
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:42,887
Okay... get the fuck out of here!

1077
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,022
Pull the wire!

1078
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:51,171
Very sorry about that.

1079
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:54,874
Yes, thank you. Thank you...

1080
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,338
...excuse me.

1081
01:21:56,544 --> 01:22:00,002
Just a push. A last favor.

1082
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:02,206
Thank you, a push, yeah.

1083
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,180
One, two, three! Yes!

1084
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:09,847
Bye sir! Thank you!

1085
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:15,758
Bye! Bye-bye! Thank you!

1086
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:19,797
Go down!

1087
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:22,196
Damn thing's stuck,

1088
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,398
Just won't budge.

1089
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,042
Ahh Doctor this too.

1090
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:33,541
Thank you for this, and for all the rest.

1091
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:37,240
Even if it's just a drop in the ocean.
She's okay now.

1092
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:38,742
Thank you.

1093
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:39,978
l must be going.

1094
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:42,679
She's okay, Doctor,
but she still isn't moving.

1095
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,620
l mean, rather than do
one thing at a time,

1096
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,522
how about if you do everything at once.

1097
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:48,855
What can we do now?

1098
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:53,433
At this stage, there is nothing more
we can do. Just hope and pray to Allah.

1099
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:55,132
Ah, thank you.

1100
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,236
You hear that?

1101
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:03,807
He said we've done all we can.

1102
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,903
You're fine, it's all inside here.

1103
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:12,948
There's nothing more we need to do,
just relax.

1104
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:15,085
He told me to pray to Allah.

1105
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:23,390
lt's the only thing we can do,
pray to Allah.

1106
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,493
l would pray.

1107
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:30,534
We've done everything else...

1108
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:37,645
Allah, the only prayers
l know is the Lord's Prayer in ltalian,

1109
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:40,346
you understand ltalian?

1110
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:42,874
lt's a beautiful prayer.

1111
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:46,485
How about it?

1112
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,024
Allah, here goes.

1113
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,222
Our Father, who are in heaven,

1114
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,725
hallowed be thy name.

1115
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,992
Thy kingdom come, they will be done

1116
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:04,103
in Earth as it is in heaven.

1117
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:06,569
Give us this day our daily bread,

1118
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:08,968
and forgive us our trespasses

1119
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:10,871
as we forgive them
that trespass against us

1120
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,341
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

1121
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:13,707
Now we've really done all we can.

1122
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,059
Rest, l'm going to have
a little rest myself.

1123
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:31,965
Bye Vittoria.

1124
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:40,634
Anything you need, l'm at the barber's.

1125
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:48,974
That's just what l said to Vittoria

1126
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:52,119
when she asked
why l'd come back to Baghdad.

1127
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:57,315
l told her about the 351st Arabian Night,
remember it?

1128
01:24:57,692 --> 01:25:01,526
You know all 1001? How about 406th?

1129
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:06,291
406 is about the ltalian poet
with a funny sole.

1130
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,702
''The Arabian Nights'', wonderful!

1131
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,332
''Beautiful sky!''

1132
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,100
The Baghdad sky is
the pillow of the world.

1133
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:19,544
Looks like they're firing angels.

1134
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:25,119
80km from here, over 3,000 years ago,

1135
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:29,221
they built the Tower of Babel
so they could climb up to this sky.

1136
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:32,952
80km from here all
our languages were born.

1137
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:37,188
Since they tried to touch this sky,
we no longer understand each other.

1138
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:45,932
A Muslim legend says that now
and then Allah comes back to Earth

1139
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,234
because he misses the look of
the starry sky from below.

1140
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:52,411
Centuries of wisdom
and what have we learned? Nothing.

1141
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,671
You know why there are wars?

1142
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:59,616
Because the world started without men
and without men it'll finish.

1143
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:07,928
Come over and get a good night's
sleep in a proper bed.

1144
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:13,260
Thanks, but l've got
a comfortable barber's chair.

1145
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:15,229
l'll sleep like a log near Vittoria,
you never know.

1146
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:16,630
l do know.

1147
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:18,504
Goodbye.

1148
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:20,406
Goodnight, Fuad.

1149
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:22,667
Fuad?

1150
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:27,138
Come on, if we're good and behave well,
we'll get to heaven!

1151
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:29,842
There's nothing after this.

1152
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:32,179
Even less than nothing,
which would at least be something.

1153
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,947
Still, l'm glad l was born,

1154
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:39,718
l'm sure even when l'm dead
l'll remember when l was alive.

1155
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:41,759
Good night, Attilio.

1156
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:44,562
See you, Fuad.

1157
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,089
Fuad!

1158
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:29,328
Fuad!

1159
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,388
Oh Vittoria!

1160
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:06,524
Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!

1161
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:10,964
No, you can't take her away yet.
She can hardly stand.

1162
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:15,298
You'll have to give her a day or two.
Look it's almost a miracle,

1163
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,000
but in here they do happen sometimes.

1164
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:23,241
But, sorry...sorry to keep asking you doctor.
But she really is better?

1165
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:26,181
Yes, she's better. Come and see.

1166
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:27,945
But do you think she'll recognize me?

1167
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:28,952
Of course she will.

1168
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,385
- Yes.
- Yes.

1169
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:36,557
l bet she won't. Wait, Doctor...

1170
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:40,461
Maybe first, a pair of new shoes...

1171
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:45,298
...or some flowers, or maybe a shower,
l must stink like a camel.

1172
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:49,806
Fine, we'll try to get her walking.
There's still so much to do.

1173
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:52,445
Thank you Doctor.
Doctor, Doctor... Excuse me.

1174
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:57,512
Forgive me but ahh...
Have you even been kissed by a camel?

1175
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:04,923
l'll give her a surprise.

1176
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:15,568
A dark brown.

1177
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,332
They are used. But they are beautiful.

1178
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:27,470
Thank you. Beautiful, yes, thank you.
Okay, so how much is it?

1179
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:29,409
Only twenty dollar.

1180
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:43,591
l...l...l don't... Excuse me.

1181
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:44,924
Yes?

1182
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:52,130
May l try just two, three steps?

1183
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,808
Just to see how they fit me?

1184
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:57,739
- Yes.
- Sometimes they are large, they are tight.

1185
01:31:57,945 --> 01:31:59,276
Take your time. Take your time.

1186
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:04,713
To try, yeah? Two, three steps, yeah?

1187
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:06,112
They are wonderful.

1188
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,182
Yes.

1189
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:10,380
Wonderful. What a beautiful good man.

1190
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:12,422
- Couple of steps more.
- Please.

1191
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:14,695
lt's not bad.

1192
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:20,058
Sir! Sir!

1193
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:37,251
All for a pair of shoes that are too big!

1194
01:32:40,655 --> 01:32:42,350
Leave me alone!

1195
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:47,153
Stop, that's a minefield!

1196
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:52,331
You're scared!

1197
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:53,966
Wimps!

1198
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:05,301
Don't move!

1199
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:07,344
Careful where you tread!

1200
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:12,986
You want your wretched shoes!

1201
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,048
Boom! Boom!

1202
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,053
l'll give them back.

1203
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:20,294
Here, have 'em!

1204
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:31,004
The other one too? Want both?

1205
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,138
So long as you leave me in peace.

1206
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:55,086
There are mines!

1207
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:58,159
Now what'll l do?

1208
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:01,026
Mines!

1209
01:34:01,235 --> 01:34:05,103
Allah, do a friend a favor,

1210
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,307
l'll never ask for another.

1211
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:09,304
Help me.

1212
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:13,474
Maybe if l tread where l trod before...

1213
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:15,446
dead east,

1214
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,145
Let's go.

1215
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:21,220
There, just as l thought.

1216
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,851
That's my footprint...

1217
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:29,358
Would you believe it?
Stuck in the middle of a minefield!

1218
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:31,522
There and there.

1219
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:44,834
Oh Mamma Mia!

1220
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:50,475
Thanks for your help,
l'll do the same for you.

1221
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:52,851
Bye, thanks.

1222
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,661
Fuad, can l come in?

1223
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:04,258
Fuad?

1224
01:35:04,765 --> 01:35:07,256
lt's Attilio, can l come in?

1225
01:35:07,635 --> 01:35:11,571
l've got some great news,
the best in the world!

1226
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:13,767
What a wind!

1227
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:17,067
You're losing all your papers.

1228
01:35:18,512 --> 01:35:21,037
However much poetry do you write?

1229
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:25,711
lt's all falling down,
shall l close the door?

1230
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:36,329
Fuad...

1231
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:40,993
Fuad...

1232
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:44,971
What have you done?

1233
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:49,136
Fuad...

1234
01:35:49,443 --> 01:35:53,311
What have you done?

1235
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:56,441
Fuad...

1236
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:57,809
First squad! Flush against the houses!
Clear the rooms! Move!

1237
01:37:21,902 --> 01:37:27,602
l'm ltalian! l'm ltalian!

1238
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:30,770
l'm ltalian!

1239
01:37:32,112 --> 01:37:38,381
l am ltalian! l am ltalian!

1240
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:41,681
Shut up, will you!

1241
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:45,552
You've been shouting for days!

1242
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,687
Let me sleep!

1243
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:55,063
l am ltalian. l am ltalian.

1244
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:06,169
l am ltalian! l am ltalian!

1245
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:11,518
l am ltalian! l am ltalian!

1246
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,114
- You want a cigarette.
- No man.

1247
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:15,986
Hey Pete, you want a cigarette?

1248
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,350
No thanks.

1249
01:38:20,961 --> 01:38:22,724
l'm ltalian!

1250
01:38:23,797 --> 01:38:25,662
l'm ltalian!

1251
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:28,626
l am ltalian!

1252
01:38:29,937 --> 01:38:31,598
The poet.

1253
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:34,472
l am ltalian!

1254
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:52,919
Good morning, l'm ltalian.

1255
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:57,287
l've got no papers,
they gave me this at the Consulate.

1256
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,597
Attilio De Giovanni, that's me.

1257
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:08,033
Thank you.

1258
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:15,542
Come with me, nothing to worry about.

1259
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,281
Nothing?

1260
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:18,977
Just a check.

1261
01:39:29,396 --> 01:39:30,658
Attilio!

1262
01:39:30,864 --> 01:39:32,661
See who's here, your attorney!

1263
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,437
They actually put me in prison!

1264
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:40,129
Glad to help,
one night and l got you out, eh?

1265
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:43,408
See what your attorney does?

1266
01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:47,445
l'll drive you home.

1267
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:53,216
This damned pollen,
it won't let me sleep at night.

1268
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:57,116
But that's a zebra!

1269
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:58,985
Beautiful!

1270
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:02,920
What's a zebra doing here?
That looks like an ostrich.

1271
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:06,029
They've turned it into a zoo?

1272
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,198
Could be, there's a cop, ask him.

1273
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,730
Officer, what's with the zebra?

1274
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:17,673
There's even a monkey in my garden,
what's going on?

1275
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:21,369
There's a fire at the circus, back up!

1276
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:33,891
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1277
01:41:54,842 --> 01:41:57,777
- Open up!
- Rosa, let's go

1278
01:41:57,978 --> 01:42:00,640
l'm here!

1279
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:04,645
- The door's locked.
- Why'd you always lock it?

1280
01:42:04,852 --> 01:42:07,013
l can't swim without my goggles.

1281
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:10,281
- My red bathing cap?
- You always forget everything.

1282
01:42:16,029 --> 01:42:16,996
Papa!

1283
01:42:17,197 --> 01:42:20,166
What a coincidence! Where've you been?

1284
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:23,300
Rosa too?

1285
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:27,703
How pretty we are!

1286
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:31,167
- Where've you been?
- Me? Where have you been!

1287
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,913
Mamma's round the back!

1288
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:37,841
Mamma, Daddy's back!

1289
01:42:41,054 --> 01:42:44,922
- Did you know Daddy was coming?
- No.

1290
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,820
Are you happy?

1291
01:42:49,696 --> 01:42:51,960
l thought l'd give you a surprise.

1292
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:54,825
l'm glad you did.

1293
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:58,202
l've got a surprise for you, a great one.

1294
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:00,396
We're going to be late for swimming.

1295
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:02,472
Hang on!

1296
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:04,539
Come here.

1297
01:43:05,145 --> 01:43:07,136
Mamma's looking well, isn't she?

1298
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:10,614
Yes, but she was very sick,

1299
01:43:10,817 --> 01:43:12,478
she nearly died in Baghdad.

1300
01:43:13,086 --> 01:43:14,348
They don't know who saved her,

1301
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:17,183
some unknown ltalian doctor,

1302
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:18,983
a medical genius.

1303
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:31,194
First he disappears then back
he comes when it suits him.

1304
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:34,340
- Dreadful, isn't he?
- Yes, he is just dreadful.

1305
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:37,738
- You can't stand it any longer.
- Quite right.

1306
01:43:37,978 --> 01:43:40,310
- Can't live with someone like that.
- No.

1307
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:42,982
So, you're madly in love with him?

1308
01:43:43,784 --> 01:43:44,716
Yes.

1309
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:49,847
Open your eyes...two goldfinches.

1310
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:53,322
- What do they do?
- Sing and fly.

1311
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:55,461
Emilia and l got them in Perugia for you.

1312
01:43:56,597 --> 01:43:58,963
Beautiful, thanks.

1313
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:00,565
l'll go and get the car.

1314
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:03,127
- l wanted to...
- Stop it!

1315
01:44:04,037 --> 01:44:06,733
Goodbye Papa!

1316
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:09,599
Goodbye!

1317
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:12,404
l'll see lots of you later.

1318
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,479
Sorry, l'm a bit tired.

1319
01:44:19,152 --> 01:44:21,814
- Something to drink?
- No, thanks.

1320
01:44:32,366 --> 01:44:35,767
lt's lovely here, l haven't been here in a while.

1321
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:37,869
How are the lectures?

1322
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:39,329
Fine.

1323
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:45,275
Nancy took off, you know.

1324
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:50,041
She went back to England for good,
just quit and left.

1325
01:44:50,817 --> 01:44:51,647
l'm sorry.

1326
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:54,286
There hadn't been anything
for a long time.

1327
01:44:54,888 --> 01:44:58,221
- l must say, you...
- l was upset.

1328
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:01,186
- l'd rather not talk about it now.
- Nor me.

1329
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:08,926
The girls are beauties,
Emilia's just like you,

1330
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:12,594
tough, takes things hard.

1331
01:45:13,273 --> 01:45:15,207
l'd like to see more of them.

1332
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:18,070
So you should, you just disappeared.

1333
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:21,279
The girls asked about you, then l was away.

1334
01:45:21,648 --> 01:45:24,173
l haven't been very well,
l must take it easy.

1335
01:45:25,052 --> 01:45:28,852
lt's a long story,
but l'll tell you some other time.

1336
01:45:29,556 --> 01:45:33,287
l have very sad news through, Fuad's dead,

1337
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:34,790
he killed himself.

1338
01:45:35,629 --> 01:45:38,689
- Maybe you read it.
- Yes, l know.

1339
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:47,001
- How's the book going?
- l haven't finished it.

1340
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:54,144
Here...

1341
01:46:01,922 --> 01:46:03,082
You know,

1342
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:09,058
l still dream about us getting
married every night.

1343
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:12,957
Even if we don't that's fine.

1344
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:17,626
- What?
- Would you like another cushion?

1345
01:46:18,171 --> 01:46:19,570
No, thank you.

1346
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,940
l'll go, get some rest.

1347
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:37,481
l'll see you soon, tomorrow,
the day after, l'll come often.

1348
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:40,387
- Stay if you'd like.
- No, you look tired.

1349
01:46:40,594 --> 01:46:42,585
Goodbye, Vittoria.

1350
01:46:52,806 --> 01:46:54,797
Sorry, l took the wrong...

1351
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:00,741
My jacket...

1352
01:47:47,794 --> 01:47:49,022
The birds!

1353
01:48:14,888 --> 01:48:16,947
They sing and fly...

1354
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:23,422
Bye.

1355
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:58,756
You don't by any chance know
where l left the car, do you?
