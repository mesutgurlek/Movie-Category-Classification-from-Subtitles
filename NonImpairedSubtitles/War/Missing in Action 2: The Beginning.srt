1
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,460
- AC phase selector.
- AC.

2
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,627
Force trim.

3
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,829
On.

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,996
Battery switch.

5
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,164
On.

6
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,764
Fire detector light.

7
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:41,934
Test.

8
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,499
Caution warning lights.

9
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,512
Test and reset.

10
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,480
By the way, congratulations.

11
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,811
Have you thought of
a name for your kid?

12
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,248
Well, we're still fighting.

13
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,684
I'm holding out for
Joe DiMaggio Mazilli.

14
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,688
The greatest Yankee
that ever lived!

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,816
Hydraulic control switch.

16
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,689
On.

17
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,853
Lighting.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,020
In.

19
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,620
Heads up, guys.
Here comes Colonel Braddock.

20
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,962
So, why would the colonel
want to go to Cambodia?

21
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,490
Yeah, he could get hurt
going across the fence.

22
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,003
He's leading a recon unit,
checking enemy strength.

23
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,164
Clear?

24
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,332
Clear left, sir.

25
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,534
Let her rip.

26
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,504
Main generator switch.

27
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,671
On.

28
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,647
- Turn switch.
- Fair.

29
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,808
700 RPMs.

30
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,317
Decrease.

31
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,545
Good morning, sir.

32
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,213
Good morning, Sergeant.

33
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,313
Sorry I'm late.

34
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,880
Would you like to take
the controls, sir?

35
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,256
No, thanks, Captain.
I'm just along for the ride.

36
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,350
What are the coordinates
on LZ Sally?

37
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,551
Three-seven-four-zero-
three-zero-one-niner.

38
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,019
We're right on top of them.
Let's give them a holler.

39
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,623
Alligator four,
this is Red Gap six.

40
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,329
Alligator four, we're
taking fire from all quadrants.

41
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,806
Sir, they're in a fire fight
down there.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,241
Charlie's got them pinned down
two miles south of the LZ.

43
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,403
How bad is it?

44
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,039
They're taking fire
from all quadrants, sir.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,514
Do you want to go in?

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,780
Hang on, guys.
We're coming down to get you.

47
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,878
Get ready to move.
Take it down, Captain.

48
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,463
Captain, let's move out now!

49
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,802
Keep your shirt on, son.

50
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,563
All right! Go!

51
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,667
Come on!

52
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,283
Come on, son.
We got to get out of here.

53
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,668
Shit! Damn!

54
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,838
You OK?

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,347
I'm fine.
Let's go to the chopper!

56
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,542
Come on!

57
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,302
Sir, they're getting
a good bead on us!

58
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,325
Colonel!

59
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,497
Looks like some
more party crashers, sir!

60
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,110
All right, come on!
Get in there!

61
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,806
Come on. Get in there. Quick!

62
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,309
Sir!

63
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,510
Let's get the hell out of here!

64
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,401
What the hell is that?

65
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,836
We're hit! We're going down!

66
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,101
I'm gonna try to make the lake.

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,129
Get ready to jump.

68
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,136
Jump!

69
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,778
Jump, Lieutenant!

70
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,405
I said, jump, Lieutenant!

71
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,053
On the day America
remembers its war dead...

72
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:36,324
a special salute today
to the war dead of Vietnam.

73
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,821
An American serviceman who died
there took his place today...

74
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,632
in a place of honor,
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

75
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,333
Almost 10 years after the last
Americans left Saigon...

76
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:51,105
the men who fought in Vietnam
got their parade.

77
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,339
Muffled drums and dirges...

78
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,940
a coffin and a flag
wrapped in plastic...

79
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,950
to protect it from the rain.

80
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,452
In the amphitheater
of Arlington Cemetery...

81
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,012
families of the men
still missing from Vietnam...

82
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:07,049
waited for the coffin
and remembered.

83
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,029
They wonder if their sons
are still alive...

84
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,758
and why the world sits back...

85
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,356
and allows
the Vietnamese government...

86
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,166
to flagrantly violate
the Geneva Convention.

87
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,638
Rumors of physical
and mental torture...

88
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,107
have made
the wait more agonizing.

89
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:26,306
The families were reassured
by a deeply moved president.

90
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,543
We write no last chapters...

91
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,744
we close no books...

92
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,253
we put away no final memories.

93
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,949
An end to America's
involvement in Vietnam...

94
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,458
cannot come
before we have achieved...

95
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:43,827
the fullest possible accounting
of those missing in action.

96
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,449
Colonel Yin...

97
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,591
you may not give a damn
about the Geneva Convention...

98
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:23,262
but someday you're gonna
be held accountable.

99
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:28,240
The Geneva Convention applies
to prisoners of war.

100
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,711
You men are not
prisoners of war.

101
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,043
You are common criminals.

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,672
I have repeatedly told you...

103
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,343
that there is no escape
from my camp...

104
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:43,049
unless you consider
death an escape.

105
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,421
You are surrounded by cliffs...

106
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,325
mountains,
jungles full of man traps...

107
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,853
and a bridge that is impassable.

108
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:56,995
None of you have ever escaped,
and none of you will.

109
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,996
The only way for you to leave
my camp...

110
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,670
is if Braddock confesses.

111
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,440
He defends the country
that has forgotten you...

112
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:15,682
an outlaw nation
the rest of the world reviles!

113
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:26,591
They are killing
your ambassadors of the evil...

114
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,396
in every part of the world.

115
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,917
I have something for you.

116
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,860
Hey, it's a beaut.

117
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,161
It's a good two inches.

118
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,758
Angelo says thanks.

119
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,103
What he give you?

120
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,237
A B-52.

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,043
It's just a worm
for his chicken.

122
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,622
You know, I got to learn
to keep my mouth shut.

123
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,719
What do you do?
You never shoot your mouth off.

124
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,662
I try to decide
if what I'm going to say...

125
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,857
is worth getting hit for.

126
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,561
Wish I could do that.

127
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,728
Franklin?

128
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,067
Hey, it's hot. I'm sweating.

129
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,404
Looks like the malaria again.

130
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,430
Hey...

131
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,044
What the hell is Harry doing?

132
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,214
I'll bite his head off
for a pack of cigarettes.

133
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,429
Colonel Braddock,
I need to talk to you.

134
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,288
Colonel.

135
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,703
Look, I'm real sorry
those two guys died...

136
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,576
but we don't all have to.

137
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,638
Maybe I can get Yin
not to ride you so hard.

138
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,875
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Braddock?

139
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,653
How about it, Sarge?

140
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,352
I mean, you know you could use
some time off.

141
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,258
Begging the captain's
pardon, sir...

142
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,862
but kiss my black ass.

143
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:48,890
That's funny.

144
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,828
All you guys are
big, brave soldiers...

145
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,997
and you think I'm a coward.

146
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,906
No, you're not a coward.
You're a traitor.

147
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,004
I'm not a traitor.

148
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,806
Look, our country
has forgotten about us...

149
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,340
and we have to do
anything we can to survive.

150
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,080
Look, I'm not the bad guy here.

151
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,748
It's Braddock
and his stupid pride.

152
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,983
When we first got here...

153
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,891
there were five times
as many of us... 33 Americans.

154
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:14,916
Now look at us.

155
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,059
I say that all Braddock
has to do is confess...

156
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,124
to some garbage war crime,
and Yin will send us home.

157
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,293
Who's gonna care?

158
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,331
The war has been over for...

159
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,940
for God knows how long.

160
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,341
We don't know that for sure.

161
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,937
There is no war.

162
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,278
And nobody gives
a damn about us.

163
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,477
Oh, yeah?

164
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,383
Well, I hear they're
coming to get us.

165
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,945
And if I were you,
I'd rather die here...

166
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,354
than have to explain
to my kid...

167
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,051
that I was a gutless traitor.

168
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,457
At least I've seen my kid.

169
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,053
Let him go.

170
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,003
Back off, Nester.

171
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,779
Die if you want to, all of you.

172
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,823
Who tell you someone coming?

173
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,484
No one.

174
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,357
I made it up to piss him off.

175
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,123
Why'd those guys have to run?

176
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,634
God, I got to get some sleep!

177
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,229
But whenever I close my eyes,
I see my wife Gina.

178
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,209
Yeah. My Diane's
gonna be mad at me.

179
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,384
I wanted the four kids
more than she did.

180
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,415
We made a deal.

181
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,048
She'd work, and I'd retire
and bring them up.

182
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,293
I fooled the hell out of her.

183
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,197
I haven't even seen my kid!

184
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,205
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,177
I try to block it out,
but I can't.

186
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,942
No one can.

187
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,448
You do. Nothing bothers you.

188
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,177
I'm just...

189
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,452
I'm just not tough like you.

190
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,715
Lao.

191
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:45,100
Sergeant Lawrence Opelka...

192
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,299
you have been tried
and found guilty...

193
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,867
of war crimes against
the people of Vietnam...

194
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,105
and have been sentenced
to death.

195
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,684
Please!

196
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:46,954
Nester.

197
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,133
What does he want from him?

198
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,510
Chou, get over here!

199
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,608
Chou! You scum!

200
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,642
Come down here, Chou!

201
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,813
Mazilli!

202
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,949
Come here, Chou!
You're nothing! Chou! Chou!

203
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,687
You lose.

204
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:15,989
You're scum, Chou!

205
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,620
Get down here
and shut that door!

206
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,789
Mazilli!

207
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,992
Get down here, Chou!
I said, get down here!

208
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,022
Mazilli!

209
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,305
It's not doing anyone any good.
You know that.

210
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,807
What the hell is going on?

211
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,536
Why are they starting
this torture crap again?

212
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,752
It's OK, kid. It's OK.

213
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,177
Here. Brought you some things.

214
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,678
Did you get the quinine?

215
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,910
No, I can't.
Yin has it locked up.

216
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,284
But he told me to tell you
that if Braddock confesses...

217
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,549
he will give it to you.

218
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,488
Yin can't be trusted.

219
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,926
I've given him what he wanted,
and he's treated me well enough.

220
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,125
He doesn't care about you.

221
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,534
It's Braddock's confession
he's always wanted.

222
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,540
Over the years,
it's driven him mad.

223
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,134
Then why not
just give it to him?

224
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:43,345
If Yin ever breaks Braddock,
we will all be killed.

225
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,553
Colonel Braddock,
I have spoken to my superiors...

226
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,386
and arranged for you
to be released...

227
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,096
if you will simply let us film
your confession just once.

228
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,588
No public appearances,
no questions.

229
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,329
We could do it right now.

230
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,639
You know I can't do that.

231
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:19,342
Some of my men feel
I am being too lenient with you.

232
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,451
Colonel Braddock...

233
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,887
I didn't want
to have to tell you this...

234
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,490
but maybe you should know.

235
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:37,333
Your wife
is planning to remarry.

236
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,204
She has you declared dead.

237
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,840
Your family needs you.

238
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,809
Sign this statement...

239
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,787
I will let you go home
before the wedding.

240
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:02,392
Colonel Yin, if my wife
is getting remarried...

241
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,020
I'm happy for her...

242
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,224
because if she's gonna wait for
me to sign this confession...

243
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,324
she's gonna be waiting
a long time.

244
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,108
Get him out of here.

245
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,622
Get down! Come on!

246
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,165
Hey! Come on!

247
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:49,140
That humper Lao is the biggest
asshole this side of Nester.

248
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:55,576
Leave him alone, Lao.
You hear me?!

249
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:04,216
Braddock, since you're
in a fighting mood...

250
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,416
I'll give you one.

251
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,394
Nester, you will be
Braddock's opponent...

252
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,828
and you will win.

253
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,264
I can't do that, sir.

254
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,839
Colonel Yin, our deal was that
I would never have to hurt...

255
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,275
any of the other prisoners.

256
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,507
Fine.

257
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,674
Don't fight.

258
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,808
But...

259
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:38,086
I will put you back
in the Americans' cell.

260
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:42,618
I'm not sure you would be as
popular there as you once were.

261
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,714
Why don't you just take a few
punches and go down, Colonel?

262
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,483
It’ll save us both
a lot of pain.

263
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,512
Yeah.

264
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,257
Put your hands up, Braddock.

265
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,092
Colonel Yin is watching us.

266
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,291
Put your hands up.

267
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,232
Nester, he's using you.

268
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:25,864
Come on.

269
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,605
Come on, sir! Get up!

270
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:35,045
Protect yourself!

271
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,673
Damn you, Colonel. Fight me.

272
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,249
Come on, Colonel.
Protect yourself.

273
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:42,676
Braddock.

274
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,382
Nester, Nester.

275
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,789
Get up, Colonel! Get up!

276
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,123
Come on.

277
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,286
Braddock!

278
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,889
You bastard,
either stay down or fight!

279
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,560
Come on, Colonel!
Hit him again! Yes!

280
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,734
He's gonna kill you, Nester.

281
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,297
I don't want to fight you,
Nester.

282
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,275
You got no choice now, Colonel.

283
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,009
No more favors.

284
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,572
Now I'm gonna hurt you!

285
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,516
Come on, sir! Get up!

286
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,848
Come on! For all of us!
Get him!

287
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,183
Come on, Colonel!

288
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:18,384
Come on, Nester,
don't be a fool, man!

289
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,363
Get up, Colonel.
Come on, get up.

290
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,993
Finish him off.

291
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,298
Come on!

292
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:34,732
Come on.

293
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,765
One more. Come on, in on him!

294
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,743
Give him another one.
Finish him off. Come on.

295
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,372
Yes! Come on, colonel!

296
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,381
Come on, Braddock.

297
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,610
Enough. Come on.
Finish this off.

298
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,640
Give him one good shot.

299
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,483
Come on!

300
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,129
Finish him off, sir. Come on.

301
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,398
- Be careful.
- Watch yourself.

302
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,597
Finish him off!

303
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,237
Come on. Get up!

304
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,211
Get up, Colonel.

305
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,304
Come on, Braddock.

306
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,473
Get up, Braddock.

307
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,676
Get up, Colonel. Get up.

308
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,877
One shot!

309
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,082
Come on, get up. Come on.
Come on, Colonel, get up!

310
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,613
Now! You're beaten!

311
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,489
Come on, soldier, get up.

312
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,094
How's it feel, Nester?!

313
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,399
Keep on him!
Get him, Colonel!

314
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,464
Yes!

315
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,468
Sir, Colonel,
you're killing him!

316
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,638
That's enough!

317
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,372
Lao, that's enough!

318
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,504
No!

319
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:32,919
You see what happens...

320
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:37,054
when one does not follow
my direction immediately.

321
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,028
You lose.

322
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:53,934
Colonel?

323
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:58,983
What did Yin lay on you
this time?

324
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,646
He said that my wife's
getting remarried...

325
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,154
and I've been declared dead.

326
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,986
He's bullshitting you.
You know that, don't you?

327
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,389
Captain Ho.

328
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:14,958
Anything on the quinine?

329
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,695
I don't have malaria.

330
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,202
Nothing.

331
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,674
But I have some things for you.

332
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,336
Beer?

333
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,390
Why don't you go give
the guys a drink?

334
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:43,486
Sure.

335
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,201
Have I got a surprise for you.

336
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,839
You see this baby, huh?
Look at that.

337
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,900
Hey, Lieutenant, have a sip.

338
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,407
This is what you wanted.

339
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,108
Thanks, Captain.

340
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,022
Colonel Yin,
I need to talk to you.

341
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,436
I'm the officer in charge.

342
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,905
If you have to punish somebody,
then punish me.

343
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:16,045
Confess. Admit your mistake.

344
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,679
No.

345
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,124
Very well.

346
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:30,995
Dou Chou.

347
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,868
No!

348
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,080
You're right.
You are responsible.

349
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,420
Come on, Franklin.
Here. I'll help you.

350
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,612
Let me get that one.
You get the small ones.

351
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,747
Fine. I ain't doing
so hot anyway.

352
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,388
What's that?

353
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,396
It's a chopper...

354
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,563
A Huey.

355
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,537
It sounds American.

356
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,485
Stop him!

357
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,583
What the hell?

358
00:33:57,002 --> 00:34:00,130
I hope I didn't scare you guys.

359
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:01,935
How do you like
my new helicopter?

360
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,741
You are a day early.

361
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,337
I had to borrow it.
The other was too small.

362
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,974
I've brought you an arsenal
that will discourage anyone...

363
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,007
from cutting into
our opium business.

364
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:17,852
Now all that can harm us are
your American friends.

365
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,686
Why are they still alive?

366
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,525
Francois, I have
the situation under control.

367
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,129
Thanks for our treat.

368
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,726
You're a hot little devil.

369
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:33,795
You know, this time
they're all virgins.

370
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,234
Come on, girls.

371
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,377
Colonel, I don't think
there is a search team.

372
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,277
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

373
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,844
At least we know what they're
putting in that hut.

374
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,116
Those boxes?

375
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,386
They're full of weapons.

376
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,188
That's our way out.

377
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,792
When do you aim to kill
the Americans?

378
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,593
In my own time.

379
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,759
You're risking
our entire operation...

380
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,291
a very profitable operation.

381
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,429
I'm thinking of
getting a new watch.

382
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,338
Do you think you can purchase
one of those digital models?

383
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,168
I told you to kill
the Americans, goddamn it!

384
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,147
If the P.O.W. Search team hears
about it, we're finished!

385
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,275
Don't let your stupid ego
ruin everything!

386
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,424
Francois, will you
come with me for a moment?

387
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,695
Look, I didn't want to...

388
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:42,899
You will never again speak to me
like that in front of my men.

389
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,738
It sets a dangerous example.

390
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,635
Do you understand me?

391
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,578
Good.

392
00:35:55,153 --> 00:36:01,422
Do you have any new information
about the American search team?

393
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,395
No. It's still rumors...

394
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:08,297
but there's been a guy
hanging around asking questions.

395
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:13,969
I wonder if Opelka is dead.

396
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,031
No. If he were...

397
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,737
Colonel Yin would stick his body
right in front of our faces.

398
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,842
So, my friend,
could I convince you...

399
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,445
to spend the night
with us and the virgins?

400
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,757
Sorry. I better not.

401
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,917
Understand...

402
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,756
I'm delivering
the opium personally...

403
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,024
but I will be back
to pick up the girls.

404
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,464
Don't forget my watch.

405
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:17,434
Colonel Braddock, Francois
brought me something today...

406
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,664
that I'm sure is of
great interest to you.

407
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:27,368
It seems your ex-wife has
finally written you a letter.

408
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,784
Unfortunately,
you must be punished...

409
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,888
for the incident with
your late friend... Opelka.

410
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:47,921
He's dead?

411
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,888
Ho!

412
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,644
Playboy, you want to play?

413
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:18,506
You!

414
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,785
I've been looking for you.

415
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:24,118
About time you showed up.

416
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,383
Your headquarters.

417
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,822
You take me
to your headquarters.

418
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,929
Name's Emerson... Clyde Emerson.

419
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,863
No. You don't understand.

420
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,308
Now, what is needed here is a
little courtesy and cooperation.

421
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,541
I'm the point man for
a P.O.W. Search mission.

422
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,982
The I.F.H. Got word of this
little operation some time ago.

423
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,212
I must say, we've had
a devil of a time finding you.

424
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,379
Who is "we"?

425
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:59,151
Ah, yes. The International
Freedom House.

426
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,023
I'm not just running around the
jungle looking for publicity.

427
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,823
He lie.

428
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,591
It's not a lie.

429
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,325
I'm part of a major operation.

430
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:08,798
There are nine other scouts
like me.

431
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,597
We each have five square miles
to cover.

432
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,867
And all of us call in
to Central Team regularly.

433
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:19,036
Now, if you think that's a lie,
you are in a pack of trouble.

434
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,203
Why don't you cooperate...

435
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,440
and save yourself a lot
of needless bloodshed?

436
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,606
What the hell is going on?

437
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,581
Damned if I know.

438
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,448
Do you really expect me
to believe you...

439
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,923
and turn over my whole camp?

440
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,889
Well, under
the circumstances, yes.

441
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,793
I believe that's the only thing
that you can do.

442
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,060
I hid a homing device
out there in the jungle.

443
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,930
My team knows
exactly where I am.

444
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,901
Now, they'll be waiting
for my signal.

445
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,403
Now, if I give it,
they'll come in slowly.

446
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,530
If I don't, they'll come in
fast, and you'll all be dead.

447
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,040
What signal?

448
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,439
Stop playing the fool.

449
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,472
The way I figure it...

450
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,209
these are your choices...
you can either cut and run...

451
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,841
or you can wait
until my team comes in...

452
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,409
and then you can try to run...

453
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,614
or you can cooperate
right now...

454
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,715
and save everyone
a whole lot of trouble.

455
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:15,694
I believe you left out
some of my options.

456
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,965
One, I could kill you
and the prisoners.

457
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,763
Yes. Missed that one.

458
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:26,971
And two... I can simply
lock you up...

459
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:31,107
and wait until you're ready
to give the signal.

460
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:32,673
Yes, you could lock me up...

461
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,446
but I'll never give you
the signal.

462
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,713
I don't care if you kill me.

463
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,916
Now, look, I'm tired of
hanging around under this sun...

464
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:41,482
playing footsie with
a half-pint would-be dictator.

465
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,837
Give him anything he wants.

466
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,008
I can't believe it!

467
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,847
We're going home!

468
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:11,344
OK. I want to know who won
the World Series last year.

469
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,153
I don't know anything about
any bloody World Series, mate.

470
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:15,318
I'm Australian.

471
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,691
Forget it. I love you anyway.

472
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,626
Yin won't give up this easy.

473
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,532
How large is your rescue team?

474
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,059
Large enough to kick
Yin's ass, huh?

475
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:30,563
I'm alone.

476
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,377
Alone?

477
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:38,109
Nobody knows I'm here, mate.

478
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,012
Man, there's nobody
gonna come and get me.

479
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,283
But the International
Freedom House...

480
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,153
The Central Team,
The homing device?

481
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,317
It's just a bluff, isn't it?
I had to tell him something.

482
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,917
I've heard rumors
about this place.

483
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,223
I followed Francois in.

484
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:52,820
I'm just a lousy
photographer, mate.

485
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:55,162
I needed pictures for proof.

486
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,325
Damn!

487
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,859
One thing for sure,
he's got guts.

488
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:05,274
Yeah. Nobody ever broke
into a prison camp.

489
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,143
All right, then, let's get out.
We'll head for the cliffs.

490
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,305
Anything happens to me...

491
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:10,575
I stashed
some ropes under a big rock.

492
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:11,877
You can't miss it.
Head for the Thai border...

493
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,281
100 miles due west.
Come on, let's go.

494
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,651
Wait. Yin may let you go...

495
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,952
but he certainly
won't let us all go.

496
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,218
What's that?

497
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,352
It's Francois coming
to pick up his whores.

498
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,259
Shit. He knows I'm alone.

499
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:26,285
Well, move it!

500
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:32,629
I'm just going to give
the signal, mate.

501
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,815
Mr. Emerson.

502
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,077
I'm just gonna give my signal.

503
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,243
Good.

504
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,752
Damn.

505
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:51,448
I hope everyone's told you
how well they have been treated.

506
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:52,820
Well, they don't love you,
but all in all...

507
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,324
they look pretty good.
I'll be right back.

508
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,849
One more moment, please.

509
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,658
I would like you to meet
a friend of mine.

510
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,632
I'll meet him later.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

511
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,999
I wouldn't want the Central Team
to get impatient, you know.

512
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,230
Francois.

513
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:11,300
What's the matter, my friend?
You look a little nervous.

514
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:14,505
He is the goddamn guy who's
been asking questions about us.

515
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,777
He claims he's the point man
for a major rescue operation.

516
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:22,115
He's lying. He's alone.

517
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,121
I've still got the homing
device out in the jungle.

518
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,890
I am weary of playing footsie
with you.

519
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,695
Take him to the tree.

520
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,166
Move!

521
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:04,051
For the crimes against
the people of Vietnam...

522
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,995
I sentence you to death.

523
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:13,232
Don't worry! It's not real!

524
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,898
He's just trying to scare you!

525
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,998
They've got
a lousy sense of humor.

526
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,358
Get up. Get up.

527
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:38,422
Shut up, you asshole.

528
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,691
You...

529
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,322
We'll get him up.

530
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,423
OK, OK.

531
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,464
I'm OK.

532
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:57,970
Captain Ho?

533
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,395
He's dying.

534
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,173
Yin!

535
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:53,394
No, don't do it.

536
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,597
He has to.

537
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:58,469
What the hell's the difference?

538
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,678
Our struggle was a long one.

539
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,015
As I predicted, you lost.

540
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:15,617
I'm glad you finally understand
the extent of your guilt.

541
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,957
You do, don't you?

542
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:19,326
He don't understand shit!

543
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,229
Yes, Colonel Yin...

544
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:28,699
I understand.

545
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,785
Let's get him up.

546
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,556
Colonel Braddock.

547
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,560
I believe you have
forgotten something.

548
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:16,652
Now, my American P.O. W...

549
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:20,384
I will live up to my promise
and will let you go free.

550
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:24,485
Tomorrow, Francois will be here
and will fly you to Thailand...

551
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,996
and deliver you to your embassy.

552
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,056
You see, Colonel? I told you.

553
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,195
I will try to make
your last day here...

554
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,727
as comfortable as possible.

555
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:39,038
Here. Come into the next room.
You'll stay there tonight.

556
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:05,102
I can't believe it.

557
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:06,865
It's over. We're going home.

558
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:08,565
I'm going to see my kid!

559
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:11,373
Something's wrong.

560
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:12,603
Nothing's wrong.

561
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,940
You've just been here too long.

562
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,309
You're in shock.

563
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,677
I am feeling better.

564
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:17,874
Yeah, you're feeling better.

565
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,087
Nothing works this fast.

566
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,618
Oh, God! Get him up, Mazilli!

567
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:33,220
He's been poisoned!

568
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:35,425
Come on, Franklin!

569
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:36,592
Come on, on both legs.

570
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:37,760
Walk!

571
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:39,497
- Come on.
- Walk, Franklin.

572
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,971
Come on, walk it.
Walk, Franklin!

573
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:44,133
Is this an American
funeral rite?

574
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:52,481
I'm afraid I gave poor Franklin
such an overdose of opium...

575
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:56,145
that he could walk
from here to Los Angeles...

576
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,246
and would not do him any good.

577
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,152
Throw him in the hole.

578
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:05,185
You son of a bitch.

579
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:53,240
Wait!

580
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:58,373
Yin, wait!

581
00:51:58,417 --> 00:51:59,884
Yin!

582
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:05,279
He's not dead!

583
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:10,584
God, no!

584
00:52:10,629 --> 00:52:12,221
Oh, God!

585
00:52:19,004 --> 00:52:20,232
Son of a bitch.

586
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:14,147
Mazilli, I thought
you should know...

587
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:16,176
that you're completely alone.

588
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:21,022
Your brave colonel has abandoned
you to die here.

589
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,287
Braddock got away?

590
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:23,794
He'll die tomorrow.

591
00:59:25,196 --> 00:59:26,356
So will you.

592
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,063
In the meantime...

593
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,234
if you're lonely...

594
00:59:37,475 --> 00:59:39,272
play with your friend.

595
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:04,432
More wine, Colonel?

596
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:05,458
No.

597
01:00:09,107 --> 01:00:10,836
Braddock gone!

598
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,274
Why keep him alive?

599
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:15,578
Now, you know,
I might be wrong...

600
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:19,344
but I don't think it's
a very good idea to kill me.

601
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:21,716
Why not?

602
01:00:21,753 --> 01:00:24,813
I could always get
someone to pour my wine.

603
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:30,552
It's because
I'm the only one left...

604
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:33,826
who really knows how
Colonel Braddock thinks.

605
01:00:33,865 --> 01:00:35,298
See, he hasn't gone yet.

606
01:00:37,836 --> 01:00:39,326
Is that so?

607
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:43,238
Yes. He has stayed to try
and take revenge on you.

608
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,273
I will use Francois' helicopter.

609
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:55,013
We will capture him tomorrow.

610
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:01,785
We should have killed that guy
a long time ago.

611
01:03:27,372 --> 01:03:29,067
We'd better get back.

612
01:03:29,107 --> 01:03:30,836
You'll never find
this guy alive.

613
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:32,035
Just keep searching.

614
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:56,525
Braddock come back,
blow bridge down.

615
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:58,825
Lock up all the prisoners
and Nester!

616
01:04:58,863 --> 01:05:00,023
You, to the bridge!

617
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:04,961
In there.

618
01:05:13,177 --> 01:05:15,145
I'll bury him with this.

619
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:20,312
My God! It's a bomb!

620
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:21,340
Get out!

621
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:31,827
Damn American!

622
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:07,056
Open it.

623
01:06:07,098 --> 01:06:08,087
Mazilli!

624
01:06:10,701 --> 01:06:12,032
What the hell?

625
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:13,866
Braddock!

626
01:06:13,905 --> 01:06:14,929
Let's go!

627
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,307
Duck!

628
01:06:23,614 --> 01:06:25,047
Come on! Come on!

629
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:16,389
Damn! We got to find that rope.

630
01:07:22,173 --> 01:07:24,539
They're getting too close.
Let's get out of here.

631
01:07:24,575 --> 01:07:25,872
It's got to be here.

632
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,203
Emerson said
they were under a big rock.

633
01:07:30,248 --> 01:07:31,613
There must be 60 big rocks.

634
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,409
Here it is!

635
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:40,479
Here.

636
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,301
Good luck, kid.

637
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,808
- Aren't you coming?
- I'm going after Ho.

638
01:07:58,843 --> 01:08:02,040
If you're staying to fight,
there's no way I'm leaving you.

639
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,513
Here they come!
Get your ass down the cliff!

640
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:15,929
You idiot!

641
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,300
Come in.

642
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:29,036
So, Yin, we're all loaded up.

643
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:31,639
I'll see you in about a week.

644
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:35,345
Francois, I will need
your helicopter...

645
01:12:35,386 --> 01:12:36,785
to look for the Americans.

646
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,685
I believe they've gone down
the river.

647
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:40,451
I am sorry. I can't help you.

648
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:41,822
You will not go.

649
01:12:43,427 --> 01:12:45,725
I am going.

650
01:12:45,763 --> 01:12:47,196
Come on, let's go.

651
01:12:47,231 --> 01:12:50,667
Get your hands off...
What the hell are you doing?

652
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:52,965
They are following my order.

653
01:12:54,305 --> 01:12:59,299
They needed a new leader after
they heard that you had died.

654
01:14:25,496 --> 01:14:26,485
Ho.

655
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:16,766
Opelka.

656
01:16:16,807 --> 01:16:17,967
Colonel.

657
01:16:26,617 --> 01:16:27,982
I'm glad you made it, kid.

658
01:16:28,018 --> 01:16:31,317
Thanks, Colonel.
Yin must have given up on me.

659
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:32,617
He thought you were dead.

660
01:16:34,358 --> 01:16:36,019
How come you hung around?

661
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:37,219
I don't know.

662
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:40,560
I guess it was just
some kind of instinct.

663
01:16:46,503 --> 01:16:48,903
I want you to guard the base.

664
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:50,668
If I'm not back in 24 hours...

665
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:52,436
go down the river
and try to find Mazilli.

666
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:59,978
Colonel, I know you don't need
me to guard the base.

667
01:17:00,017 --> 01:17:02,247
I want to help you
get those bastards.

668
01:17:11,962 --> 01:17:13,122
Colonel Braddock!

669
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:27,476
Yin's our enemy, too.

670
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,140
I'll kill him!

671
01:17:32,549 --> 01:17:36,076
The fighting's over!
We all go home!

672
01:17:37,788 --> 01:17:38,914
Colonel Braddock!

673
01:17:38,956 --> 01:17:39,945
Dou Chou.

674
01:17:42,559 --> 01:17:44,220
He's listening.
He knows we're here.

675
01:17:53,237 --> 01:17:55,797
Yin dead. Believe now.

676
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,739
See, Colonel Braddock?

677
01:17:59,309 --> 01:18:01,243
Come look for yourself.
Yin dead!

678
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:07,115
Sir, the boots. That's not Yin.

679
01:18:22,466 --> 01:18:23,592
I'm going after Ho.

680
01:18:23,634 --> 01:18:25,329
He's in one of those two shacks
down there.

681
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:29,328
If there's any fireworks,
here, throw these grenades.

682
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:33,368
Sir, what about Nester?

683
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:35,344
He can take care of himself.

684
01:18:35,379 --> 01:18:36,539
He always has.

685
01:18:40,617 --> 01:18:41,777
He won't show.

686
01:18:47,858 --> 01:18:49,018
He'll come.

687
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:11,047
Good. They got Mazilli.

688
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:12,070
Let's go.

689
01:19:29,566 --> 01:19:31,625
Colonel Braddock!

690
01:19:41,812 --> 01:19:45,441
I'll give you
30 seconds to decide...

691
01:19:45,482 --> 01:19:48,679
whether you want Mazilli
to live or die.

692
01:20:10,707 --> 01:20:12,902
Your 30 seconds is up!

693
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:18,577
You have just murdered
your last man.

694
01:20:18,615 --> 01:20:21,083
Psst. Mazilli...

695
01:20:21,118 --> 01:20:23,348
anything you want me
to tell your kid?

696
01:20:26,223 --> 01:20:28,020
Hold it!

697
01:20:28,058 --> 01:20:29,355
Mazilli is mine.

698
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:33,353
Why don't we just tell
the kid that Daddy...

699
01:20:33,397 --> 01:20:38,733
was a very brave soldier
right up till the very end?

700
01:20:43,774 --> 01:20:44,832
Down!

701
01:20:48,445 --> 01:20:49,742
Move it, Mazilli!

702
01:21:14,905 --> 01:21:17,237
Nester... he came back to us.

703
01:21:17,274 --> 01:21:18,263
Yeah, I know.

704
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:20,769
I'm going after Ho.

705
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:44,463
Cover us, Ho. We're going in.

706
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:56,612
Colonel, they're all
in Yin's house.

707
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:57,874
Opelka!

708
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:58,903
Lieutenant.

709
01:22:03,787 --> 01:22:05,277
Opelka, left flank.

710
01:22:06,823 --> 01:22:09,451
Mazilli, around back.

711
01:22:09,493 --> 01:22:10,619
Wait.

712
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,560
Ready? Go!

713
01:22:12,596 --> 01:22:13,893
Now!

714
01:23:51,761 --> 01:23:53,194
Nobody could have lived
through this.

715
01:23:55,131 --> 01:23:56,120
Colonel.

716
01:24:19,923 --> 01:24:21,413
Remember how to fly this thing?

717
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:22,618
You better believe it.

718
01:25:26,256 --> 01:25:28,315
You really didn't think
I'd leave...

719
01:25:28,358 --> 01:25:30,019
without knowing for sure
you were dead?

720
01:25:33,096 --> 01:25:35,326
You'll not just kill me.

721
01:25:35,365 --> 01:25:38,528
You want to know
who the better man is.

722
01:25:39,869 --> 01:25:44,169
That is why you stayed behind.

723
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:46,767
I also want to know.

724
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:51,247
That is why I kept you alive
all these years.

725
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:57,076
Now it is the time...

726
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,250
You and I, one-on-one.

727
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:02,451
No politics...

728
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,450
no weapons.

729
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:18,798
Just a little game to find out
who is the better man.

730
01:26:24,147 --> 01:26:27,116
I knew you could not
resist my challenge.

731
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:39,061
Colonel Yin,
for the atrocities inflicted...

732
01:26:39,095 --> 01:26:41,825
on the Vietnamese and American
prisoners of this camp...

733
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,668
I sentence you to death.

734
01:28:50,093 --> 01:28:51,492
This is for Nester.

735
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,098
Not yet.

736
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:35,301
The game's over.

737
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:13,737
And this is for Franklin.

738
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:24,583
You lose.

739
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:22,804
This is for me.

740
01:31:32,805 --> 01:31:35,605
