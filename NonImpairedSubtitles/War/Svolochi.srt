1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
25.000

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,900
By the beginning of 1943, the number of homeless
children in areas of evacuation has reached more
than 670 thousand people,

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,400
the majority of whom are vagrants, beggars,
or thieves.

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,300
The most daring join gangs
and commit heinous crimes:

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,800
robbery, larceny of socialist property,
murder, and others:''

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,800
From a Central Executive Committee
report to Comrade Stalin.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, you're already familiar with this order:

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
''...By decree: Forthe perpetration
of especially heinous crimes,

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
children will be tried as adults to the fullest
extent of the law, in compliance with the
statutes of the USSR.''

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And that's how things are, sir.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes....

12
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Of course, sir, the easiest thing would be
to follow the penal code.

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,500
However, the decision was made to ease the fate
of young criminals and give them the chance

14
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,800
to atone for their crimes before the Motherland.

15
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:59,500
We've developed recommendations for the creation
of an intelligence school in your area for those
juvenile delinquents facing the capital punishment

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,900
Thanks to this school they will now
have a choice.

17
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,800
Vishnevetsky, Anton Viacheslavich.

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,600
How do you feel about this?
That's why l flew here.

19
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,500
Thank you for your confidence, sir.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
-Have they brought him?
-Yes sir, in the corridor.

21
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,100
You should change your seat.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,500
We found one fitting candidate.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,600
A distinguished master of the sport: a lieutenant
colonel, single, wife and son died a year ago
from typhus.

24
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
Vishnevetsky?

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,800
-So he's...?!
-Yes, Vishnevetsky is back from incarceration

26
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,700
to, let's say, atone himself
through blood.

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
-Bring him in!
-Come in.

28
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,600
Vishnevetsky, please sit down.

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,700
Hello, Anton Viacheslavich.

30
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,800
Good day,

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,700
Comrade Lieutenant-General.

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
General, show him our plans!

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,100
Congratulations, Vishnevetsky, you've been
selected to head this ''school.''

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,700
The staff?

35
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Give us any name. We'll bring them from
the front lines; recall from evacuations,

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,300
and from other, shall we say,
locations.

37
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,100
-And, the cadets?
-Well, our ''cadets'' are special.

38
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,000
And then from the Christmas tree, softly sprang
the yellow angel - ''Poor maestro you are tired,
you are ill.''

39
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,300
They say at night you sing
the tango at the haunts!

40
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Even in our bright sky everyone was amazed''
-Hey, what's taking so long?

41
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Stay here, watch it, and hold the animal
so it doesn't drag the cart away.

42
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,300
Yeah, ok.

43
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,000
Bring some gingerbread forthe donk.

44
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Cot, get on the roof, we'll go below.

45
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Damn, it's creaky.

46
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Come on!

47
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,700
Line up behind me.

48
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,300
Hey man, got a smoke?

49
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,200
What the fucking hell?

50
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,200
Come on.

51
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,900
-Guys, tinned stew!
-Take it. Cot, where are you?

52
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,000
-Bitch, he didn't even have ammo.
-Fuck him. lf he had any,
he would have shot you for sure.

53
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Find the condensed milk and the powdered eggs.

54
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
What the hell do you want
all that condensed milk for?

55
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,300
-The piker asked for it.
-What the fuck does he want it for?

56
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,200
How should l know?

57
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,300
-Watch it.
-Cops!

58
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,200
Where are you going, Cot and Lavrik
are still in there, fuck! Dirty scums!

59
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Stop! l'll shoot! Stop!

60
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,700
Cops!

61
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,100
-Dead.
-Go, Tulimhan!

62
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,800
So, you shit your pants yet?

63
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Come out with your hands up, one by one!

64
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,200
There, cop!

65
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,000
Stop: come out you dirty fucks,

66
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
l'll fuck you up!

67
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,200
Stop!

68
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,300
Put it down, fool!

69
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,400
lt could shoot!

70
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Drop it, kid.

71
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,200
What are you doing, boys?

72
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Don't move, bastard!

73
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,300
''BASTARDS''

74
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,400
Comrade lieutenant-colonel,
are we blocked down below?

75
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes, below, at the old base.
Every approach to the school
is covered by a special guard battalion.

76
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,700
Now, there will be no ranks, no last names,

77
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,200
only first names.

78
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,100
The contingent should best be
called by nicknames.

79
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Take this.

80
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,400
But why involve the children in this?

81
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,000
Even if they are:

82
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They are not children,

83
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,400
they are repeat offenders: criminals,

84
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,800
-l don't feel good.
-pickpockets, thieves,

85
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,700
robbers, murderers.
They have no respect for authority.

86
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,700
Therefore, don't expect any fear
or respect from them.

87
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
And try not to turn your back on them,

88
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,100
or else all they have learned
from you, might be turned against you.

89
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,800
And...

90
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,700
As comrade Konstantin Simonov put it:

91
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
''no love, no grief, no jealousy.''

92
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Whell...

93
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
What did they tell you:

94
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,200
fifteen, not older!

95
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,400
They had to be orphans,

96
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,300
no mom, no dad, no grandparents!
And what did you turn up?

97
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,400
-Who did you pick out?
-Don't understand.

98
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,000
You are kidding?

99
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,300
Only two...

100
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,700
Chernov, Konstantin Arkadievich..

101
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,800
armed robbery.. theft of personal
and socialist property..

102
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,700
participation in the murders of police
officers: and so on.

103
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Tiapkin, Valentin Petrovich..gang member
murder of a police officer..

104
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:17,400
Hold it! Tiapkin isn't fourteen!
He's only thirteen.

105
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,400
We've checked, he's fourteen,
precisely on April 3rd.

106
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,600
Chernov, out!

107
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,700
Face the wall,

108
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
move.

109
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:09,400
Ask forthe penal colony, or else you'll go to
the front line, as a ''son of the regiment,''
plugging gun ports with your ass.

110
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Hands behind your back.

111
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,900
-Where are you taking them?
-The seventh..

112
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,800
Move!

113
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,800
The boys are there!

114
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,000
l've already been in the colony,
betterthe front.

115
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
-You might be a good thief, but you're stupid.
-And you, wise guy, got yourself
a screw's discharge..

116
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Face the wall!

117
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Go in.

118
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,600
You have to say hello!

119
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, yeah,

120
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,300
uh huh.

121
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:31,300
-Are you really recruiters?
-Yeah, recruiters..

122
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
l'll smoke.

123
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Do you want to atone for yourwrongdoings
before the Motherland?

124
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,900
What, now l need to atone before him?
Really?

125
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,100
You don't...

126
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,600
have a choice Chernov

127
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,500
lt's eitherthe death row orthe school..

128
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,700
Well, explain, what kind of school?

129
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,800
ln 5 months we must prepare 5 sabotage groups,
each capable of the unconditional execution
of any task,

130
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
l emphasize the word ''any.''

131
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Around 50 people will arrive here,

132
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,600
but don't expect the huge thugs from the
front recruitment films

133
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,500
or army legends.

134
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,900
Take 'em, man, you'll be here awhile.

135
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,200
-Hey, what's your name, kid?
-Tiapa

136
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,800
-What about the official name?
-Tiapkin Valentin Petrovich.

137
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
-Valentina...
-Valyusha, our little sister...
darling.

138
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,600
Here, come on, come over here, get up.

139
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,500
-Why?
-What, you didn't understand
what your elder said?

140
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,700
-What do you want?
-Don't act stupid, your asshole !

141
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Hey wolf, you don't say hi, huh?

142
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,300
Whatever, we'll deal with you later,
we've got a sweat gerl.

143
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,000
Come here Valyushka.

144
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
-Don't move, lousy bitch!
-l'll crush you, bastard!

145
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Beat them!!!

146
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,900
They aren't afraid of God, the Devil,
or even Soviet power.

147
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Each one of them is a finished scoundrel.

148
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,800
And don't try your methods, comrade.

149
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,500
To your bunks, scum!
To your bunks, fuck!

150
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,100
And that recruiting asshole asks me, ''Want to
atone forwrongdoings before the Motherland?''

151
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,200
l tell him: last spring l robbed some guy

152
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
who had packets of cash the size
of bread loaves in his basement.

153
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,700
Should l be buying my atonement
from people like him?

154
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,600
And this asshole tells me, ''Chernov you
haven't got a choice.''

155
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,800
And what is he afterthat?

156
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,700
An asshole, fuck! Asshole!

157
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,300
Hey, put that out!

158
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,200
l'm talking to you!

159
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Go to hell.

160
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,100
Asshole.

161
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,200
What did we get ourselves into?

162
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,300
Most importantly, not prison.

163
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,200
Don't get involved in anything,
we'll escape anyway.

164
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
Let me go, Cot, l'll fuck them all up!
l'm telling you, let go!

165
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,400
-Don't interfere in other people's business.
-Can you hold him?

166
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,300
Don't touch me you old goat!

167
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,600
Bitch!

168
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,300
Just let me go, why are you holding on to me
like l'm a little kid, let go!

169
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,700
Boys, stop, what are you doing?
Cut it, sons of bitches, what!?

170
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,800
He's a fucking kid!

171
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,400
ls he alive?

172
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,400
-Who is that man?
-Anton, head of this ''school.''

173
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Starting a fight for a tub of hot water...

174
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,600
we expected to get desperately brave boys,

175
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,500
but instead we got 50 half brained
worthless idiots.

176
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
-The next time the instigators...
-Will be expelled from school?
-Will be expelled...

177
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,300
-...from school! Will be taken below:and shot..
-Quit fucking with us.

178
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,400
-We're minors, we can't even be tried
underthe law.
-We can't try you.

179
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,800
We can kill you!

180
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,800
Get yourselves in order.

181
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Dismissed!

182
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,900
Ok.

183
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,500
ln time.

184
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,700
Last lot.

185
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,400
How many?

186
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,800
Seven.

187
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Are we taking down anyone?

188
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
-We'll wait for now.
-Now take them.

189
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,200
-Who are you?
-Nikita.

190
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,700
-You a thief?
-We're

191
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,200
All right, let's go to bed.

192
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Troublemakers:

193
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
-And what holds the glass?
-Bread putty.
-Shut up!

194
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,500
l was a store thief on the outside and
can tell where everything is by instinct.

195
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Skull, what do you need?

196
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,400
-Pot.
-This isn't a pharmacy, so what have we here?

197
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,300
-Koaca.
-Ta, o y ac ec?

198
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Chocolate, sausage, halva, boys!

199
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:14,900
Hands, hands.

200
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,800
-Here.
-Ok.

201
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:33,400
Hands!

202
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,700
Turn them around! Cut yourfingernails!

203
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,300
No sick, no wounded.

204
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,200
Three missing.

205
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Where are the rest?

206
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,200
Robbed the storehouse:

207
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Will we be taking them down?

208
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Feed them first...

209
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Shitheads!

210
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,400
Need to figure out how to get out of here,
you know?

211
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,300
Doesn't look like much of a guard.

212
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
l overheard they have a whole battalion below.

213
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,400
There are mountains all around.

214
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,800
Need to learn to climb like those mountaineers.

215
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Hey guys, what are you talking about?

216
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,000
My pants are falling down.

217
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
-The grub isn't bad.
-Lay off Babai!
-Alright...

218
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,000
The reception of food is over,
collect the plates, line up!

219
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Whoever didn't have time, didn't eat.

220
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,700
The grub isn't bad.

221
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,700
Next!

222
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,700
Ration!

223
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
-Do it!
-What ?
-how come everyone else can, but you can't?!

224
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,200
-Because l can't, Zhora!
-l'm not ''Zhora,'' l'm Georgiy Nikolaevich!
-You've equated your ass to yourfinger.

225
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,700
Look at them, used to climbing walls
to get into windows

226
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,300
Georgiy Nikolaevich! l am a thief.

227
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,400
Specialty? Don't fuck with me.
You were in for murder.

228
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,000
-lt's just along with Cot.
-Let's go!

229
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,700
-Come on, come on, what now!?
-Hold on!

230
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,600
What are you laughing at?
Who asked you to come over here?

231
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,600
lsn't this yours!?

232
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,000
-What?! How the hell?!
-Looks like yours,...

233
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,600
Georgiy Nikolaevich...
Don't blame anymore.

234
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,000
Now you know who is are thif?

235
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,200
Let's go, now!
What are you standing around for?

236
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,000
-Get to the bag! Climb!
-Yeah, yes.

237
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Run!

238
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,500
Time's up.

239
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Good.

240
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Good job Cot.

241
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,800
You again!

242
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,700
Put your hands down.

243
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,000
Babai, what are you doing?

244
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
Stand!

245
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,700
Left-face,

246
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,600
follow me, march.

247
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,100
Hey, guitarists, let's go to the smoking yard!

248
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,400
-Let's go.
-l don't smoke.

249
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,300
Skull, where are you going?
Give me a cigarette.

250
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,200
Six machine guns,

251
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,600
nine sub-machine guns,

252
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
five carbines.

253
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,700
We gave you shitheads the kind of inventory
even the best of the Soviet Union could only
dream of..

254
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,200
..Shithead yourself

255
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,000
And you sons of bitches have torn the 4th
pairto splinters in two weeks!

256
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And what kind of skis!?
Glued, rust resistant ..

257
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,800
..with the latest bindings

258
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,700
if l had my way, you'd all be against the wall
forthose skis!!!

259
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,800
-Don't get too excited now.
-What did you say?

260
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,700
You heard me, must have not put enough people
against the wall in '37.

261
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,000
Really, and where'd you dig up
the thirty seventh!?

262
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,600
-What'd you think, l fell from a cloud or crawled
out of someone's ass?
-Scum, did you just say that to me?!

263
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,500
Don't touch the gun or else they'll find you only
afterthe snow melts. Do you understand me?

264
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,900
Understand!?

265
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,600
Here, take it and don't lose it or you'll
end up against the wall yourself.

266
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Just in case,..

267
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,400
so you don't get any ideas into your head.
et's train, Vitya?

268
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,800
Come on Vitya, relax.
Just tell us what we do wrong.

269
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Don't get upset, Victor lvanovich.
We don't break them on purpose.

270
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,800
-That's right!
-l just can't get into the turn.

271
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,600
Well, ok, let's try to get
into the curve again,

272
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,400
aggressively.

273
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,700
Follow me, everyone.

274
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,600
-After me!!!
-Stop! Where are you going?! Fuck!

275
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,400
How many times do l have to say it?
Same thing, over and over.

276
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,800
What the hell is going on here?

277
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,000
-What are you hanging there for,
like pregnant cockroaches?
-Shut up, boys do it perfectly!

278
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,700
Where are you looking, idiots?

279
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Matanya, what are you doing?
Want to kill yourself?

280
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,600
-l'll do it like it's supposed to be done!
-There you go, kid.

281
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,100
And take it slow! Don't hurry it,
l'm telling you, take it slow!

282
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Quit it, Matanya. Climb up here and
l'll fix you, you son of a bitch!

283
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,300
l climbed drainpipes up five floors without
any sort of protection.

284
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,700
-Did it with stolen goods too.
-Quit showing off, Matanya!
-Let's race...

285
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,300
..who'll get to the top faster.
You're an expert thief after all,
can't bear a loss.

286
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,400
l'm not here to make bets with idiots,
understand?

287
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,600
Scared?

288
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,500
-Buckle up at once!!
-Son of a bitch, God help us!.

289
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Skull..

290
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,600
-..where are you going?
-Don't talk Cot.

291
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,900
l'm going to try and escape.

292
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,700
Skull..

293
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,200
..put on a sweater. lt's cold.

294
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,100
Last summer l checked all the pot plots
around here. l'll make it.

295
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,000
Skull, you're insane. lt can't be done.

296
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,800
There's nothing here for me.
l'll die like Matanya.

297
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,700
l'll either make it, or else,..

298
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,600
..and what's the difference between
kicking in here or out there?

299
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,600
Maybe you guys will come with me..

300
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,700
All right, be well.

301
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Let's go back to sleep.

302
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,200
The hand, upon completion of the throwing phase
is directed at the center of the target,
the center.

303
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Don't swing from the side, you'll miss. Tiapa!

304
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:38,000
He's not on the camp territory. The upper guards
didn't see him. He must have taken the
shepherds' paths.

305
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,700
Where the hell can he go?

306
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,600
Solovei! Solovei! Aleksanich! Motherfucker,

307
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,200
-Sanich!..
-What's up?
-..look where l am!

308
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,000
Tiapa, you are best!

309
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,400
And then from the Christmas tree
sprang a yellow angel.

310
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,500
And said, poor Maestro,
you're tired, you're sick.

311
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,700
-Cot, Cot, look where l am! No hands!
-Quit showing off!

312
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,400
-Tiapa, come down!
-No.

313
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Nice going today with the trainer.

314
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,700
Just forget about it.

315
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,600
Tiapa, Tiapa...

316
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
..can't throw a heavy knife.

317
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,700
Well, he has nowhere to hide.

318
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,600
There's nowhere to run here.

319
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,000
True..

320
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
well, that means he'll get to the first
guard post and come back.

321
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,500
And if he doesn't?

322
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,200
lf he doesn't return, he'll be brought back.

323
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,600
Looks like they brought him back.

324
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,500
Call Pasha.

325
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Put the cigarette away.

326
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Your boy?.

327
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,300
-Why have you brought him?
-Need identification..

328
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,800
ldentified.

329
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,000
-What was his name?
-Stepka.

330
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,900
Belomlinskiy, Stepan..

331
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,400
Scull..

332
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,000
Certify it.

333
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
l know.

334
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, Skull croaked.
What was his real name?

335
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,900
Stepa...

336
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,700
Tiapa,..

337
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,800
...don't you have any other songs?

338
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,200
Why, for you mister commander?

339
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,700
Of course, we'll do it!

340
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,600
Maestro, music!

341
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,200
...and then from the Christmas
tree sprang a yellow angel

342
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,500
and said: poor Maestro, you are
tired, you are ill..

343
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:22,900
They say at night you sing
the tango at the haunts!

344
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Even in our bright sky everyone was amazed..

345
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,000
Where did you get that from?

346
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,800
From one very compassionate bitch.

347
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,800
She'd bring a guy home, put him away,

348
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
put the record on..and off she goes!

349
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,200
And what were you in that house?

350
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,700
lt was in the manner of a dog.

351
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,600
Bring this, bring that. Mail the cards,
bring mother some wine,

352
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,800
don't you see she's tired?

353
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
So that was your mother?

354
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,000
Who else?

355
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
And afterwards?

356
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Nothing.

357
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,500
Cops took her, kicked him out.

358
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,000
And yourfather:?

359
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Afather? What's a father, mister commander?

360
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,800
Anton Viacheslavich, not mister commander.

361
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,700
Yessir, Anton Viacheslavich! Mister commander.

362
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,900
Tiapa, good song :.

363
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,100
Cot, hey Cot.

364
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,700
Cot, maybe l should tell the truth about my
father being at the front,

365
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,600
maybe they'll let me go

366
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,400
Are you stupid?

367
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,700
They won't let you go,

368
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,600
they'll shoot you.

369
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,700
-You are a murderer and you signed their papers.
-They'll shoot me anyway.

370
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,500
Why do you think so?

371
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,700
What?

372
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,800
We're not stupid, like Skull,..

373
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,800
..we'll do the smart thing.

374
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
We'll figure it out.

375
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,700
Let's sleep on it for now..

376
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,600
-Hurry up, it's about to rain.
-Pasha?
-Yeah?

377
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,500
Why are you giving extra food to two boys?

378
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,300
l'd like to know who's the squealer around here?

379
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,700
Every other one.

380
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,700
So, who are the boys?

381
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,600
-Well, the rare kind of scum.
-So, who?

382
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Tiapa and Cot.

383
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah, the rarest.

384
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,900
One is a hardened thief,
the other, a young killer.

385
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,200
Anton, and what are we?

386
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,400
True...

387
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,400
You shouldn't have taken me out, it
would have been better if l served my time.

388
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,400
And what is this, a camping trip?

389
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,300
You're serving yourtime here too!

390
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:32,700
We never sent children to die!

391
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,600
War is that kind of time!

392
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,500
Don't aim forthe head fuckers, don't risk it.
Shoot the chest, the stomach, doesn't matter
where as long as he goes down. You might even live

393
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,000
Where'd you get that?

394
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
From a camel.

395
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,400
The camel's name doesn't happen
to be Pasha, does it?

396
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,600
Guys!..

397
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:11,800
-..has anyone climbed to the castle?
-Go ahead and try, there's two Guards up there.

398
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Ah, Vova-Studerwith his brown nosers.

399
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Give me a smoke.

400
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,800
Listen, Studebaker, give those back.

401
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Who do you think you're talking to? You weren't
even born when l was in prison.

402
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,700
Been on the front five times.

403
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,800
-Four.
-What?

404
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,000
Last night you said ''four''.

405
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,900
You bitch, have you decided
to count all my terms?

406
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,100
Turns out, whatever you try your hand at they
grab your sorry ass and throw you in a slammer.

407
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,300
A real made

408
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,500
You a Jew or an Armenian?

409
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,300
-A bit of both.

410
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,400
-Cut it out, Studer!
-Shut up, filthy dogs. What, are you
tired of living?

411
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,600
-And you, dirty Jew, answer me,
are you circumcised or not?
-Why don't you come take a look?

412
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,300
Take it out, take it out you uncut Jew.

413
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,400
l'll return you to the real Hasidic tradition.

414
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,400
wait a minute...

415
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,400
Tough son of a bitch.

416
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,400
What are you standing around for,
get him out of here!

417
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,900
Thank you..

418
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Why are you standing around?
Take him to the infirmary,

419
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,200
say that Vova Studer slipped...

420
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,000
on a rock, hit his head.

421
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,900
Take the rope off, idiots!

422
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,300
Still smoking?

423
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,000
Can't even breathe at this altitude, swine..

424
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,000
Are you really a Jew?

425
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,900
l call myself a Moldavian for safety.

426
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,100
Here, hold on to it.

427
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,400
Give me you hand.

428
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,600
Climb up!. Come on, Cot,
come on.

429
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,500
Go! Go! Go!

430
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,800
-You are ok?
-l can't hear anything!

431
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,800
-His ears are bleeding!
-That's ok, it happens. They'll bleed
for a bit and then they'll stop.

432
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,200
-Prince, how about you?
-What?
-Ok?

433
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,600
Yeah, seems like it. Only...
l dropped the crank, what happens now?

434
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,400
...what happens now?

435
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,700
-We'll shoot you.
-Absolutely.

436
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,300
-How are you, though?
-l think l'm whole.

437
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,800
Why is it, Prince, you're never sure:
''l think, maybe so''?

438
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Well, now, Anton Viachslavich, is a time when
you can never be completely sure.

439
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,400
-Ayoung bandit philosopher,
that's something new!
-Ok.

440
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,600
we'll considerthe task of blocking the
path done. We'll analyze mistakes back at camp.

441
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,500
lnstructors will explain the mistakes.

442
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,700
That's it for now, everyone relax!

443
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,900
Hurry up, Tiapa, Cot,

444
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,500
Studer, Babai, Gulmas,

445
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,200
Maestro,

446
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,800
-Perch.
-So, let's ride?

447
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,800
We're flying, Rabbit.

448
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,600
-So, you scared?
-Nah.

449
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,400
-Release!
-Helmets on!

450
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,800
Get up, move out,

451
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,700
get ready! Go, go,

452
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,600
go, go!

453
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:21,400
go, go!

454
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,000
Who's the packer?
Who packed the parachutes?

455
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,800
- packed them

456
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,800
-Look, his line is broken.
-Here it is!

457
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,100
Who thought of bending the pin like this!?

458
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,200
Check if there's anything on the boy linking
him to the school

459
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,700
then bury him,

460
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,600
overthere by the far guard post,

461
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,500
we won't carry him back up.

462
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,800
-Execute!

463
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,700
Yes sir! Right face, march!

464
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Who did this?

465
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:18,400
Studer, you filthy bitch
You bent the pins, fucking bastard!

466
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,300
-You bent the pins, fucking bastard!
-Calm down! Enough.

467
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,800
-Oh Maestro...

468
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,800
-he was such a great guy, you fucking killer!
-You?
-Yeah, me.

469
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,400
Why?

470
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,800
l lost at cards to him last month,

471
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,800
and you know how card debt goes to a thief.

472
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,600
-You little bitch...
-Anton Viacheslavovich, don't do it.

473
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,300
Everyone get changed, get in the cars.

474
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,500
Left face, march.

475
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,800
What should be do with the one who lost?

476
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,700
Nothing. Bury him too.

477
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,700
What do you mean, bury? He's still alive

478
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Your problem, my responsibility.

479
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Bury him.

480
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,200
You have no right without a trial, l'm a minor!

481
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,700
Hey Tiapa, you're a real bitch.
Why should l, an old sick man,

482
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,800
have to clean the weapons instead of
a young buck like you?

483
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,800
Pasha, how are you an old sick man!?

484
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,300
-No way, Cot, did you hear him?
-Shut up,

485
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,200
Last time your sub-machine gun
was covered with soot!

486
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,800
And your pistol is filthy!?

487
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,800
And what if it jams?
And what if you need it?

488
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,200
And this could happen at any second,
you understand me?

489
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,800
-Sorry Pasha, l won't do it again, l swear..

490
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,200
-You're lying, and you know why you lie?

491
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,000
-Why?
-Because you've got wind in yourfield
and smoke up your ass.

492
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,900
-Pasha, why was Anton summoned down?

493
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,300
Don't know:

494
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,000
-Was it because of the problems at the airfield?

495
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
-Nah.
-So how do you know that it wasn't
because of that? You're lying, Pasha.

496
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,000
A?

497
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,900
-You're lying, and you know why you lie?
-The less you know the longer you'll live,
understand?

498
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,400
You think?

499
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,700
The base ''Geflugelhoff'' - ''Birds' Yard.''

500
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:00,600
Runs underground for several kilometers,
elevation about two thousand meters.

501
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,200
Well protected above by ice cliffs.

502
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,200
All the entrances below are well guarded.

503
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,200
You must approach the base from the top.
There are mined ventilation shafts at the top.

504
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,100
Your goal is to destroy the cliff overhang

505
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,400
Exit routes?

506
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:31,300
There's a village nine kilometers away.
To the northwest, the forester is our man,
no dangerthere.

507
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,600
And why do you assume that their plane won't
be downed on their approach to the base?

508
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,100
We have our men there, too:

509
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Thank you, Anton Viacheslavovich,
for your great work...

510
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,800
service.

511
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,700
l serve the Soviet Union.

512
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,100
The first group to go ...

513
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,300
..should be Chernov's, l think,
the best group at your school.
'551

514
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:34,200
Forthe mission, you'll take
your regularweapons,

515
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,600
think about what else you would need
based on the details of this assignment.

516
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,100
What's on the base?

517
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,900
Fuel, all the fuel forthe Army Group West.

518
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,800
Don't spill it. Here's the base:

519
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:05,800
- this is the fuel collector, here is the command post.
And why do you think that we won't be attacked on our
approach to the base?

520
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,400
You know, when you come back, l'll introduce you
to this one recon guy, then you can ask him:

521
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,700
-We'll never get the hell out.
-When did you decide on that?

522
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,300
-That's a long way to walk back.
-Don't worry. Put your mind to it and
you'll make it. Drink yourtea.

523
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,100
Well, l'm off, thanks.

524
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,500
-How did it go?
-Drink this tea, there's sugar:

525
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,400
Tiapa, wake up, we need to talk.

526
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,800
-This can't wait 'til morning?
-We can't.

527
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,700
-We need to get out.
-Now?
-Now, now, Tiapa, wake up!

528
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,200
Our group got the first mission.

529
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,700
We'll need to get out at the transfer.
At the airfield, got it?

530
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,500
-And the guys?
-We'll see when we get there.

531
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,800
Go back to bed.

532
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,200
Kaluga's cut himself open!

533
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,400
That's Zhora's razor.

534
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,300
He all way was so special...

535
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:41,600
Go to hell:

536
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,500
Keep reading, doctor.

537
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,100
There's nothing else:

538
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,000
Go ahead and take care of this one.

539
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,100
-What's his nickname, Kaluga or something?
-That's correct, Anton Viacheslavovich, Kaluga.

540
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,300
Look up his individual file,
then write down..

541
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,700
-...his full name, details, and so on:
-Ec.

542
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,500
ln your report,

543
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,900
What are they doing?! What are
they doing, those bastards?!

544
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,500
And don't you dare call them that anymore!

545
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,600
While we are sitting up here in the
mountains, they

546
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And no one will rememberthem afterwards.

547
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,900
And we'll be training the next kids,

548
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,900
how to best get killed!

549
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,800
We're about to land. lt's now or never.

550
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,600
When we land, stay sharp.

551
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:10,600
-Where are we?
-Mari airfield, or Mary.

552
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,200
-Prepare for disembarkation.
-Hey, commander,

553
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:29,900
-maybe you can open the door? We're suffocating.
-That's not authorized
-Hey, shithead, there's no fucking airto breathe!

554
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,700
-ls that how you talk to your officers!?
-What kind of officer are you?

555
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,100
-Get out of here, go man yourwheel...!
-Babai, Driver, shut up, dirty bitches.

556
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,100
-Sorry, commander, it is pretty hot.
-We'll open it when we get off the runway.

557
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,800
Motherfuckers.

558
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,200
Be careful gay.

559
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,100
Mari airfield, or Mary.

560
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,300
Where to?

561
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,900
Overthere..

562
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,500
o.

563
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,700
What are you staring at?!

564
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,800
-Comrade General, the group, forthe especially
important mission is here. Commander in charge
is Avdeev.

565
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,800
Erofeev, what are you here?

566
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Commanding officer of a special unit,
Comrade General...

567
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,700
Then kindly explain to me
what that tatooscum was?

568
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:33,600
You're asking me?

569
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,900
-Dismissed!
-Yes sir!

570
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,200
Move!

571
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:45,600
What do you think, would they
have shot us if we ran?

572
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,200
-What?
Did you see how many there were?

573
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,400
-Hey, pilot!
-l'm not a pilot, l'm a gunner.
-l don't give a shit, call the chief.

574
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:04,900
-Not the chief, the commander.
-l'm telling you, l don't give a shit what you
call him, the group leader is asking for him!

575
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,500
-What do you need?
-How long is the flight?
-About 8 hours.

576
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:39,600
Wake us up an hour before the target
please.

577
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,600
Alright,

578
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,500
you boys should get dressed, in about five minutes
it will be freezing in here.

579
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:56,600
Get dressed!

580
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:44,200
-Why aren't you sleeping?
-Not sleeping because these bastards are guarding
us betterthan at a camp.

581
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,500
Stop worrying about it. We'll
land and make a run for it.

582
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:59,300
No we won't make a run for it, we'll die like
dogs. l told you l should have confessed
about my father being at the front,

583
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,400
they might have sent me below.

584
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,300
-What, getting scared?
-And you're not afraid of dying, huh?!

585
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:15,400
They're sending us to our deaths!
The Germans don't care, children or not.

586
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,600
Keep quiet, stop yelling.
You'll wake the boys.

587
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,300
Commander, time to release!

588
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,800
Sergeich, stay on course,

589
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,900
l'll release them myself.

590
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,500
-What's this?
-l was ordered to give this to you
before the jump.

591
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:49,400
Boys, listen to Anton's orders:
Tiapa and l jump first,
you follow ten seconds later,

592
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:54,200
we'll meet at the target.

593
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,900
-Start, Cot!
-Man, you're the boss.

594
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,400
You should eat something.

595
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,800
Nah, l don't want to.

596
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,100
There they are.

597
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,800
What'd you hang that up for?

598
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:41,200
When the boys come back, we'll
put them in clean clothes.

599
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,500
We're not going anywhere!
Those fucks will answerfor our buddies!

600
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:57,700
Did you see how they used them as a distraction
so we could get in? l'll go back
and kill all of them!

601
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,100
Poor boys, but who got us in?!

602
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,900
Bitches got us, put us exactly
where they wanted!

603
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:17,900
Before we left, l asked Anton if our guys get
behind theirfront lines then the Germans
have theirs as well?

604
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,100
-What'd he say?
-Nothing,

605
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,500
probably didn't want to upset me.

606
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:40,400
-Great.
-lf we destroy that rock, they'll
pay forthe boys.

607
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,800
-We won't destroy it.
-Why's that?

608
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,800
We won't destroy it, we don't
have enough dynamite.

609
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,800
Alright, let's climb down, then we can decide.

610
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:40,300
They were just kids:What are we doing..

611
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:02,200
-What's overthere?
-Nothing.

612
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:18,500
Empty...

613
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:03,600
-Based on the map, the fuel collector is here.
-Well, look at that, you memorized it!

614
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,900
Here.

615
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,500
l don't understand, why kids?

616
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,800
Urragh!

617
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,700
Yes! Yes! Yes!!!

618
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Tiapa, mine!!!

619
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:01,400
-Needs streptocidum..
-l've already used some:

620
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,800
-maybe we should look below?
-Look forwhat?

621
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,800
What?

622
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,800
My hand, that's what, my hand!

623
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,400
How'd it happen, Tiapa?

624
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,600
Probably a shard of the mine, l think.

625
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,500
Don't worry, l stopped the bleeding.

626
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Let's rest for a couple of hours.
Then we'll go down.

627
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:38,100
-We need to surrender.
-Uh huh,

628
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:50,200
- l wanted to ask you, Cot,
did you ever have a girl?

629
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:59,700
-No
-Me too, but l have seen, once.
-Lucky.

630
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:07,900
-Tiapa, now listen. Go down to the valley.
-Why?

631
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:13,600
The two of us won't be able to make it
down by ourselves.

632
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,300
understand?

633
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:21,200
Relax Cot, you just have some kind
of fever right now.

634
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,300
Go, l'm telling you,

635
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,000
stop wasting time.

636
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:54,600
CA-AAA-AAT!

637
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
-Why did we come here?
-He's searching for his friend.

638
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:50,200
-Here?
-30 years we've been coming,

639
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,900
every year, May 9th.

640
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Cot,

641
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:25,400
it's hard enough to breathe up here,
and here you are, smoking!

642
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,400
-Cot
-Tiapa

643
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:39,800
Well, we meet again,

644
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:44,200
Tiapkin

645
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:48,100
Valentin Petrovich.
