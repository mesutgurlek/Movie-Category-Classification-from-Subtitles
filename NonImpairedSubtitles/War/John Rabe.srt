1
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,665
Good morning.

2
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,499
Morning. Back to work.

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,915
November 27, 1937.

4
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,124
They say the Japanese
razed Shanghai to the ground.

5
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,124
I just don't want to believe that.

6
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,457
Typical Chinese propaganda.
AlI is quiet here in Nanking.

7
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,832
Except for a few
who are running scared.

8
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:41,457
l hope our leaving doesn't
make it seem like l'm backing out too.

9
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,582
But shouId l go around

10
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,249
telIing everyone
I've been promoted to director?

11
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,082
And was called to Berlin?
Of course not.

12
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,832
Put me through to John Rabe.

13
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,499
But still.
my heart bleeds at the thought

14
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,790
of leaving this alI behind
after so many years.

15
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,832
Hello, Rabe household.

16
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,290
No, no, no. That won't work.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,082
You've got to tilt the piano.

18
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,249
What are you doing? Tilt it.

19
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,582
-l'm telling you, it won't fit.
-Well, it went in.

20
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,999
-Yes, 20 years ago.
-l suppose the piano grew since then?

21
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,040
Put it down, put it down.

22
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,457
My God,
these idiots are good for nothing.

23
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,624
December1. 1937.

24
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,332
A Iarge Japanese force lies in wait.

25
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,290
just 70 km off Nanking.

26
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,832
So says Chang, my Chinese driver.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,915
He won't say who told him.

28
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,999
All the same,
we're off in two days.

29
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,040
Japanese or no Japanese.

30
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:49,540
Though it wouIdn't be bad if Japan
gained more infIuence in China.

31
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,374
After all,
they are aIlies of the Reich.

32
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,082
-What about the hat?
-l loved that hat.

33
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,415
-We agreed, everything we haven't...
-Yes, fine. Get rid of it.

34
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,832
-Do you still need insulin?
-No, l've got enough.

35
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,790
When l'm dead.

36
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,207
l know, then l can read your diary.
But not before.

37
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,832
l think l'll outlive you
out of sheer curiosity.

38
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,582
That's my tactic.

39
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,040
Boss!

40
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,290
Chang! How many times? Knock first.

41
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,790
-But boss...
-For God's sake!

42
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,124
We knock in this house.
Now get out.

43
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,957
How can someone be so dumb.

44
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,874
-There was a knock.
-l heard it, but he has to learn.

45
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,915
We leave in two days.

46
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:48,040
-lt's the principle of the thing.
-Come in.

47
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,749
Just has arrived Herr Fliess.

48
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,374
What? Here already?

49
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,457
Couldn't he call first.

50
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,499
He call.

51
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,582
But you not have time when l tell.

52
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,082
Chang,
what's the point in you having a head?

53
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,374
Well, so that...

54
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:15,082
So that it not rain into my neck.

55
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,165
Quite right.

56
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,249
Herr Fliess.

57
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,832
l'm John Rabe. Welcome to Nanking.

58
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,832
-Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.

59
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,040
Hope you had a good journey.

60
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,999
This is Herr Han.
He is my deputy, soon to be yours.

61
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,957
Heil Hitler.

62
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,082
Welcome to Nanking.

63
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,540
Heil Hitler.

64
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,790
You wouldn't believe
how long they took to learn that.

65
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,249
Not long enough it seems.
He's saluting with his left hand.

66
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,874
Not the left.

67
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,249
Right hand. Right hand!
That's it.

68
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,165
The Chinese are like children.

69
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,749
You have to teach them,
but they do what they're told.

70
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:10,874
You have to be able to spot
a good Chinaman right away.

71
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,874
You have to see it at first glance.

72
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,374
That, for example,
is a good Chinaman.

73
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,290
Those are our W-923 systems.

74
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,582
We provide
for the whole province of Jiangsu.

75
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,499
Over 15 million people.

76
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,082
The population is growing so rapidly

77
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,457
that we'll hit our capacity soon
without the dam.

78
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,915
How does it feel
to be returning home after so long?

79
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,582
Siemens sends me to China,
so l go to China.

80
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,374
Siemens wants me in Berlin,
so l'm off to Berlin.

81
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,082
lt sounds as if you'd rather stay.

82
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,999
That's the control unit
for the system.

83
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,207
You could call it
the heart of the plant.

84
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,707
lmpressive,
what you've built up here, Rabe.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,707
But so much work,
just for the Chinese?

86
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,040
For Siemens.
ln a few years we'll make millions.

87
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,790
You haven't been told?

88
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:24,082
Rabe, Germany is taking a new course.
And so is Siemens.

89
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,790
What's that supposed to mean?

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,915
There isn't going to be a dam.

91
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,499
Siemens Nanking is to be phased out.

92
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,999
What the hell!

93
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,707
We've wiped out the Chinese here.

94
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,957
Our armored divisions

95
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,332
are proceeding to the west.

96
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,749
We are now preparing
to advance on Nanking.

97
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,957
Who is leading the advance?

98
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,207
Major Ose, Your lmperial Highness.

99
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,165
A great undertaking
for such a young man?

100
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,249
Yes, sir.

101
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,040
But young men
are capable of great deeds too.

102
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,665
Your report, Major.

103
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,374
This is our position.

104
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,207
My troops
are joining the 33rd lnfantry.

105
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,457
And
Lieutenant Yanagawa's Sixth Division.

106
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,540
We will surround Nanking
from three sides and close ranks.

107
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,624
This way
we will avoid significant losses

108
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,290
and force the city to surrender.

109
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,040
Major.

110
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,957
Have you ever
taken part in an elephant hunt?

111
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,540
No, Your Highness.

112
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,624
You don't encircle an elephant,

113
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,249
wear it out or force it to surrender.

114
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,832
Either you kill it,
or it will kill you.

115
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,624
ls that clear.

116
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,165
Dora?

117
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,749
My God! What are you doing in here?

118
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,165
-What are you doing in here?
-Back to bed, it's a surprise.

119
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,249
Have l forgotten
my own birthday or what?

120
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,290
l know how hard it is for you
to leave everything here.

121
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,999
You don't know that.

122
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,249
Okay, perhaps l don't.

123
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,749
But l do know
nobody could have done a better job.

124
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,499
Nobody.

125
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,082
And that's why l made you this cake.

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,874
-Gugelhupf.
-Gugelhupf.

127
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,957
Shujuan, a little to the left.

128
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,249
Welcome to the Nanking NS group.

129
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,499
l'm Krüger, group president.

130
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,957
l'll introduce you to the others.

131
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,957
This way, please.

132
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:01,290
-And that's mine, gentlemen.
-l'll get you next time, l swear.

133
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,165
This is the NS group?

134
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,165
We're not all here yet, but...
Gentlemen!

135
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,415
And what is that?

136
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,249
Bernd.

137
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,290
No, leave it. l'll do it.

138
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,999
We share the room with the...

139
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,040
With the English Veterans Club.

140
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,665
How dare you...

141
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,624
-Hello everybody!
-That's Hans.

142
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,582
Ah, you must be the new one?
Hans Scheel, baker by trade.

143
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,249
Please excuse my tardiness.

144
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,457
But l brought you something.

145
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,957
Cinnamon rolls. They're still warm!

146
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,915
That's unbelievable.

147
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,332
Did you really join the Pa¤

148
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,207
to eat pastries
under a photo of the King of England?

149
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,499
No! We have talks too.

150
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,374
The conditions you tolerate here
are scandalous.

151
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:59,374
And that is the flag we sent you
for the Party's anniversary?

152
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,332
You haven't even opened it.

153
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,832
We'd need to build a tower,
it's so big.

154
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,415
lf you were real National Socialists,

155
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,790
you would have done just that.

156
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,207
Here too.

157
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,415
Why's that, Dr. Xu?

158
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,957
To pull out now
would be a terrible mistake.

159
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,040
China is the market of the future.
We'll regret it forever.

160
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,290
There is no war yet,
and if the Japanese do come,

161
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,082
then they'll need electricity too,
probably more than the Chinese.

162
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,457
You can't close Nanking
without asking me.

163
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,707
l set the whole thing up myself.

164
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,415
Herr Lehmann, l...

165
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,374
Herr Lehmann?

166
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:54,082
-They're closing Nanking down.
-They can't do that.

167
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,082
They can.

168
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,290
They haven't promoted me.

169
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,332
They kicked me upstairs.

170
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,124
They tricked me.

171
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,749
And the dam...

172
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,082
lt would have been my legacy.

173
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,457
And then that Fliess comes along.

174
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:22,207
-That awful little cretin.
-John, John.

175
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,290
Look at me, please.

176
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,040
This is our last night.
Let nobody spoil it.

177
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,957
Not Fliess, not Siemens
not the Japanese.

178
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,374
And certainly not you.

179
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,165
Your Excellency. What an honor.

180
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,124
-What a toady.
-Fukuda?

181
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,957
l have always liked him.

182
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,790
You've had no dealings with him.

183
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,040
l wonder what awaits us in Berlin.

184
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,124
Christmas.

185
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,957
Café Kranzler.

186
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,832
Marzipanstollen.
Mulled wine on the Ku'damm.

187
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,749
A daily newspaper
you can actually read.

188
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,749
Proper bread and butter.

189
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,499
And beds that aren't too short.

190
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,749
Did you know
that you're still the man l love?

191
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,332
Even after 27 years.

192
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,124
Yes, l do know that.

193
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,165
You conceited thing!

194
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,957
Dora! Dora!

195
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,582
Everybody out! Get out of the room!

196
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,874
Out!

197
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:44,999
Open the gate!

198
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,665
Open it! Open the gate!

199
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,290
Go, go, go!

200
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,999
Come on! Quick!

201
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,374
Han!

202
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,415
Which idiot had the gate closed?

203
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,415
That idiot would be me.

204
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,707
Open the gate!

205
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,874
-Keep it closed.
-They're our workers.

206
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,457
They'll be killed!

207
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,915
-My concern is the plant.
-No... Not yet.

208
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,832
Open the gate!

209
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,749
Dora, you take the women and children.

210
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,665
Come on! Quick, quick!

211
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,415
Quick! Come on! That way!

212
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,457
You're going to regret this, Rabe.

213
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,082
l'll be happy to regret this.

214
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,082
Women and children! Quick!

215
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,790
Come on! This way!

216
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,832
Rabe!

217
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,749
l swear...

218
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,082
Where's the flag?

219
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,165
-What for?
-The flag, damn you!

220
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,707
lt's in the trunk of the car.

221
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,832
Han!
Turn the floodlight on! Full power!

222
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,790
-Are you mad?
-Do it!

223
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,290
-Chang, come here!
-Yes, boss!

224
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,624
Over there! Quick!

225
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,124
Everyone, under the flag!

226
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,040
Come on, run! This way. Quick!

227
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,457
Come on!

228
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,957
Come on! Quick!

229
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:14,624
They're going away.

230
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:23,040
We did it.

231
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,874
They're leaving.

232
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:31,790
They're leaving!

233
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,707
There are just too many to cope with!

234
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,707
Nine shot in the stomach.

235
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,999
One in the head.
Three are dying. Four amputations...

236
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,124
Enough. Crying won't help.

237
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,124
-Where is Dr. Xu?
-He's not here.

238
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,915
Lucky they only hit the guard house.

239
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:38,749
l want this hole filled in.
And get the grounds cleaned up.

240
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,124
Han, check the plant for damage

241
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,790
and check the turbine functions.

242
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:47,124
l want a report
sent to Shanghai and Berlin today.

243
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,832
Yes, sir.

244
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,082
-Chang.
-Yes?

245
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,415
You're to reinforce the sheds

246
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,749
to make provisional shelter.

247
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,624
ls that clear?

248
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,874
Boss, l'm driver.

249
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,999
And without shelter

250
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,374
you'll be a dead driver soon.

251
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,707
Herr Fliess.

252
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,832
Stop. Stop the car.

253
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:20,499
Close the gate! Close it!

254
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:34,374
The early bird catches the worm, eh?

255
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,457
Get out of the car.

256
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,915
-Open the trunk.
-Herr Rabe.

257
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:53,582
May l remind you,
you had your send-off yesterday.

258
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:57,499
You're talking to the new director
of Siemens Nanking.

259
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:01,040
-l don't remember handing over.
-Don't worry.

260
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,249
You've been busy enough
with your move.

261
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:08,332
What are your plans
as the new director?

262
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,665
Considering
what we witnessed yesterday,

263
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,957
the plant
will have to be closed immediately.

264
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,332
And what about the workers?

265
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,415
They will be contacted.

266
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:23,540
-Should we resume business.
-Do you have everything?

267
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:27,790
-Files? Accounting books? Contracts?
-No need to worry.

268
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,582
German efficiency.

269
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,790
A good plan, Herr Fliess.

270
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,957
lt's just a pity your contract
doesn't start until the sixth.

271
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,249
The day after tomorrow.

272
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,790
lf you doubt me, look in the trunk.

273
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:43,374
The contract must be with the papers.

274
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,332
German efficiency.

275
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,582
That may be so.

276
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,374
-But you have no say here anymore.
-You're right, indeed.

277
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,457
And you have no say here, yet.

278
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,915
But somebody has to have a say here,
don't you think?

279
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,499
Han?

280
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,082
Han.

281
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:13,040
Tell him to open the car trunk.

282
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:18,665
Herr Fliess,
would you please open the car trunk?

283
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:34,290
And now tell him
that for insurance purposes alone,

284
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:38,332
his access to the company grounds
must be restricted.

285
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:42,249
He'll stay in the guest apartment.
Staff will look after him.

286
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,999
-Herr Fliess...
-Don't bother.

287
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,124
Herr Fliess.

288
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,082
The apartment is over there.

289
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,749
l'm sorry.

290
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,165
lf the Führer knew
the people they send here...

291
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,165
lt's just ridiculous.

292
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,415
l know you mean well.
But let it rest, please.

293
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,415
Someone has to look after it.

294
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,874
-Someone, but not you.
-As long as l'm here, l will.

295
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:34,707
-And where are my fried eggs?
-You can look after them yourself.

296
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,749
December 4. 1937.

297
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:43,832
As the Japanese shelIs
tear through the sky overhead,

298
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:48,040
I open the gates
and let in all who come to us.

299
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,249
Women and children crouch

300
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:56,082
under the huge German fIag,
with terror in their eyes.

301
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,915
The flag is said to be bombproof.

302
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:02,082
The Japanese
are faithful allies indeed.

303
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,332
They hoId their fire
as soon as they see our flag.

304
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,457
Very honorable.

305
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:15,332
Hurry up there!
Come on! Quickly!

306
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,957
What is all this?

307
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,957
The refugees can't stay
in the front yard.

308
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,540
That's company grounds.
l'd need permission.

309
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,874
So they're staying in our yard?

310
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:32,332
Yes, exactly.
They're staying in our yard.

311
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:38,749
This way. Bring it over this way.

312
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,540
"The Japanese soldiers
are your friends!"

313
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:01,582
The Chinese took the bait.
lnform headquarters.

314
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,749
Congratulations, Major.

315
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,207
You'll make
an excellent commander one day.

316
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,499
But l ask myself,

317
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,207
why is it that l give orders
not to take prisoners,

318
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,749
and you arrive with thousands?

319
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,374
Please forgive me.

320
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,624
-Your Highness.
-l didn't ask you to speak!

321
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,665
So, Major.

322
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,665
What do you propose?

323
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,499
Your Highness.

324
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,082
lt would be extremely difficult

325
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,040
to execute that many prisoners.

326
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,832
ls that so?

327
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,790
Furthermore,

328
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,874
l believe such executions

329
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:28,124
could be considered to be illegal.

330
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,832
lllegal?

331
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,540
l am entrusting you personally

332
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,665
with resolving
this matter once and for all.

333
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:43,457
l want no prisoner
alive by tomorrow morning.

334
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,624
We will also shell the city center.

335
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,957
Nanking must experience
the superiority of our troops.

336
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,707
Attention!

337
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,207
On your feet!

338
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:05,832
Now you are going
to get warm soup to eat.

339
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,332
December 5. 1937.

340
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,290
I never thought that a single day

341
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:41,165
could have changed my life compIeteIy.

342
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:45,290
To stay or to go.

343
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,415
To pIay the hero or steal away.

344
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,790
And what shall l tell Dora?

345
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,540
You're not asleep.

346
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,540
Neither are you.

347
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:28,415
The difference is, l can't sleep.
You don't want to.

348
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:34,082
Tell me what thoughts are inside
that head of yours, John Rabe.

349
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,207
What life holds
for those poor devils outside.

350
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,624
You think everyone is like you.

351
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:47,790
Those poor devils
out there in your yard

352
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,124
are just happy to be in your yard.

353
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:53,874
They're happy
about what you pity them for.

354
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,374
l am the way l am.

355
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,707
l know.

356
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,707
Do you remember,

357
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,665
27 years ago,

358
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,582
what we promised one another?

359
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,374
Remind me how old was l back then?

360
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:54,999
19.

361
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,124
Yes, l remember.

362
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,040
And?

363
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:17,415
Now and forever, come what may.

364
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,832
And do you still mean it?

365
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,582
The statute of limitations may be up.

366
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:29,165
But yes, l mean it,

367
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,374
now and forever,

368
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:36,040
come what may.

369
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:54,624
This way.

370
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,749
Quick, come on.

371
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,290
Keep moving!

372
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,749
Stay with me, Dora.

373
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,665
Did you really
have to bring that damn bird?

374
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,582
Just stay with me.

375
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,749
Out of the way! Get out of the way!

376
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,874
Let me through. Just let me through!

377
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:17,290
Stop!

378
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:37,582
You're not coming.

379
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:51,124
Take care of yourself.

380
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,624
l love you.

381
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,790
l'll come later.

382
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,040
Dora!

383
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,415
Boss.

384
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,540
Go on. l'm staying here.

385
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,165
lt's too dangerous.

386
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:13,332
Han, l know you mean well.

387
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:19,832
lf l'm hit, all the better.
lf not, then so be it.

388
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,165
Now go, before l get angry.

389
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:07,290
December11, 1937.

390
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:11,207
Suddenly. peopIe are flooding

391
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:13,874
the gates of our zone
by the thousands.

392
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:17,165
News of the zone
must have spread Iike wiIdfire.

393
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:20,749
We can hardly handle the influx.

394
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:24,290
Even the Japanese ambassador.

395
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,165
Mr. Fukuda.
has given our zone his approval.

396
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,249
December13, 1937.

397
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:29,540
We're stilI transporting rice in
from outside of the city.

398
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:32,207
The zone needs flour. salt. firewood,

399
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:34,499
medicine. utensils and blankets

400
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,707
before the Japanese get here.

401
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,915
We have to be weIl prepared,

402
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,915
for we'll be cut off from the world.

403
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,707
The Japanese
have 600 pIanes in Shanghai.

404
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,582
As well as armored divisions
and an enormous army.

405
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:53,457
If an army
of that size attacks Nanking.

406
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,499
they mean to raze it.

407
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:58,832
But perhaps this is mere chiId's play

408
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:01,207
compared to what a new world war

409
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,665
would mean in Europe.

410
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:11,374
The Chinese soldiers who haven't left
are posted at the main city gate.

411
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:14,499
They want to defend Nanking,
at all costs.

412
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:17,999
A compIeteIy pointIess
and futile venture.

413
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:27,749
Why have you ended the siege
and begun to attack the city?

414
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,499
Forgive me, General.

415
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,415
Answer my question, Major!

416
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:38,332
His lmperial Highness gave the order.

417
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,332
Lieutenant General... your report!

418
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,374
My nephew, the Emperor,

419
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:52,832
wants a swift victory.

420
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:55,040
A modern war.

421
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:57,624
One that shows Japan's superiority.

422
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,415
The advance can't be stopped.

423
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:02,665
Tonight we will attack Nanking.

424
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,749
Hello? Hello?

425
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:18,915
What's going on here?

426
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,290
-What's going on?
-The lines are down.

427
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,582
Then do something. Fix them.

428
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:35,457
And set up lines to the exchange.
Lives are at stake.

429
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:06,582
Send news: Nanking has fallen.

430
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,790
Out of the way!

431
01:01:54,416 --> 01:02:12,540
Get out of here!

432
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:19,915
Quick! Quick!

433
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,165
Shut up!

434
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,957
What are you doing here?

435
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,040
-Search in there.
-Yes, sir!

436
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:08,082
Two of you search that room.

437
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:14,332
Check it.

438
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,582
We found him.

439
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:40,707
Onwards.

440
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,832
December15, 1937.

441
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:23,457
Feeding the zone's 200.000 peopIe

442
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:25,707
is getting ever more difficult.

443
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:28,290
Our various appeals to the Japanese

444
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,540
to allow more rice into the zone

445
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:32,790
have remained unanswered.

446
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:45,749
We alI hope the dipIomats
wiIl return to Nanking soon.

447
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:49,290
Rosen believes onIy
an international presence

448
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,749
wilI curb Japanese aggression.

449
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:36,832
-Forward!
-Forward!

450
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,082
Attention!

451
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:43,415
To the prisoners camp, march!

452
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,624
December19, 1937.

453
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,790
Bodies Iie in piIes before the gates.

454
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,915
The Japanese won't touch them.

455
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:04,665
And we aren't allowed to do so.

456
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:08,999
We Europeans
are paralyzed from the shock.

457
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:11,457
The executions are rampant.

458
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:14,499
Sometimes
with machine guns at the barracks.

459
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:18,249
At the Army Ministry.
And down by the river.

460
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:28,582
To the Führer of the German people.
Chancellor Adolf Hitler.

461
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:32,707
My Führer.

462
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:36,249
As a Ioyal party member
and upstanding German.

463
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:39,124
I turn to you in a time of great need.

464
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,082
The Japanese Imperial troops

465
01:13:44,416 --> 01:13:48,457
conquered the city of Nanking
on December12, 1937.

466
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,707
Since then l have witnessed

467
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:55,915
atrocious crimes against civilians.

468
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:02,499
PIease heIp to end this catastrophe,

469
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,624
and make an appeaI
to our Japanese alIies

470
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,499
in the name of humanity.

471
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,957
With a German salute.

472
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:15,874
Your Highness, his wife survived.
She is in Shanghai.

473
01:17:56,625 --> 01:17:59,290
You have to stay in the car.

474
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:04,040
l don't understand Japanese.

475
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,457
Get back in the car.

476
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:09,290
Should l get in the car?

477
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:11,207
l said back in the car!

478
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:13,665
l could get back in the car.

479
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:15,707
Take your hat off.

480
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:18,082
Take your hat off!

481
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,374
Damn it.

482
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:26,082
Move on! Move on!

483
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:54,874
Boss! Boss!

484
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:57,624
l'm in here!

485
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,790
-Have them line up.
-Yes, sir.

486
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:07,290
Everybody stand up
and get into a line!

487
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:10,040
Stand up! Go over there!

488
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:12,665
Quickly! Quickly!

489
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:14,915
Quickly!

490
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:54,999
-Ask if anybody speaks German.
-Yes, sir.

491
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:58,249
Raise your hand if you speak German.

492
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:12,957
-Front and center.
-Yes, sir.

493
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:15,374
Come to the front!

494
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,499
Do you understand me?

495
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:43,790
Say something.

496
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:47,207
Just say something. Anything.

497
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:49,915
Say something.

498
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:49,290
You.

499
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,999
Children? You.

500
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:02,207
You.

501
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:20,040
December 21, 1937.

502
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:24,165
We're cut off from the outside wo¤d.

503
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:27,499
No post, teIegrams
or calls can reach us.

504
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:29,749
Nothing works anymore.

505
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:33,332
I never thought
I'd have to put a vaIue on human life.

506
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,957
weighing one against another.

507
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:37,999
ls it better

508
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:41,915
to hand over a few hundred soldiers
to protect the zone.

509
01:31:42,083 --> 01:31:44,790
not knowing if it wilI heIp at aIl?

510
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,624
Or to stand one's ground?

511
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:52,790
There is no answer.

512
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,290
Hi.

513
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:17,082
How did your hair get so short?

514
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:20,124
Got cut off.

515
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:32,915
Where is she then?

516
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:36,332
-Who is it?
-Where's the girl?

517
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:38,999
-ls she in here?
-Who?

518
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:43,290
-There's no girl here!
-What are you blathering about?

519
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:55,124
-What did l tell you?
-You were right!

520
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:57,874
Nice haircut.

521
01:33:58,583 --> 01:34:00,124
Come on then.

522
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:04,082
Just you wait.

523
01:34:04,416 --> 01:34:06,249
Who do you think you are?

524
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:12,124
Not so fast.

525
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:19,207
-Spread her legs.
-Just calm down.

526
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:21,624
Just calm down.

527
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:25,249
Keep her still, will you!

528
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,582
Keep quiet.

529
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:56,374
Be quiet there!

530
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:59,790
Quiet! Stop there!

531
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:09,374
We're Germans.

532
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:12,207
Germans. We're Germans.

533
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,207
Help me out here, damn it!

534
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:17,999
Heil...Shitler.

535
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:20,999
Heil Shitler.

536
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:24,040
-That's not funny.
-We got through.

537
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:27,499
All the same,
he is the Führer of the German people.

538
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:30,707
And shall l tell you
what l don't find funny?

539
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:32,415
Yes, what is it?

540
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:34,457
lt also concerns

541
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:36,374
the so-called Führer.

542
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:39,999
-Listen here...
-Friedrich Rosen, my father.

543
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:44,582
An ambassador and foreign minister,
forced to flee and die in China.

544
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:47,124
Simply because my grandfather,

545
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:49,832
Beethoven's best friend, no less,
happened to be Jewish.

546
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:54,582
My father couldn't die
in the country he always lived for.

547
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,999
That's not funny.
Nor is my position as secretary.

548
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:00,707
After years as embassy councillor.

549
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:03,040
l should be glad to even be alive.

550
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:05,249
Do you think that's funny?

551
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:08,999
Heil Shitler.

552
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:25,499
Why do we have to bury him?

553
01:36:25,833 --> 01:36:27,582
lt's our duty.

554
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:30,249
l hated him.
And you hated him too.

555
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:32,165
He is still our father.

556
01:36:32,583 --> 01:36:35,749
Not being buried
is like dying a second time.

557
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:38,082
Well, he deserves it.

558
01:36:43,041 --> 01:36:45,082
Hold the candle.

559
01:37:05,916 --> 01:37:08,457
l hated him.

560
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:12,415
Forgive him.

561
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:25,749
He has orders to fill the hole
to make the road passable.

562
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:28,874
-With corpses?
-lt looks like it.

563
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:37,874
Are you all right?

564
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:41,332
Yes, l'm fine. Don't worry.

565
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:45,207
An officer.

566
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,749
Lieutenant.

567
01:38:59,916 --> 01:39:02,415
These people are hindering our work.

568
01:39:16,375 --> 01:39:17,749
Come on!

569
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,624
Listen, we have to split up.

570
01:39:40,958 --> 01:39:43,874
Run in there. Quick!

571
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:16,790
lt's me, Langshu.

572
01:40:37,916 --> 01:40:39,874
Ssh! lt's me, Langshu.

573
01:40:43,458 --> 01:40:47,540
-Quick! Help me!
-lnto the stove!

574
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:50,374
-Search from top to bottom.
-Yes, sir!

575
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:03,415
Quick, get into bed!

576
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:23,457
-Wait outside.
-Yes, sir.

577
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:00,040
Onwards!

578
01:45:29,875 --> 01:45:33,124
December 23, 1937.

579
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:35,040
Tomorrow is Christmas.

580
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,790
We're at the end of our rope.

581
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,957
We can't maintain
the zone much Ionger.

582
01:45:43,791 --> 01:45:46,999
I used to say. "Never stop.

583
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,332
it wiIl stop on its own."

584
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:52,415
And that
will have to hold true even now.

585
01:45:57,541 --> 01:46:01,290
l've decided
to Ieave our savings to the zone.

586
01:46:01,625 --> 01:46:03,540
What eIse are they good for?

587
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:07,290
Now that Dora is no Ionger with us.

588
01:49:04,166 --> 01:49:07,124
December 24, 1937.

589
01:49:09,333 --> 01:49:13,499
l've celebrated every Christmas
with Dora for nearly 30 years.

590
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:17,874
With a Christmas tree.
And Christmas goose.

591
01:49:19,083 --> 01:49:21,249
And Dora's famous Gugelhupf cake.

592
01:49:23,666 --> 01:49:27,624
I don't regret staying behind.
We have saved a lot of lives.

593
01:49:29,583 --> 01:49:32,124
But I haven't words for my grief.

594
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:28,415
We have been questioning
some girls from the college.

595
01:52:28,583 --> 01:52:32,540
Hundreds of soldiers
are being hidden there.

596
01:52:32,833 --> 01:52:35,999
We could close the security zone.

597
01:52:37,208 --> 01:52:39,832
So what are you waiting for?

598
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,874
The zone must be cleared

599
01:52:48,166 --> 01:52:49,999
before the diplomats

600
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:53,749
and the press return to Nanking.

601
01:52:53,875 --> 01:52:56,540
Or the whole world will hear about it.

602
01:52:56,958 --> 01:52:58,499
That's an order!

603
01:56:34,083 --> 01:56:37,290
December 25, 1937.

604
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,082
News that Prince Asaka
wants to clear the zone

605
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:43,624
did not take Iong to get around.

606
01:56:43,791 --> 01:56:47,332
Hundreds of people
have gathered outside the zone

607
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:49,790
to block the entrance.

608
01:56:50,208 --> 01:56:54,082
They're prepared to risk their Iives
to defend the zone.

609
01:56:54,291 --> 01:56:56,415
Their time is up.

610
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:58,582
Clear the zone, damn it!

611
01:56:59,875 --> 01:57:02,624
Reinforcements?
For what, exactly?

612
01:57:02,958 --> 01:57:05,290
This is ridiculous.

613
01:57:40,583 --> 01:57:42,290
Reinforcements for what?

614
01:57:53,416 --> 01:57:58,832
Battle order!

615
01:58:04,625 --> 01:58:06,665
-Load.
-Load!

616
01:58:22,875 --> 01:58:24,540
-Aim.
-Aim!

617
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:52,374
Your Highness, let us shoot.

618
01:59:45,708 --> 01:59:47,832
Aim!

619
02:00:39,666 --> 02:00:41,790
Stand down.

620
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:45,332
-Stand down!
-Yes, sir!

621
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:51,249
Unload your weapons!

622
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:55,457
Order arms!

623
02:00:58,041 --> 02:01:00,499
To the left!

624
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:05,124
Quick march!

625
02:01:35,916 --> 02:01:39,082
December 29, 1937.

626
02:01:39,458 --> 02:01:43,790
ln front of the diplomats
Prince Asaka acknowIedged the zone.

627
02:01:43,958 --> 02:01:46,874
But this victory was the end of us.

628
02:01:47,208 --> 02:01:49,999
The committee was forced to step down.

629
02:01:50,166 --> 02:01:54,332
We handed over most of our photos
and films to the Japanese.

630
02:01:54,750 --> 02:01:56,999
who destroyed them before our eyes.

631
02:01:57,416 --> 02:01:59,249
And l...

632
02:01:59,416 --> 02:02:02,207
l have to leave the city today.

633
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:04,749
But I wiIl see Dora again.

634
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:07,874
lt almost seems like a miracle.

635
02:02:08,041 --> 02:02:09,832
The struggle is over.

636
02:05:03,583 --> 02:05:04,749
Thank you.

637
02:05:10,041 --> 02:05:11,249
Good luck.

638
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:34,290
Clear out!

639
02:05:58,458 --> 02:06:00,249
Rabe is coming!

640
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:23,749
Goodbye! Goodbye!

641
02:07:37,875 --> 02:07:39,915
Far more than 200,000 people

642
02:07:40,333 --> 02:07:43,915
survived the Rape of Nanjing
in the protection of the Safety Zone.

643
02:07:44,333 --> 02:07:47,874
Nevertheless the number of victims
was staggering.

644
02:07:48,291 --> 02:07:52,040
Censuses revealed that at least
300,000 people were killed.

645
02:07:54,708 --> 02:07:57,332
Until the present day
the Japanese government

646
02:07:57,750 --> 02:08:00,790
has refused to officially acknowledge
the extent of the Rape of Nanjing.

647
02:08:03,916 --> 02:08:05,499
On his return to Germany,

648
02:08:05,916 --> 02:08:08,749
John Rabe was arrested as
a suspected collaborator of the Chinese.

649
02:08:09,166 --> 02:08:11,874
He was forbidden to report
on his experiences in Nanjing.

650
02:08:12,291 --> 02:08:15,082
His diaries were confiscated and
only rediscovered 60 years later.

651
02:08:16,125 --> 02:08:18,207
After the war

652
02:08:18,625 --> 02:08:22,457
John Rabe was at first refused
denazification by the Allies.

653
02:08:22,875 --> 02:08:26,582
Forgotten and impoverished,
he died in Berlin in 1950.

654
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:52,832
Based on true events

655
02:09:54,708 --> 02:09:58,165
