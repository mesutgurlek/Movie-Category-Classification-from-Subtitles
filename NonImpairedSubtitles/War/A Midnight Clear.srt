1
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,299
It's too hot.

2
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,767
When I get back,
I'm gonna put it...

3
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,508
Mother?

4
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,068
Mother's the oldest
in our squad.

5
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:38,015
He just had his 26th birthday, and
two days later his baby was born dead.

6
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,018
We call him Mother... Wilkins...

7
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,384
because he's always hounding us
for being sloppy, bugging us...

8
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,389
about leaving things around.

9
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,900
They're a little bent.

10
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,776
You want me
to turn you in, Vance?

11
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,713
Between the stuff you did
and the stuff I make up...

12
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:21,658
I could at least get you
to a psychiatrist in some hospital.

13
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,560
Couldn't fool anybody.

14
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,430
Wouldn't let me do
all this shit.

15
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,642
Only you were here.

16
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,713
Doesn't really count.

17
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,880
You sure fooled me, Mother.
I'll tell you that.

18
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,153
You also broke a squad rule.

19
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,885
What rule?

20
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,893
Well, you said "shit."

21
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,724
What would Father say?

22
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,098
Father Mundy invented our squad
'no obscenity"rule.

23
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,108
We wanna make it clear
we're not actually part of this army.

24
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,141
Yes, we have a squad father too.

25
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,375
Mother Wilkins, Father Mundy.

26
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,950
Father Mundy was gonna be a priest,
but never made it through the seminary.

27
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,553
The next guard was taken by Bud Miller,
our mad mechanical genius...

28
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,894
and resident wit...

29
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,765
and Stan Shutzer,
our avengingJewish angel.

30
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,703
They're supposed to be 12 in
Intelligence and Reconnaissance squads.

31
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,970
Ours is down to six.

32
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,614
Mel Avakian,
our best remaining soldier...

33
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,708
became corporal to our squad
at the same time I made sergeant.

34
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,946
It wasn't
for anything we did.

35
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,989
Except stay alive.

36
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,423
He hasn't sewn on
his stripes either.

37
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,156
Our regimental commander
is Major Griffiin.

38
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,791
Griffiin was a mortician
in civilian life.

39
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,062
His main passion now
seems to be generating business...

40
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,468
for his army counterparts.

41
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,098
It's thanks to Griffiin
and his military mortuary skills...

42
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,610
that I've made my recent
headlong leap to three stripes.

43
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,341
We lost half our squad, attempting one
of his map-inspired, ill-conceived...

44
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,508
recon patrols.

45
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,382
When I say 'lost,"
I mean 'killed."

46
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,786
Nobody in the army ever admits
that someone on our side is killed.

47
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,587
They're either lost,
like Christopher Robin...

48
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,325
hit, as in a batter
hit by a pitched ball...

49
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,099
or they get 'it"
like in hide-and-go-seek.

50
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,334
Or maybe they get it
as with an ambiguous joke.

51
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,071
Not one of the six killed
had an army intelligence score...

52
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,808
of less than 150.

53
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,873
We gained a few miles
of European real estate...

54
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,011
and lost the beginnings to untold
generations of very bright people.

55
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,682
I think the army
considered this a good deal.

56
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,822
So now we've been moved north
into the Ardennes Forest...

57
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,834
to await replacements.

58
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,927
It's become a kind
of frontline halfway house...

59
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,938
for straightening out
our nerves.

60
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,909
I'm not sure
I can be straightened out.

61
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,404
I'm scared all the time now.

62
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,386
It's mid-December, 1944.

63
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,158
My family name is Knott.
K-N-O-T-T.

64
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,758
My parents named me William.

65
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,930
By the third grade,
I was Will Knott.

66
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,939
I've learned to live with it.

67
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,840
What I wasn't prepared for
were the guys of the I & Rplatoon...

68
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,777
who decided I was
to be known as 'Won't."

69
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,582
Let's go, Knott!

70
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,053
Back in Camp Shelby
before we shipped out...

71
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:15,287
Lieutenant Ware was told that
Intelligence was doing a lousy job.

72
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,057
He figured if he filled the squad
with intelligent soldiers...

73
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,360
he'd get better Intelligence.

74
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,766
He searched the regimental records for
the soldiers with the highest scores...

75
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,770
on the intelligence test...

76
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,568
and requisitioned us
as a squad.

77
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,701
Of course, six of us are dead.

78
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,736
So what's intelligence?

79
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,474
Jesus Christ, Knott.

80
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,316
Haven't you got them fucking
sergeant stripes sewn on yet?

81
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,289
The supply sergeant says they're all
out. They're waiting on a new shipment.

82
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,883
Well, get some staff sergeant
stripes and cut 'em down.

83
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,823
That'd be destruction
of government property, sir.

84
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:56,464
Well, I just hope to hell that
son of a bitch Griffin doesn't see it.

85
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,903
It's amazing how much profanity
goes on in the army...

86
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,304
when you're tuned to hear it.

87
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,549
Yeah, at ease, gentlemen.

88
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,847
Well done.
And, Corporal, if we could...

89
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,854
I'd like the water
a little warmer tomorrow.

90
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,289
Give that razor a fighting chance
up there against the whiskers.

91
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,759
Okay. Lieutenant Ware,
Sergeant Knott.

92
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,729
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to disregard...

93
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,323
all the rumors you've been
hearing around camp lately...

94
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,495
because now there's talk
of a imminent all-out enemy offensive.

95
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:36,008
Of course, the natural route for
any such offensive in this sector...

96
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:40,136
would obviously be
up these two roads...

97
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,544
and through this path
in the forest.

98
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:48,144
With that in mind,
three days ago, I sent out a patrol.

99
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,747
Now, that patrol
has not returned...

100
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,089
and, unfortunately,
they have not reported back.

101
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,860
Accordingly, I've made
the following decisions.

102
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,729
Sergeant Knott...

103
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,202
at this particular clearing
in the forest...

104
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,398
is a house.

105
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,965
I'd like you to move into that house
with your reduced squad.

106
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,137
Take yourself two jeeps
and a week's rations.

107
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,680
And from that house...

108
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:20,651
you're to report on any and all
enemy activity within that sector.

109
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,654
Lieutenant Ware...

110
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,020
you're to maintain constant
radio contact with Sergeant Knott.

111
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,924
- Is that clear, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,862
Sir, is there any evidence
of enemy occupation at that house?

113
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,524
Well, now, Sergeant Knott...

114
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,933
that's something you're just
gonna have to find out, isn't it?

115
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,272
Right, sir.

116
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,600
We drive for hours
through the snow.

117
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,201
Mother and I haven't talked about our
cross-country jaunt through the woods.

118
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,797
He just acts
as if it never happened.

119
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,538
That's all right. Just thinking
about something like that scares me.

120
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,282
What's going on, Mother?

121
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,725
I don't know.
There's something up the road.

122
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,128
- What is it?
- You can't see it from here.

123
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,933
All right, stay here.

124
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,625
What is it?

125
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,637
Miller.

126
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,515
Check it out.

127
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,108
Why do I always have
to check it out?

128
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,701
Jimmy Brunowski
from Griffin's patrol.

129
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,168
Looks like
he finally found a date.

130
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,522
I don't get it.

131
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,632
What's going on?

132
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,627
Those filthy, Nazi...

133
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,607
Kraut-headed
motherfucking bastards!

134
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,483
Give me a hand.

135
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,981
May God have mercy
on your souls.

136
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,563
I don't see anything.
No smoke, no movement.

137
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,835
What do you think?
Head on up with the jeeps?

138
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,879
Actually, I thought
maybe shoot through an eye.

139
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,814
We head down the road a ways,
circle around the back...

140
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,477
then come down the front of the road
and check for mines.

141
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,747
Is that okay with you?

142
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,790
- Yeah. We'll cover you.
- Great.

143
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,849
If Mel hadn't gotten trench foot,
he'd sure as hell be squad leader.

144
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,861
And that's the way
it should be.

145
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,863
Or maybe he'd be dead.

146
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,651
I'm not exactly sure
what country we're in.

147
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:14,495
It could be Belgium,
Luxembourg, France or even Germany.

148
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,965
I don't know what day it is. I have no
watch, so I don't know what time it is.

149
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,905
I'm not even sure of my name.

150
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,704
The next thing you know,
they'll be making me a general.

151
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,021
We find four mattresses
and satin-quilted covers...

152
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,547
along with some wine
and cases of sardines.

153
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,150
The I & Rplatoon,
or what's left of it...

154
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,356
will be living in luxury
for a few days.

155
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,265
Wow. Sheets and pillows.
I haven't had that since home.

156
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,067
Mel, come on.
Show 'em how we did it for the old USO.

157
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,077
USO, huh?

158
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,644
They call it
theJersey Bounce

159
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,348
The rhythm
that really counts

160
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,885
The temperature
always mounts

161
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,362
Whenever they play that crazy rhythm
they play

162
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:56,925
It started onJournal Square

163
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,165
Somebody heard it there

164
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,241
They put it
right on the air

165
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,312
And now you hear it
everywhere

166
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,246
Uptown

167
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,580
Back at Camp Shelby,
when we finally realized...

168
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,849
they really were going
to ship us overseas...

169
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,856
we went into a mild
state of panic.

170
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,188
The thing that
bothered us most was that...

171
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,356
with the exception of Mother Wilkins,
we were all eleven virgins.

172
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,364
I don't know
if this was normal...

173
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,562
or if there's some sort of correlation
between a lack of sexual precocity...

174
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,901
and what is known as intelligence.

175
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:44,009
I think Shutzer came up with the idea.
Or maybe it was Eddie.

176
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,550
Eddie was the youngest
of all of us.

177
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,143
Four of us managed a weekend pass
and headed into town...

178
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,554
to find a nice, complacent whore
who could put us out of our misery.

179
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,566
We kept it to four. We figured any more
would be some kind of gang bang.

180
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:05,592
And, well, we had
more romantic aspirations.

181
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,935
We had fifty dollars.
We spent ten on the room...

182
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,841
and left the rest
for the investment.

183
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,005
There was much discussion
as to the kind of woman.

184
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,209
I think we were all scared
that we'd end up with a real woman...

185
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,218
and not be able to manage it.

186
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,720
And the 'B"girls
in the bars were out.

187
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,622
We were well-conditioned
by the army VD films.

188
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,760
Avakian and Shutzer
were to handle the search.

189
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,297
Eddie and I waited.

190
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,875
What time is it?

191
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,845
- One.
- You're kidding.

192
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,561
We got company, guys.

193
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,332
Oh, shit.

194
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:15,073
I know right then I won't
be able to do it. I'm glad I'm third.

195
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,025
So we'd just about given up...

196
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,561
when we see this girl
down by the bus station.

197
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,223
Just sitting there
on one of those wooden benches.

198
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,894
Anyway, we got around to talking
about what we'd been doing all night.

199
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,960
And right then,
out of the blue...

200
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,939
she just volunteered
to come back here with us.

201
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,943
I thought she was kidding,
but she's serious.

202
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,946
Well, I got an extra rubber
you can use if you want, Stan.

203
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,948
I got my own rubbers.

204
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,746
You've gotten as bad
as Mother Wilkins.

205
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,753
Actually, I can use one.

206
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,826
I should have known Edward
was gonna take forever.

207
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,132
What the fuck
are they doing in there?

208
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,177
Watch your language, Stan.
What would Father Mundy think?

209
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,178
Fuck Father Mundy.

210
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,883
Hey, Eddie,
how you doing in there, huh?

211
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,681
Maybe she rolled him
or something.

212
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,157
Knockout drops
or a blackjack.

213
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,535
Would you at least
say something?

214
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,639
Her name's Janice.

215
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,145
She was engaged
to a boy named Matt.

216
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:40,446
She found out last week that he was
killed in the invasion of Sicily.

217
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,512
She came down to Shelby
to get his stuff...

218
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,492
and decided to kill herself.

219
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,131
But she couldn't
work up the nerve.

220
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,327
All she has now is a bus ticket
back home to Pittsburgh.

221
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:12,846
Janice has only made love
to one boy, Matt, just before he left.

222
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,985
Now she's volunteering herself
to all of us...

223
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,489
insisting it's what
she wants to do.

224
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,593
Of course
we're so guilty and scared...

225
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,459
we end up subjecting
this simple, lovely idea...

226
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,830
to every kind
of spurious rationale.

227
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,706
We wind down before dawn
and sleep.

228
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:41,678
Then just before the morning,
Janice comes quietly...

229
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,680
privately to each of us.

230
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,460
We pass through
the mythical barrier...

231
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,156
between boys and men...

232
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,028
men and death.

233
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,034
Janice takes us with her.

234
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,740
After a luxurious
mass breakfast in bed...

235
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,538
we walk Janice to her bus.

236
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,602
None of us talk
about what happened.

237
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,842
And I think I'll always feel strange
about my first sexual experience...

238
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,911
masquerading as a dead boy
named Matt.

239
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,328
- Knott.
- Yeah.

240
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,428
I'll cook lunch if you can get me
some wood for the fireplace.

241
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,235
No, Mother. All we need
is a bunch of smoke...

242
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,242
to let the Germans
know we're here.

243
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,972
Will, if we don't light a fire,
we're gonna freeze our butts off.

244
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,447
And it's very hard to kill Germans
with a frozen butt.

245
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,387
All right.

246
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,179
The smoke's bad,
but not as bad as I thought.

247
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,398
You're taking a little long putting
that back together, aren't you, Bud?

248
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,407
I'm not working
for speed right now.

249
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,409
This wine tastes
like sardines.

250
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,647
Well, here. The sardines
taste sort of like wine.

251
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,515
I sit here trying
to work out four bridge hands.

252
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,951
Miller invented the game, calling it
'compact, cardless, duplicate bridge."

253
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:52,397
When we lost half the squad,
we also lost our only deck of cards.

254
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,404
They were on Eddie.

255
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,299
He died in the fiield hospital.

256
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,938
With his left arm gone
and his face the way it was...

257
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,448
I don't think he tried
very hard to stay on.

258
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,479
Hi, Bud.

259
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,583
Did Mother and Avakian
set up all right down there?

260
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,711
They seemed fine to me.

261
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,519
Good. Listen. You have got to be more
careful lighting cigarettes, all right?

262
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,686
Some German could sneak up from
behind you, pop one in your head...

263
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,855
while you're pretending
to be Walt Whitman.

264
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,558
I think my eyeball's frozen.

265
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,742
- Yeah?
- Is that you, Will?

266
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,940
- Yeah. What's going on?
- I don't know. I think I saw something.

267
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,983
- What did you see, Mother?
- I'm not sure, Will.

268
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:51,586
I don't know. I think I saw something
move on the hill across from us.

269
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,988
Did Avakian see it?

270
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,390
No. Just me.

271
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,555
All right, Mother, hang tight.
I'll call up top.

272
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,565
Oh, shit.

273
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,661
- Father?
- Yeah?

274
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,900
Yeah. Mother says he saw something
on the opposite hill there.

275
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,840
- Did you see anything?
- No. Nothing.

276
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,368
Wilkins must have eyes like an owl.
I can't see my hand in front of my face.

277
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,882
All right.
Could be he's only jumpy.

278
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,316
Just keep an eye
on their backs, all right?

279
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,980
Okay, Will.

280
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,489
Hey, Bud. Relax. Relax.

281
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,460
Mother's pretty nervous.
It's probably nothing.

282
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:34,487
Probably nothing?
That's real reassuring, Will.

283
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,901
Well, what do you think?

284
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,495
I don't know.

285
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,838
Maybe I should tell them
about Mother's run through the woods.

286
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,571
The news of his baby being dead
did him in for sure.

287
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,419
- Yeah?
- We're hearing something down here.

288
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,931
Mother thinks it's the Germans
signaling back and forth.

289
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,468
All right, Mel, hold on.
We'll be right down.

290
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,766
- Bud. Bud, wake up.
- What?

291
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,671
Listen. Mel says he's
hearing some noises, all right?

292
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:20,199
I want you to call Shutzer, tell him
I'm going down to the lower post.

293
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,645
Then call Mother and Avakian back and
remind them not to shoot me, all right?

294
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,114
Come on. Get up.

295
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,186
Go!

296
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,630
Did you hear any more?

297
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,634
Not since the last one.

298
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,744
It's closer that time.

299
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,279
Americana.

300
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,848
Easy, Mother. Easy.

301
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,878
What do you think?
Maybe they're gone?

302
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,751
I don't know.

303
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,516
Maybe they're
just being quiet.

304
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,623
Mel.

305
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,463
Let's you and me go
check out the road, all right?

306
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:29,131
Hey, Will, you go if you want.
I'm fine right here.

307
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,437
If they're gone, they're gone.

308
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,443
If they're not,
I'm not walking into an ambush.

309
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,312
Put that pin
back in that grenade.

310
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,828
- No, it wasn't.
- They do shit like this all the time.

311
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,563
- I know, but that wasn't the case.
- How do you know?

312
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,901
Do you think
it was five of'em?

313
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,209
- Yeah, yeah.
- What the hell is going on?

314
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,182
Mel said they were actually talking
to you. What did they say?

315
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:17,688
I don't know. First it was,
"Hey, Americana."

316
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:21,088
Then when they left, they started
saying something like "slap guder."

317
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,061
It didn't make any sense.

318
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,369
Shit, that's Yiddish.
It's schlaf gut.

319
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,371
It's 'sleep well."

320
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,240
"Sleep well"?

321
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:40,641
Yeah, Will. 'Sleep well."
Get it?

322
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:45,705
Holy shit. These fucking Nazis.
They're softening us up for the kill.

323
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,824
Will, wake up.

324
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,555
Ware's on the phone.
He doesn't sound real happy.

325
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,335
- Is Mother out there alone?
- Yeah.

326
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,072
- Why?
- Why? It's the day.

327
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,081
You don't need to leave two guys out
there during the day. What's the point?

328
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,140
I don't know, Bud.
How about the Germans?

329
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,413
What do you want, Will?
You wanna lose one guy, two guys?

330
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:27,288
I'm just really glad we talked about
this. I'm glad we could work this out.

331
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,791
Shit.

332
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,688
It's up to you, Bud.
Bid or pass?

333
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,697
I pass.

334
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,063
Able 1 to Able 4. Over.

335
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:44,399
I tell Ware about our nighttime
encounter with the Germans.

336
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,965
Bad idea.

337
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,977
Griffiin's desperate
for information...

338
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,344
so Ware orders us out
to find their command post.

339
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,349
We decided to head south
down the pass.

340
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,614
It's as good a guess as any, and that's
where their voices seem to come from.

341
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,656
Of course that could be seen as a good
argument for heading the other way.

342
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,801
I'm having my usual trouble...

343
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:17,398
noticing how beautiful the world is
just when I might be leaving it.

344
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,638
Just this side of the road.

345
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,156
Don't worry.

346
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,760
I'm just enjoying having
a fucking Nazi in my sights.

347
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,905
I think I'm getting a hard-on.

348
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,477
Pow!

349
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:48,794
I know we could've killed
those three guys and gotten away.

350
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,802
I'm also sure they could've done
the same thing to us last night.

351
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,908
What I don't know in both cases
is why it didn't happen.

352
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,773
Shit!

353
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,749
Fuck! Here we fucking go!

354
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:46,484
You're gonna get us killed here.
You got to relax.

355
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:51,460
I said you got to relax.
You gotta shut up. You gotta shut up.

356
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,260
- Shut up, Stan!
- You're gonna get us all killed.

357
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,131
You're gonna get us all killed.
You gotta shut up!

358
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,261
Stan! You gotta...

359
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,770
Come on!

360
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,682
What happened?

361
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,481
- You find any Germans?
- Yeah, we found them all right.

362
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,581
And they found us.
Krauts nearly blew our heads off.

363
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,960
Oh, shit.

364
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,963
I lost the scope and the map.

365
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,693
Great. Injury to insult.

366
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,669
- What happened, Bud?
- What happened?

367
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,705
Germans found us,
had a dead in their sights.

368
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,708
They could've killed all of us
and they just let us go.

369
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:16,475
- That's what happened.
- They had you and then they let you go?

370
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,481
What are you complaining about?
You should be happy.

371
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,449
We should be happy?

372
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,784
Oh, okay, Mundy, we're happy.

373
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,052
We're happy! Yippee!
Hooray!

374
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,457
You feel better now?

375
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,462
All right, Stan, come on.

376
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,830
- What the hell is that?
- That's just Mother.

377
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,841
Clumping around in the attic again.
It's fine.

378
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,120
- Did you find the stuff?
- They must've come back after we left.

379
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,682
There's all kind of tracks.
They took the scope and the map.

380
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,130
What did you do? Crawl around
on your hands and knees looking for it?

381
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:19,074
No. I could see right off
the stuff wasn't there.

382
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:23,739
I got wet working out a little
surprise for our Teutonic friends.

383
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,805
What, a trap?

384
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,620
I built a snowman.

385
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,320
Right where
we dropped our stuff.

386
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,518
I used pine needles
for a mustache.

387
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:40,086
And then a branch,
like an arm giving the Nazi salute.

388
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,691
I even put a few
pine branches over one eye.

389
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,201
- It's not a bad resemblance.
- Jesus, Stan.

390
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,467
They could've come up from behind, made
a few well placed critical comments...

391
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,474
and one more
ventilated whiz kid.

392
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,744
Even stamped out a message
in front of my snowman.

393
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,374
What?

394
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,249
F-U-C-K...

395
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,086
H-l-T-L-E-R.

396
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,987
Made exclamation points
with pine branches.

397
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:35,176
- Where's Mother?
- He's upstairs in his attic.

398
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,888
- What's he doing there?
- I have no idea, Will.

399
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,420
Actually, he's been kind
of quiet lately.

400
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,521
Maybe he hung himself,
huh, Father?

401
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:33,873
Are you all right, Mother?

402
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,248
Look at the paintings, Will.

403
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,187
Look.

404
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,921
See?

405
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,700
Somebody cared.

406
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,866
Somebody made something...

407
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,245
probably not even for money.

408
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,550
For love.

409
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,780
Sometimes I didn't believe
there was any love left.

410
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:30,532
Try to remember
who the real enemy is, Will.

411
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,849
Christ, I thought we lost
both of you up there.

412
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,123
What did you do,
start a family?

413
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,323
Father, you're on next.

414
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,027
Unless anyone objects, Bud...

415
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,765
I think we should go back to at least
two on the lower post for now.

416
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,773
All right?

417
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,307
It's too weird out there
for one guy alone.

418
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,841
Shit!

419
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,066
What the hell's going on?

420
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:13,331
The explosion was me throwing a grenade.
They haven't fired back yet.

421
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,338
Can you hear that?

422
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,912
Can you hear that?

423
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:27,212
We can hear without the phone.
What are they yelling about now?

424
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,447
I think they're yelling "Fuck Hitler"
the way your grandmother would say it.

425
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:34,548
There's this crazy guy in the cemetery,
pretending grenades don't hurt.

426
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,593
Maybe you should send out
some straitjackets.

427
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,592
Grenade!

428
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,361
Shit.

429
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,187
- We're having a snowball fight.
- What?

430
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,660
You don't think maybe the war's over
and they're not telling us, do you?

431
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,095
- I mean, they wouldn't do that.
- You sure you're okay down there?

432
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:52,067
Goddamn it, Shutzer! You're the one
that started this "Fuck Hitler" shit.

433
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,978
Schlaf gut, Kraut.

434
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,112
You got that map?

435
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,620
Yeah.

436
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,599
I'll be a son of a bitch.

437
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,200
What?

438
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,269
I've been trying to figure out all
this crazy shit that's been going on...

439
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,612
for the past couple of days,
and only one answer makes sense.

440
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,816
Remember the frozen American
and the Kraut dancing together?

441
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,415
See, it's like a message.
They wanna get together.

442
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:25,154
- It's crude, but remember who they are.
- So?

443
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,527
So then they come around with that
schlaf gut bit the first night.

444
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,793
It's like they're saying
they know that we're here...

445
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,801
but they're not
so mad about it.

446
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,105
- Yeah.
- Well, listen.

447
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:42,305
Okay. Just try to think of one reason
they didn't mow us down...

448
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:45,644
or at least take us prisoner.

449
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,184
I think they're telling us
that they wanna talk...

450
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,276
maybe even surrender.

451
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,417
- What?
- If I'm right...

452
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,721
they want us to meet them
in this clearing at 1200 hours.

453
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,522
What if it's a trap?

454
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,961
If they wanted to kill us,
they could've done it a couple of times.

455
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:04,899
We could've shot them. We didn't.
That doesn't mean we wanna surrender.

456
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,902
They could be stalling
for reinforcements.

457
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,938
With a snowball fight?

458
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,940
A snowball fight
doesn't mean surrender.

459
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,272
Yeah, but look at this.

460
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,213
- I'll mention it to Ware.
- Come on, Won't.

461
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:22,945
We don't wanna get officers involved
in this, screwing everything up.

462
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,615
You know,
I think we got a chance...

463
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,817
to make something good
come out of this for everybody...

464
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,622
if we just use our heads.

465
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,994
What do you say we just go out there
and see what's going on?

466
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,397
Just the two of us.
I'll take all the risks.

467
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:42,427
- I still say I should call Ware first.
- What do you think Ware is gonna do?

468
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,701
- He'll tell Griffin.
- And you know damn well...

469
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,902
that Griffin is gonna come charging
out here and arrange everything...

470
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,445
so he looks like General Patton
winning the war single-handed.

471
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,607
That's the way it is, Stan. There's
nothing we're gonna do about that.

472
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:18,541
Suppose that one of us captures all
the Germans single-handed, all alone...

473
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:22,738
then we build this guy
into a second Sergeant York?

474
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:26,078
It's got to be worth
at least a Silver Star.

475
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:29,482
Maybe even a trip home
as a returning war hero.

476
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,113
- How does that sound?
- Sounds like a court-martial.

477
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,487
How are they ever
gonna catch on?

478
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,789
You know, for Mother's sake,
I think we should at least try.

479
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,692
For Mother?

480
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,323
Sure. Who else?

481
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,769
Oh, boy, that would be perfect.

482
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,736
We testify that the Germans
had us pinned down...

483
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,507
and Wilkins comes in the nick
of time and saves the whole show.

484
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:01,711
And we'd have a genuine mob
of enemy soldiers to back up our story.

485
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,515
Yeah, okay. For right now
we don't tell anybody, okay?

486
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,715
It's just the two of us.

487
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,453
Look, if it doesn't work,
at least we tried.

488
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,795
Sneaking out is easy.

489
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,857
Mother's back upstairs
by himself...

490
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,300
and Father and Miller
are asleep.

491
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:24,466
We decide we'll have to tell Avakian,
who's on guard at the lower post.

492
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,101
You're gonna tromp out there,
set up an armistice conference...

493
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,145
and turn Wilkins
into a war hero.

494
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,146
What, are you
out of your tiny minds?

495
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,944
- I don't think so.
- It all makes sense.

496
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:38,477
It's a theory. You're gonna get
your butt shot off for a theory.

497
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,750
Well, I'm going.

498
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,351
Will, listen to me.
I'm the one guy here who knows...

499
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,520
Mel, I said I'm going.

500
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,560
Okay, fine.

501
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,297
But even if you do
pull this off...

502
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,570
how are you going to get
Mother to go along with it?

503
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:06,940
- We tell him?
- No. No, he's right.

504
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,850
We'll have to draw straws
or something and rig it.

505
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,445
Wilkins will never accept it
if he thinks it's charity.

506
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,457
Plus, you tell him,
he's gonna want to tag along.

507
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,426
I don't think you want Mother
facing any Germans.

508
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,124
So what do you think, Sarge?

509
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:30,465
It's then I tell them about Mother's run
through the forest back at headquarters.

510
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,976
I don't think
we should tell him.

511
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,206
Okay, look, when we go
to get the Krauts...

512
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,441
we'll leave Wilkins here to guard
the chateau and mind the radio.

513
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:43,680
- It's all gonna seem perfectly natural.
- What makes you so sure this will work?

514
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:45,983
What makes you
so sure it's not?

515
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,788
Okay, fine.

516
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,660
Give two quick shots and one more
if you need any help.

517
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,791
Then what?

518
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,529
Then I'll miss you.

519
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,080
Hey, have fun, boys.
Don't get killed.

520
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,838
Hey, just calm down!

521
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,943
They want to talk
to our officer in charge.

522
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,984
- I don't speak German or Yiddish.
- It's okay. I'll translate.

523
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,349
I don't have stripes on my arm.
They won't believe I'm an officer.

524
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,911
I just don't think they're very happy
about surrendering to a Jew, okay?

525
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,048
Did they say
they want to surrender?

526
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,559
Just stuff about wanting
to talk to our officer in charge.

527
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,462
- What was all the yelling about?
- I'm not sure.

528
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,227
- You're not sure?
- Look!

529
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,269
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

530
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:18,673
Look, just...
Just come over with me.

531
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:23,076
I'll tell them our officer's
back at the chateau.

532
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,912
You look goy enough. Maybe they'll
come out more with you around.

533
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,917
Okay? Come on.

534
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:39,518
This is, uh, meine friend.
Freund.

535
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,158
He's in the 'schtieb,"
you know?

536
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,802
Okay, I think I got it.
There's seven of them.

537
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,361
They just got sent back
from the Russian front...

538
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,931
where it sounds like they got
the shit knocked out of'em.

539
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,671
He keeps talking about that
big offensive south of here...

540
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,679
and he doesn't want
any part of it.

541
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:32,908
They think the war's almost over
and they don't want to get killed...

542
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,917
in the last few days.

543
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:39,682
I told him we'd bring our leader here
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

544
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,281
We're going
to bring Ware here?

545
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,054
Look, just get Mother
out on guard duty...

546
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,119
and get the squad together,
all right?

547
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,961
What are we gonna do
about an officer?

548
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:50,166
I don't know about this.
Why can't Will just do it?

549
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,067
I don't know about this.
Why can't Will just do it?

550
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,297
- He's the leader, for Christ's sake.
- They've already seen him.

551
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:59,000
Besides, no Kraut's ever gonna believe
that a guy like Will is an officer.

552
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,168
- Take a look at him.
- Thank you, thank you.

553
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,542
Then let's let Mel just do it.
He's a natural leader type.

554
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,673
Hey, wait a second. I'm not even sure
I want to be part of this plan.

555
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,876
Besides, I don't look
like an Aryan god.

556
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:13,079
What is this?
Father, it's all stripes and no rocker.

557
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:17,115
- What's that mean?
- It's something new, Miller.

558
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:21,527
You're our bastard sergeant minor.
Besides, we don't have any rockers.

559
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,657
What if it's like some kind of...

560
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,395
"capture the commander" scheme
the Krauts have worked out?

561
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,903
You know, put a bullet in my head
or something.

562
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,242
Hey, look, Bud, why don't you
just try walking now?

563
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:41,207
- The man walks like a soldier.
- Put more pigheaded asshole into it.

564
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,309
- That I can do.
- Chest out, chest out.

565
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,219
Yeah, that's it!
That'll do just fine.

566
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,348
Just stand there like an SOB
and nod occasionally.

567
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,358
You know, you actually do
look like an officer.

568
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:53,759
- I actually feel like an asshole.
- That's about the same thing.

569
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,821
Mother gets off post in five minutes.

570
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,834
- Let's not blow his Christmas present.
- Sure this is a good idea?

571
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,535
I can't stop worrying.

572
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,238
God, I hope we're doing
the right thing.

573
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,420
- Yeah.
- Will, listen.

574
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,321
There are five or six of them
down here working like crazy.

575
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,292
They got something big with them.
Could be a mortar.

576
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,726
I think maybe you better have somebody
man that upper post to cover us.

577
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:29,264
Shit. Mel, you and Mother
go up to the upper post.

578
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,300
Stan says they're
setting up a mortar.

579
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:37,905
All right. Listen. Mother and Avakian
are going to the upper post.

580
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,305
You want me down there?

581
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,932
- Father?
- Yeah, Will.

582
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,806
Get your butt down here.
You of all people shouldn't miss this.

583
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:22,643
Bethlehem

584
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:27,378
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

585
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,883
For you. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

586
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:37,893
Merry Christmas.

587
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,125
Merry Christmas
Happy New Year.

588
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,702
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

589
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,264
Merry Christmas.

590
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:37,315
Holy night

591
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:41,618
All is calm

592
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,149
All is bright

593
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:49,562
Round yon virgin

594
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:53,193
Mother and child

595
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:57,137
Holy infant

596
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,834
- So tender and mild
- Merry Christmas.

597
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,377
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

598
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:09,977
Sleep in heavenly peace

599
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:17,220
Sleep in heavenly peace

600
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:30,667
O come ye
O come ye

601
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:35,143
To Bethlehem

602
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:37,805
Hey, Father, they teach you
German in the seminary?

603
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,906
What the hell were you two
talking about?

604
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:44,419
I just kept saying "Merry Christmas"
and "Happy New Year."

605
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,183
I said it maybe 50 times.

606
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,918
- What did he say to you?
- Well...

607
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:53,359
he said something
that sounded like...

608
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,262
"Throw me a why not."

609
01:03:56,332 --> 01:04:01,201
And then, when he tried
to hand me his gun, he said...

610
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,865
"Why not go shrink."

611
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,501
"Fröhlich Weihnachten"
is 'Merry Christmas..."

612
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,876
and "Weihnachtsgeschenk"
is 'Christmas present."

613
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,909
I wonder what the Germans
thought Father was saying.

614
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:20,017
What's going on?

615
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,354
Couldn't get anybody
to answer the phone.

616
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:26,259
Oh, my God.
Mother, I'm sorry.

617
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,661
I forgot all about you
up there.

618
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,999
I...

619
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,164
I heard singing.

620
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,309
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

621
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,868
The Germans just wanted
to spread a little holiday cheer.

622
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,914
Father even did some
present exchanging.

623
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:47,916
They gave us sausages,
Vance.

624
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,317
- Is that what happened, Will?
- Yeah, that's it.

625
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,324
This particular branch
of the German army...

626
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:00,192
seems to believe in turning off
the war every once in a while.

627
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:17,378
I don't know if I can take
this kind of war.

628
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:21,007
I'd rather we kept out of each other's
way, except when we have to fight.

629
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,181
Oh, shit.

630
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,929
This is meine kommandier.

631
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,802
Hey, Will, come over here.

632
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,902
Okay. Okay,
they do want to surrender.

633
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,143
As soon as possible.
Today. They...

634
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:31,346
He's convinced that this German push
is coming through here any time now.

635
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,581
There's a kicker.

636
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,789
It's a big kicker.

637
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:39,350
The young ones are scared shitless
that if the Germans come through here...

638
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:41,988
and it looks like they
surrendered without a struggle...

639
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,931
it's gonna be taken out
on their families.

640
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,596
Everything is nuts back home and they
don't want their parents to get shot...

641
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,196
or put in camps because
their sons were cowards.

642
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,499
Well, do they have a suggestion?

643
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,073
Yeah.

644
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,718
They want us to take 'em
in a fake skirmish.

645
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,843
What?

646
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:07,685
Just make some noise, leave some
spent cartridges, grenade fragments.

647
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:09,748
No. No, absolutely not.

648
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,884
- Will...
- No! It doesn't make any sense.

649
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:14,054
Just calm down. Now you're gonna
blow the whole operation here.

650
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,428
- It's crazy!
- Be quiet! Quiet!

651
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:17,932
- Shut up!
- You wanna get us killed?

652
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,093
We're not gonna do it!
And don't tell me to shut up!

653
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:29,743
Will, I know it sounds nuts,
I know, but...

654
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,871
I think it's the only way
they're gonna go for it.

655
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,778
They're just kids.
They're just scared.

656
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,080
They're just scared kids.
Look at 'em.

657
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,790
I don't know.

658
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,452
You trust these
fuckin' Nazis, Stan?

659
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,557
- What does that mean?
- He said they're not Nazis.

660
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:55,127
They're just regular German army.
They're regular army like we are.

661
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,836
I say we do it.

662
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:08,315
What if it's a trap?

663
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:12,445
It's not much of a trap, having us
both come fully armed to a skirmish.

664
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,684
I mean, at best, it's just
mutual suicide, right?

665
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,817
What if they're using the noise
to bring in reinforcements?

666
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:23,329
No. If they wanted to do that,
they could've done that the first night.

667
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,698
He's right, Will, he's right.
And take a look at 'em.

668
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:31,103
Things must be bad in the vaterland
to have an army of old men and boys.

669
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:45,444
- Okay, what do we do?
- Just give a little nod.

670
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,781
We agree to come
this afternoon...

671
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:53,818
make a lot of noise with rifles
and grenades and take them in.

672
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:57,889
Able 1 to Able 4, over.
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

673
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,026
Yeah, you got anything yet, over?

674
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:04,198
Yes, sir, I think we're gonna
be able to take a prisoner, sir.

675
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,707
We found some tracks.
Our plan is to hit their outpost...

676
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,902
around 3:00 this afternoon.

677
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,708
- Over.
- Good. Do it.

678
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,409
I'll come out. Maybe Griffiin too.
We'll bring the prisoner back. Over.

679
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,883
No, sir, I don't think
that's necessary, sir.

680
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,888
Tell Major Griffin that...

681
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,890
No sense in him taking the risk
coming all the way out here.

682
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,188
We'll have the jeeps ready
with the chains...

683
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:27,229
and we'll get that prisoner
to you, sir, over.

684
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,230
- I'll tell him.
- Over and out.

685
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:31,232
Over and out.

686
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:37,665
I tell Mother we're going out
to try for a prisoner.

687
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,268
I tell him if we're not back in
two hours to call Ware at the base.

688
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,575
He's obviously glad
not to be on the patrol.

689
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:50,347
We hide Miller's officer outfit
under his snow poncho.

690
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:58,450
Now what? Walk down there
and knock on the door?

691
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,595
Well...

692
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,600
here I go.

693
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,727
I'm not sure what to do
so they don't shoot me.

694
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:11,462
- Try yelling "comrade."
- Is that it?

695
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,168
Well, Stan, you could
wave a white fag.

696
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,438
Then it would look like
the wrong group was surrendering.

697
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,950
We're right here covering you.
Good luck.

698
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:37,291
Oh, boy.

699
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,991
We wait.
There's nothing else to do.

700
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:51,568
- What's going on? Everything all right?
- Yeah.

701
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,700
He wanted to talk to our officer
"Herr Muller" here.

702
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,007
You know, I'm sure
it's because I'm a Jew.

703
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:01,311
All right, you nick-prickJew-type,
take me to my Aryan friends.

704
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:03,374
All right,
if they're really giving up...

705
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:05,647
why are they
putting a guy on post?

706
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,780
Who are they
guarding themselves from?

707
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,584
Maybe other Germans.

708
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,719
They probably have
a Major Griffin of their own.

709
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:17,288
Ubergruppenfuhrer Griftoch
or something.

710
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:19,493
Don't worry.

711
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,593
Come on.

712
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:47,087
- That's nice.
- Okay, here's how it's gonna work.

713
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:51,223
They'll wind up in front of the cabin.
Miller and I will stay as protection.

714
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,768
All right, now, you go on out
with the rest of the squad.

715
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,634
When old Shickelgruber here and I
signal, we all start firing.

716
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,764
When we signal again,
we all stop.

717
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:02,902
Then you guys come down the hill,
we disarm them and take them in.

718
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:06,812
All we need is a nod from Miller
and they'll get their stuff together.

719
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,139
Dismiss me.
I'll go inform Father and Mel.

720
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:40,738
- What?
- Dismiss me.

721
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:48,012
Will, why don't you get up on that hill
and go inform Father and Will... Mel.

722
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,351
Mother!
Hold your fire!

723
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,782
Go check on
Shutzer and Miller.

724
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,455
Hang in there, Father.

725
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:04,424
We're gonna get you wrapped up
and get you outta here.

726
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,954
You warm enough?

727
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:18,063
Anybody else hit?

728
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,131
Everybody's fine, Father.

729
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:26,312
- Are the Germans dead?
- Don't worry about that.

730
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:33,653
You all right?

731
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,593
God have mercy
on those poor Germans.

732
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,454
God have mercy on us.

733
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:54,605
- Don't... Don't tell Mother.
- I won't.

734
01:16:54,676 --> 01:17:01,411
- Don't tell Mother.
- I won't.

735
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,543
Don't tell...
Don't tell Mother.

736
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,815
Promise me.

737
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,879
I won't.

738
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,341
Is he dead?

739
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,836
I think so, Vance.

740
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:15,481
He ran out to warn me.

741
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,095
Why?

742
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,927
I don't understand.

743
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:27,127
I had a perfect position.

744
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,798
I don't get it.

745
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,747
He's stupid, Vance.

746
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:42,682
He does stupid things.

747
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,470
What a mess.

748
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:07,702
Shit! It looked so easy.

749
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:11,803
Looks like our friend here
got a million-dollar wound.

750
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,814
The one guy who wants
to fight these bastards...

751
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:16,248
and I get
the million-dollar wound?

752
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,309
Isn't it the way?

753
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,889
How's Mundy?

754
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:26,519
He's dead. He died fast.
There was nothing I could do.

755
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,498
What a fuckup.

756
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:44,611
Father said don't tell Mother.

757
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:46,613
That's what we'll do.

758
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:51,175
We were pinned down,
and he saved us.

759
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,244
That's the plan.

760
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:23,217
Mother tells us
why he came out after us.

761
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:27,119
Ware and Griffiin are at the chateau,
looking for their prisoner.

762
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:31,592
Well, we've got one,
if he stays alive.

763
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:35,252
It's hard to look at Father.

764
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:38,060
I keep waiting
for his eyes to open...

765
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:44,703
waiting for him to tell me
it'll be all right if I just have faith.

766
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,976
Sergeant Knott.

767
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,076
- Yes, sir.
- Get some men out on post.

768
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:01,611
The enemy camp may have heard
that skirmish and sent out a patrol.

769
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,420
Well, sir, before the prisoner
went into shock...

770
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:07,052
he told Shutzer that an enemy attack
was expected at any time.

771
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:09,619
Well, now, holy shit, soldier!

772
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,496
Just when the fuck
were you gonna tell us that?

773
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,797
I thought this was an I & R platoon,
for Christ's sake!

774
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,065
Lieutenant, get me Regiment
on the horn immediately.

775
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,129
Whiz kids, my ass!

776
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:23,776
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

777
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:28,282
- Able 1 to Able 4, over.
- Corporal Leary here, over.

778
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,582
Son, this is Major Griffin.
You take down this message...

779
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:35,088
and get it to Regimental Command
on the double-quick, over.

780
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:37,181
Wilco, sir. Over.

781
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:40,092
"Have contacted enemy
and taken prisoner.

782
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:43,892
Have suffered casualties.
One dead, one wounded.

783
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,433
Have destroyed enemy outpost.

784
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:50,232
Prisoner claims impending enemy attack
through this sector at any moment.

785
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,975
Repeating. Prisoner claims impending
enemy attack at any moment.

786
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:59,412
Am leaving immediately with prisoner and
wounded for base. Signed, Major Griffin."

787
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:02,473
- Get that to the regimental commander.
- He ain't gonna make it.

788
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,780
Over and out. Let's go.

789
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:09,548
Sergeant Knott...

790
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:13,025
have your men transfer the chains
from your jeep to my vehicle.

791
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,688
We have a long way to go,
and the road's gonna be very rough.

792
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,732
- Yes, sir.
- Son...

793
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:22,765
I am shocked by
the conditions of these quarters.

794
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:24,771
This is private property.

795
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,000
The United States government
is responsible for it.

796
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,771
It was in bad shape
when they moved in, Major.

797
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,176
Are you finished, Lieutenant?

798
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:39,311
Because there is ample evidence
to indicate a dereliction of duty...

799
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:43,414
and conduct not becoming
an American combat troop.

800
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:45,459
I'll be dead honest
with you here, son.

801
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:49,190
I wonder if your fucking men even know
there's a war going on outside.

802
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:53,428
Were it not for extreme
extenuating circumstances...

803
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:56,868
I would see that this soldier,
as noncom in charge...

804
01:22:56,938 --> 01:23:00,135
were brought before a military
review board and severely disciplined.

805
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:03,439
And where the fuck
are your stripes?

806
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:06,537
I'll be goddamned if you haven't
had enough time to sew them on.

807
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,640
Yes, sir.

808
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:13,119
- I'll get on it.
- No! You know what you'll do?

809
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:15,656
You will march your ass outside...

810
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:21,321
and transfer those chains from your jeep
to my vehicle on the double-time.

811
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,455
Now!

812
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:37,336
Lieutenant...

813
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:41,542
do not ever contradict me
in front of the men again.

814
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,810
All right, buddy,
you're almost home.

815
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,220
What do you think, Mel?
Is he gonna be all right?

816
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:59,525
Yeah, Shutzer's strong.
He'll be okay.

817
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,806
They won't fall out
if you're careful, sir.

818
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,707
It's a rough trip, but it'd help
if you'd loosen the tourniquets...

819
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:11,405
every once in a while.

820
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,710
- We'll do the best we can, Knott.
- Thank you, sir.

821
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,919
Don't worry, Knott.
You done a good job.

822
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,218
I don't think so, sir.

823
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:29,162
Knott, Major Griffin wants you
to keep the squad here...

824
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:30,754
until the Krauts attack.

825
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:35,565
Stay here, sir?

826
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,832
What do we do
when the attack comes?

827
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,897
You contact us by radio.
We'll give you our position...

828
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:42,943
then you get the hell out,
understood?

829
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,843
- Understood, Knott?
- Yes, sir.

830
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,908
Lieutenant Ware, goddamn it!

831
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:53,818
Are you going to baby-sit
or drive this fucking jeep?

832
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,880
- Be right there, sir, on the double.
- Get your ass in here!

833
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,983
Good luck, Knott.

834
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:37,156
Did you ever think about
how many dead people there must be?

835
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:44,004
Looks like Father just joined
the great majority.

836
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:51,239
Father told me he still wanted
to be a priest.

837
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:56,607
He just didn't think
he was pure enough.

838
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,827
You know, I've been thinking
maybe Father's the lucky one.

839
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:13,764
I mean, is this whole world
run by shits like Griffin?

840
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:18,731
If we get through this,
is that the way it's gonna be?

841
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:50,929
What's the tree for?
You gonna burn it?

842
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:55,542
Vance thought
a little Christmas cheer...

843
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,545
would pick things up
around here a little bit.

844
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,810
Thought we could roast some chestnuts
and stuff ourselves with turkey.

845
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,113
You first, Will.

846
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,660
You aren't the rankest, but...

847
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,788
you do have rank on us.

848
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:20,397
It's a...

849
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,436
It's a Christmas present.

850
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:32,106
We try to turn off the war.
We don't even keep a guard on.

851
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,478
We figure when the attack starts,
we'll hear it.

852
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:46,837
I asked Ware to put you in
for a citation.

853
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,405
I hope that's okay.

854
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:54,288
I think Father or Stan
should get it.

855
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:59,049
No. You should.

856
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:02,392
The Germans had us pinned down,
and you saved our asses.

857
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:12,299
I only shot twice.

858
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:17,333
After Father went down,
l... I didn't shoot anymore.

859
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,210
My glasses were all fogged up.

860
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:23,512
- I don't even know if I hit anybody.
- It doesn't matter.

861
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:26,144
Just stick with the story.

862
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,154
You shot them all.
That's what I told Ware.

863
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:31,749
Maybe if you get decorated,
we can get you pulled out of here.

864
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:42,326
Two-thirds of the squad is gone now.
I don't see how we're gonna make it.

865
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:48,039
I'll make you a bet, Vance.

866
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,737
I'll bet you that
in six months...

867
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:54,179
you're back with Linda,
and she's pregnant...

868
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,910
and this will all be something
you hardly remember.

869
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:00,913
I doubt that.

870
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:05,549
I'll bet you $100.

871
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:10,190
Who has $100?

872
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:16,699
You can pay me off
a bit at a time.

873
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:21,734
We'll start
New Year's Day, 1946.

874
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,352
- It's a bet.
- Yeah.

875
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:44,799
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

876
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:46,426
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

877
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,026
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

878
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:51,537
- Able 1 to anybody, over.
- Will, we got to go.

879
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,540
Pull up the phones and the wires.

880
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:55,701
Miller, if anybody can get
through on this thing you can.

881
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:59,473
Just keep trying, all right?
Let's get Father out to the jeep.

882
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:02,107
- Come on.
- Able 1 in.

883
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:05,984
Able 4, come on.
Able 1 to Able 4.

884
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:19,900
- Come on!
- Come on, Will! Let's go!

885
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:21,902
Shit!

886
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:24,699
Come on, Will, move it!
Move it!

887
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,445
Fuckin' Griffin
took the chains off the jeep!

888
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:52,393
Christ! There they are!

889
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,565
- Oh, fuck!
- You all right?

890
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:06,940
- I think so.
- Father got some.

891
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:14,082
Another 100 yards
and we'll be out of range!

892
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,788
- Straighten out.
- I can't! It's not doing anything!

893
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:23,261
Straighten out!
Jesus Christ!

894
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:36,365
- You guys all right?
- Hold it! We're about to slide over.

895
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,503
Put some weight on the back,
Mother, on the back!

896
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:40,945
Let's go. Let's go.

897
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:47,313
- All right?
- Let's get Father and get out of here!

898
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:11,936
Well, Sergeant Knott,
what the fuck do we do now?

899
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:15,881
I can't believe
they'd just leave.

900
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:19,044
Mel, what do you think?

901
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,714
I don't know,
but we'd better keep moving.

902
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,968
- I have no idea where we are.
- Just go.

903
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:46,207
- We could be heading for Berlin.
- Just go!

904
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:42,795
We're out of gas.

905
01:36:08,028 --> 01:36:11,020
We'll probably have
to surrender any time now.

906
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,225
Miller insisted on
rigging up the.30 caliber.

907
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,234
But without a real mount...

908
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:18,669
it probably wouldn't sit still
long enough to hit anything.

909
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:23,438
We can't stay here long,
and the jeep is dead.

910
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:26,537
I wish Shutzer were here.
He might know what to do.

911
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:30,584
I'm through playing soldier.

912
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:13,325
Did you see those markings?
That was honest-to-shit SS.

913
01:37:14,762 --> 01:37:17,595
What do we do now, Will?

914
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:20,862
We stay away from them.

915
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:24,530
What, you think they were
advancing or retreating?

916
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:29,938
I wonder what they'll think?

917
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:34,037
Maybe this will convince them
I am over the edge.

918
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:36,275
We'll have a mutiny.

919
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,318
I'll join it.

920
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:44,216
- Thirty caliber?
- We'll bury it.

921
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:47,692
- Radio?
- Bury it.

922
01:37:47,761 --> 01:37:52,528
- Rifes too?
- There's no other way.

923
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:58,095
Even if we pull this off and get back,
what are we going to say?

924
01:37:58,172 --> 01:38:02,302
We'll say we were captured and they
took our weapons and then we escaped.

925
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,674
But I'm thinking with
all this confusion going on...

926
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:06,804
there's not gonna be
too many questions.

927
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:14,051
We do it together or nothing.

928
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:17,989
If anybody has any objections,
any at all, speak up now.

929
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:21,786
Well, for what it's worth,
I say we do it.

930
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:25,565
Yeah, me too.

931
01:38:25,633 --> 01:38:30,866
I mean, the idea's so wild, I'd be sorry
for the rest of my life if I didn't try.

932
01:38:30,938 --> 01:38:34,806
Of course, the rest of my life
could be today.

933
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:39,739
Mother, don't let us pressure you.
You make up your own mind.

934
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:45,618
I already have. I was only
waiting on the other guys...

935
01:38:45,686 --> 01:38:48,177
so I wouldn't
put pressure on them.

936
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:55,387
This could be the deepest finesse
in squad history.

937
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:04,804
I've never seen a better smile.

938
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:08,672
It's the smile I need to make myself
do what we're gonna do.

939
01:39:26,694 --> 01:39:28,662
All right.

940
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:10,289
Bleacher!

941
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:14,657
Bleacher, goddamn it!

942
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:16,999
We don't know the counter.
We're from another sector.

943
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,539
Stay where you are.

944
01:41:24,978 --> 01:41:27,037
We're Americans.

945
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:38,755
Is that blood?

946
01:41:40,494 --> 01:41:43,463
We give him our escape story.

947
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:46,055
They tell us to take Father
to the grave registrar.

948
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:20,024
They drive us back
to our own regiment.

949
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:24,264
I'm sent straight to Ware,
and I tell him our story.

950
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:26,738
I wander into
the kitchen tent...

951
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:31,403
and curl up to sleep behind
the warm pots of hot water.

952
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:50,587
Just wanted to let you know
it's all settled.

953
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:54,892
Since you weren't in a POW compound,
you won't have to go through clearance.

954
01:42:54,968 --> 01:42:57,198
You can go right back
out in the field.

955
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:01,173
I'm gonna fill out your platoon
with an antitank group they broke up.

956
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:04,005
I put in for a Bronze Star
for Wilkins.

957
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:07,274
Had him reassigned to the motor pool.
He's gonna be okay.

958
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:08,780
Thank you, sir.

959
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:14,018
Just wanted you to know I did my best
to radio you before we pulled out...

960
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:16,021
but Griffin said
there wasn't any time.

961
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,456
How's Shutzer doing?

962
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:24,258
Real tough shit. He was dead
before we even got back.

963
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:29,030
Kraut was dead too. Didn't even
have time to interrogate him.

964
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:31,332
Before I go, you're gonna have to
fill out a statement of charges...

965
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:33,896
for the jeep, radio and phones.

966
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:58,828
We'll be moving out soon.

967
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:02,062
Gonna push those fucking Kraut
bastards all the way back to Berlin.

968
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:09,566
Merry Christmas, Knott.
