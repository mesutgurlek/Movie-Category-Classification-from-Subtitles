Enjoy the Movie.

1
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,651
Fuller.

2
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,677
Feel lucky today?

3
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,167
I guess he ain't superstitious.

4
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,642
Three on a light, it's bad luck.

5
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,909
Counting me, that makes four.

6
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,254
So what does that mean?

7
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:07,567
Dear Mr. Smith,

8
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:10,128
My father passed away on January 15th.

9
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,015
Dad never really shared much
about the war with us kids,

10
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:14,902
and I know talking to you was a comfort.

11
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,023
Thank you.

12
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:17,486
He asked me to let you know
when he passed,

13
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,691
and to tell you next time
he wants more than three rounds.

14
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,680
He said you would understand.

15
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,534
You're lucky to be going back
to your old unit.

16
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:34,518
That don't happen much anymore.

17
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:40,461
You want me to mail that?

18
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:41,876
That to your girl back home?

19
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,289
It was 1943 when I went to war.

20
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,245
I was almost 19.

21
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:51,342
Some things about those years
I've forgotten.

22
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,486
Others I'd rather forget.

23
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:57,740
I suppose there still isn't a day
that I don't think about

24
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:00,628
some of those guys
I shared foxholes with-

25
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:03,408
the friends I knew and lost.

26
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,219
You come back to us, son.

27
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,385
Don't you dare get yourself killed.

28
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:31,759
I'll come back, Ma.

29
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:37,167
You be good, pumpkin.

30
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,902
I'm sorry to leave you
with so much work, Pa.

31
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,136
This war-

32
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:11,593
Son, I know.

33
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:12,847
We'll be fine.

34
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:17,039
You're a good son.

35
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:18,288
Godspeed.

36
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:20,874
Yes, sir.

37
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,155
Thank you, sir.

38
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,394
Angelo Benedetto?

39
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:28,140
I see you are before this court
once again,

40
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:30,662
this time charged with a number
of serious offenses.

41
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,711
Your Honor,
not all of those were my fault.

42
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:35,598
I admit I made some mistakes-

43
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,038
How's that?

44
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,959
My friends, they would give me
stuff to pawn for them,

45
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:40,365
but I didn't know it was stolen.

46
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:41,487
Honest, Your Honor.

47
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:44,138
And the robbery was just a mistake, too?

48
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,726
You realize this could
land you in prison for five years.

49
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:49,286
Your Honor, the defendant
is completely aware

50
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,214
of the seriousness of the charges,

51
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,369
but he was completely unaware
that a robbery was even taking place.

52
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,591
Yeah, I know.

53
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:59,526
He claims they pushed him into the car.

54
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,631
Now, that's a pretty tall tale,
wouldn't you say, counselor?

55
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:07,207
Well, yes, Your Honor,
but Mr. Benedetto insists that it's the truth.

56
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:10,725
He does, however, recognize
how this might appear to the court.

57
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,310
Your Honor, if I may,
I'd like to make a suggestion

58
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:19,367
that may save the court
the unnecessary nuisance of a trial.

59
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,885
We would proffer, in lieu of a dismissal,

60
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:28,106
that Mr. Benedetto seeks service
in the United States Armed Forces.

61
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:29,612
What the hell are you doing?

62
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:32,807
Look, kid, with your record,
you're 4F. They can't take you.

63
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,403
You're going to be off scot-free.

64
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:35,627
Trust me.

65
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,779
So, Mr. Benedetto,

66
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:39,016
you'd be willing to go into the military?

67
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:40,807
Yes, Your Honor.

68
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,931
Very well.

69
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:45,860
As a result of the recent changes
in the draft code,

70
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:48,419
which now authorizes me to do so,

71
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:51,623
I hereby accept counsel's motion.

72
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:54,179
You're ordered to report
to the local draft board,

73
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:58,986
where you will be immediately inducted
into the nation's armed services.

74
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:03,785
And the court further orders
that Mr. Benedetto's draft classification

75
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,021
be changed from 4F to 1A,

76
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:11,141
removing any obstructions
to a successful and speedy enlistment.

77
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:13,445
Good luck, Mr. Benedetto.

78
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:15,140
Next case.

79
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:16,361
What does that mean?

80
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:18,981
What does that mean?
What is he saying?

81
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:20,201
It's a technicality.

82
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:21,696
- What does that mean?
- I'll talk to you later.

83
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:22,921
Just tell me what it means.

84
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:24,896
Go ahead.

85
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:29,060
CBS World News now presents
15 minutes of news and analysis.

86
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:31,944
First, a summary of today's developments
by Major Palmer,

87
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:34,562
followed by analysis by Quentin Powell.

88
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:39,842
Hey, Joe, the car runs great.
See you next week.

89
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:43,143
That will be $1.25.

90
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,135
One dollar, two bits.

91
00:07:56,936 --> 00:08:00,002
Hey, take this, you little Kraut.

92
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,143
Go discuss that with your F?hrer, huh?

93
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,503
I am not a Kraut. I am an American.

94
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,926
I'm the whistler.

95
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,231
Look, I know I haven't a chance.

96
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,828
I know that I can't live.

97
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:31,073
I can tell the way
that a doctor looks at me.

98
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,629
And you, too.
Why don't you tell me the truth?

99
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:34,885
Why don't you?

100
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,909
I thought you said you were
going to try to get a transfer.

101
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:41,250
You have a family now.

102
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,132
Hey, I know,

103
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,381
but this is war.

104
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,171
There's no way I can get out
of going overseas now.

105
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,368
I was just lucky to get a three-day pass
to come home to see you.

106
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,356
But why the infantry?

107
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:01,411
Hey, infantry means I'll be
one of the first guys sent home

108
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,069
when this thing's all over.

109
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,275
There's nothing I can do.

110
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:21,570
I got to do my part.

111
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:25,083
What am I going to do without you?

112
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,074
And what about the baby?

113
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:32,448
Baby, it's going to be okay.

114
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:33,698
Come on.

115
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:36,481
It's going to be okay.

116
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:40,768
Now you can start your campaign.

117
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:44,314
But I- I won't be around to participate.

118
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:54,561
Okay, that's the last one.

119
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:55,835
I got to go.

120
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:57,498
Can you clean up?

121
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:12,028
Thanks for the lift, Charlie.
I got to go.

122
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,725
World News Today,
brought to you by the...

123
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,207
Great voice tonight, Doreen.

124
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:27,454
Thank you.

125
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:32,729
I'm sorry. I tried to get here.

126
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,391
I had to finish an order at the mill.

127
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:35,551
What time is it now?

128
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,112
It's 11:55.

129
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:38,938
You told me you might be late.

130
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,072
I figured you'd do your best
to get here if you could.

131
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,523
I thought I'd stick around
just a little longer.

132
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,717
I'm so sorry I'm late.

133
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:49,271
Don't worry.
I had a good time anyway.

134
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:53,531
They made me sing a couple numbers.

135
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,572
This isn't my usual.

136
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:57,914
- I had a suit at home. I wanted to-
- No.

137
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:00,572
It's okay.

138
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:04,855
Listen, you're here now.

139
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,483
Dance with me.

140
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,011
There's no music, and I'm a bit dirty.

141
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,677
It's not important.

142
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,555
Come on, Doreen. It's time to go.

143
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:41,905
Who's that?

144
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:43,439
One of the guys I came with.

145
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:44,922
One of the guys you came with?

146
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:50,546
I came with two guys, Don and Bill.

147
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,538
I've been dancing with them
most of the night.

148
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:57,331
My brothers.

149
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,152
They're the ones needing chaperones.

150
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,225
Come on, sis. Let's go.

151
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,265
They dance pretty good for brothers,

152
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,468
but I'm glad I got to dance with you.

153
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,392
I hope it was worth the wait.

154
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,312
Maybe.

155
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,132
I'll think about it and let you know.

156
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:18,072
But I have to go now.

157
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,728
Bye for now.

158
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:39,123
Hey, Don, how'd it go?

159
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:40,719
I was looking for you all night.

160
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:42,318
I was late.

161
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:43,601
Day late and a dollar short.

162
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,197
That doesn't matter.

163
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,126
I saw you two.

164
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:49,678
She didn't seem too upset.

165
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:50,961
She must like you.

166
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:52,557
Maybe.

167
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:53,840
I hope so.

168
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,398
Heck, she invited you, didn't she?

169
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:57,680
You like her?

170
00:12:57,783 --> 00:13:00,466
Yeah, I do, but...

171
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,435
if I'm not around,
it'll be hard to do anything about it.

172
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:05,681
What?

173
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:08,400
Hell, Bud, I got this in the mail.

174
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,804
Been carrying it around.

175
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:12,909
Guess I'm a little late on everything.

176
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:19,283
They want me to report next week.

177
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,943
I should have gotten to know her sooner.

178
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,532
Damn.

179
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:29,614
Well, you can always write.

180
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:32,172
Sure, write her letters.

181
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:35,692
The guy that pretty much stood her up.

182
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:38,065
Come on, you don't give up that easy.

183
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:45,835
Midway 153.

184
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,391
I got it.

185
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,172
Hello?

186
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,195
- Hi, Doreen?
- Yes?

187
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:56,171
How are you?

188
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,414
Is this Don Smith?

189
00:13:58,515 --> 00:13:59,759
Wow, what a surprise.

190
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:01,615
Yeah, I called a couple hours ago.

191
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,865
Your mom answered.

192
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,452
I just got home.

193
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:08,654
So I suppose this means
you've made up your mind.

194
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,999
How's that?

195
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,854
Have you made up your mind?

196
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:13,131
About what?

197
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,958
About paying me a visit.

198
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:16,651
I was supposed to pay you a visit?

199
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:21,030
Well, if a girl asks a guy to a dance
and he barely shows up,

200
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:25,230
but she still waits to dance with him,
can you tell me why not?

201
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,469
He'd have to be an idiot.

202
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:29,392
Or have a real good reason.

203
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,945
Which one is it?

204
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,228
Don?

205
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:34,671
What? I couldn't hear you.

206
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:36,777
I said, which one is it?

207
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:39,499
I'm sure I'm not an idiot.

208
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:41,062
That remains a question.

209
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,708
If someone is going away,

210
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:47,303
and isn't sure if-

211
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,864
Don Smith, how's a girl
supposed to share any news?

212
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:51,277
Who told you?

213
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:54,343
Told me? Who told me what?

214
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:56,782
Who told you I'm going
to San Francisco?

215
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,505
You're going to San Francisco?

216
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:01,707
I was accepted at the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music.

217
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:06,859
Wow, that sounds like
the chance of a lifetime.

218
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,415
It is the chance of a lifetime.

219
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,229
I want to go, but to tell the truth,
I'm kind of scared.

220
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,018
I know what you mean.

221
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,258
But that's great. I'm...

222
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,175
really happy for you.

223
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:23,882
There's a lot I'm going to miss.

224
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:25,958
Please deposit ten cents
for the next three minutes.

225
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:28,200
Hello?

226
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,157
Operator, I don't have the change.

227
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:33,254
- Don? Where are you at?
- Doreen?

228
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:35,244
I'm sorry, sir.
I have to disconnect you now.

229
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:38,277
Now boarding the 2:15, Portland to Chicago.
This is your last call.

230
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,443
Mom, did Don Smith call earlier?

231
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,719
Yes, he called while you were out.

232
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,960
He said he'd try later.
Was that Don on the phone?

233
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,198
Yes, but it was long distance.

234
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,439
Well, he said that he's been drafted.

235
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,640
He's in Portland now, probably
at the bus or the train station.

236
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,155
No, no. All I could talk about
was San Francisco.

237
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,359
I didn't even ask about him,
or where he-

238
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,826
Mom, I'm such an idiot.

239
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,041
You're lucky to be going back
to your old unit.

240
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,633
That don't happen much anymore.

241
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,233
All I've seen was just replacements.

242
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,459
So what happened to you?

243
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,610
I heard you were in Nennig.

244
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,932
I heard it got pretty nasty up there.

245
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,817
Couple of the guys told me
there's not much left of that town.

246
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:27,972
Shit, we got them Krauts
on the run now, though.

247
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:31,554
Dear Doreen, I am going overseas.

248
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,862
I wish we could have had
more time together,

249
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,970
as there are things
that I would like to have said.

250
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:37,896
I've wanted to send you this letter
so many times,

251
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:40,776
but I don't know now if I will ever
have the chance,

252
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,282
or if it will even matter.

253
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:50,441
Too many bloody Yanks.

254
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:55,263
Starks.

255
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,052
Starks, I lost you boarding.

256
00:16:58,153 --> 00:16:59,304
I wasn't sure if-

257
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:01,887
Where'd you go?

258
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:04,448
Throw my bag on the pile.

259
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:07,335
Something wrong?

260
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,254
My wife took the bus down
from Sackets Harbor.

261
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:10,847
I was supposed to meet them.

262
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:15,654
I had to go pick up the troop's
berthing assignments from the lieutenant.

263
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:18,468
That's tough. I'm sorry.

264
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:21,023
Well, at least you know his transport's due.

265
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:22,950
My life, four words-

266
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:24,870
Didn't see that coming.

267
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:26,528
- That sounds familiar.
- Yeah.

268
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,491
Maybe I'll bring it up as one of our topics
of the day so we can all bitch about it.

269
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,141
Excuse me, I'm in the wrong section.

270
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:43,741
I am in supply.

271
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,187
I am American.

272
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,904
The hell you say.

273
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:50,046
Shit, target practice, maybe.

274
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,824
Hey, this rack taken?

275
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:59,419
Want another card or what?

276
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:01,664
Come on, take one. I bet it's good.

277
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,587
Hey, greaseball, this rack taken?

278
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:04,864
I'll greaseball your sorry ass.

279
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:05,988
Sure, come on, goomba.

280
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:07,265
Hey, Benedetto, save it.

281
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:08,516
Come on.

282
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,419
Come on, Ken, you're not supposed
to show me your hand.

283
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:13,827
You dumb farmer.

284
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,075
I'm out.

285
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,722
Farmer?

286
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,875
Where from?

287
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:22,048
Kansas.

288
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,319
Near Norris.

289
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,848
Never heard of it.

290
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:32,860
Feels like we're on the move.

291
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,543
You know, I feel like a cattle down here.

292
00:18:36,643 --> 00:18:38,398
Here.

293
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,651
Write your V-Mail.

294
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,603
V- Mail?

295
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,837
How am I supposed to write
on something so small?

296
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,215
Keep it short and sweet, you know.

297
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:47,387
Dear folks, off to war.

298
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,149
Having fun.

299
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:51,226
Love, Angelo.

300
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,792
Can't say nothing anyway.

301
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,473
First class accommodations.

302
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:11,032
Not like any first class I can remember.

303
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:12,631
When were you that lucky?

304
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:15,192
Back when I was rich, young, and stupid.

305
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:17,119
Never was lucky.

306
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:21,592
Hey, speaking of young and stupid, here.
I'm giving this back to you.

307
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:23,191
Why? You won it.

308
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,712
Do you know how
to whip-shot dice, Smith?

309
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:27,995
- No.
- Yeah, well, I do,

310
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,591
and so does Benedetto.

311
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:30,907
The game wasn't straight.

312
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:33,429
The bet wasn't fair.
I'm giving it back.

313
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,714
Well, thanks, but I-

314
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:38,558
No buts. Just stay out of
Benedetto's dice games.

315
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:41,655
Money's not that important,
and you're no good at dice.

316
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,060
Try your hand at poker.

317
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,757
Hey, Smith, want to play some cards?

318
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,349
Hey, Fuller.

319
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,594
Cards? Not this time, Benedetto.

320
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,069
Come on, I'll go easy on you.

321
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:00,950
Okay, cut the chatter and listen up.

322
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:04,469
For those of you I do not know,
my name is Corporal Starks,

323
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:08,120
and I get to take care of your sorry butts
for the next week.

324
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:11,125
Now you need to remember
that we are in the blue section-

325
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:12,855
troop compartment 4.

326
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,608
There are thousands of soldiers
on this boat,

327
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,532
so the important stuff first.

328
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,452
We eat in shifts.

329
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,727
Only two meals a day.

330
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:22,652
- Come on.
- You got to be kidding me.

331
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,123
Just eat hearty.

332
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:28,279
Physical training will start
at 1100 hours each day,

333
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:29,690
followed by lifeboat drills.

334
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:31,797
You will be there.

335
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:33,051
Take a look around, boys.

336
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,043
This might be the last time you're on
a boat as nice as the Queen Elizabeth.

337
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:40,564
You're free to wander the mid-decks
until 2100 hours,

338
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:42,491
unless battle stations are called.

339
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:43,963
If battle stations are called,

340
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,645
your battle station is here.

341
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,122
Do not get lost.

342
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,488
Do not get in the way of the gun crews.

343
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:54,647
And do not bother the limeys.

344
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:58,490
There is absolutely no smoking
above decks at night,

345
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:00,562
and no throwing trash overboard.

346
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,286
U- boats are looking for targets.

347
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,143
Do not make us one.

348
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:10,417
Otherwise, try and have a good time,
if you can.

349
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:12,982
Where we going, Starks?

350
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:18,901
We're going to war, son.

351
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:20,726
This is the real thing.

352
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:24,561
We're going to fight the Nazis.

353
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,561
And we're going to kill them all.

354
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,177
Every last one of them.

355
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,543
On our way overseas,
we had a lot of time to think about things.

356
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,056
After a short stop in Scotland,
we were back on our journey to a war

357
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,298
that up until now, we'd only heard about.

358
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,419
I think we all masked that fear in our gut
with false bravado and nervous laughter.

359
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,670
You feel lucky today?

360
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:05,875
I guess he ain't superstitious.

361
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,172
Three on a light. It's bad luck.

362
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:13,557
Counting me, that makes four.
So what does that mean?

363
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,378
Either you're really screwed,

364
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,788
or we are,

365
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:18,479
and you get to make a wish.

366
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,960
Either way, it's a hell of a call for a light.

367
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:26,030
Go ahead, Smith. Make a wish.

368
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:30,318
A wish?

369
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,188
Some 50,000 German troops

370
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:41,392
had been cut off when Patton
pushed through after Normandy.

371
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,566
They were stuck, their backs to the sea,

372
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:45,873
and the 94th,
along with the French resistance,

373
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:49,071
dug in in protective and log bunkers
in the hills surrounding them.

374
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,627
Our orders- keep them there,

375
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,871
which on most days wasn't too hard.

376
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,012
It was the nights that got interesting.

377
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:17,616
It's quiet for a change.

378
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:20,914
No artillery.

379
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:26,831
Maybe they ran out of ammunition.

380
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,922
We can hope.

381
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:37,037
Shut it down, Fuller.

382
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:39,184
You're going to wake the Germans.

383
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:46,983
You know, Smith, I think I spent more time
sleeping with you guys than my wife.

384
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,952
That's a sad commentary, Starks.

385
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:56,844
I suppose I should write her again
pretty soon.

386
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:58,374
She might forget who I am.

387
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:01,552
Yeah.

388
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:07,567
She made the best pies you ever ate.

389
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,727
Your mom make pie?

390
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,638
Where'd Benedetto go?

391
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,655
He must be taking a piss or something.

392
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,938
God damn it.

393
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,217
He left his carbine here.

394
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,529
What's he doing without his weapon?

395
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:30,413
Maybe he thinks he needs both hands.

396
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,893
That boy's got light fingers
and a nature for a deal.

397
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:36,780
What? What do you mean?

398
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:39,366
I mean the army's the only thing
that kept him out of jail.

399
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,045
Hey, watch it.

400
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,538
That goomba-
You better check if he took your wallet.

401
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:53,739
Maurice, my friend, how you doing?

402
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,989
Benedetto.

403
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:58,470
I have been expecting you.

404
00:24:58,573 --> 00:24:59,724
Yes.

405
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:01,032
What the hell is this?

406
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,205
Calvados.

407
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,829
Brandy.

408
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:07,558
Regrettably these days,

409
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:11,622
it has no chance to grow old.

410
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:15,434
But this is finely aged.

411
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:19,591
With this, you can start fires,
refill lighters.

412
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,220
You can even drink it.

413
00:25:21,324 --> 00:25:23,745
I bet half your buddies
make this in their canteens.

414
00:25:23,853 --> 00:25:27,267
Well, my friend,

415
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:30,667
I guess this is too good
for your American taste.

416
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:33,763
Hang on, hang on.
I got more taste than your mother.

417
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:40,710
So you want to deal?

418
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:44,586
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

419
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:47,682
The point is what do you have?

420
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,873
All right, all right, all right.

421
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,688
Look at what I got.

422
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:04,328
And cigarettes?

423
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:05,576
You got it.

424
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:10,793
American cigarettes.

425
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,166
Pleasure doing business.

426
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:02,789
Stay.

427
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,228
Maybe we can have some other
mutually advantageous...

428
00:27:09,222 --> 00:27:10,399
What?

429
00:27:10,502 --> 00:27:12,324
Pilferage.

430
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,178
Maybe.

431
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:15,397
You know what? Another time.

432
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:18,082
They're going to miss me,
so I got to get back. See you later.

433
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:28,484
Starting up with the 88s again.
We got incoming!

434
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:32,189
- Ready?
- Yeah.

435
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,496
What, you see something?

436
00:27:34,596 --> 00:27:36,637
I'm not sure.

437
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:52,319
Tell those Krauts to go back to bed.

438
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,875
We've got some on our left flank.

439
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:57,827
We've got Krauts moving up out there.

440
00:27:59,171 --> 00:28:00,322
Thirty.

441
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:10,499
- Go! Get down! Come on!
- Move in!

442
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:12,927
Over here.

443
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:15,612
How'd they get so damned close?

444
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,171
- Take the gun.
- Come on.

445
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:33,470
Son of a bitch, what was that?
That wasn't an 88.

446
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:35,259
Here comes another one.

447
00:28:36,897 --> 00:28:38,904
Try to cut across to the gully below us.

448
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:42,783
I'll take the gun.

449
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:46,079
Stop, they're down below us!

450
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:48,478
I know, I know. I'm trying
to keep their men back.

451
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:52,475
Where's the mortars?
Don't the frogs have mortars?

452
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:57,909
We got spotters up there.
They must be ranging in those coastal guns.

453
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:03,710
Nice entrance, Brooklyn.

454
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,263
- Hey, are you okay?
- Leave me alone. I'm fine.

455
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:07,517
Goddamn Nazi assholes.

456
00:29:10,654 --> 00:29:12,083
Can we range in on that spotter out there?

457
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:14,263
Kind of busy with our left flank right now.

458
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:17,854
Mortars, finally.

459
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:23,128
I'm going to see if I can get
a sharpshooter on that spotter.

460
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:32,503
Briggs, Briggs, Briggs.

461
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,429
You see that spotter out there?

462
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:36,981
Yeah, I'm already on it.

463
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:39,540
But they're pretty far out.

464
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:42,962
I just have to wait
until we see some movement.

465
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:47,481
Sure. I don't think they sell it, though.

466
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:48,825
Yeah. Hang on.

467
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:54,172
That one was on the mark.

468
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,388
First mistake they make is to freeze.

469
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:03,098
Stay there.

470
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,340
The second one's down, too.

471
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,669
Come on, you bastards.

472
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:40,469
I think we're back to 88s for a while.

473
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:45,968
Guess I'll just keep poking at it
to see if we're here.

474
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:49,172
God damn it.
Away from your post, no weapon?

475
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:50,550
You pull a stunt like that again,

476
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,551
what's left of you
after I'm through with you,

477
00:30:53,657 --> 00:30:55,600
the Army won't want to put in jail.

478
00:30:55,704 --> 00:30:57,614
Where the hell were you?

479
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,346
- Where the hell-
- Maurice.

480
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:03,342
He was right in front of me.
Now he's gone. He's just gone.

481
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:07,671
Benedetto, damn it,
get yourself cleaned up.

482
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,288
Look at me.

483
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:13,557
Get yourself cleaned up.

484
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:20,502
Come on, Brooklyn.

485
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,061
Starks.

486
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:34,933
What?

487
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:36,151
Are you okay?

488
00:31:36,152 --> 00:31:38,038
No, I want to beat the shit out of-

489
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:42,134
Just give me a minute.

490
00:31:57,686 --> 00:32:00,784
We've been in France
for three months now.

491
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,340
You'd think we'd get
some local food for a change.

492
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:06,062
As far as I'm concerned,
you can take France

493
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:09,100
and shove it up the ass
of the nearest German.

494
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:10,698
Is that the topic of the day?

495
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,299
Yeah, I suppose it'll do.

496
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:15,186
Kind of liked
our topic of the day discussions.

497
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,324
Since we left England,
you kind of dropped off.

498
00:32:18,485 --> 00:32:20,306
I have, haven't I?

499
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,860
So the subject is France, right?

500
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:25,419
Not the capacity of the German ass.

501
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:27,857
Yeah.

502
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:29,106
Okay.

503
00:32:29,204 --> 00:32:34,059
As for France, Paris is okay, I suppose.

504
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:38,057
Haven't seen much else,
except for the Germans trying to kill us.

505
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:43,597
Yes, our honorable enemy with whom
we continue our three-month stalemate.

506
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:47,758
We got them right where they want us.

507
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:50,160
We won't move.

508
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:51,917
We can't move.

509
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:54,157
They can't move.

510
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:58,961
We want them there.
They seem content to stay there.

511
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:03,434
Little trap, playing shooting gallery.

512
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:07,214
We don't advance. They don't advance.
It's horse shit.

513
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:09,833
You'd rather be with Patton right now?

514
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:11,846
No. Frankly, I'd rather be bored right here.

515
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:14,321
Better odds.

516
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:16,240
Well, this isn't much like fighting,

517
00:33:16,337 --> 00:33:18,476
except for maybe today.

518
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:22,373
Sit around,
count how many shells are duds.

519
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,829
You know, I'd almost rather worry
about a bullet with my name on it

520
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:29,035
than a shell addressed
"to whom it may concern. "

521
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:31,274
That old question.

522
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,198
Didn't we talk about that once or twice?

523
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:35,597
Destiny or random probability.

524
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:38,630
Guess it's a good object lesson.

525
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:44,365
Just out of range, slight variation
in the charge, aiming, the crew,

526
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:46,852
barrel temperature...

527
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:50,091
It won't hit the same hole twice.

528
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:51,402
They might.

529
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:55,432
They seem to have plenty enough shells
to hit our little hole.

530
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,088
So as probability goes, the more they fire,

531
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,645
the more we should figure
we're all dead men.

532
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:02,125
And I don't like it much.

533
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,954
Goddamn German ambitions.

534
00:34:07,054 --> 00:34:08,647
Come on, General.

535
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,408
Those Germans.

536
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,682
See, I have a particular
perspective on things.

537
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:16,972
Guess we're the guys
that get to tell them they're wrong.

538
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,525
Well, they don't listen too well.

539
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:22,084
And I'm getting
a particularly nasty perspective

540
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,563
on those bastards, too.

541
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:36,743
Smith, you got to tell me,
when are you going to mail that letter?

542
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,251
Not sure if I ever will.

543
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:42,187
Come on, you've been
working on that thing off and on

544
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:44,107
for what, months now.

545
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:46,342
Just send it to your girl.

546
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:47,786
How do you know it's to my girl?

547
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:52,422
Because you look too serious
when you pull it out.

548
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,938
I don't exactly have a girl yet.

549
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:57,537
I pry things from you.

550
00:34:57,643 --> 00:34:59,781
You never tell me anything.

551
00:34:59,883 --> 00:35:02,338
Who are you writing it to, then?

552
00:35:02,443 --> 00:35:04,266
Just a girl I met, okay?

553
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:07,462
It was before the army got me.

554
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:09,700
- And?
- And what?

555
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:12,323
And so what does she look like?
How'd you meet her?

556
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:18,656
This is Doreen.

557
00:35:18,762 --> 00:35:19,880
She has red hair.

558
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:21,191
She was Harvest Princess there.

559
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:26,022
You have a picture of her
from the newspaper.

560
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:27,649
You two must be real close.

561
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:31,710
Knock it off, Starks.

562
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:33,639
I didn't get a chance.

563
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:36,355
We just met. It didn't quite
work out for us.

564
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:37,607
Sorry.

565
00:35:38,856 --> 00:35:41,191
Look, if I had any piece of advice
to give you,

566
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,190
do yourself a favor-
just send it to her.

567
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:46,750
Take a chance.

568
00:35:46,857 --> 00:35:49,312
It's just...

569
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,238
we only were at one dance.

570
00:35:51,336 --> 00:35:52,830
I was working nights at the mill.

571
00:35:52,936 --> 00:35:56,034
Weekends I had to study,
then I got drafted.

572
00:35:56,135 --> 00:35:59,234
She sure made an impression on me.

573
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:01,792
Not sure if she even really likes me.

574
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:04,034
Come on, not like you?

575
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:05,313
You've got that Latin blood.

576
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:09,758
Your big Italian eyes
are going to melt her heart.

577
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:14,271
You've never seen
my wife and kid, have you?

578
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,197
Nope. Figured you'd show me some day.

579
00:36:16,295 --> 00:36:17,473
Yeah.

580
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,136
I guess it's my turn.

581
00:36:25,254 --> 00:36:26,405
Nice-looking.

582
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:28,804
Kid, too.

583
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,287
I think I worry about them
more than I worry about me.

584
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,844
And I worry about me a lot.

585
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:43,324
Come on.

586
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:45,568
Let's get some food
back to Fuller and Benedetto,

587
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:47,523
before the Spam tries to escape.

588
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:52,290
So I told him I was going to hit him
in the face with a 2x4

589
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:53,883
if he didn't give me my 30 bucks.

590
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:55,483
Hey, you guys rotating out?

591
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,410
Yeah, we're headed
back to Heteborn for a break.

592
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:58,685
Plenty of traffic on this road lately.

593
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:00,927
Yeah, lots of troops moving up
in the northern sector.

594
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:02,522
I thought so.

595
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:05,083
Not with you guys. We're the ones
getting hit with the big artillery.

596
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:06,681
Sorry.

597
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,129
Hey, I've seen some of them craters.

598
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,845
Don't send them our way.

599
00:37:10,948 --> 00:37:13,314
So anyways, $30 later...

600
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,955
Benedetto's going to bitch.
Another cold breakfast.

601
00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:19,807
It's the law of the universe.

602
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:23,966
It'll be our turn to bitch when they
run for chow and we get cold breakfast.

603
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,822
Still beats eating nothing at all.

604
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:27,073
Yeah.

605
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,944
I've had my share of soup lines,
that's for sure.

606
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,536
- Come on.
- No, it's true.

607
00:37:32,642 --> 00:37:36,385
After the market crash,
my family was left without a dime.

608
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:37,976
Ended my college years.

609
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:39,642
Then the war broke out.

610
00:37:39,746 --> 00:37:41,632
Then the war broke out.

611
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,021
And it'll end, some day.

612
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:49,824
Hell, hard to count on anything.

613
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,481
Is that why you've never
finished that letter?

614
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:58,780
You got to learn
to count on something, Smith.

615
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:01,019
Sometimes, that's the hardest thing,

616
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,139
but if it's tough, then you got to
probably figure it's the best thing to do.

617
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:07,391
I know.

618
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,219
I almost gave up.

619
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,207
Been through a lot of twists in my life.

620
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,859
If it makes your letter-writing
decision any easier,

621
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,017
you should know it's not rotation coming.

622
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,296
What do you mean, it's not rotation?

623
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:27,894
I mean, we're rotating out,

624
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:31,415
but we're moving east across
the German border.

625
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,974
Come Christmas and New Year's,
we're going to be on the move.

626
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,178
- Who told you that?
- The platoon sergeant, yesterday.

627
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:40,060
Seems the general thinks
we might be getting a little stale.

628
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:42,198
Stale? Hell, we're moldy.

629
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:48,315
Hey, buddy, can you let us out here? Thanks.

630
00:38:54,237 --> 00:38:56,377
Yeah, we'll get through this damn war.

631
00:38:56,477 --> 00:38:59,259
One of these days,
I might even get home to see my kid.

632
00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:00,851
You haven't see your kid?

633
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:03,096
No, born after I left.

634
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:04,440
That's tough.

635
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,693
Hopefully, the war-

636
00:39:21,244 --> 00:39:22,553
Starks, you okay?

637
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,440
Yeah. Just stay down.

638
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,995
I'm staying down, I'm staying down.

639
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:34,422
That was a little too close.

640
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:36,115
Starks, you okay?

641
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,910
Yeah.

642
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,068
Starks? Starks?

643
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,322
Starks.

644
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:48,921
I didn't see that one coming.

645
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,344
Oh, God. Help me!

646
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:54,100
We got a wounded man.

647
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:58,293
Hey, kid. Look, he's bleeding.
He don't look too good.

648
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:00,304
I ain't no medic, but that man's dead.

649
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,904
Go get the kit.

650
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:04,628
- Screw the kit.
- Go get the kit.

651
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:07,032
Come on.
They came to shoot up the forest.

652
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:09,912
You're going to die. We're going to die.

653
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,798
We'll come back.

654
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:13,304
- We'll come back.
- No.

655
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:48,558
Every few weeks, they'd pull us off the line
to rest, shower, and clean up.

656
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,118
Smith. Hey, Smith.

657
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:52,499
They want you up at the CP.

658
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,524
It always felt like you could
wash away everything,

659
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,827
except what was happening to you
on the inside.

660
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:26,132
Buddy, you got a smoke?

661
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:31,373
Private Smith, reporting as ordered, sir.

662
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:33,332
At ease.

663
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:35,217
Smith, I need a few answers
from your perspective

664
00:41:35,317 --> 00:41:36,495
about this witless character here.

665
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:39,978
Soldier, not many discipline problems
reach this level,

666
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:42,419
so you can figure you've done
a really good job

667
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:43,693
of digging a hole for yourself.

668
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:45,138
Yes, sir.

669
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,177
Let's see what we got here.

670
00:41:49,044 --> 00:41:52,818
Where'd all this stuff come from, Benedetto?

671
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:55,697
Smith, you recognize anything here?

672
00:41:55,795 --> 00:41:58,577
Yes, sir. A keychain I thought was lost.

673
00:41:58,674 --> 00:41:59,852
Take it, then.

674
00:41:59,955 --> 00:42:02,770
The sergeant will make sure
everything else gets returned.

675
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:05,616
Sir, most of that was won
in honest crap games.

676
00:42:05,715 --> 00:42:09,130
Soldier, your name and honest
just don't go together.

677
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:10,728
Sir, I found that-

678
00:42:10,835 --> 00:42:11,986
As you were, Private.

679
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,021
Where the hell do you think you are?

680
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:18,025
We're facing a half a million
Krauts out there.

681
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,188
You see this?
It's a casualty report, God damn it.

682
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,948
Your buddies are dying,

683
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,351
and you act like this place
is your own personal racket.

684
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:29,230
Why are you in this army, anyway?

685
00:42:29,328 --> 00:42:31,151
To fight the Nazis, sir.

686
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:33,224
Well, it sure doesn't look like it, son.

687
00:42:33,328 --> 00:42:37,867
AWOL, petty larceny, desertion.

688
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:40,750
Do you know what they're doing
to deserters now?

689
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:43,303
Write home to your mother.
She'll be real proud of you.

690
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:45,263
I ain't got no parents, sir,

691
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,886
but I swear, it won't happen again, sir.

692
00:42:46,993 --> 00:42:49,261
The hell it won't.

693
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,905
Smith, your section's
already down one man.

694
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:55,146
If I turn this clown over
for a summary court martial,

695
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:56,366
you'll be down two.

696
00:42:56,367 --> 00:43:00,590
But we're hurting for replacements,
so what do you suggest I do?

697
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:01,865
Smith?

698
00:43:01,968 --> 00:43:03,145
Sir, I wouldn't-

699
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,937
I think Benedetto's
made a lot of mistakes.

700
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,902
Mistakes?
His mistakes will get you killed.

701
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,690
He is a risk to the lives
of you and your buddies,

702
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:13,449
let alone stealing from them.

703
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:18,444
Yes, sir. Permission to speak freely, sir.

704
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,036
We need all our men.

705
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:22,117
Smith, I think we need to get
another replacement.

706
00:43:22,223 --> 00:43:25,419
Maybe, Sarge, but Fuller and I
have been around Benedetto a while,

707
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:27,209
and yeah, he's done
some really stupid things,

708
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,684
but we're used to him.

709
00:43:28,782 --> 00:43:31,367
He does know his job, and it would be
hard to break in two new men.

710
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:33,445
- Sir, I-
- Can it, Benedetto.

711
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:35,371
Sergeant, get him out of my sight.

712
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:38,021
Hold him outside.

713
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:46,596
Smith, I'm sorry about Corporal Starks,
but you need to know now-

714
00:43:46,701 --> 00:43:50,116
We've got new orders.
The 376 just broke through the border,

715
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,649
and we're moving out soon to reinforce.

716
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:55,947
Where we're going, the Germans
will be fighting on their own soil.

717
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:58,116
Need I say more?

718
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,675
No, sir.

719
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,162
Men are dying out there.
We don't have time for this crap.

720
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:07,082
You think I should send Benedetto
back to your section?

721
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,936
Yes, I think so.

722
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:10,498
Okay. It's on you, then.

723
00:44:10,603 --> 00:44:14,377
Benedetto messes up again,
and I'll have both your hides.

724
00:44:14,474 --> 00:44:16,133
- Understand, Corporal?
- Yes, sir.

725
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,533
Corporal, sir?

726
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:20,129
Yes, Corporal.

727
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:22,689
Your promotion is effective immediately.

728
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:24,737
I'm sorry it comes to you like this.

729
00:44:24,842 --> 00:44:26,850
Starks was a damn good man,

730
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,093
but the sergeant and I
need a man in his place

731
00:44:29,194 --> 00:44:30,405
who we know we can rely on.

732
00:44:30,506 --> 00:44:32,775
We can rely on you, right?

733
00:44:32,874 --> 00:44:34,532
Yes, sir.

734
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:36,291
You're dismissed.

735
00:44:36,395 --> 00:44:39,329
Get those stripes on,
and don't let me down.

736
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:40,643
Yes, sir.

737
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:55,556
Smith.

738
00:44:55,657 --> 00:44:58,024
Thanks. in there. I owe you.

739
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:00,160
Goddamn right you owe me.

740
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:02,240
They went and made me Corporal.

741
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:04,547
All right, keep pushing. We almost got it.

742
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:09,343
Just keep pushing. We almost got it.

743
00:45:09,447 --> 00:45:10,941
- Come on, push.
- I'm pushing.

744
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:14,464
- We're supposed to get stuck?
- This won't do.

745
00:45:14,568 --> 00:45:16,771
- It is on full-wheel drive.
- You sure?

746
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:25,666
We all thought that the war
was going to be over by Christmas,

747
00:45:25,768 --> 00:45:30,469
but three weeks and 400 miles later,
we knew that wasn't going to happen.

748
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:33,086
For us, this was just the beginning.

749
00:45:36,327 --> 00:45:37,478
Almost out.

750
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:42,941
Hey, Smith, they're just about unstuck.

751
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:44,769
We won't be hanging around here
much more.

752
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:50,619
Get everyone on the truck.

753
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:52,286
I've got to get rid of my barracks back.

754
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,649
Just let go of it.

755
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:02,082
Kind of moody, I'd say,
taking over for Starks.

756
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:05,280
Losing Starks kind of shakes a guy up.

757
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:09,755
Hell, son, this war's starting
to catch us all off guard.

758
00:46:09,861 --> 00:46:11,683
M Company?

759
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:13,156
Who do we have here?

760
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,411
Heinrich.

761
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,274
- Hey, Smith.
- Yeah?

762
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,873
Are you in M Company?

763
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,158
Yeah.

764
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:37,495
I've got this bag here labeled "Starks,"
but he's not on the sheet for M Company.

765
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,798
Carry it around. Just put it
with the rest of our gear.

766
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,458
But he's not on the sheet.

767
00:46:53,058 --> 00:46:55,677
There. Now he's on the list.

768
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:58,299
Put it with M Company gear.
I'll take care of it another time. Not now.

769
00:47:06,433 --> 00:47:07,489
Who's this?

770
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,856
He jumped aboard before you.

771
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:11,447
This here's Heinrich.

772
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:14,651
Our new ammo carrier, thank God.

773
00:47:14,754 --> 00:47:16,313
And he brought us chocolate.

774
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,173
You been in the 302nd long?

775
00:47:18,272 --> 00:47:22,068
Just two weeks. I volunteer for supply,
and then for a unit on the line.

776
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:24,249
This was my family's country,
and I want to help you.

777
00:47:24,352 --> 00:47:27,134
You've got a bit of an accent there.

778
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:28,383
Two weeks.

779
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,969
All right.

780
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:32,249
Welcome to M Company.

781
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:33,726
Yeah, I come from Boston.

782
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:38,331
I apologize for the accent.
I was raised in Berlin until I was 13.

783
00:47:38,431 --> 00:47:41,530
I think you might want to learn
to say the passwords real good.

784
00:47:41,631 --> 00:47:43,125
What is it we are likely to run into?

785
00:47:43,231 --> 00:47:46,165
Who we're likely to run into?

786
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:47,765
Your fucking relatives, son.

787
00:47:47,871 --> 00:47:49,562
Goddamn Krauts.

788
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:54,105
And they'd like to shoot us. A lot.

789
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:58,167
Look, Heinrich, let me impress on you.

790
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,052
You just advanced yourself
into the serious war.

791
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,972
I will try my best for you, sir.

792
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,248
I hope to hell you will,

793
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,804
but we don't have time to teach you
not to do something stupid

794
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,732
that could get us all dead.

795
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,612
We've been shot at and shelled.

796
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,860
We already lost one man,

797
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:16,471
and this is going to be worse
than anything we've seen yet.

798
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:18,647
You're going to do three things-
Make sure we have ammo,

799
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:20,310
make sure it's there when we need it,

800
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:21,843
and follow Benedetto.

801
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:23,378
Don't do something stupid.

802
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:27,004
Benedetto's going to keep you alive.

803
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:29,272
Stick with Benedetto. Do what he does.

804
00:48:29,372 --> 00:48:31,129
Nothing stupid, got it?

805
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:33,879
Yeah, nothing stupid.

806
00:50:45,493 --> 00:50:48,656
This is NBC,
the National Broadcasting Company.

807
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:54,286
Here is Dwight St. Eiser,
reporting from the WOR newsroom.

808
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:57,171
Good evening. Front reports indicate
that the Americans have lost

809
00:50:57,268 --> 00:51:00,051
both Bambrik and Babelom in Belgium,

810
00:51:00,149 --> 00:51:01,971
and farther south near the French border,

811
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:05,166
field reports say German tanks
in eight heart-breaking days

812
00:51:05,268 --> 00:51:07,505
have broken from defenses
in the Siegfried line

813
00:51:07,603 --> 00:51:09,970
and have driven back into Belgium
and Luxembourg,

814
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:13,897
back to within 29 miles of historic Sedoz.

815
00:51:14,003 --> 00:51:16,370
Everybody out.
Grab your weapons and ammo.

816
00:51:16,467 --> 00:51:18,605
We got a 5-mile hike down this rail line.

817
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:20,299
Let's go.

818
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:37,422
That's where we're going.

819
00:51:37,522 --> 00:51:40,370
We're going to need those.
You're an ammo carrier. Grab your ammo.

820
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,538
And stick with Benedetto.

821
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,982
Maybe you should just shoot him now.

822
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,218
Save the Germans some trouble.

823
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,254
Yeah? He might just end up
saving you, Fuller.

824
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:32,846
I've got a bad feeling.

825
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:43,692
Why do they want this town anyway?

826
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:15,522
Come on, come on.
Gunmen on the line need to be relieved.

827
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,792
Okay, listen up.

828
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:42,785
There are two machine gun positions
we badly need to relieve tonight.

829
00:53:42,891 --> 00:53:44,777
Both are on the east hill behind-

830
00:53:47,914 --> 00:53:50,696
As you can tell from that demonstration,

831
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,695
you're going to be real careful
taking up your positions.

832
00:53:53,802 --> 00:53:56,868
The 376 are holding our line right now.

833
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,068
Smith, Fuller, Heinrich, Benedetto,

834
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,559
you'll relieve the gun in place
on the south end of that hill,

835
00:54:02,664 --> 00:54:04,159
close to an old pump house.

836
00:54:04,266 --> 00:54:06,754
Foster, Matthews and Jennings,

837
00:54:06,856 --> 00:54:08,962
there's a castle
on the north side of the hill.

838
00:54:09,065 --> 00:54:10,560
You'll take that position.

839
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,803
When we're done here,
we'll guide you up there.

840
00:54:12,905 --> 00:54:14,056
Questions?

841
00:54:16,745 --> 00:54:18,206
Hear this well.

842
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:21,030
There are German divisions
on the other side of that ridge.

843
00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:24,445
They've tried to retake the town
a couple times from the north.

844
00:54:24,551 --> 00:54:26,854
We cannot let that happen.

845
00:54:26,952 --> 00:54:29,439
Hopefully, this weather
will slow them down.

846
00:54:29,543 --> 00:54:33,188
Stay sharp. I'll try to get some warm chow
to you by morning.

847
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:35,491
Okay, let's move them out.

848
00:54:40,967 --> 00:54:43,269
- Hey, Tony?
- Yeah?

849
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,774
We got 2 feet of snow coming.

850
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:46,694
Krauts ain't going to do anything
in this shit.

851
00:58:21,018 --> 00:58:22,513
Smith.

852
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:24,112
Yeah?

853
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:26,041
I found this in the truck.

854
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:27,699
Think you might have dropped it?

855
00:58:29,658 --> 00:58:32,441
Listen, I ain't got nobody back home.

856
00:58:32,537 --> 00:58:34,610
At least you got somebody.

857
00:58:34,714 --> 00:58:36,274
You should hang on to that.

858
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:41,971
Benedetto.

859
00:58:42,074 --> 00:58:43,318
Thanks.

860
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:46,934
Relief has arrived.

861
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,655
What took you?

862
00:58:57,753 --> 00:58:59,247
Mostly the ammo.

863
00:58:59,353 --> 00:59:01,174
Christ, it's freezing in here.

864
00:59:01,273 --> 00:59:02,295
Any movement?

865
00:59:02,296 --> 00:59:04,685
Nothing but goddamn shelling.

866
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,942
Okay.

867
00:59:06,008 --> 00:59:07,317
You got everything you need?

868
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:12,374
I have to get these men back down
to relieve other positions along the line.

869
00:59:12,472 --> 00:59:13,878
Stay sharp.

870
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:19,086
Benedetto.

871
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:21,165
I don't need for you and Heinrich
to be out here.

872
00:59:21,271 --> 00:59:23,572
Find that pump house over that direction.

873
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:25,166
Go in there and dry out.

874
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:26,448
Yeah, sure.

875
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:28,526
Find it in the dark.

876
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:31,501
All right, Heinrich. Let's go.

877
00:59:31,607 --> 00:59:32,758
Let's take a look.

878
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,268
You sure we got everything?

879
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:48,464
This is the fastest relief I've ever seen.

880
00:59:48,566 --> 00:59:51,881
Belt, gun, you, me.

881
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:03,504
What time is it?

882
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:04,755
Don't know.

883
01:00:06,165 --> 01:00:08,980
Lost my watch. Poker game.

884
01:00:12,244 --> 01:00:13,421
Great.

885
01:00:13,525 --> 01:00:15,695
I don't have one, either.

886
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:19,441
Sure wish they would have taken
that guy with them.

887
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:24,978
It's like he keeps staring at us.

888
01:00:25,075 --> 01:00:27,759
Well, at least
we're a little warmer than he is.

889
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:35,441
Poor guy.

890
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,032
Sorry, fellow.

891
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:39,278
Sometimes it seems like the Krauts
want to kill you.

892
01:00:39,379 --> 01:00:41,201
It just don't matter.

893
01:00:41,298 --> 01:00:42,449
Not me, brother.

894
01:00:43,283 --> 01:00:44,712
Would you get down and shut your mouth?

895
01:00:44,818 --> 01:00:47,601
What's with you?

896
01:00:47,698 --> 01:00:49,869
I don't know.

897
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,858
Hell, I don't know.

898
01:00:58,898 --> 01:01:02,312
It's my birthday.

899
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:04,872
Just don't want nothing to happen to me
on my birthday.

900
01:01:04,977 --> 01:01:07,344
That's it? It's your birthday?

901
01:01:10,737 --> 01:01:12,231
They're persistent.

902
01:01:12,337 --> 01:01:15,784
Yes, they are.

903
01:01:19,696 --> 01:01:25,293
We're spread so thin, I don't think
anyone knows where our line is.

904
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:29,801
We could have Krauts behind us
for all we know.

905
01:01:31,472 --> 01:01:33,926
I feel like going home right about now.

906
01:01:34,032 --> 01:01:36,716
You paying attention
to the current situation?

907
01:01:40,111 --> 01:01:43,853
To hell with you.
I plan on getting through this.

908
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,445
Don't you?

909
01:01:45,551 --> 01:01:46,730
Don't know anymore.

910
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:50,627
Right now, probably best to figure
we're all dead men until proven otherwise.

911
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,714
Happy birthday to me.

912
01:01:58,189 --> 01:01:59,340
Sorry, just-

913
01:01:59,342 --> 01:02:00,461
Doing okay?

914
01:02:00,462 --> 01:02:02,730
The hell?

915
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:03,981
Don't sneak up like that.

916
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:06,249
Yeah, we're okay.

917
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,259
Did you get where the other part
of our line is?

918
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:11,048
I think the other guy's over there,
that direction.

919
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,859
There's a squad from the rifle company
in the pump house.

920
01:02:14,957 --> 01:02:16,485
When did they get here?

921
01:02:16,588 --> 01:02:18,411
Just a little bit ago.

922
01:02:18,509 --> 01:02:19,660
Trying to keep warm.

923
01:02:19,725 --> 01:02:22,180
It's been a shitty mess,
getting everyone relieved.

924
01:02:22,285 --> 01:02:26,027
Some artillery and equipment
slid off the road.

925
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,499
SNAFU as usual.

926
01:02:27,596 --> 01:02:29,538
You dried out?

927
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:31,783
Not much, but better.

928
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:37,542
They think the 11th Panzer Division
has moved up out there.

929
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:39,425
They say those bastards
don't take prisoners.

930
01:02:39,532 --> 01:02:41,953
11th Panzer. Oh, good.

931
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,099
Bring their tanks with them?

932
01:02:44,205 --> 01:02:48,743
Any of the squad carry something
to fight tanks with, like a bazooka?

933
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:50,021
Not that I saw.

934
01:02:50,123 --> 01:02:52,612
They pushed them up pretty fast,
just like us.

935
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:55,464
Any communication?
Radio? Field phone? Anything?

936
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:58,116
Unless we're going to sort it out
in the morning.

937
01:02:58,219 --> 01:03:01,218
That's great news.

938
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:04,105
There's nothing we can do right now.

939
01:03:04,203 --> 01:03:07,945
If they suspect that's a Panzer division,
we'll be sorting it out real quick.

940
01:03:08,043 --> 01:03:10,977
Okay?

941
01:03:11,082 --> 01:03:13,384
Well, get back and get dry.

942
01:03:13,481 --> 01:03:15,937
You and Heinrich will get to relieve us
come daybreak.

943
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:17,192
Yeah.

944
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:25,475
I know.

945
01:03:25,578 --> 01:03:29,352
If there's tanks out there,
we're in deep shit.

946
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:33,954
That sounds like more than a few
Kraut squads to me.

947
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:41,475
Shit, this is misery.

948
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:43,399
My feet are numb.

949
01:03:43,496 --> 01:03:45,536
Wet and goddamn numb.

950
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:51,398
Want me to change positions
with you for a while?

951
01:03:51,496 --> 01:03:52,903
Yeah, that'd be nice.

952
01:04:00,006 --> 01:04:01,501
Damn it.

953
01:04:01,608 --> 01:04:04,837
It's a pond you were in, boy.

954
01:04:04,936 --> 01:04:07,074
You sure it wasn't a latrine?

955
01:04:07,174 --> 01:04:09,062
Why do you think it's not frozen?

956
01:04:14,535 --> 01:04:18,811
Hey, did you notice the shelling stopped?

957
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:24,928
I don't know what that means.

958
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:29,088
Think they'll try something?

959
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:32,189
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

960
01:04:36,228 --> 01:04:37,379
I hear them.

961
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:39,749
They're coming.

962
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,596
I hear them. They're coming.

963
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:44,740
I don't hear nothing.

964
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,011
I hear them.

965
01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:49,050
They're out there. They're coming.
Better get ready.

966
01:04:49,157 --> 01:04:51,578
I still don't hear nothing.

967
01:04:51,685 --> 01:04:53,725
I hear them now.

968
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:54,979
Damn, your hearing's good.

969
01:04:58,307 --> 01:04:59,868
The guys in the pump house.

970
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:05,883
Wait here. I have to warn those guys
to get out of there.

971
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:07,481
Don't fire if you don't have to.

972
01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:09,082
The tank will be able to see our position.

973
01:05:09,187 --> 01:05:12,831
No, I'd rather wear red and castrate a bull.

974
01:05:31,843 --> 01:05:32,993
Come along.

975
01:05:33,762 --> 01:05:34,913
Come on.

976
01:05:50,946 --> 01:05:51,967
Open up, it's Smith.

977
01:05:51,968 --> 01:05:52,992
Brooklyn, Brooklyn.

978
01:05:52,993 --> 01:05:55,840
God damn it, there's Mark-4s
not 300 yards from here. Open up.

979
01:05:57,345 --> 01:05:59,733
- What's going on?
- Listen, there are tanks moving up.

980
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:02,263
You have to get out of here,
or you'll be sitting ducks.

981
01:06:02,368 --> 01:06:04,058
- Tanks? Shit.
- We don't have anything here for tanks.

982
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,338
But we have tanks. Get out.

983
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,223
Riley, come here.
Listen, you're the first one out.

984
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,516
I want you to cut around, head toward town
and warn them about the tanks.

985
01:06:11,616 --> 01:06:13,437
There's an orchard
about 30 yards from here.

986
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,062
I want you guys to spread out, stay low.

987
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,989
Corporal, where do you want me
and Benedetto to go?

988
01:06:17,087 --> 01:06:18,843
I have to get back to Fuller.
Give me some belts.

989
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:20,634
Fall back behind the orchard
and take cover.

990
01:06:20,735 --> 01:06:22,164
I'll get Fuller and I'll meet you there.

991
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:23,929
We're clear. Let's move.

992
01:06:25,662 --> 01:06:26,812
Go, go.

993
01:07:01,405 --> 01:07:02,998
Go, go, keep moving.

994
01:07:04,606 --> 01:07:05,628
Go, go.

995
01:07:05,629 --> 01:07:06,936
Keep moving, keep moving.

996
01:07:08,093 --> 01:07:09,243
Go left.

997
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:14,935
Cover fire.

998
01:07:15,036 --> 01:07:17,402
Cover fire, cover fire.

999
01:08:03,066 --> 01:08:05,716
This is good.

1000
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:17,326
I'm hit. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1001
01:08:19,064 --> 01:08:21,236
My ankle!

1002
01:08:21,337 --> 01:08:22,613
- Stop him.
- I'm coming back for him.

1003
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:24,436
Okay, go.

1004
01:08:25,463 --> 01:08:28,213
Smith!

1005
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:52,721
Go, go, go.

1006
01:09:11,382 --> 01:09:12,532
Smith!

1007
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,811
Open fire, open fire.

1008
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:21,610
Are you okay?

1009
01:09:21,717 --> 01:09:23,856
No, no, no.

1010
01:09:23,957 --> 01:09:25,167
I can only move my right leg.

1011
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:26,420
Where's Benedetto?

1012
01:09:26,517 --> 01:09:27,923
The orchard, wounded.

1013
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,217
I'm sorry. I guess I did
something stupid after all.

1014
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:36,881
No, Heinrich. Look, I'm going to get
you and Benedetto a medic.

1015
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,314
- Get Fuller. Can you give me some cover?
- I'll try.

1016
01:09:41,459 --> 01:09:42,610
I need a medic.

1017
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:53,840
...our daily bread. And forgive us our...

1018
01:10:08,369 --> 01:10:09,711
Blood.

1019
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:12,657
Not resurrected.

1020
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,568
Is this heaven?

1021
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:19,148
I know for sure we're in
a shit load of trouble.

1022
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,071
We got to get help.

1023
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,347
Going to get you out first.

1024
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:23,600
Stop.

1025
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:26,829
You let me get you out of here.

1026
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:28,017
Stop.

1027
01:10:28,018 --> 01:10:30,603
- Get back to Heinrich.
- I didn't even see it coming.

1028
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:34,501
I couldn't get out in time.

1029
01:10:34,609 --> 01:10:35,885
My legs are crushed.

1030
01:10:35,985 --> 01:10:39,913
I lost my. 45.

1031
01:10:42,608 --> 01:10:46,023
We're getting picked to pieces out here.

1032
01:10:46,128 --> 01:10:47,247
I'll get you out of here.

1033
01:10:47,248 --> 01:10:48,367
It'll be okay.

1034
01:10:48,368 --> 01:10:50,823
- Get help.
- Had to get run over by a tank.

1035
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:52,078
Tell them what's coming.

1036
01:10:56,047 --> 01:10:57,454
Smith.

1037
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:02,982
Can't do nothing here.

1038
01:11:05,966 --> 01:11:07,117
Go.

1039
01:11:11,022 --> 01:11:13,837
Tank division can't do those trees.

1040
01:11:13,934 --> 01:11:16,618
We don't even got a weapon.

1041
01:11:20,654 --> 01:11:22,825
Here. Birthday present.

1042
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:28,585
Use this if you need it.

1043
01:11:28,686 --> 01:11:30,889
There are three rounds left, I think.

1044
01:11:34,061 --> 01:11:35,785
Only if you need it.

1045
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:41,548
Don't get killed.

1046
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,384
Only if I need them.

1047
01:12:29,226 --> 01:12:30,376
No.

1048
01:12:37,994 --> 01:12:40,579
- You kill us.
- Yeah, you're killing us too, you bastard.

1049
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:42,569
Yeah. You know, I can kill you.

1050
01:12:42,665 --> 01:12:44,487
You stay here.

1051
01:12:44,584 --> 01:12:46,210
You go, I kill you.

1052
01:13:13,447 --> 01:13:14,597
Riley.

1053
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:19,719
Shit, it's mined.

1054
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:53,306
Brooklyn. Brooklyn.

1055
01:16:53,404 --> 01:16:55,923
You son of a bitch, I'm American.

1056
01:16:57,882 --> 01:16:59,377
No Kraut swears like that.

1057
01:16:59,482 --> 01:17:01,970
Got to be one of ours.
I'm getting down there.

1058
01:17:08,442 --> 01:17:10,580
We got overrun.

1059
01:17:10,683 --> 01:17:12,821
Tanks. Germans.

1060
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:14,415
They got tanks coming up.

1061
01:17:14,522 --> 01:17:16,017
Get a medic!

1062
01:17:16,121 --> 01:17:17,299
Get the lieutenant.

1063
01:17:20,921 --> 01:17:22,072
We've got to go back.

1064
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,259
Dear Doreen,
I don't think about that night too often.

1065
01:17:34,361 --> 01:17:37,426
The 94th held the town
after heavy fighting,

1066
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,154
but in breaking
through the German border,

1067
01:17:39,256 --> 01:17:42,256
some 60,000 men lost their lives
in less than a month.

1068
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:47,149
I started to notice that all of the dead
looked the same, except for the uniform.

1069
01:17:47,256 --> 01:17:49,328
It was March by the time
my wounds were healed

1070
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:50,609
and I made it back to M Company.

1071
01:17:50,711 --> 01:17:53,711
I am so glad you're back
from San Francisco.

1072
01:17:53,815 --> 01:17:55,539
I am, too. Let's go in.

1073
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:59,087
...more than 100 miles in just 12 days.

1074
01:17:59,192 --> 01:18:00,882
Fighting scattered pockets of resistance

1075
01:18:00,983 --> 01:18:04,812
and heavy opposition in the city
of Ludwigshafen, the 94th breaks through.

1076
01:18:04,919 --> 01:18:08,147
After all this time away,
after all the war I've seen,

1077
01:18:08,246 --> 01:18:10,962
I can't tell anymore if I saw you
yesterday or a thousand years ago.

1078
01:18:11,063 --> 01:18:12,972
The 94th infantry...

1079
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:17,813
In many ways, this crumpled letter
covered with the traces of war

1080
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:21,226
has become you,
become the us that might have been,

1081
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,472
the us that could have laughed
on your front porch

1082
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:26,989
or taken a walk in the summer evening.

1083
01:18:27,092 --> 01:18:29,940
To me, this letter has become the us
that will never be.

1084
01:18:30,037 --> 01:18:32,754
That to your girl back home?

1085
01:18:32,852 --> 01:18:34,675
Say, you want me to mail that for you?

1086
01:18:34,773 --> 01:18:35,923
No.

1087
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:40,049
Just know that my thoughts of you,

1088
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:44,175
delivered poorly again and again
in a million different ways in this letter,

1089
01:18:44,276 --> 01:18:47,888
are the only things that made me believe
I might survive.

1090
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:56,366
After that night,
I never saw any of them again.

1091
01:18:56,468 --> 01:18:59,566
We continued to push on into Germany
through Dusseldorf,

1092
01:18:59,669 --> 01:19:02,035
but most men now were new faces.

1093
01:19:03,188 --> 01:19:06,285
Heck, Don, we're right back
where we started.

1094
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:08,110
This has been a waste of time.

1095
01:19:09,907 --> 01:19:12,363
How do you lose a prisoner
out of a guarded holding cell?

1096
01:19:15,346 --> 01:19:18,761
- Your arm okay?
- It just aches.

1097
01:19:18,867 --> 01:19:20,045
Let's check that barn up there.

1098
01:19:20,146 --> 01:19:22,285
If he's not in there,
we're not going to find him.

1099
01:19:24,146 --> 01:19:26,121
Christ.

1100
01:19:26,226 --> 01:19:28,081
Artillery's making a mess
of things up there.

1101
01:19:28,178 --> 01:19:30,282
Krauts can't have much fight left.

1102
01:19:30,387 --> 01:19:33,005
We see a German, he's still the enemy.

1103
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:36,081
Hell, they must know they've lost.

1104
01:19:36,178 --> 01:19:38,065
Hey, with this crew, we're taking
the whole damn country down.

1105
01:19:38,162 --> 01:19:40,463
Taking the whole thing down,
good and bad.

1106
01:19:40,561 --> 01:19:41,838
I'm not crying for him.

1107
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:45,931
Hell, Germans here, Japs in the Pacific.
The whole damn world's falling apart.

1108
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:49,295
It's got to end soon.

1109
01:19:49,392 --> 01:19:51,563
I'm getting damn tired of waiting.

1110
01:19:51,665 --> 01:19:54,512
Damn tired of Germans
and damn tired of losing friends.

1111
01:19:57,329 --> 01:19:58,447
It came from inside the barn.

1112
01:19:58,448 --> 01:19:59,598
Come on.

1113
01:20:06,352 --> 01:20:07,596
Shit.

1114
01:20:25,582 --> 01:20:27,076
Shut up, you goddamn Kraut.

1115
01:20:27,183 --> 01:20:28,333
Get up!

1116
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:32,075
What the hell are you doing?

1117
01:20:32,175 --> 01:20:33,326
And your patrol?

1118
01:20:33,391 --> 01:20:35,398
The couldn't find shit. Just-

1119
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:36,712
They almost killed Starcher!

1120
01:20:36,814 --> 01:20:39,597
Just take him off and kill him.
Kill him for all the trouble.

1121
01:20:39,694 --> 01:20:41,036
God damn it.

1122
01:20:41,134 --> 01:20:42,188
Starcher.

1123
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:44,972
Starcher, take Anderson
back to HQ and hold him there.

1124
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:46,092
You're in charge.

1125
01:20:46,093 --> 01:20:47,117
What are you going to do?

1126
01:20:47,118 --> 01:20:48,580
I'm going to take this Kraut off the road.

1127
01:20:48,685 --> 01:20:50,540
Get a little payback, Smith.

1128
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:52,524
Just shoot the bastard.

1129
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:53,865
Come on. Let's go.

1130
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:57,412
Just shoot the bastard.

1131
01:20:57,516 --> 01:20:59,753
Come on. Kill the bastard, Smith.
Get a little payback.

1132
01:20:59,853 --> 01:21:01,003
Come on.

1133
01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:11,975
Go ahead.

1134
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,226
Take it.

1135
01:21:17,195 --> 01:21:18,656
All right, come on, then.

1136
01:21:30,251 --> 01:21:31,908
Okay.

1137
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:35,497
A quarter mile more,

1138
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:37,441
you can bullshit with your POW buddies
all you want.

1139
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,003
Look, I don't understand what you're saying.

1140
01:23:49,539 --> 01:23:51,546
Put it down.

1141
01:23:52,836 --> 01:23:54,079
I don't want to shoot you.

1142
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:12,381
For two and a half years,
I had fought to survive.

1143
01:24:12,482 --> 01:24:14,369
Every one of us had
hopes and dreams locked away

1144
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:17,312
so they wouldn't spill out with our blood.

1145
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:21,271
Now I wasn't sure if they were still there.

1146
01:24:21,377 --> 01:24:24,159
And in that split second,
with the crack of that pistol,

1147
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:26,907
another human being
had given those things up.

1148
01:24:39,743 --> 01:24:41,718
It's okay, sir.

1149
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:43,231
The war is over.

1150
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,986
It's over, sir.

1151
01:24:46,688 --> 01:24:47,839
Where are we?

1152
01:24:47,871 --> 01:24:49,117
Where are we at?

1153
01:24:49,216 --> 01:24:52,346
We're in Spokane, sir.
Are you all right?

1154
01:24:52,448 --> 01:24:53,724
Yeah.

1155
01:24:56,127 --> 01:24:57,437
Yeah, I think so.

1156
01:24:57,534 --> 01:25:03,191
We're waiting on another train to get in,
so we're going to be here for a while.

1157
01:25:05,215 --> 01:25:08,084
You know, it sure is beautiful out.

1158
01:25:09,598 --> 01:25:11,606
I bet you glad to be home.

1159
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:17,628
Yeah.

1160
01:25:36,093 --> 01:25:39,922
Damn it. It's an open door.
You don't need to break it down.

1161
01:25:40,029 --> 01:25:41,179
Sorry.

1162
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,410
Sorry, Sarge.

1163
01:25:45,596 --> 01:25:47,090
Where are you headed?

1164
01:25:50,172 --> 01:25:53,849
Fort Louis, as soon as they
get the trains changed.

1165
01:25:53,949 --> 01:25:57,461
I got a couple more days to report,
and I'm out of this army.

1166
01:25:57,564 --> 01:25:59,288
Well, I'll be right next door.

1167
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:00,598
Court Airfield.

1168
01:26:00,699 --> 01:26:02,292
But I'm staying in.

1169
01:26:02,395 --> 01:26:07,830
Yeah, staying in the old Army.

1170
01:26:07,931 --> 01:26:10,582
Where did you get it?

1171
01:26:10,683 --> 01:26:13,717
Nennig. Siegfried Line.

1172
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:17,909
I didn't actually see much action.

1173
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:19,353
I got there after VE day.

1174
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:21,392
Lucky for you.

1175
01:26:21,498 --> 01:26:23,189
I suppose.

1176
01:27:16,504 --> 01:27:17,654
Hello.

1177
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,963
Do I know you? Have we met?

1178
01:27:23,063 --> 01:27:24,437
I don't think so.

1179
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,133
My name is Wagner. Otto Wagner.

1180
01:27:29,239 --> 01:27:31,027
Don Smith.

1181
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:34,836
Forgive me. I overheard your conversation
in the restroom.

1182
01:27:34,934 --> 01:27:37,105
You're coming back from Germany?

1183
01:27:37,206 --> 01:27:39,245
Well, yes.

1184
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:40,528
Going home finally.

1185
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:43,499
We were on the train together from Chicago.

1186
01:27:43,605 --> 01:27:45,808
Sorry. I didn't notice.

1187
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:47,600
That is all right.

1188
01:27:47,701 --> 01:27:52,589
It's just that I hope to back home
to Germany soon.

1189
01:27:52,692 --> 01:27:55,823
I'm going to try to find
the rest of my relatives.

1190
01:27:55,926 --> 01:28:00,180
Some live close to Weiss.
Not far from Nennig.

1191
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:05,393
My wife and I escaped here
shortly before the war began.

1192
01:28:05,492 --> 01:28:07,914
I have been working for your government.

1193
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,874
I wish you luck.

1194
01:28:09,971 --> 01:28:11,662
The country's a bit of a mess.

1195
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,759
I don't blame you.

1196
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:19,089
So much destruction and loss.

1197
01:28:19,187 --> 01:28:22,765
But we are finally free from those evil men.

1198
01:28:24,595 --> 01:28:26,537
I must thank you.

1199
01:28:26,644 --> 01:28:30,256
You can be thanking a lot of guys.
I'm just one.

1200
01:28:33,427 --> 01:28:34,769
You waiting for a train?

1201
01:28:34,867 --> 01:28:37,420
No, a car is coming to pick me up.

1202
01:28:41,682 --> 01:28:43,886
Maybe there's something
that you could do for me?

1203
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,709
What is it? What can I do?

1204
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:48,297
I have this letter.
I'd like to know what it says.

1205
01:28:48,402 --> 01:28:49,521
It's in German.

1206
01:28:49,522 --> 01:28:51,530
You would like me to read it for you?

1207
01:28:51,634 --> 01:28:53,968
Of course. My car is not due
for a few more minutes.

1208
01:28:54,066 --> 01:28:55,375
This is it.

1209
01:29:05,842 --> 01:29:07,499
Can you tell what it says?

1210
01:29:09,712 --> 01:29:12,429
This is terrible. Did you know these people?

1211
01:29:12,528 --> 01:29:14,154
No, not like you think.

1212
01:29:14,256 --> 01:29:18,151
I was wondering if it mentioned anyone
I could return it to with a note.

1213
01:29:18,256 --> 01:29:20,198
But I don't know where.

1214
01:29:21,392 --> 01:29:24,970
I am afraid that will be quite impossible.

1215
01:29:25,072 --> 01:29:27,624
"My dearest husband,

1216
01:29:27,728 --> 01:29:33,029
It is with terrible longing that I wait
for some dear words from you.

1217
01:29:33,136 --> 01:29:36,932
If I could only see you just one more time.

1218
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:42,696
During the past weeks,
I have begun to fear the end of everything.

1219
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:48,110
All the lovely places you remember
are in ruins. "

1220
01:29:48,206 --> 01:29:53,126
I pray every minute for your protection
and for blessed hope to return,

1221
01:29:53,231 --> 01:29:58,888
but I fear this land is reaping a judgment
no power on earth can restrain.

1222
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:02,758
Every day we see relatives and friends
being taken away

1223
01:30:02,861 --> 01:30:06,244
as Jews are being called
to report to labor camps.

1224
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,954
How awful this war is.

1225
01:30:11,053 --> 01:30:14,370
How I long for the life we had together,

1226
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:16,997
to have the blessing of a future and hope.

1227
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,231
Despair often overtakes my soul.

1228
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:21,482
Forgive me.

1229
01:30:21,581 --> 01:30:25,639
However hard it may be,
we shall do our utmost to survive,

1230
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:29,056
but today I have made my peace with God.

1231
01:30:29,164 --> 01:30:32,992
May every man on earth be
as good as you have been to us.

1232
01:30:33,101 --> 01:30:36,133
I give you all my love and a thousand kisses.

1233
01:30:36,236 --> 01:30:38,244
I love you to my last breath.

1234
01:30:39,627 --> 01:30:43,369
"Your loving wife, Greta. "

1235
01:30:49,706 --> 01:30:52,096
I'm going now, my friend.

1236
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:56,992
I think we both have things waiting for us.

1237
01:31:00,362 --> 01:31:06,019
May every man on earth be as good as you
and those like you.

1238
01:31:32,936 --> 01:31:35,718
Hi, can I change my ticket destination?
Am I too late?

1239
01:31:35,816 --> 01:31:38,434
Don? Don?

1240
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:45,150
Would you like some lunch?

1241
01:31:47,207 --> 01:31:48,582
Don?

1242
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,174
I'm the last.

1243
01:31:51,624 --> 01:31:53,728
The last what?

1244
01:31:53,832 --> 01:31:56,418
I'm the last guy in my crew.

1245
01:31:56,518 --> 01:31:58,461
I'm still around.

1246
01:31:58,567 --> 01:32:00,193
Is that bad?

1247
01:32:02,631 --> 01:32:05,087
Don.

1248
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:07,711
Just thinking.

1249
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:10,236
About?

1250
01:32:10,342 --> 01:32:14,238
I wish- I wish they were still around.

1251
01:32:22,213 --> 01:32:24,002
What's this?

1252
01:32:24,102 --> 01:32:25,253
A letter.

1253
01:32:27,173 --> 01:32:28,635
When is this from?

1254
01:32:28,742 --> 01:32:30,083
Back then.

1255
01:32:30,181 --> 01:32:34,043
I carried it, but I never sent it.

1256
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:35,326
It's to me.

1257
01:32:36,613 --> 01:32:37,763
Yes.

1258
01:32:38,788 --> 01:32:40,796
You didn't send it.

1259
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,907
I just needed it.

1260
01:32:43,013 --> 01:32:47,289
It was my hope, a way home,
something to hold on to.

1261
01:32:47,396 --> 01:32:50,691
You and me seemed so impossible.

1262
01:32:53,284 --> 01:32:55,870
I almost lost it.

1263
01:32:57,987 --> 01:32:59,930
I've forgotten so much.

1264
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:05,277
Well, I remember waiting for you.

1265
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:08,640
Then one day there was this
handsome soldier

1266
01:33:08,739 --> 01:33:11,935
finally coming home to see me.

1267
01:33:12,035 --> 01:33:15,417
I hope it was all worth it.

1268
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:17,311
It was, Don. It was.

1269
01:33:19,682 --> 01:33:20,926
Dance with me.

1270
01:33:22,659 --> 01:33:24,152
I'm on duty.

1271
01:33:24,258 --> 01:33:25,281
That's okay.

1272
01:33:25,282 --> 01:33:26,777
It's okay.

1273
01:33:26,881 --> 01:33:28,032
There's no music.

1274
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,875
You be the music.

1275
01:33:36,322 --> 01:33:38,972
It was 1943 when I went to war.

1276
01:33:39,074 --> 01:33:40,700
I was almost 19.

1277
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:45,756
I returned from war in 1945.

1278
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,711
I was now 21.

1279
01:33:47,809 --> 01:33:50,591
I had seen more
than I would ever want to tell.

1280
01:33:50,689 --> 01:33:55,228
Some things had held on to me
more than I had realized.

1281
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:59,900
But some words, some hopes, and dreams

1282
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,040
were never meant for paper.

1283
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:50,000
