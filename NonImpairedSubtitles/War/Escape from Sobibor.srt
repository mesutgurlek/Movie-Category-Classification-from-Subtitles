1
00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:06,009
<i>In 1942, SS-chief Heinrich Himmler
initiated "Operation Reinhardt".</i>

2
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:09,884
<i>Nazi-Germany's final solution
to the "Jewish question".</i>

3
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:14,167
<i>3 death-camps were built and staffed
under top secret orders.</i>

4
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:20,973
<i>These camps, all in eastern Poland, were Belzec,
Treblinka and the most secret Sobibor.</i>

5
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:26,687
<i>Sobibor. It was here on October 14th
1943 that the biggest, most successful</i>

6
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:29,966
<i>prisoner revolt in World War 2
took place.</i>

7
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:32,370
<i>This is that story.</i>

8
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:44,168
- Did you speak to them?
- Yes, Leon.

9
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:47,253
But they're still going to do it.

10
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:52,771
- Leon, Leon...
- What's going on?

11
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:57,764
We're assigned to the vegetable lot today.
While you're at the station, we are going to go.

12
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:02,889
- We've been working on that fence, it's our chance.
- In broad daylight through the minefield? It's crazy, you'll never make it.

13
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:08,806
We have the courage now. Who knows if we do
tomorrow. We're going to do it, nobody can stop us.

14
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,445
Good luck.

15
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:25,006
Quick! Run!

16
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:39,331
It's nothing but a little
target practice.

17
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:46,244
I want no problems here today.

18
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:55,328
Is that clear?
Take your positions. Dismissed.

19
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:27,653
Attention, railroad brigade Jews.

20
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:35,575
As always, I expect you to be smiling, when the train
arrives. Remember, we are welcoming these people.

21
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:42,806
This will run smoothly. If there's a problem
like yesterday's, if people panic or try to run

22
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:47,770
I don't have to remind you,
you will be killed.

23
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:34,203
Water!
Give me water!

24
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,804
Remember, we've got to stay together.

25
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,534
Get moving!

26
00:07:30,855 --> 00:07:34,484
You! You, get back!
Get back, I say!

27
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:59,532
- You must leave your bag.
- No!

28
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:14,965
Stay right next to me.

29
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:18,924
If you want to stay together,
volunteer.

30
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:32,368
When they ask you,
tell them you have a trade.

31
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,527
Quiet!
Quiet!

32
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:01,929
Stand where you are and be quiet. You will be
separated into two groups, just temporarily.

33
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:08,005
Women and children on this side, men and
boys, 14 years of age or older, on the other.

34
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:16,569
Those who are ill or too weak to walk will be assisted.
Leave your luggage, it will be brought to you later.

35
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:20,370
Now, move as quickly as possible.
Move!

36
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:43,165
- Shlomo, Moses...!
- Mama, he said we'd be together in a little while.

37
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:47,533
- Yes, a little while. Kiss your sister.
- Mama, which side to go?

38
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:53,567
Don't start anything.
Move! Back!

39
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:11,644
All the sick on the top.
On the wagon, over here!

40
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:41,613
Observe...

41
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:52,334
Do you see? How I'm scattering this?
Grain by grain.

42
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:59,087
That is what will happen
with your filthy Reich.

43
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:04,926
It will vanish like flying dust
and passing smoke.

44
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:09,885
No.

45
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:19,932
You stand right here
and don't move until I tell you

46
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:34,449
Silence!

47
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:39,603
I want everyone to listen to me carefully.
You have arrived at Sobibor.

48
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:43,887
You are in eastern Poland.
This is a labour camp.

49
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:50,454
We have brought you here to work. You will
work hard, but hard work is good for the soul.

50
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:54,563
So in reality, we are your benefactors.

51
00:11:54,695 --> 00:12:03,444
You will be housed, you will be fed. All we ask is your
cooperation. If you do your jobs, you will have nothing to fear.

52
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:10,526
You will be given postcards. Write to your relatives
and friends to tell them you have arrived here safely.

53
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:20,009
We will mail them for you. Unfortunately, there have been
reports that typhus have broken out at several labour camps.

54
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:26,051
We do not want typhus at Sobibor. Therefore,
first you will be taken to the shower facility

55
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:29,167
where you will each have a hot shower.

56
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:35,609
Naturally, men and women will shower separately.
Women will have their hair cut short before they shower

57
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:39,809
While you are showering, your clothing
will be disinfected.

58
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:45,134
Remember, the better your behaviour,
the easier your stay will be.

59
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:50,290
Hauptscharführer Wagner,
Oberscharführer Frenzel

60
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:58,004
- I need experienced shoemakers and tailors.
- Is anybody a qualified seamstress?

61
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:05,175
- Here, I am a seamstress.
- Where did you work? For how long?

62
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:10,809
In Warsaw for 2.. no 2,5 years
in a clothing store, Beloskis.

63
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:14,923
- I did alterations.
- Good, step forward.

64
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,285
- I am a seamstress.
- Step forward.

65
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:22,125
- Are there any first class shoemakers? Any tailors?
- I am a shoemaker, sir.

66
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,925
- The best.
- Step forward.

67
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:34,766
- Qualified seamstresses?
- Here, sir. I am a seamstress.

68
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:40,726
- Is this your son? -
Yes. - No, can't use you.

69
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:43,609
- I am a seamstress.
- Step forward.

70
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:50,327
- I need experienced shoemakers. Any tailors?
- Sir, I am a goldsmith.

71
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:56,804
See, I made that.
These are my tools, sir.

72
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,287
Alright, step forward.

73
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:07,134
And Sir, my brother... He's a goldsmith too.
He helps me. We can make jewellery, anything.

74
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:12,292
Alright, step forward.

75
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:25,885
- Sir, what about our father?
- Never mind him. Stay here, I'll be back.

76
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,891
- Any tailors?
- I'm a tailor, sir.

77
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:33,645
- From where?
- Bialystock, sir. Very experienced. See?

78
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:38,612
Alright, step forward.
Any more?

79
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:44,246
Women and children!
Follow me!

80
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:48,724
Men and boys!
Move!

81
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:24,050
- Did you come here with your husband?
- No, I'm not married.

82
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:31,374
- My name is Bajle.
- I'm Luka.

83
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:35,408
I'm Naomi. My husband is fighting
with the partisans.

84
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:35,804
Come on!
Hurry up!

85
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:40,644
Get in!

86
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,689
I'm Samuel.

87
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:51,250
Welcome. I am Itzhak.

88
00:17:56,655 --> 00:18:00,534
We work here for the SS and
their Ukrainian guards

89
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:05,046
- How did you know I was a shoemaker?
- I didn't.

90
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:10,369
- But what if I'd been a shopkeeper, or something?
- I'd have taught you.

91
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:15,444
- It happens here all the time.
- So why did you tell me to volunteer?

92
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:21,525
Because you like someone I could get along with
and that's important in Sobibor.

93
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:24,411
Where do you come from?

94
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:33,651
Come, come!
Come in! Come.

95
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:39,372
Wait over there!

96
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,731
- What do we do now?
- He said to wait.

97
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:54,574
Someone will tell us.

98
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:05,085
They can't allow babies in here.

99
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:10,050
Help me...

100
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:20,289
Come!

101
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:31,769
Stay in there. Don't leave for any reason.
That's sergeant Wagner's orders. Understand?

102
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:52,606
Look! Way over there.
Looks like a fire. I wonder what it is.

103
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:56,444
If it looks like a fire, then it probably is a fire.
I sound like grandpa.

104
00:19:57,735 --> 00:20:02,126
- What could be burning?
- Who knows.

105
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:30,291
What's happening?
This isn't a normal roll-call.

106
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:44,885
- Complete.
- Complete.

107
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:53,452
The roll-call is complete, Herr Hauptscharführer.

108
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:03,453
There's something you don't seem to understand,
so I'm going to explain it to you.

109
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:08,330
Our Commandant wants me
to make it very clear

110
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:13,807
that he is responsible for you.
For each and everyone of you here.

111
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:18,451
Somewhat like, a large family.

112
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:26,092
Today 3 members of that family decided that they
didn’t want to be with us this evening or ever again.

113
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:30,811
Now, we could not let that happen,
could we?

114
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:07,208
We have brought these 3 foolish men back,
to be with all of us this evening.

115
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:13,734
Understand the message these
3 Jews bring back to you.

116
00:22:14,455 --> 00:22:21,964
There's no escape from Sobibor.
There's only death for those insane enough to try.

117
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,604
Don't any of you ever forget that.

118
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:30,450
Dismissed!

119
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:44,928
- Leon, why didn't they listen to you?
- They couldn't stand the pain anymore.

120
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:49,606
We talk about escape all the time and we do nothing.
Maybe it's true. Maybe there is no chance.

121
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:54,889
No, I still think there is a way. But not like this.
There has to be organization, there has to be patience

122
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:58,212
and some new people whose spirits
have not yet been broken.

123
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:03,011
Yes, I want a chance to escape. To be free
or at least a chance to die trying.

124
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:07,765
Better to escape and live.
That would be real revenge.

125
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:30,691
This is Commandant Reichleitner.
Show the commandant your wallet.

126
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:36,850
- This is very handsome. You made it?
- Yes, sir.

127
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:42,849
SS. The initials are appropriate.
What do they stand for?

128
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:46,604
- My name, sir. Shlomo Szmajzner.
- Can you make rings?

129
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:54,130
- O yessir. I can make, we can make any kind of jewellery.
- Show me what kind of monogram you would design for me.

130
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:57,210
- May I sit, sir.
- Yes, sit.

131
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:06,888
- The initials, sir?
- FKR Franz Karl Reichleitner.

132
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:33,450
- You can make that for me?
- Yes sir, but I need gold.

133
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:44,645
- Is that enough?
- See to it that these boys get food and blankets.

134
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:51,934
- Sir, our clothes... they're filthy.
- Everything and everybody in Sobibor has to neat and clean.

135
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:55,092
- Let them pick out what they want at the sorting sheds.
- Yes, Herr Commandant.

136
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:58,725
- And sir, my parents and...
- Be quiet!

137
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:03,014
- Let the boy talk.
- My parents and my sister came here with us.

138
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:08,493
- Please, sir. When can I see them?
- Don't worry about them. They're working in the fields. They're well and happy.

139
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:12,210
I promise you, soon you will join them.

140
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:40,651
- How dare she hide the baby in here. We can all be killed for that.
- You must get it out of here.

141
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:46,930
- And put it where? What would you do if that was your baby?
- It's Wagner.

142
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:53,927
Good morning, ladies.

143
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:12,805
- I need someone who can take care of rabbits. Does anyone here have experience?
- I have.

144
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:18,806
- Stand up. How did you learn?
- At home.

145
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:24,293
- We raised rabbits and chickens. My mother sold them at the market.
- You have a new job.

146
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:28,249
- Oberkapo, show her.
- Come.

147
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:50,493
Bit of advice. Don't get Wagner angry.
These Nazis can be madmen. He is the worst.

148
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:54,005
- What is your name?
- Luka.

149
00:26:54,135 --> 00:27:02,327
Luka. Well, Luka the woman who tended the rabbits twisted her back a few days ago. We haven't
seen her since. Sergeant Wagner arranged that.

150
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:08,610
The rabbits are food for the SS. They love their Hasen-Pfeffer.
You'd better know what you are doing.

151
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:15,290
- Oberkapo? Does that mean you are in charge of all the capos?
- Yes. - Are you Jewish?

152
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:19,328
- All the capos are. There are only Jews here.
- A Jew and you work for the Nazis?

153
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:24,973
- I have no more choice than you do.
- But you carry a whip.

154
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:24,168
Choose your clothes!

155
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:49,411
- Esther! Kapo!
- If they catch you with that, you're dead.

156
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:55,287
And they'll kill me too. So don't risk my life for me.
I am risking it enough already, not turning you in right now.

157
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:59,170
I don't know how to thank you.

158
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:11,643
- Where did all these clothes came from?
- Quiet! No questions!

159
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:14,289
You have what you need.

160
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:42,773
- Get back to work, you lazy scum!
- Well said, Kapo.

161
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,052
Now, give me your whip.

162
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:57,533
Do your job.

163
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,245
Get back to work! All of you!
Go on! Go on!

164
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:00,894
Do you think...

165
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:05,248
- Where are all the women and children?
- Eda. Look.

166
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:11,924
- How did you find it?
- Put it in the soup.

167
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:47,168
Vodka!

168
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:57,410
- Go on! Stuff you faces right in front of us! Shame on you!
- Big bad Kapo Porchek.

169
00:31:57,535 --> 00:32:01,972
What guard did you bribe
to get food for you and your whore?

170
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:05,931
- For your own good, shut up!
- Give me that food.

171
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:09,331
I'm warning you, stop it!

172
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:21,292
Why do we fight among ourselves?

173
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:29,044
If we have energy to spend, let's spend it
against those who have reduced us to this.

174
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,973
Wait!

175
00:32:39,535 --> 00:32:43,574
Here, let them share this.

176
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:50,446
Share it.

177
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:53,726
- Excuse me. Excuse me, are you Leon?
- Yes.

178
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:58,246
- I thought so. Samuel said I should see you. I am Itzhak Lichtman.
- Oh yes, he told me about you.

179
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:03,366
- You're from Zolkiewka? - Yes.
- I have been there many times.

180
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:06,652
Did you know the Rabbi there?

181
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:12,131
- Rabbi Schmeitzher?
- Yes, he was a close friend of my father's.

182
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:15,964
- Did you know they shot him?
- No.

183
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:19,731
It's in the synagogue.

184
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:24,451
During the service of Yom Kippur.
I was there.

185
00:33:27,335 --> 00:33:29,803
Let's go outside.

186
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:37,209
You found him. Good.

187
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:45,728
Samuel and I are forming a small group.
We have to select our people very carefully.

188
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:49,368
- We're planning an escape.
- An escape?

189
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:54,134
- For how many?
- We don't know yet. 10 people, perhaps 20 when we work out the details...

190
00:33:54,255 --> 00:34:00,205
Whatever we say here
must be kept secret at all costs.

191
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:04,772
- I swear to God. I'd rather die right here, right now than betray you.
- Good.

192
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:11,091
- Can I bring my wife and my son? Can I bring him?
- How old is the boy?

193
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,683
Four.

194
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:19,209
When you saw your wife and child at the
train station last. Who were they with?

195
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:25,251
- They were with all the other women and children
going to the showers. - Are you sure? - Yes.

196
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,329
What is it?

197
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:35,613
- Itzhak. - What?
- Listen to me. - What?

198
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:40,646
This is a death camp.
Every day a train comes.

199
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:48,011
All the people, everyone who goes to the showers
is dead. Men, women, children. Everyone.

200
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:51,047
Oh, God...
Oh, God... Oh, God... Oh, God...

201
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:01,488
Itzhak.
Itzhak.

202
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:09,732
The fire, the fire is their funeral.

203
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:38,167
They were my life.

204
00:36:54,255 --> 00:37:00,330
- Beautiful. That is excellent work. Excellent, isn't it?
- Very handsome, Herr Commandant.

205
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:07,645
- I expect you to design an SS-ring. I want my SS-men
to have a nice gold ring. Start right away. - Yes, sir.

206
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:30,008
Bend over

207
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:51,403
- You are two lucky Jews.
- Why? Why?

208
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:06,364
Have you seen the new girl
in charge of the rabbits?

209
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:14,004
- I've seen her. I wouldn't mind having a little of that right now.
- A Jew? That's disgusting!

210
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:17,970
- If you saw her...
- Remember Poul and Groth.

211
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:22,850
Two good men. Kicked out of the SS and sent to the
Russian front for raping Jewish girls.

212
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:26,968
- That didn't make sense to me.
- Me neither. We are ordered to kill them.

213
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:32,044
- But we are not allowed to use their bodies first.
- As it should be. We're SS. We're the elite.

214
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:37,249
- We do not soil ourselves in Jewish filth.
- The British bombed Hamburg again.

215
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:43,332
And again I'm lucky.
My wife and kids are alright, thank God.

216
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:49,485
Just be glad you are in a safe place.
Look at us. Proud defenders of the Reich.

217
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:55,451
Don't talk like that. My father was killed in the
first war. Doing his duty for the fatherland.

218
00:38:55,575 --> 00:39:01,684
And we are doing our duty for the Führer here.
That's as honourable as being on a battlefield.

219
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:05,933
- He is right.
- Battlefield. You're crazy.

220
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:11,845
What do you do? Sit in your
little booth and turn on the gas?

221
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:18,892
Valve on... Wait 20 minutes... valve off...
Big job.

222
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:27,533
That takes great courage, Bauer.
How many Jews did you gas today?

223
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:33,447
- Don't talk about that in front of them.
They don't hear anything. Do you?

224
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:38,603
- I'm sorry, sir. I didn't hear you.
- See, they are deaf.

225
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:40,726
- How old are you?
-15, sir.

226
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:48,330
15? My son is 12. I hope he lives to be 15.
I mean if a Jew can, why can't he?

227
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:51,333
- What's your name?
- Toivi, sir.

228
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:56,135
- Toivi. Get me another beer.
- Yes, sir.

229
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:04,049
Get this butcher out of here.

230
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:10,204
I've seen Treblinka.
I don't know how they managed it.

231
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:16,649
- Sloppy security, that's all. - Right, Herr Commandant.
- If Jews at Treblinka can riot and set buildings on fire

232
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:21,371
then they can do it here. - Could they?
- Not at Sobibor, Untersturmführer.

233
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:31,689
But still I want extra caution to be taken. I am advised by Berlin that
they are increasing the number of transports we are to receive to 3 a day.

234
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:36,889
A tribute to our efficiency.
We'll be up to our eyes in Jews.

235
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:42,886
Tell your men what happened at Treblinka.
I expect you to see to it, that nothing like that happens here.

236
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,529
Yes, Herr Commandant.

237
00:40:48,975 --> 00:40:53,890
- Can I help you, sir?
- Here's a little present for you. Put it to work.

238
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:57,645
- Tell them your name.
- We know Toivi, sir. We can use him.

239
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,612
Nobody asked you that.

240
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:11,211
I want a design in gold.
On the handle.

241
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:17,570
- A snake that winds around from here to here.
- I'd be happy to do that for you, sir.

242
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:24,168
- But Sergeant Wagner, he said that I wasn't...
- I don't want to hear about Hauptscharführer Wagner, just do it or I'll break some bones.

243
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:27,851
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

244
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:33,527
Send him to compound 3 tomorrow morning.
Ask for me at the gate, Scharführer Bauer.

245
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:39,208
- I will have a gold piece, I want inserted at the end of the handle. Here.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:17,448
Look at this.

247
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,288
Thank you.

248
00:42:21,655 --> 00:42:26,445
See, the skin is the most nourishing part.

249
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:32,565
I've put a piece in your soup too.

250
00:42:33,695 --> 00:42:36,255
Try it.

251
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:47,928
You must eat. The best revenge
is for you to survive.

252
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:51,807
- Itzhak...
- Hmm?

253
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:57,770
My family was murdered too.

254
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,893
Roll-call in 2 minutes. Come on! Quick!

255
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:23,213
- All I'm saying is that maybe somehow we can use the Ukrainian guards.
- It's possible. - How loyal are these Ukrainians to the SS?

256
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:27,886
They hate the SS as much as they hate us, but they're
mercenaries. and also known as shooting at them.

257
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:31,565
We use them all the time.
When we find gold or jewels in the sorting sheds

258
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:37,327
we steal some of it sometimes and bribe the Ukrainian guards
to bring us food. They get rich but at least we stay alive.

259
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:43,692
- What’s your idea? - Look, suppose we find the right
Ukrainian, we bribe him to bring us poison. Strychnine, cyanide...

260
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:49,333
- Alright, we have the poison, then what?
- Well, who serves the SS meals? The butchers. We get them to do the poisoning...

261
00:43:49,455 --> 00:43:56,372
- They're children, Samuel. It's too much responsibility for them.
- You're right. The problem is we are not soldiers. We don't know how to kill, we never have...

262
00:43:58,975 --> 00:44:00,931
Roll-call, come on.

263
00:44:17,015 --> 00:44:20,132
Sergeant Bauer wants me.

264
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:29,244
- What are you doing? You're not allowed in here.
- Sergeant Bauer ordered me here, sir.

265
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:37,443
Wait here.

266
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:49,367
- What's taking Moses so long?
- Maybe he got lost.

267
00:46:55,255 --> 00:46:57,450
No, here he is.

268
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:05,451
- Moses! Moses! Moses! What happened?
Did someone hurt you? - No.

269
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:11,844
- What is it? What happened? Tell us.
- I went there to get this.

270
00:47:12,255 --> 00:47:18,012
- From sergeant Bauer. - Yes, I know that.
- I saw the shower place.

271
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:24,683
And there are no showers.
'Cause all the people who go in there, are killed.

272
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:31,654
I saw the dead bodies.
Women, babies...

273
00:47:31,775 --> 00:47:40,410
All twisted together. And prisoners like us
throw them on carts and pull them away.

274
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:45,655
Everyone who goes for a shower is dead.

275
00:47:46,095 --> 00:47:54,571
Everyone. Shlomo, our whole family is dead.

276
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:05,613
- You knew this. You knew and you didn't tell us.
- My family are dead too.

277
00:48:05,735 --> 00:48:10,286
The sergeants, they said if I told anyone,
they'd kill me.

278
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:17,532
Our mother, our father and our sister
are murdered.

279
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:22,691
Now I want to kill.
And I will kill!

280
00:48:36,535 --> 00:48:42,053
- Which one of you is Leon? - I am. You are
the new... eh... the new goldsmith. - Shlomo.

281
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:45,372
- Yes, hello Shlomo.
- What's going on in here?

282
00:48:45,815 --> 00:48:48,773
How can you do this in a place where
they murder your families?

283
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:55,494
They kill little children. And you make music, you laugh,
you play games, you even make love. In here, it's a carnival.

284
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:59,813
And you work for these monsters!
You packet our clothing to send to Germany.

285
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:03,086
My mother's clothing,
my father's clo...

286
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:11,809
Now that you know the truth about Sobibor,
will you still make jewellery for them?

287
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:18,886
What will you do? Refuse? Consider yourself
an honoured person because you let them kill you?

288
00:49:19,015 --> 00:49:26,205
No, you won't. As we don't.
And every day will be an agony of conscience.

289
00:49:28,815 --> 00:49:31,773
It's the same for everybody here.

290
00:49:31,895 --> 00:49:39,051
When I came here, I was with my wife and small child. They took me to
work in the sorting shed. My wife and child were sent to the showers.

291
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:42,326
The next day I am sorting through clothes, and I...
I come...

292
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:54,248
I came across their clothes. I find them by accident. This
is the way I find that they are dead. My wife. My child.

293
00:49:56,135 --> 00:50:00,606
But what is there to do but survive?

294
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:05,889
Yes, we sing and we dance.
Sometimes we make jokes. We make love.

295
00:50:06,015 --> 00:50:11,851
If not, we deny life.
We work for them so we may survive.

296
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:16,253
And we survive for a reason.
Revenge.

297
00:50:16,455 --> 00:50:21,529
And some day we will have it.
Do you understand?

298
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:26,775
I will do anything for revenge.
Even if I have to die for it.

299
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:30,723
- How old are you?
- How old do you have to be?

300
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:33,005
You're old enough.

301
00:50:56,575 --> 00:51:00,204
Wagner's going to be late on his round today.

302
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:04,652
No he isn't!
Here he comes!

303
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:16,769
God morning, ladies.

304
00:51:16,895 --> 00:51:19,807
And how is the work
progressing this morning?

305
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:37,567
- No, please...
- Is that yours?

306
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:42,325
- What are you going to do?
- What do you think?

307
00:51:43,335 --> 00:51:47,374
There are no babies in Sobibor

308
00:51:59,775 --> 00:52:04,053
- You're going to kill her? - Because I am in a
good mood today, I'm going to let you live.

309
00:52:04,175 --> 00:52:10,045
- No! - I really shouldn't. You're
a lucky woman. - Give me my baby!

310
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:23,926
You don't understand. I'm offering you
a chance to live. It's quite unusual.

311
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:30,364
I spit on your offer, you Nazi bastard.

312
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:54,728
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out.

313
00:52:56,335 --> 00:53:01,614
- But even if we do.. even if we do escape, what then?
- We disappear into the forest.

314
00:53:01,735 --> 00:53:10,131
There are partisan groups there. We find these groups and we
join them. But first things first. We must find a way of escaping.

315
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:22,213
This should be one of our easier days.
These Dutch will behave themselves.

316
00:53:35,735 --> 00:53:38,124
I'll take this.

317
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:45,013
- Here. Be sure to keep your baggage check.
- Thank you. Just a second.

318
00:53:49,415 --> 00:53:53,124
- Here you are.
- We're not allowed to accept tips, Madame.

319
00:53:53,495 --> 00:53:56,726
- Nonsense. Please, take it.
- I can't.

320
00:53:56,855 --> 00:54:03,772
Well, then only as a souvenir from Holland.
Are there any other Dutch people already here?

321
00:54:03,895 --> 00:54:07,205
No, this is the first train from Holland.

322
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:26,172
- Here is your baggage check. Don't lose it.
- Thank you, I won't.

323
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,610
When they ask for seamstresses or laundresses just
raise your hand. Whatever it is, say you're a professional.

324
00:54:33,335 --> 00:54:35,849
- Why?
- Just do it.

325
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,971
Look at the SS. They're amused.

326
00:55:10,935 --> 00:55:16,328
- Bastards!
- Not only do we die for them, we dance for them like stupid performing bears.

327
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:27,373
- That was charming. A lovely
folkdance. - Thank you. - Very charming.

328
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:33,088
Now, everybody dance. Play.

329
00:55:37,495 --> 00:55:40,726
I want you all to have a good time.
Come on.

330
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:46,249
Dance! Enjoy it. Let's dance.

331
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:51,452
Let's dance. Come on. Dance.

332
00:55:51,855 --> 00:55:55,291
May I have the honour?

333
00:55:58,535 --> 00:56:01,447
Let's dance. Come on.

334
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:10,444
- Hello, Bajle.
- Hello.

335
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:16,088
- You dance beautifully.
- Thank you.

336
00:56:17,455 --> 00:56:21,289
- You came to Sobibor alone?
- Yes.

337
00:56:21,855 --> 00:56:26,804
- Where are your family?
- I don't know where they are.

338
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:31,205
- I'm by myself.
- And I'm by myself.

339
00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:45,483
- My name is Chaim. -
I'm Selma. Hello. - Hello.

340
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,931
- Would you dance with me?
- Oh, I would.

341
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:57,054
Come on! Come on!

342
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:04,133
- You look like you want to dance.
- Yes, but I don't know how.

343
00:57:04,815 --> 00:57:07,693
Would you like me to show you?

344
00:57:08,255 --> 00:57:13,045
- But no laughing.
- Maybe just a little.

345
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:20,367
Let's dance! Come on!

346
00:57:23,295 --> 00:57:26,731
One, two three,
one, two three...

347
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,651
I keep seeing people coming to you for advice.

348
00:57:35,775 --> 00:57:39,927
We talk it passes the time.

349
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:46,530
Whatever it is, if I can ever help,
just say so.

350
00:57:46,895 --> 00:57:52,447
Bajle, I don't know how to say things like this...

351
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,454
but I want you.

352
00:57:57,215 --> 00:58:00,685
Let me tell you, you do know
how to say things like that.

353
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:07,804
Shlomo, I'm 26.
Why don't you ask one of the younger girls?

354
00:58:08,295 --> 00:58:13,813
I've never eaten an apple before.
I wouldn't want a green one.

355
00:58:14,855 --> 00:58:18,404
Bajle... When?

356
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:24,533
We'll see.

357
00:58:41,575 --> 00:58:43,884
Wagner's coming!

358
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:52,494
Keep working.

359
00:58:54,695 --> 00:58:58,973
- When will the SS rings be finished?
- We'll finish the last ones today, sir.

360
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:02,690
I have orders from Commandant Reichleitner to
close down the goldsmith shop when the rings are done.

361
00:59:02,815 --> 00:59:06,694
- Why?
- It doesn't matter why.

362
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:13,530
Now listen to me. I'm making you the head of the mechanics shop.
You'll have 4 or 5 men under you and a lot of hard work.

363
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:17,614
If you want to live, you'll see that it's done right.

364
00:59:18,015 --> 00:59:22,167
- You can take that one with you. What's his name?
- Moses.

365
00:59:25,255 --> 00:59:27,450
Ah... the king of Jews.

366
00:59:29,295 --> 00:59:35,086
You will work and sleep in the mechanics shop and at night,
in secret, you'll continue to make gold jewellery

367
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:39,731
for me and for whoever I send to you.
Remember, if this secret leaks

368
00:59:39,855 --> 00:59:45,452
you and the little king will be dead 5 minutes later.
Understood?

369
00:59:45,575 --> 00:59:47,805
Yes.

370
00:59:51,215 --> 00:59:56,414
- Sir, what about Toivi, sir?
- You better find yourself another job.

371
00:59:56,535 --> 01:00:00,210
What other job, sir?

372
01:00:01,695 --> 01:00:04,687
Any other job!

373
01:00:50,935 --> 01:00:53,244
Get up! Get up!
Get up!

374
01:00:56,735 --> 01:01:01,047
Alright, 25 for you.
And don't forget to count.

375
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:09,929
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

376
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:17,928
Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!

377
01:01:19,415 --> 01:01:24,967
Eleven! Twelve! Thirteen! Fourteen!...

378
01:01:42,255 --> 01:01:47,283
Kapo! Hurry up! Move it!
Move along!

379
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:53,726
Here, You. Get the water.

380
01:01:58,455 --> 01:02:02,334
- Got a light?
- I think so. - You two, wait!

381
01:02:03,535 --> 01:02:06,971
- Now?
- At the stream, I'll hit him.

382
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:10,611
Alright, go ahead. Move!

383
01:02:23,495 --> 01:02:28,774
- What's taking them so long? - I don't
know. - Stay here, I'll have a look.

384
01:02:46,215 --> 01:02:49,525
Scharführer! Scharführer Wolf!

385
01:02:50,215 --> 01:02:54,652
Two prisoners... escaped... at the stream!
They have a rifle!

386
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,654
You, you, you and you follow me!
Come on!

387
01:03:00,775 --> 01:03:04,324
They got out.
Let's go! Go!

388
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,804
Stand at attention!

389
01:04:01,135 --> 01:04:04,605
This morning two prisoners
escaped from North Camp.

390
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:10,093
13 other prisoners, no doubt inspired
by that idiotic example

391
01:04:10,215 --> 01:04:17,530
also tried to escape. If any of you would
like to cheer. Go right ahead.

392
01:04:18,415 --> 01:04:24,172
There will be no more escape attempts
in this camp. I'll repeat that:

393
01:04:24,455 --> 01:04:28,812
There will be no more escape attempts
in this camp!

394
01:04:29,215 --> 01:04:33,891
We're going to kill these
13 men while you watch.

395
01:04:34,255 --> 01:04:40,091
But we're going to do more than that.
We're going to allow each of these men.

396
01:04:40,215 --> 01:04:46,404
the privilege of selecting one of you,
as his partner in death.

397
01:04:46,535 --> 01:04:50,414
26 will die today.

398
01:04:55,415 --> 01:04:58,134
Go and select your partners.

399
01:05:00,135 --> 01:05:05,334
You're all free to walk over and
select your partners. Do it now.

400
01:05:07,815 --> 01:05:11,854
I said, do it now.

401
01:05:12,815 --> 01:05:16,091
Do it now!

402
01:05:16,215 --> 01:05:20,766
No! None of us will do.
We will never do it.

403
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:29,051
Let me explain.
This is simple mathematics.

404
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,645
So it shouldn't be
too difficult to understand.

405
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:39,214
If you 13 men do not
select 13 to die with you

406
01:05:39,575 --> 01:05:43,329
then I will select 50.

407
01:05:44,215 --> 01:05:47,013
So the decision is yours.

408
01:05:48,055 --> 01:05:52,890
13 or 50?

409
01:06:14,775 --> 01:06:17,448
I'm sorry.

410
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:58,571
And now we begin. You will watch this,
so that you will remember.

411
01:07:58,695 --> 01:08:03,928
If I find anyone turning away
or closing their eyes

412
01:08:05,095 --> 01:08:10,692
then that person will join
these 26 who are about to die.

413
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:22,284
Scharführer Fallaster!
Yes, Hauptscharführer Wagner.

414
01:08:24,455 --> 01:08:27,652
Take your positions.

415
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:31,972
Avenge us!

416
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:35,288
Fire!

417
01:08:48,935 --> 01:08:53,372
Enough time off now.
Everyone back to work.

418
01:09:01,935 --> 01:09:07,805
Tell the others... We'll meet in your
shed tonight. 8 o'clock

419
01:09:15,295 --> 01:09:18,173
There's something we have to discuss.

420
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:23,407
We've been planning the escape
for a small number of people

421
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:28,563
but you saw what happened today when 13 men
tried to escape. The same thing will happen again.

422
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:34,487
We can not leave hundreds behind
to be slaughtered. And they would be.

423
01:09:34,615 --> 01:09:40,133
Therefore, the escape we plan must be for every prisoner in Sobibor.

424
01:09:43,495 --> 01:09:48,125
Everyone?
Even the workers in camp 3?

425
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:52,407
Yes, all 600.
Or else no one.

426
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:58,048
But that's impossible.
How can we get 600 people out of here?

427
01:09:58,175 --> 01:10:01,690
I believe there is a way.
And I believe that we must find it.

428
01:10:01,815 --> 01:10:09,813
Leon is right. It is an incredible idea. 600 people!
Everyone in Sobibor must have a chance to be free.

429
01:10:09,935 --> 01:10:13,450
There is no other choice.

430
01:10:16,215 --> 01:10:18,410
Shlomo?

431
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:21,975
Morris?

432
01:10:23,335 --> 01:10:25,644
Mundek?

433
01:10:26,575 --> 01:10:28,805
Itzhak?

434
01:10:29,255 --> 01:10:32,645
Good, the we are agreed.

435
01:10:33,175 --> 01:10:40,684
Alright, let's put our mind to discovering what
this plan should be. There is one if we can just find it.

436
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:48,213
What about this?
We build 30 ladders in my carpenter shop.

437
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:53,125
They should be maybe 12 foot long.
This is perfect!

438
01:10:53,255 --> 01:10:59,012
On a dark night we rush the fence.
20 people go over each ladder. Zip, zip, zip, zip.

439
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:02,650
In no time. That's 600 people.

440
01:11:02,935 --> 01:11:09,010
- Even if you could build it, where would we hide the ladders?
- Make it 20 ladders. 30 people over each.

441
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:17,486
- We'll find a place to hide them somewhere. I don't know.
- And what about the minefields outside the fence?

442
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:23,324
- It won't work, Morris.
- That's alright, Morris. Keep thinking. Every idea may be the right one.

443
01:11:23,455 --> 01:11:28,575
- Let's talk about a tunnel.
- Exactly. It would have to be at least 50 yards long.

444
01:11:28,695 --> 01:11:33,371
- But how could we do that?
- It doesn't matter. Let's say we can dig this tunnel and hide the dirt.

445
01:11:33,495 --> 01:11:38,489
The suppose we start the escape at midnight
and give each of us 600 people 1 minute to get through

446
01:11:38,615 --> 01:11:42,403
the tunnel, crawl through and escape into the woods.
which is impossible, but never mind,

447
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:47,325
that adds up to 600 minutes. 10 hours.
We'd still be escaping at 10 o'clock in the morning.

448
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:53,485
- Well, we have to come up with a real plan soon.
- It's there. We can find it.

449
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:57,845
We'll meet again tomorrow.

450
01:12:53,855 --> 01:12:57,165
- Russian soldiers.
- What are they doing here?

451
01:12:57,295 --> 01:13:02,244
- They should be in a prisoner of war camp. Maybe they’re all Jews.
- Maybe.

452
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:19,010
You wanted to know about the Russians.
They are all Jewish.

453
01:13:19,135 --> 01:13:24,084
- They're here to do heavy labour in the North Camp.
- Thanks.

454
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:29,452
See if their officer will meet me
in the women’s barracks tonight.

455
01:13:29,575 --> 01:13:34,330
I don't know what is going on,
but whatever it is, I wish you good luck.

456
01:14:00,455 --> 01:14:03,606
No, no, no, no.
Now, we'll just see what he's like.

457
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:08,445
- Let's find out if he trusts us.
- Or whether we trust him.

458
01:14:08,975 --> 01:14:14,891
Civilians and soldiers, Russians, Poles
trusting each other. I don't know...

459
01:14:15,135 --> 01:14:20,846
- Well, we have to try.
- Supposing they escape?

460
01:14:21,335 --> 01:14:24,805
If they escape, they'll pay for it.

461
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:34,186
- Lieutenant, I am Leon Feldhendler.
- Alexander Pechersky.

462
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,667
- This is Samuel Freiberg.
- A pleasure, lieutenant Perchersky.

463
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:41,385
Everyone calls me Sasha.
It saves time and energy.

464
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:46,106
Thank you. We would like very much to know
what's happening in the outside world. Would you tell us?

465
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:49,222
- Of course.
- What's happening in the war?

466
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:54,061
- Please, please.
- How far away is your army?

467
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:58,661
We are between 6 and 700 miles away.

468
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:02,066
We are beating back the Nazis,
but it is a slow process.

469
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:07,583
- Are there partisans nearby? Could they help us?
- They have many things to do.

470
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:13,349
I'm afraid here, we must help ourselves.
