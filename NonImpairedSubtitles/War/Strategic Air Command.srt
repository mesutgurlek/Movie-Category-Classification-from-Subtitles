1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Bombers high

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,200
Riding the air

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,800
Every man

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
Doing his share

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,000
Men of war

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Better beware

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
When the Air Force

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Takes command

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,400
Bombers high

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,000
Ready we stand

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,400
Minutemen

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Guarding the land

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
Thunder rides

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Here in our hand

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
When the air force

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,000
Takes command

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,400
Our legions

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,400
Are legend

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,000
Our wings

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,600
Own the blue

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
With jets

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Winding free

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
And men

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Flying true

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
Ride the wind

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
Follow a star

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,600
Find the foe

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
Strike where they are

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,000
Round the world

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Isn't too far

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,600
When the air force

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,600
Takes command

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
America today is watching her skies
with grave concern.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,600
For in these skies of peace,
the nation is building its defense.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,400
To the officers and men of
The United States Air Force,

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,400
to The Strategic Air Command, whose
cooperation is gratefully acknowledged,

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
and to the young men
of America who will one day

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,000
take their places besides them, this
motion picture is dedicated.

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Well, here we are.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,000
An Elderly Parson, shouldn't yield
to temptation this way.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
Oh, nonsense, Dad.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,200
The sun will do you good.

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Good morning.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Hi, darling!

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
Hey, that boy's good.

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Who is he?

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,200
He's a rookie named Brewster.
Just up from Columbus.

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Hi, Joe. How am I doing, coach?

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,400
Well, you're comming along.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,400
Coming along, huh?

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
This daughter of yours is kind
of hard to please, you know?

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Say, how about that Brewster kid?
Doesn't he look sharp?

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
No. They ougth to play him at third.

54
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
He doesn't move well to the right.

55
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,400
You want him to take my job.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
Oh!, in 3 or 4 years, perhaps.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
He's young. He can wait.

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah, true.

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,600
What's going on now, Robert?

60
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Intersquad game.
Reds against the blues.

61
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm captain of the blues.
See you later.

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,400
Oh, that reminds me.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
I forgot to give Dutch a message.

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,600
Some Air Force friend of
his named Rusty Castle

65
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
phoned and said he was comming over.

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Oh, well, Dutch won't care much

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
one way or the other.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
How do you know he won't?

69
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Well, I just know.

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
He's and old war buddy of his,
a flyer or something,

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
and I know Dutch.

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
The last thing he wants
is to hass over old times.

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
You seem to know
you husband very well

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
considering the short time
you've been married.

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, I do! I know him like a book.

76
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
- Is that so surprising?
- Well, rather.

77
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Why?

78
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,800
I've known your mother
for 30 years.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
What I don't know about her
would fill a very large book.

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Now, I'm just going to show you.

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,600
Brewster is comming to bat,

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
and Dutch likes him.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,400
And the kid always hits
to the left.

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Now, you just watch Dutch.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
If he connects,

86
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,000
he's going to try to
make it look like a hit.

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,800
See what I mean?

88
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Any more questions, Dr. Thorne?

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,200
Well, I guess we better go, Dad.

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Good morning, reverend, Sally.

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Hi, Tom.

92
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
Well, our boy looks pretty good.

93
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,400
Yes, he's coming along.

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
Can't you stay a while?

95
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
No, thank you. Dad has
to work on his sermon,

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
and I have to go home

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,800
and get ready for the housewarming.

98
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,600
You just stay here and watch
your livestock at work.

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
and pretty expensive livestock...

100
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,600
especially your husband.

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Yes, well, feeding him is
no cinch, either, you know.

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll see you later. Tom.
Bye-bye.

103
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
- Mrs. Holland?
- Yes.

104
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm Rusty Castle.

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Oh, yes, of course!

106
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
This is my father Dr. Thorne

107
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,800
and Mr. Doyle.

108
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Hello, Mr. Doyle.

109
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,600
Well, I'm glad to meet you, General.

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
- General?
- Rusty!

111
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,800
Rusty, how are you?

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Hello, Dutch.

113
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Boy, am I glad to see you.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
Hey, you're looking great.
How are you hitting them?

115
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Oh, I'm getting in shape.

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
- Did you meet all these people?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
Why didn't you tell us
you were coming to town?

118
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Well, see. I was over at
a staff meeting at MacDill...

119
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, General Castle did phone.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I haven't had a chance
to tell you. I'm sorry.

121
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Oh! Oh, well, that's all right!

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
When, you just got here
at the right time.

123
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
We're having a houseworming tonight.

124
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
How about staying over, huh?

125
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Well, I...

126
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,800
- Oh, please do!
- Along, come on!

127
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,400
I'd be glad to.

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Good.

129
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,400
Well, I've got to run, sweetheart,

130
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
and I'll see you later.

131
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm awfully glad
you can stay, General.

132
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Thanks, Mrs. Holland.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Goodbye, reverend.

134
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,400
Well, what do you know?
What's new, Rusty?

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Well, come on, give me the lowdown.

136
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
That's just what I came to do, Dutch.

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
But I think it better
wait until later.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Oh? What, is something cooking?

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah, in a way.

140
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,200
Is that so?

141
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Hey, Dutch, you're up!

142
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh!, I'll see you later.

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
Dutch is pretty valuable
to the Cardinals,

144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Isn't he, Mr. Doyle?

145
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
Valuable?

146
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
He drove in 152 runs last year.

147
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,400
He just signed a $70.000
a year contract.

148
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
We don't pay salaries like that

149
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
for fun, General.

150
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, I can understand that.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Dutch was the best
B-29 commander I had.

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Not many men with his
judgment, coordination,

153
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
and whatever else it takes

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
to come through in the pinches.

155
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Why did you ask me that, General?

156
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Why?

157
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,400
I was thinking...

158
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,000
He'd be just as valuable to S.A.C.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
S.A.C? What's S.A.C.?

160
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,800
Strategic Air Command.

161
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
We're the Air Forces's
Global bombing outfit.

162
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,200
Oh. You're the boys
that dropped the A-Bomb?

163
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
Well, I hope not.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Our job is to be ready and able

165
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
to strike back anywhere in the world

166
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
if this country is ever attacked.

167
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
And quite a job you got there, General.

168
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes, It's a big job, all right.

169
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Our greatest problem
is personnel, Mr. Doyle.

170
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
We need mature, experienced
leaders in S.A.C.

171
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Men like Dutch.

172
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Are you trying to tell me they
want Dutch back in the Air Force?

173
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,000
That's exactly what
I'm trying to tell you, Mr Doyle.

174
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Oh, boy!

175
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Well, this is the craziest thing
I've ever heard of.

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
What do you want with a guy me age?

177
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
I haven't flown
and airplane in 6 years.

178
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
I've never even been close to a jet.

179
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
Look, Dutch, we don't need
young kids in S.A.C.

180
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,200
We need old hands
like you, experience.

181
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Well, where's the fire?

182
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I, I, I just don't see
the necessity.

183
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,400
You would if you were in my seat.

184
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
Look, do you realize

185
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
that we're the only thing
that's keeping the peace?

186
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
By staying combat ready,
we can prevent a war.

187
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Dutch, if I didn't beleave that,

188
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
If my commanders and crew
didn't believe that,

189
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,800
I couldn't get a single
airplane off the ground.

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,200
But I I've don't my share.

191
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Doggone it, why do you
have to recall me?

192
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm not recalling you, Dutch.
This wasn't my decision.

193
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Believe me, I fell worse
about it than you do.

194
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I asked you to take
that reserve commission

195
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
just as a gesture
for old time's sake.

196
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,800
I never thought the time would come.

197
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
All right, whose decision was this?

198
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,800
General Hawkes.

199
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
I even tried to talk him out of it,

200
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
but they're calling up everyone
in your reserve classification.

201
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
The General was adamant...
no exceptions.

202
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,000
I could talk to?

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,600
Sure, sure, but he's boss of S.A.C.

204
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,200
There are people who could fire him,

205
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
but I'll guarantee there's no one

206
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,000
Who could ever make him
change his decision.

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Well, this is it, then, huh?

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
I report a week from tuesday?

209
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
That's right.

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
Your orders are on their way now...

211
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,200
21 months of active duty.

212
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
21 months?

213
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,000
You, you realize
what this does to me?

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm no youngster anymore.

215
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I've got a few more good
years in baseball left.

216
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
No you take me away...

217
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Look, Dutch, there's just
no point in arguing with me.

218
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,600
No, I guess not.

219
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,600
Your orders read report to
my headquarters at Carswell.

220
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
Yes, sir.

221
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Well, I...

222
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,600
I guess I'd better be
running along, Dutch.

223
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
See you soon, huh?

224
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,400
Yes, General, I suppose you will.

225
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
Leaving, General?

226
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Oh, yes!, I'm afraid
I have to, Mr. Doyle.

227
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Would you please give my
apologies to Mrs. Holland?

228
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,400
Well?

229
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,800
Well, that's it...

230
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
21 months.

231
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
I have to report to Carswell
a week from tuesday.

232
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Isn't there anyone we can go to?

233
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Castle says it's no use.

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
Of course, you know
how I feel, Dutch.

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,400
What worries me most
is Sally, though.

237
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Sally? Oh! I wouldn't worry
too much about her.

238
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
No, but I do.

239
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
This is going to be
an awfull wallop to her.

240
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,600
She's been fixing up the house.

241
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,400
She's getting a big kick
out of the ball club.

242
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Now something like this happens.

243
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,000
What am I going to tell her?

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,200
Maybe it won't be
as hard as you think.

245
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, just don't say anything
to her about it, will you?

246
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,000
She's worked so hard on this
housewarming and everything.

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,400
I just want her to have
this evening, huh?

248
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,400
I won't say a word.

249
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
I'll figure out some way
to break it to her later

250
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
when everybody's letf.
Come on!

251
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,600
It was a lovely party, Sally.

252
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
and you look just radiant.

253
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Thank you.

254
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,000
It's wonderful to see a young couple
so gay and happy, isn't it?

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
it certainly is, Mrs. Thorne.

256
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Good night, Tom.

257
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Good night, Sally.

258
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Good night, Tom. I'll see you.

259
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,800
Well...

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,400
It was just a wonderful party, Sally.

261
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Thank you, sweetheart.

262
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,800
You know, we're going
to remenber this for a long time

263
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,600
our first housewarming.

264
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,400
That's the kind of thing
you don't forget, you know.

265
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,400
No. That's why I wanted
it to be just perfect.

266
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,200
It sure was.

267
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Your mother seemed to have
a good time, didn't she?

268
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Yes. She always does.

269
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,000
She's beginning to sound more
like a baseball fan every day.

270
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
Say, your dad had a drink
just to celebrate the occasion.

271
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I know. I saw him.

272
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,400
Sally, would you...

273
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,800
let me have this a minute. I...

274
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,600
come over here and sit down.

275
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,000
- Dutch.
- Sally. What?

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
There's something I have to tell you.

277
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
Well, what is it?

278
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
You're going back into the Air Force.

279
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Tom told me this afternoon.

280
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, that's what I've been trying to.

281
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
Well, what do you think?

282
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, what do I think?
what do you think?

283
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,400
I don't care about this house.
Mother can take care of that.

284
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,800
We can sublet. That's no problem.

285
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I certainly don't mind
missing the season

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,200
and losing all that money.

287
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
What?

288
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,800
No. I'm not a child.

289
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
Oh, honey, I know you're not a child.

290
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,000
And if you go, then
we both go on active duty.

291
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Besides, what's wrong
with being an Air Force wife

292
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,800
and living in a barracks
or whatever you call them?

293
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,400
It migh be fun.

294
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Anything you do is fine with me,

295
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
just so long as you don't
leave me behind.

296
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,000
You mean that?

297
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
Of course I do.

298
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,400
I married you, Dutch,
not a house room.

299
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm lieutenant colonel Holland.
I'm reporting in for duty.

300
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
May I see your
identification, colonel?

301
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,200
I, I don't have an I.D. card.
They never sent me one.

302
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm sorry, sir.

303
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
I can't admit a civilian
without identification.

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
I'm not a civilian!
I wish I was a civilian.

305
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Here. Here are my orders.

306
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Civilian.

307
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
Security officer?

308
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
Captain, I've got a man
here at the gate

309
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,600
with no identification card.

310
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
His orders say that
he's on active duty,

311
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,600
but he's not in uniform.

312
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Very well, sir.

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,800
You'll have to wait, sir, until
the security officer gets here.

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,400
Sergeant, if you'd just
call General Castle...

315
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
Hey.

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,600
Pull over. Pull over there, then.

317
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,000
General Castle, please.

318
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
May I speak to the General?

319
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This is Dutch Holland...
Colonel Holland.

320
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Well, as soon as you reach him,
would you tell him,

321
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm having a little trouble
at the main gate?

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's right. I can't get in.

323
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
May I see your orders?

324
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, this whole thing's ridiculous.

325
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and your driver's license.

326
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,200
There you are.

327
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
License expired.

328
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
It has?

329
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Are you Dutch Holland the ball player?

330
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,400
I was.

331
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,800
I've been reading about you.
You don't look much like your pictures.

332
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,800
Well, you don't look much like
your picture, either, Captain.

333
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
We had a phony one time.

334
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Fella got on the base

335
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,200
With a pass that showed
a picture of an orangutan.

336
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,000
They had us all
on the carpet for that one.

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,200
No orangutans allowed?

338
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,800
I'm glad to see your men
are on the job, Captain.

339
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,000
That's be all.

340
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hello, Dutch, how are you?

341
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
I'm sorry you had so much trouble here,
but a uniform would help, you know.

342
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,400
Yeah, well, I left in such a hurry,
and muy old ones were the wrong color.

343
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,200
Yeah, well, that'll be easy.
I'll drop you off at the post exchage,

344
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
first stop.

345
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,200
OK.

346
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Did Sally come with you?

347
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No, She'll be here
as soon as I get squared away.

348
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,600
Good. I can get you a set
of quarters here on the base.

349
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Fine.

350
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
"Control tower
calling General Castle".

351
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,400
Castle. Go ahead.

352
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Sir, I've got a commercial DC-3

353
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,000
coming in for an emergency landing.

354
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,000
Why can't he land
at municipal airport?

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
He says he can't make it, sir.

356
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,400
All right, have the security
officer notified right away.

357
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,800
Affirmative, General.

358
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Notify the security officer.

359
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We're kind of particular
these days, Dutch.

360
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,600
All S.A.C. bases are restricted.

361
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,200
Alert the fire trucks and meet wagon.

362
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Fire station,

363
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,400
we have an unidentified
DC-3 in the pattern,

364
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,800
landing at the present time.

365
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,000
That is all the information we have.

366
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,200
This is Colonel Holland.
I'll vouch for him.

367
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,800
Where does that fool
think he's going?

368
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,200
All right, stand back.

369
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,800
Major, search that airplane.

370
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,600
Yes, sir.

371
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,000
That won't be necessary.

372
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,600
What's the excuse, Rusty?

373
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Well, Frankly, sir,

374
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,400
I thought we handled
this security test pretty well.

375
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,800
Better than I expected.

376
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Of course, you just
lost your life, Rusty.

377
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,000
Why didn't you block off
that taxi strip, Major?

378
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
It never ocurred to me,
General Hawkes.

379
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
It should have.

380
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,000
Your men should have gotten
here sooner.

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,200
My men should never have
gotten out of that aircraft.

382
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Yes, sir. I don't have enough
experienced personnel, sir.

383
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,800
Don't tell me
your little problems, son.

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
All I'm interested in is results.

385
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,800
I want airtight security, Rusty,

386
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,200
so it'll be impossible
for an unidentified aircraft

387
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,400
to barge right into your flight line.

388
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
What the devil is
that civilian doing here?

389
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,200
I'm just carrying out
your orders, General.

390
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,000
My orders?

391
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
Yes, sir. He was with me,
General, just reporting for duty.

392
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,800
Lieutenant Colonel Holland,
this is General Hawkes.

393
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
You're Dutch Holland?

394
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Yes, sir.

395
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
We've been expecting you.

396
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,800
Yes, sir, I know.

397
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
In a blue suit.

398
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
General, I realize...

399
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
Good to have you in S.A.C., Dutch.

400
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Hope you enjoy your tour.

401
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,800
You'll find there's been a few
changes since you were in last.

402
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,400
Yes, sir, I've found
a few already, General.

403
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,200
Come in.

404
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
Colonel Holland, sir,
reporting for duty.

405
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
Glad to have you
assigned to my wing, Dutch.

406
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,000
Got a real job waiting
for you in operations,

407
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
unless you have a preference.

408
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Well, sir, as long as I'm here

409
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
I'd just as soon fly
as sit at a desk.

410
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
You'll fly, all right

411
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,200
All my staff officers are pilots
first and desk jockeys second.

412
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
"Samford".

413
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,600
Come in, will you, Rocky?

414
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,000
Rocky Samford is my
director of operations.

415
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,600
You'll be his assistant.

416
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Sounds fine to me, Colonel.

417
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,400
Of course, I'm an old B-29 pilot.

418
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
I don't know the first
thing about a B-36.

419
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,800
Well, we'll check you out on a B-36
while you understudy Samford.

420
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,200
The idea is for you to replace him,

421
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,200
so he can move into
one of the new units.

422
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I see.

423
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
S.A.C. has something big coming up...

424
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
the B-47.

425
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,000
Colonel Samford. Colonel Holland.

426
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
How are you?

427
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Glad to meet you, Dutch.

428
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
Been a fan of yours for years.

429
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I heard about you back on Guam

430
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,400
when you where with the 315th.

431
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Well, Rocky, he's your baby.

432
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,200
You've got yourself an assistant.

433
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
Shouldn't take you long
to take over my job, Dutch.

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,200
No sweat.

435
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
I've got 21 months.
I'll do what I can.

436
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Good luck on your physical.

437
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Thank you, sir.

438
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,600
Want to take a look at our setup?

439
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Fine.

440
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,000
"P-E-Z."

441
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,400
"T-E-C-F-D...

442
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,800
E- D-F... "

443
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Captain Brown.

444
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
"C-Z-P."

445
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,000
Call for you, Colonel Holland.

446
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Colonel Holland.

447
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
Sally.

448
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,800
Well, how are you?

449
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Where are you?

450
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm at the airport.

451
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,400
What airport?

452
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,600
Here in Fort Worth?
What are you doing here?

453
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Well, what do you think I'm doing?

454
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I came to be with you

455
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,800
Oh!, I've missed you.

456
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm your bride of 5 months,
remember me?

457
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Yes, dear, I know, but...

458
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Well, I just didn't see any sense
in sitting around and waiting,

459
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
so here I am.

460
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Don't you want me?

461
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
Well, honey, of course I want you,

462
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
but we don't have any quarters yet.

463
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,800
Now, I have to get in touch
with Rusty and find out.

464
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll tell you. You go to a hotel.

465
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,000
Go to the Blackstone hotel,

466
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and I'm taking a physical
examination right now.

467
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,600
What's the matter? Are you sick?

468
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,600
No, no, everything's fine.

469
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,000
As soon as...
I'll call you later.

470
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Bye, dear.

471
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,800
Good bye.

472
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
Where was I?

473
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
Say "A".

474
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,400
Captain Johnson.

475
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,800
It's for you, Colonel.

476
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Colonel Holland.

477
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,200
You're at the main gate?

478
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,600
Well, yeah, I got ahold of Rusty,

479
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,200
and he's checking on it now, but I...

480
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
get somebody to take you
over to the officers club.

481
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,400
I'll come over
as soon as I'm finished.

482
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,400
I have no idea, dear.
They go over you from head to foot.

483
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
They're just down to my throat now.

484
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,600
What?

485
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Well, this one says
I don't have any adenoids.

486
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Adenoids.

487
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Good bye, dear.

488
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,600
We're going to take you
up to 45.000 feet.

489
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
Major Fleming.

490
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,800
Colonel Holland can't come
to the phone right now.

491
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Just a minute.

492
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,600
It's your wife, Colonel Holland.

493
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
She says it's urgent.

494
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,200
Well, uh...

495
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
Tell her I'll call her back.

496
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,800
He says he'll call you back.

497
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
He's up to 45.000 feet.

498
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
I don't see him.

499
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,600
No, no, in a training tank,
Mrs. Holland.

500
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,800
Mrs. Holland is at your quarters.

501
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,200
She says to meet her there.

502
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,200
My quarters? Where are they?

503
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,000
She says General Castle
drove her to your quarters.

504
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
She has no idea where they are.

505
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Do all Air Force officers
live in such luxury?

506
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,400
Oh, no, this is just because

507
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,800
General Hawkes has taken
such a shine to me.

508
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,600
Yeah, well, he certainly has,
the old bat.

509
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Now, shh, shh.

510
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,000
Sally, now, we're on a S.A.C. base.

511
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Dutch, are you angry with me

512
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,200
because I didn't wait
for you to send for me?

513
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, I was kind of upset at first,

514
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,400
but now that I see you
in that nightgown,

515
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
I've kind of changed my mind.

516
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
It's all right. All right, dear.

517
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
All right.

518
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,400
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hello, Mrs. Castle.

519
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
What's happened?

520
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
The cards are ahead 6 to 2.

521
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Do you know that Brewster
just drove in another run?

522
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,000
Eh, good for him!

523
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Well, I guess
I'd better get out there.

524
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
You wait for me, honey.
I won't be long.

525
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Are you sure?

526
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,800
Yeah. Rocky's going to show me

527
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
one takeoff and one landing.
That's all.

528
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,400
OK.

529
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

530
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
- Hi, Dutch.
- Hi, Rocky.

531
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
- We're about set.
- Fine.

532
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm going to ride copilot today.
Check the crew's proficiency.

533
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
You can ride behind the aircraft
commander, see how it's done.

534
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,400
OK.

535
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,800
This is a select combat crew,
incidentally...

536
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,400
all sharp tools.

537
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,000
Hey!

538
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,000
Colonel Holland!

539
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,600
Sergeant Bible, how are you?

540
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,400
Good. gee, it's good to see you.

541
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,000
I thought the cardinals had
you all signed up, Skipper.

542
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
Yeah, I thought so, too,

543
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
but General Hawkes
has a prior claim,

544
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
and he wouldn't give me a waiver.

545
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Well, it's looks like we're
taking up were we left off.

546
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,400
well, I hope not.

547
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,200
We had 2 engines shot out the
last one over Tokyo, remember?

548
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Oh, boy, that was quite
a night, wasn't it?

549
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
I thought you were going
to get out on the Air Force.

550
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,200
No, I'm still in. Still in the
same racket flight engineer.

551
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,200
Got married a while back.

552
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,600
Fine. Any kids?

553
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,000
Sure have, one on the ramp,
one in the hangar.

554
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,600
Ha! Good for you. Good for you.

555
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Say, now, what about this?

556
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,000
Don't tell me you've rigged up
this great big thing so it'll fly.

557
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
Well, if it doesn't, it'll be my neck.

558
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
Preflight completed, sir.

559
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,200
OK.

560
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll give you your safety
procedures in a minute, sir.

561
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,000
All right.

562
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Checklist completed.
Ready to start engine, sir.

563

564

00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,000

Hey, aren't you fellas a little
high for a landing pattern?

601
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We're right on flight plan, Dutch.

602
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,400
How high you going?

603
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
40.000 feet, Colonel.

604
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,800
40.000 feet?

605
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,400
Oh, I see!

606
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,600
One takeoff, one landing?

607
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Where's the landing going to be,
Rocky, Fairbanks, Alaska?

608
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,000
Right where we told you.
Back at Carswell.

609
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,200
Oh, I see!

610
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,200
Profile mission, huh?

611
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,800
Texas to Alaska and back?

612
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,000
You know, when I was a kid,

613
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,400
somebody sold me the key
to the pitcher's box.

614
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Looks like I just bought it again.

615
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
You sure did, Dutch.

616
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
Now, you know who's

617
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,800
Really gonna appreciate this?

618
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,400
My wife Sally. I asked her
to wait for me.

619
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,800
Don't worry, Dutch.
Espy's gonna tell her.

620
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Colonel, you wanna see
the rest of this big cigar?

621
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,400
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Take over, onionhead.

623
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,000
This is Colonel Dutch Holland.

624
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Captain Miller.

625
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Hi, Captain.

626
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Sergeant Jones.

627
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Mighty glad to meet you, Colonel.

628
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,400
Wait till my kids hear about this.

629
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,800
We saw in the papers
you were coming.

630
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You and I are goin'
in opposite directions,

631
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
you might say.
This is my last flight.

632
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Oh, you gettin' out?

633
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,400
Yes, sir. My hitch is up.

634
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,400
No more of this
high pressure stuff for me.

635
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,600
Fella likes to get home
once in a while

636
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,200
and see his wife and kids.

637
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Kind of rough duty in S.A.C, huh?

638
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,600
Oh!, no, sir, I wouldn't say that,

639
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,400
not if you like being away
from home all the time,

640
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,600
temporary duty in England,
North Africa, Japan,

641
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,200
maintenance of weekends,
working all night.

642
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,800
Oh, great! just not for me,
that's all.

643
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,800
- You wanna follow me, Colonel?
- Were we goin' now?

644
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,800
We're goin' through the holland
tunnel to the gunner's compartment.

645
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,600
Left gunner from radio
2 men coming through.

646
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,000
Well, I'll be darned.

647
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,600
- I'll see you later Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

648
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,400
- All right, Colonel.
- OK.

649
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,400
That's quite a trip.

650
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,800
Yeah. It's about 80 feet.

651
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,800
I never have gotten used to that thing.

652
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,200
Fellas, this is Colonel Dutch Holland.

653
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,600
Sergeant Lassiter.

654
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
How are you?

655
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,200
Let's see... Sergeant Dames.

656
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,200
- Hello, Colonel.
- Oh, how are you?

657
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,800
Airmen lay.

658
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,400
Hello, Colonel.

659
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,000
It's not quite ready.
We'll have a cup in a minute.

660
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
All the comforts of home?

661
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,400
Sure, sure.

662
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
This is airman Davies.

663
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,000
Hi, Colonel. Have a seat.

664
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Fine.

665
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,400
Well, what do you think of her, sir?

666
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,200
She's a battleship.
Oh, what am I saying?

667
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,000
I guess it seems a lot different

668
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,600
from our old B-29.

669
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,400
That's the same gunsight
we had in the 29. Isn't it?

670
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,200
Same type, different model.

671
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,000
Of course, when you boil it all down,

672
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,600
it's still an aircraft and a crew

673
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
working together to get
a bomb on a target.

674
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,200
But there isn't a war on.

675
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,000
Do many of the men feel like
that radio operator?

676
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,000
Every day in S.A.C.'s a war, Colonel.

677
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
Pressure's on all the time,

678
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,600
and General Hawkes is
breathing down your neck.

679
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,800
We never know when the other
fella may start something,

680
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,200
so we've gotta be combat ready

681
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,200
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

682
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,600
How do you find the guys

683
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,600
that will take it
at these pay scales?

684
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Well, it's the competition, maybe.

685
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,600
You take a sellect crew like this,

686
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,200
they've all got spot promotions.

687
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,600
Our aircraft commander

688
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
would be a Major instead
of a light colonel

689
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
If he weren't on this crew.

690
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,400
If one man lets the crew down,

691
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,000
The whole crew gets demoted.

692
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It keeps 'em in there pitchin'

693
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,000
I can think of an easier way
to make a buck.

694
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,000
Well, the coffee's free, anyhow.

695
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,800
Colonel Holland,

696
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
This is Major Mapes,
our radar observer.

697
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
How are you?

698
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Hi, Colonel.

699
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
Major Ike Knowland, our navigator.

700
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
Hi, Major.

701
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,600
You sure have my sympathy, Dutch.

702
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,200
How do you mean, Knowland?

703
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
I was yanked back in, too.

704
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,000
Just when I got a nice
tv business started.

705
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Built a house for the wife and kids.

706
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,200
Well, you'll only
be in for 21 months.

707
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,000
What do you mean, "only"?

708
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,200
You can't tell me they need
radar navigators this bad.

709
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,600
Anyway, I did my share once.

710
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,800
We're not in a war.

711
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I think I know what you mean.

712
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,400
Come on, Dutch.
We'll put you to work.

713
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,200
OK, she's yours. Course 3-3-0.

714
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
I've got it.

715
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,200
Where did those jets come from, Rocky?

716
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,600
Our fighter escort. Part of S.A.C.

717
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,000
- I'll take over.
- OK.

718
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,200
That's it. Let's go home.

719
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,000
Airspeed 1-3-5.

720
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,400
1-3-0.

721
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,800
1-2-5.

722
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,000
Arm 'em.

723
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
Reverse.

724
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm terribly sorry, honey.

725
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,400
I had no idea this thing.

726
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,600
Oh, I know. Now you
clim in, Marco Polo,

727
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,200
before I sure you for desertation.

728
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,000
Did you ever go over
Niagara Falls in a barrel?

729
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,400
Yes. That makes 2 of us.

730
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
- Hi, Sally.
- Hi.

731
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,400
Hey, Dutch, not so fast.
You're not through yet.

732
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,800
Now what?

733
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,200
Steam bath and massage in
the physical conditionating room.

734
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,800
Just a couple of hours more.

735
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Honey, you better go on home.

736
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,000
This may take another couple of days.

737
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,600
See you later.

738
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,400
Sally?

739
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,000
Well, here you are.

740
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,800
The same night, too.

741
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,400
You angry with me?

742
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,200
No, darling. I'm just confused.

743
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Why?

744
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
I don't know whether to fix you
breakfast or dinner.

745
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,600
Well, let's see...

746
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
It's nearer breakfast.

747
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,800
You hungry?

748
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,600
Not very. I'm tired.

749
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,600
Where did you boys go
on your little jaunt,

750
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,200
or is that a secret?

751
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,400
Well, this was
a local mission... Alaska.

752
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,400
All right, you don't
have to tell me.

753
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,000
Honey, I just did tell you.

754
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,400
We went to Alaska!

755
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Alaska and back without
landing or anything?

756
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,600
Yeah, yeah.

757
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,400
Well, I'm certainly glad
I didn't know that,

758
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,000
or I wouldn't have slept at all.

759
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
You don't look like you
slept very much, either.

760
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,600
Well, I did fly the airplane
most of the night,

761
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,200
with a lot of help,

762
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,400
but that's not it.

763
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,400
It's just being out of
the picture for so long.

764
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Having so much to learn,
so much to cath up on.

765
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,400
Oh, sweetheart, you're just tired.

766
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,200
You wouldn't believe
the mess of new gadgets

767
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,600
they have on that thing.

768
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,600
The aircraft commander
was a real pro.

769
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,200
Even he say he's still learning
things about the B-36.

770
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,200
Well, why are you worrying
about all of this?

771
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,000
You said you had a desk job.

772
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,600
I'm supposed to be
an operations officer.

773
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,800
And you can't tell an aircraft
commander what to do

774
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,400
unless you can do it yourself.

775
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,000
In this outfit, everybody flies,

776
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,800
from General Hawkes on down.

777
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,400
In other words, then,
you're going to fly a lot

778
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,200
of missions like this one?

779
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,400
I don't know any other way to do it.

780
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,000
Well, that's a happy prospect.

781
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,000
Especially if I find out too late.

782
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,800
I'm in over my head.

783
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
Maybe I better quit right now.

784
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Quit?

785
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Well, It's better than crossing
things up in an emergency.

786
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,000
Honey, you know, I used to think

787
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
the old B-24 was a lot of airplane.

788
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,600
Do you realize that
one B-36 with an A-Bomb

789
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,800
can do the job of 1.000
world war II bombers

790
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,200
and 10.000 crew members?

791
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Now, just think
of the responsability

792
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
that places on everybody
that even goes near

793
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
one of these airplanes.

794
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,200
I've never heard you
talk like that before.

795
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,000
I've never come up against
anything like this before.

796
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Well, neither have I, for that matter.

797
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,400
Being an Air Force wife
certainly is not for me,

798
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
but it isn't that simple.

799
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,200
I could go in to Rusty tomorrow

800
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
and lay it on the line,
tell him I can't cut it.

801
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,800
Oh, don't talk like that.

802
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,200
Well, wouldn't you
like that, Sally?

803
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,600
Well, of course I would.
I'd like nothing better,

804
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,400
especially under the circumstances.

805
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,000
What circumstances?

806
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, that's what makes me so mad.

807
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,000
What's the sense of talking
about it when you know

808
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,200
you're not gonna do any
such thing, and you know it.

809
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
How do you know I won't?

810
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,600
Because I know you.

811
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,000
You'd no more walk in there
and tell Rusty you're gonna quit

812
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,800
than... well, I was gonna say fly.

813
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,600
I guess maybe you're right.

814
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,800
You know me pretty well, don't you?

815
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,400
Do I? Wish you'd put that in writing.

816
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,600
Why?

817
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,000
I'd like to send it to my father.

818
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,400
Honey, you where gonna
say something back here.

819
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,400
No, I've said everything
I have to say.

820
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,800
Dutch.

821
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,200
Yeah?

822
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,000
How do you want your eggs,
scrambled or fried?

823
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,200
Uh... scrambled.

824
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,600
No. Fried.

825
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,000
Over...

826
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,000
Easy.

827
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
You know, I'm beginning to know you

828
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,200
pretty well, too, young lady.

829
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,600
You are?

830
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
I learned a lot than night
at the housewarming.

831
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,200
You remenber when I had
to break the news to you?

832
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,800
That was a lovely house.
It was a lovely party, too.

833
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,800
Sally...

834
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,800
Yes?

835
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,800
I've got something to tell you.

836
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,800
Now, it's pretty personal,

837
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
but I think it's gonna
make you very happy.

838
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,600
What is it?

839
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
You're going to have a baby.

840
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,200
How dou you know?

841
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,800
I met the Stork at 40.000 feet.

842
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,400
Then I met doc Baxter,
and he congratulated me,

843
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,000
so that was the other.

844
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Well, what do you think?

845
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,800
What do I think?
I think it's wonderful.

846
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,800
I hope it's twins.

847
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,400
Oh, Dutch.

848
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,600
Well, all I can say is
we're mighty lucky it happened

849
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,200
before you had
to report for duty.

850
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,600
Why?

851
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,000
Well, judging from my short
experience in the Air Force,

852
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,200
it couldn't very well
have happened after that.

853
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,800
Will do, General.

854
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,600
Well, you got what you wanted Dutch.

855
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,000
Your own airplane
and a crew... temporarily.

856
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,400
Now you're talkin'.

857
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,800
General Castle did the talking.

858
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,200
But don't forget, you're still
flying a desk for me primary duty.

859
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,200
You sent for me, sir?

860
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,000
Colonel espy has ordered me
to reassing you, Knowland.

861
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,800
Your aircraft commander
has asked that you be replaced.

862
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,000
Anything wrong with my qualifications

863
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,400
for a select crew, sir?

864
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,600
No. That's the unfortunate
part of it.

865
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,800
You're as well qualified as any
radar navigator in this wing.

866
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,800
He says it's your attitude.
You haven't been putting out.

867
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Well, what do they expect
my attitude to be?

868
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,200
Gratitude for wrecking
my business career?

869
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,400
What about my request
for transfer, sir?

870
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,000
Or is the only way to get out
of S.A.C. to be carried out?

871
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,800
Don't hold your breath
while you're waiting.

872
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,000
We'll let you know.

873
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,600
Meantime, you're not
getting out of flying.

874
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
You're being reassigned
to a noncombat ready crew.

875
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,600
You lost your spot promotion
a couple of days ago.

876
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,400
Hey, Ike.

877
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,000
Wait a minute.

878
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
Say, uh...

879
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
They're giving me a pick-up crew

880
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,200
to train with for a while.

881
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,000
I'll need an experienced navigator.

882
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,800
Not particular, huh?

883
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,400
Maybe I am.

884
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,400
We're both in a particular
sort of situacion.

885
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,600
Yeah. Same raw deal.

886
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
Well, you migh say the same deal.

887
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,600
How about it?

888
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,800
It's ok by me.

889
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,000
It's OK with me,

890
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,800
until the first time
you get me off course.

891
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,400
1-3-0.

892
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200
1-2-5.

893
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
1-2-0.

894
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,200
1-1-5.

895
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Arm the props.

896
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,600
Ike, you missed your ETA
by 45 seconds.

897
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,800
You owe me a buck.

898
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,000
Ok, Dutch,

899
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,200
But it's the first time
you've won it in 6 months.

900
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,000
Reverse.

901
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,200
No more fuel leaks so far.

902
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,800
Maybe the modification's
all right, maybe not.

903
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,800
The next series of tests
will give us the answer.

904
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,600
Has Dutch Holland been running
these fuel tank tests?

905
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,400
Yes, sir.

906
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,400
I thought he had a staff job.

907
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,800
You made him an aircraft commander?

908
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,800
Well, I'd say he's doing both, sir.

909
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,400
But he sure likes to fly.

910
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,000
He does, eh?

911
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Going, Dutch?

912
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,600
Now don't have the baby
till I get back.

913
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,000
I want to be here to greet him.

914
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,600
I'll certainly try not to.

915
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,600
You know, I kinda have a feeling

916
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,200
the little fella's
not going to report in

917
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,600
for about 2 weeks.

918
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,200
I'll be back in 4 days.

919
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,800
Well, I certainly hope
it's a little fella, for your sake.

920
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,600
But you know, it could be a girl.

921
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,800
A girl?

922
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Sure.

923
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,400
I suppose it's a possibility.

924
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,200
Sweetheart, do you have to go
on this trip right now?

925
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,400
Honey, I've been running
these cold weather tests.

926
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,600
I have to go through with them.

927
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,200
Couldn't it be postponed,

928
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,400
even just till after
the baby gets here?

929
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,200
Well, Sally, we've got a job to do.

930
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,600
Now, if we start scheduling flights

931
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,800
to fit the birthrate,

932
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,400
do you realize
there are 1.500 babies

933
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,200
born a month in S.A.C.?

934
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,800
And do you realize

935
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,600
you're getting to sound more
like General Hawkes every day?

936
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,200
- I am?
- Yes.

937
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,600
I promise I won't smoke
any big black cigars.

938
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,600
That will be very nice.

939
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Right.

940
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,200
Where are you going?

941
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,200
Thule.

942
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,600
Thule?

943
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,800
- Where's that?
- Greenland.

944
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,800
Greenland?

945
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,600
- Yeah.
- In february?

946
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Well...

947
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
With all that ice and snow?

948
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,800
Well, we're running
cold weather tests,

949
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
you see, and in order to run
a cold weather test...

950
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,600
you have to have cold weather.

951
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

952
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,400
What do you want me to bring you,

953
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,000
a polar bear, penguin?

954
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,200
How about a husband?

955
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,800
Got one.

956
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,800
No. I want a husband
right here on the ground,

957
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
not one that's
8 miles over Greenland

958
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,600
or Alaska or Timbuktu.

959
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,000
Whatever happened to that nive guy

960
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,800
who played third base
for the Cardinals?

961
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,400
You mean Brewster?

962
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,600
No. I mean you.

963
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

964
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,400
It's just so hard to be
a good sport at 5 A.M.,

965
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,000
especially when you're
9 months pregnant.

966
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,800
Now don't you worry.

967
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,000
The little fella's never
gonna know the diferrence.

968
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,400
before he's a year old,
I'll be back at third.

969
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,200
I hope so.

970
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,200
Good bye, dear.

971
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,600
Take it a minute.

972
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,800
Aw, we're never gonna
get under this stuff, Leo.

973
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,400
Call Thule approach control
for G.C.A.

974
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
Roger.

975
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,800
Thule approach control
from Air Force.

976
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,600
I've just been out
on the left wing, sir.

977
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,600
We've got a bad leak
in number 2 fuel tank,

978
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,400
gas sloshing around
near the fire walls.

979
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,800
May have a fire any second.

980
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,600
All right, cut off every
electrical system you can spare.

981
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,400
We're gonna be over the base
in about 40 minutes.

982
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,200
Aircraft commander to crew...

983
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,800
we have a bad fuel leak
in the left wing.

984
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,800
Gasoline fumes. No smoking.

985
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Take stations for possible
emergency bailout.

986
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,600
Take bailout stations.

987
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,000
Might be that sudden
temperature change, Dutch.

988
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,600
42 below zero out there.

989
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,000
Rear scanner to aircraft commander...

990
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,000
we're on fire, Colonel.
Number one engine.

991
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,000
Feather 1, 2, and 3.

992
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,400
Fuel switches off to 1, 2, and 3.

993
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,200
Fire extinguishers on.

994
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,800
All right, start jets 3 and 4.

995
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,400
100%

996
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,600
Full power on 4, 5, and 6.

997
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,000
A.C. to crew standby
for inmediate bailout

998
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,200
when you hear the long ring.

999
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,800
A.C. to navigator

1000
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,200
call Thule tower.
Give 'em our exact position.

1001
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Keep giving it to 'em.

1002
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,800
Roger. Radio, this is navigator.

1003
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,200
Our position is 68 degrees,

1004
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,400
45 minutes west longitude.

1005
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,000
76 degrees,

1006
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,200
10 minutes north latitude.

1007
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,400
I repeat.

1008
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,400
Hadn't we better belly land, Dutch?

1009
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,800
We'll freeze to deatch down there.

1010
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,200
I'm afraid we'd blow up first.

1011
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,600
Fire spreading over
the whole wing Colonel.

1012
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
A.C. to crew...

1013
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,600
Bail out as close together
as you can.

1014
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,000
Try to join up as soon
as you hit the ground.

1015
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,800
All right, here we go.

1016
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,600
Go on, Leo.

1017
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,600
Thule tower, this is 2-3-5-0.

1018
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,600
I just broke out of the overcast.

1019
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,800
I'm too low to bail out.

1020
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm gonna attempt
a gear-up crash landing.

1021
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,200
Hey.

1022
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,600
Who's that? Ike?

1023
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,000
You all right?

1024
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,600
Yeah. I guess so.

1025
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,800
Just my ankle.

1026
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,800
Just wait a minute now. Don't move.

1027
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,200
Wait till I close this hatch here.

1028
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,600
Witch leg is it?

1029
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,400
Right leg, Dutch.

1030
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,800
No movin' now. Just lie still.

1031
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,400
Here. Put that blanket over you.

1032
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,400
Wait till I get things
closed up here.

1033
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,200
We're darn near buried, Ike.

1034
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,400
Storn comin' up, too.

1035
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,000
Oh, that's great.

1036
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,400
All the air rescue boys need
is a good blizzard.

1037
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,800
Well, It's no use trying
to find the crew out there now.

1038
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,600
Not a chance.

1039
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,400
The bailed out miles from here.

1040
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,600
Let me take a look at that leg.

1041
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,400
Hold that.

1042
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,200
Davenport's got the emergency radio.

1043
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,200
- That's one thing.
- Yeah.

1044
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,600
Good thing the guys in back
bailed out in time.

1045
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,200
Yeah. They'd have had it.

1046
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,000
This ankle's broken.

1047
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,800
Here.

1048
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,800
Can you reach that
first aid thing there?

1049
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,800
Hold that.

1050
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Why didn't you bail out?

1051
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,400
Waited too long, I guess.

1052
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,200
I was trying to give them
a continuous voice fix.

1053
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,200
You mean you kept
talking till we hit?

1054
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,600
Oh!, just in case we were off course.

1055
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,000
Well, I'd say you were
rigth on course, Ike.

1056
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,600
Is this all of them, sir?
All but Dutch and Nolan.

1057
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,600
No sign of the wreck, General.

1058
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,400
Why couldn't they have had
the same luck we had?

1059
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,600
Why couldn't they have come down

1060
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,000
with an Eskimo Village in their lap?

1061
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,400
Let's get back out there, Lieutenant.

1062
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,600
I'm going with you.

1063
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,200
How's the arm, Dutch?

1064
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,800
Oh, it's pretty good, but it's still sore.
Up around the shoulder joint there.

1065
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,600
I think I'll have another look.

1066
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Anything doing?

1067
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,600
No. It's still pretty gusty.

1068
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,800
Our smoke signal's burning fine.

1069
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Close the blister, will you, Dutch?

1070
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,200
We don't need any more ventilation.

1071
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,200
All right.

1072
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,600
You know... you know, with only
4 hours of daylight,

1073
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,200
it might take quite a while finding us.

1074
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,600
I hope not. I'd like to
get out of this igloo.

1075
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,200
I supoose they've notified
our wives we're missing, huh?

1076
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,600
They'd have to after 2 days.

1077
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,400
Sally's a wonderful sport about
everything, but after all,

1078
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,000
when you're having your
first child, this is rough.

1079
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,000
When is it due?

1080
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,800
When's it due? I don't right now!

1081
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,200
Maybe now! How do I know?
Here I am out in a pile of snow.

1082
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,200
Hey, sit down, Colonel, sit down.

1083
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,400
We've got trouble enough without you

1084
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,400
pacing up and downlike
a nervous father.

1085
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,400
Don't suppose it does much good.

1086
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,000
What do you want, Dutch?
A boy or a girl?

1087
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,000
Oh... Boy, I guess,

1088
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
but I just have a hunch it's a girl.

1089
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Never. I'll bet you on it.

1090
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,800
- You want to bet?
- I'll bet you 5 bucks it's a girl.

1091
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,200
- Did you hear something?
- No.

1092
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
No, there.

1093
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,400
Listen. That...

1094
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,800
Hey, Colonel, what are you
doing down there awol?

1095
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,400
Say, I want to get
a message to my wife.

1096
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,600
She's already been notified
that you'r ok, sir.

1097
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,800
This came for you
a couple days ago, sir.

1098
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,800
A baby girl.

1099
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,400
Just happened to have this handy, sir.

1100
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,600
Well, have one.

1101
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,600
Thank you, sir.

1102
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,000
Hey, Rusty, it's a baby girl.

1103
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,200
Congratulations, pappy.

1104
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,000
Look. It says right
here a baby girl.

1105
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
That's great, Dutch.

1106
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,800
What do you know? A baby girl.

1107
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,200
Amazing, Colonel.

1108
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,400
6 pounds, 5 ounces it says.

1109
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,200
It's a good thing
we found you, Colonel.

1110
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,200
6 pounds. What do you know?

1111
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,600
She wants to know about a name.

1112
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,000
Well, what about...

1113
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,800
can you get a message
to her right away?

1114
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,200
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

1115
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,800
Before you do anything else,
why don't you go get washed up,

1116
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,400
get some hot food and have
that shoulder looked at?

1117
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,600
We have about a half an hour

1118
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,400
before General Hawkes gets here.

1119
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,400
We got word a couple of hours ago

1120
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,200
that he's landing here
on his way back from England.

1121
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,200
Oh, yeah! Well, that figures.

1122
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Yeah. Here.

1123
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,000
Get that off right away,
will you?

1124
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,200
Yes, sir.

1125
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,200
And, uh, this one for the General.

1126
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,600
How much time was there
on number one engine?

1127
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,000
341 hours, sir.

1128
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,600
Did you inspect the fuel tanks
personally before takeoff?

1129
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,400
Yes, sir.

1130
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,400
Captain Symington
and Sergeant Bible, too.

1131
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
Any fuel stains?

1132
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,600
No, sir.

1133
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,800
How much time did you spend
pre-flighting the aircraft?

1134
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,800
Over 4 hours,

1135
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,800
and that's not including
engine run-ups.

1136
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
You consider your flight
engineer fully qualified?

1137
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,400
I consider him the best
in the business, General.

1138
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,600
Well, Rusty, there's no use
trying to get the rest

1139
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,200
of this picture until Holland
meets the investigating board.

1140
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,600
But accidents don't
just happen, Colonel Holland.

1141
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,800
There's always a reason.

1142
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
As Aircraft Commander
you're completely responsible,

1143
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,800
even if a wing drops off.

1144
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,600
especially if a wing drops off.

1145
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,400
I'm leaving for Carswell in an hour.

1146
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,400
Would you like a lift?

1147
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,200
Yes, sir.

1148
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,000
We'll continue this on my airplane.

1149
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,600
Yes, sir.

1150
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,800
Flight surgeon seen that arm yet?

1151
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,200
No, sir, but I've talked to him.

1152
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,200
I'm OK. I'll have it checked

1153
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,400
as soon as I get back.

1154
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,800
It's just a bruise up
on my shoulder, General.

1155
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,800
Make sure of that.

1156
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,000
Yes, sir.

1157
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,600
I want the latest results

1158
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,600
of your last performance
and stability tests

1159
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800
as soon as possible.

1160
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,000
Yes, sir.

1161
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,400
That cigar, sir.

1162
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,400
Doesn't the General know
the aircraft might explode?

1163
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,400
It wouldn't dare.

1164
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,200
While we're gassing up

1165
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,600
I've got something to show you.

1166
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,600
Yes, sir.

1167
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,400
Holy smokes.

1168
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,000
So this id the B-47, huh?

1169
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,400
She's the most beautiful thing

1170
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,800
I've ever seen in my life, General.

1171
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,800
Just look at her.

1172
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,800
Look at her.

1173
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,000
I sure would like to get
my hands on one of these.

1174
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,600
Maybe you will, Dutch.

1175
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,800
Maybe you will.

1176
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,800
How are you, sweetie?

1177
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,200
Oh, how are you?

1178
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,800
Hey, what are you doing home
from the hospital so soon?

1179
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,800
The birth rate of Carswell must
have jumped up or something.

1180
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,000
Boy, they were so crowded.

1181
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
They sure got rid of me in a hurry.

1182
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,200
What?

1183
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,000
Well, you seem to beall in
one piece. Was it very bad?

1184
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,800
No. I sure oiled up
an airplane, though.

1185
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,200
We were all mighty lucky.

1186
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,200
The main things was

1187
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,400
I just kept worrying about you.

1188
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,800
I knew we were all right.

1189
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,400
Oh, so did I, really.

1190
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,200
I kept listening to the radio
reports every day.

1191
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,000
I knew you were coming back.

1192
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,200
You just had to.

1193
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,400
Oh!, yeah, sure.

1194
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,600
Especially me being
a father and everything.

1195
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,200
A father. Well, where's the baby?

1196
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,600
Where are you hiding the baby?

1197
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,000
Oh, she'll be here.

1198
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,200
Oh, she's so pretty.

1199
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,800
- She is?
- Yeah.

1200
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
Dutch, are you
terribly disappointed

1201
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,600
because she's a little girl?

1202
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,800
Disappointed?
I'm delighted.

1203
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I won 5 bucks from
Mike Knowland on it.

1204
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,800
Wait. I've got a present for you,

1205
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,200
all the way from Thule.

1206
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,600
My goodness. It looks
as big as the baby.

1207
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,000
A penguin.

1208
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,800
I couldn't get a polar bear.

1209
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Oh, but I didn't ask
for anything but a husband,

1210
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,200
and I got him.

1211
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,000
Here we are.

1212
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Dutch, I want you
to meet your daughter.

1213
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,800
Well...

1214
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,600
Well,...

1215
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,000
Well, how do you do, young lady?

1216
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,400
Very glad to meet you.

1217
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,800
She says she is, too.

1218
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,200
Would you like to hold her, Colonel?

1219
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,400
Would you like to hold her?

1220
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,000
I'm not checked out on this, but...

1221
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,000
Oh, OK!

1222
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,400
She's not very big, is she?

1223
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,000
- No.
- She sure is cute.

1224
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,400
What did you name her?

1225
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,400
Just what you said. Hope.

1226
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,400
Hope?

1227
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,600
Hope? I said Hope?

1228
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,800
Well, yes, that's what
you said in your telegram.

1229
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,000
"Can't think of any name but Hope.

1230
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,400
"Everything fine.

1231
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,200
Oh, honey, see, I said,

1232
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,800
"Can't think of any name,

1233
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
"but Hope everything fine.

1234
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,200
Well, Hope. That's a pretty nice name.

1235
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,400
Yeah.

1236
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,000
What do you think of the name Hope?

1237
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
She says she likes it fine.

1238
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
All right.

1239
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,400
It's OK with me if it's OK with you.

1240
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,800
I think it's really pretty.

1241
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,200
Well, Hope, it is, then.

1242
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,600
Well, now, you say
good bye to your father.

1243
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,600
Good bye, Hope.

1244
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,600
I guess I'll be seeing you around.

1245
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,400
That's was sort of a
silly thing to say.

1246
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,400
She's gonna like it in Florida.

1247
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,400
Florida. Oh, I forgot to tell you.

1248
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,000
We're gonna move.

1249
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
When?

1250
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,600
In about 2 weeks.

1251
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,000
I've been transferred to MacDill.

1252
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,200
We're going back to our old house.

1253
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,200
Oh!, that's wonderful.

1254
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,600
We'll be there just in time
to watch the spring training.

1255
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,600
How did that happen?

1256
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,600
They're setting up
a new B-47 wing.

1257
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,200
General Hawkes gave me a chance
to get in on the ground for.

1258
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,800
General Hawkes?

1259
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,200
What's a B-47?

1260
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,600
It's a new jet bomber,

1261
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,600
and it's the most beautiful,
wonderful airplane

1262
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,000
you've ever seen in your whole life.

1263
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,400
Sally, this is the most
wonderful thing

1264
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,000
you could ever imagine.

1265
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,400
In the B-36.

1266
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,200
We've got a good
long range heavy bomber,

1267
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,000
but we've needed a medium bomber

1268
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,400
to replace our World War II types.

1269
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,800
The B-47 can fill that need

1270
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,800
and greatly increase
the overall capabilities

1271
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,800
of the Strategic Air Command.

1272
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,800
It's been under development
for 8 years.

1273
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,400
It's the fastest operational
jet bomber in the world.

1274
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,600
Recently it was timed

1275
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,800
at a ground speed
of 794 miles per hour,

1276
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
and it's ceiling
is over 40.000 feet.

1277
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,000
This wing is so clean

1278
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,600
that mechabics have to wear
soft soled shoes

1279
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,000
If they walk on it.

1280
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,400
A scuff on this metal skin

1281
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,000
could slow it down 20 miles an hour.

1282
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
With the new family of nuclear weapons,

1283
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,200
on B-47 and a crew of 3
carries the destructive power

1284
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,000
of the entire B-29 force
we used against Japan.

1285
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,000
Up until now the B-47 has been

1286
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,400
in the hands of test pilots.
It looks good.

1287
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,800
We don't now how good

1288
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,600
until it's been proved out
by our regular S.A.C. crews.

1289
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,000
That'll be General Castle's job

1290
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,600
with the first new wing at MacDill.

1291
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,800
I want to see a year of flying
crammed into 6 months.

1292
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,800
I'll tell you why I'm in a hurry.

1293
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,600
When units of all 3 S.A.C. Air Forces

1294
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,000
are equipped with B-47's,

1295
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,400
our overall mobility will be doubled.

1296
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,000
It all boils down
to less danger of war.

1297
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,400
With each B-47 delivered,

1298
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,200
S.A.C's capability of quick
retaliation is increased,

1299
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,000
and an enemy
would undoubtedly know it.

1300
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,800
We'll be better able to realize
S.A.C.'s best hope:

1301
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,400
to prevent a war from ever starting.

1302
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,200
I've called you to Omaha

1303
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,000
for the special briefings
that will follow

1304
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,000
because each one of you
is gonna be a key man

1305
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,800
in the B-47 program.

1306
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,600
Let's leave it this way.

1307
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,600
The B-47 is on third base.

1308
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,600
It'll be up to you to bring it home.

1309
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,200
Canopy Coming closed.

1310
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,200
You all squared away, Ike?

1311
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,400
Ok, Dutch.

1312
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,400
How about you, Rocky?

1313
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,600
Roger.

1314
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,200
MacDill tower, this is 5024.

1315
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,400
We're ready to go.

1316
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,000
5024, you are cleared for takeoff.

1317
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,200
Roger, 5024.

1318
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,800
Rolling.

1319
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,200
Arm A.T.O.

1320
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,800
Fire A.T.O.

1321
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,600
Air force 5024.

1322
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,600
This is eagle control. Say again.

1323
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,800
We're just in time.

1324
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,800
The B-47 is on a bomb run.

1325
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Eagle control, this is Air Force 5024.

1326
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,600
Type a bomb run, radar,
observer, Major Knowland,

1327
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,200
I.K., altitude 43.000, 43.000 feet.

1328
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,600
Type of release, automatic, over.

1329
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,000
Eagle control, Roger.

1330
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,200
Give us a call when
you depart the I.P.

1331
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,200
Eagle control,
this is 5024 departing I.P.

1332
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,200
Roger.

1333
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,600
Ike, you all set?

1334
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,600
Roger.

1335
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,200
Ok, it's your airplane.

1336
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,600
We are 25 miles out.

1337
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,600
Roger.

1338
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,000
Tour tone is loud and clear.

1339
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,200
Standing by for information.

1340
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,400
Bomb away.

1341
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,600
Dutch, that's a shot.

1342
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,600
You mean this city's been wiped out

1343
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,200
theoretically in a storm

1344
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,400
by a bomber we didn't
even see or hear?

1345
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,400
Sure. With radar,
weather's no problem.

1346
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,600
We've been bombing cities

1347
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,600
every day and every night
all over the U.S.,

1348
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,400
only people never know it.

1349
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,000
What?

1350
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Seventh hour stretch.

1351
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,000
Thanks, Ike.

1352
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,800
Hey, Rocky, we've got about
an hour and a half more to go.

1353
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,400
Do you want to take it the rest of
the way and shoot the landing?

1354
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,400
Roger.

1355
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,600
You have it.

1356
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,400
That shoulder again?

1357
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,400
No. I'm stiff all over. Who isn't?

1358
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,400
Pop the chute.

1359
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,600
Say, you know, that boy's
got a lot on the ball.

1360
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,200
He could be another Bobby Feller.

1361
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,200
Oh!, he looks great.

1362
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,400
He won 18 for Rochester last year.

1363
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,800
Dutch, will you stop
looking at your watch?

1364
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,400
You said you don't
take off until midnight.

1365
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,800
Well, honey, I'm not hopping
a streetcar, you know?

1366
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,800
A mission like this takes
6, 7 hours pre-flight briefing.

1367
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,400
And what about the 4
days between missions?

1368
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,800
You've only had 2.

1369
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,200
I know, I know.
I'm filling in for Charlie.

1370
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,800
You could watch the rest
of the inning, anyway.

1371
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,400
All right, all right.

1372
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,800
Hey, I just noticed those eagles.

1373
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,600
When did you make chicken,
Colonel Dutch?

1374
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,600
Couple weeks ago.

1375
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,000
They figure we needed the raise

1376
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,400
on account of the baby.

1377
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,000
She's not kidding.

1378
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,200
How a Sergeant with 5 kids
makesit, I don't know.

1379
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,200
Well, I'll say this much
for General Hawkes.

1380
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,800
He's certainly doing
everything he can for them.

1381
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,400
Struck him out. 2 in a Row.

1382
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,000
Honey, I've got to go. Bye.

1383
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,800
Now look, this time I don't
want any penguins.

1384
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,400
I'll bring you a pelican.

1385
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400
Bye, Tom.

1386
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,800
Bye, Colonel.

1387
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,400
What's the matter, Sally?

1388
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,200
Oh, nothing. I was just wondering

1389
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,600
where he's going this time.

1390
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
Hello, Sally. How are you?

1391
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,200
Oh, hi, Rusty!
I'm fine. How are you?.

1392
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,800
Fine, fine. May I present
General Hawkes?

1393
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,200
It's a real pleasure, Mrs. Holland.

1394
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,600
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

1395
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,800
Same here.

1396
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,400
Only I'm a little disappointed.

1397
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,600
I thought you'd be breathing fire.

1398
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,600
Well, I usually do.
I just had a flame-out.

1399
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,600
Oh, well, if you're here recruiting,

1400
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,400
please don't take Brewster.

1401
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,400
Oh, no! I'm a great ball fan.

1402
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,600
Oh, good. Why don't you
tell that to Mr. Doyle?

1403
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,800
Mr. Doyle, General Hawkes.

1404
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
How do you do, Mr. Doyle?

1405
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,200
Thank you for letting us in.

1406
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,600
My pleasure. Won't you sit down?

1407
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,800
Thank you.

1408
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,600
So you're the man that
stole my third baseman.

1409
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,800
I wish we could keep him, too.

1410
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,400
I'll bet you do.

1411
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,400
So you're on Mr. Doyle's side, eh?

1412
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,000
Yes, I am.

1413
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,200
Well, we've got a job
to do, Mrs. Holland,

1414
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,800
and getting men like
your husband isn't easy.

1415
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,200
Don't tell me your
little problems General.

1416
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,600
I'm only interested in results.

1417
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,000
Touche.

1418
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,400
Hello.

1419
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,000
Oh, mother!, it's you.

1420
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,800
Nothing, nothing at all.

1421
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,400
It's just that every time

1422
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,800
Dutch goes on one of
these missions I just die.

1423
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,600
No, of course he doesn't know.

1424
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,600
No, and he never will.

1425
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,200
No, no, but he should
be here any minute.

1426
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,600
Yes, it was a long flight.

1427
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,000
Please don't ask me.

1428
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,800
I never know where he's going.

1429
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,200
Look, mother.

1430
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,800
We thought we'd take you all

1431
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,200
to the officers' club.

1432
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,600
You know, for dad's birthday,

1433
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,200
if Dutch is here.

1434
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,600
Well, I haven't had
a chance to ask him yet.

1435
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,200
Oh, here he is. I'll call you back.

1436
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,600
Oh, hi.

1437
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,800
That's a real bear hug.

1438
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,800
Oh, I'm just so glad to see you.

1439
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,800
How are you?

1440
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I'm fine.

1441
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Was it rough?

1442
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
No, no. Everything went off fine.

1443
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,200
It was like clockwork.

1444
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,200
My shoulder bothered me
the last couple of hours,

1445
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,600
but outside of that...
How's the baby?

1446
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,800
Oh, she's fine. She's still asleep.

1447
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,800
Listen.

1448
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,600
You know, Tuesday is Dad's birthday,

1449
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,800
and I thought we'd take them
to the officers' club.

1450
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,400
You'll still be here, won't you?

1451
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,400
Yeah.

1452
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,600
I think so.

1453
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,800
It all depends on
the operations schedule.

1454
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
You won't be going
on another mission that soon.

1455
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Honey, I don't know.

1456
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,400
All I know is we should be.

1457
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,600
Should be?

1458
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,800
You shouldn't be flying at all.

1459
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,800
Dutch, why don't you go
and see the doctor?

1460
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,600
Every time you go
on one of these trips,

1461
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,400
when you come back
your shoulder is much worse.

1462
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,200
You know how flight surgeons are.

1463
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,600
It's not that bad.

1464
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,000
I'm not taking any chances.

1465
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,800
Now, honey, I know what I'm doing.

1466
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,200
You're so tired, you don't
know what you're doing.

1467
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,800
All right, all right, all right.

1468
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,800
I'll fix you some breakfast.

1469
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,400
Then you should go to bed.

1470
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,000
All right, all right.

1471
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,800
So this will be the first
overseas movement

1472
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,200
of an entire jet bomber wing.

1473
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,600
While we're at it,

1474
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,200
we've been ordered to try
something a little special:

1475
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,600
a new record.

1476
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,400
30 B-47s will make a routine
refueling stop at Seattle.

1477
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,400
But the other 15 airplanes
will attempt to fly

1478
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,800
from MacDill to Japan nonstop.

1479
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,400
Now, General Espy has
some additional information.

1480
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,400
The flight will be
7.400 statute miles

1481
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,200
in almost 16 hours.

1482
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,200
I will fly number one position
of the nonstop group.

1483
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,000
Colonel Holland will fly number 15.

1484
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,600
Lights.

1485
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,000
Now here's the plan.

1486
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,200
This operation will be
carried out in 3 phases.

1487
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,200
First we'll move
the wing bag and baggage.

1488
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,600
Everything, spare engines,

1489
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,600
fuel trucks and maintenance crews.

1490
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,000
Tomorrow at 08:00,
globemaster cargo aircraft

1491
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,800
will load the men and equipment.

1492
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,800
The second starts
the following morning at 06:00

1493
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,800
when our KC-97 tankers will take off

1494
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,400
so as to be in place here...

1495
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,400
and here.

1496
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,200
For in-flight refueling
rendezvous with the B-47s,

1497
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,800
who will proceed
to destination, Yokote.

1498
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,000
Lights.

1499
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,400
And third, the B-47s
will depart when ordered.

1500
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,000
All B-47 combat crews will stand by.

1501
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,600
A word of caution.

1502
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,800
There is a security blackout.

1503
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,000
Let's do it first, then talk about it.

1504
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,800
She's still asleep.

1505
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,600
Does that child sleep all afternoon?

1506
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,600
I have to get home.

1507
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,200
Oh, now, she'll be awake soon.

1508
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,600
You just be patient.

1509
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,800
- Patient? I haven't seen her
since yesterday. - True.

1510
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,600
Hello.

1511
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,200
No, Colonel Holland isn't here.
This is Mrs. Holland.

1512
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,600
Oh, it's long distance,
mother. Tom Doyle.

1513
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,400
Hi, Tom. How are you?

1514
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,600
Oh, I'm fine.

1515
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,400
She's just fine.

1516
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,000
No, he's over at the base.

1517
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,400
You can reach him at MacDill.

1518
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,200
I see.

1519
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,600
Yeah, I see.

1520
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Oh, I'm sure he can.

1521
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Oh, yeah, me?
You know I'm all for it.

1522
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,000
Fine.

1523
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,800
Fine, then I'll see you in a few days.

1524
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,200
Bye, Tom.

1525
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,000
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

1526
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,000
God bless Tom Doyle, Brewster,

1527
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
and everybody in St. Louis.

1528
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,200
What's come over you?

1529
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,400
Oh, the most wonderfull
thing just happened!

1530
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,400
What?

1531
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Brewster broke his leg.

1532
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,600
Oh, wonderful? The poor boy.

1533
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,400
Oh, I'm sorry about it, of course,

1534
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,400
but don't you see?
This puts Tom in a spot,

1535
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,400
and he wants Dutch to come back
and finish the season.

1536
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,600
You know, I'd almost forgotten
Dutch was a baseball player.

1537
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,600
Oh, gosh, so had he.

1538
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,400
Oh, but he'd never turn Tom down.

1539
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,600
He'd love this,

1540
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,600
and you know,
this settles everything.

1541
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,000
Well, if you're going
to St. Louis,

1542
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,800
I'd say it unsettles everything.

1543
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,200
Oh, no, Mom.

1544
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,600
No more long missions,
no more worrying.

1545
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,600
Sally, I hope it all
works out for you.

1546
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,000
Oh, it will, Mom. It really will.

1547
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,000
Where are you going?

1548
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,200
I have to find the sports page

1549
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,800
to catch up on a few things.

1550
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,200
You know, I don't even know
the Cardinal lineup anymore.

1551
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,800
Well, this just came out of the blue.

1552
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,400
You know I want to do everything
I possibly can to help.

1553
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,800
Uh-huh, yeah.

1554
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,200
That's right.

1555
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,600
Well, let me call you
in an hour, huh, Tom?

1556
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,000
What's your number?

1557
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,200
What is it?

1558
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,600
4728.

1559
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,400
I'll call you in an hour.

1560
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,600
Right.

1561
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

1562
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,200
Did Tom get you?

1563
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,200
Yeah, yeah. Talked to him twice.

1564
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,400
You know, he called here first,

1565
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,800
and he told me all about it.

1566
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,200
I suppose you'll still have
to make the flight, anyway.

1567
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:30,800
Well, we've been standing by all day

1568
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,800
for weather and word from S.A.C.

1569
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,800
How soon can you get away?

1570
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Sally, I had to turn Tom down.

1571
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,200
I had to make a decision,
and I made it.

1572
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,000
I'm not getting out at all.

1573
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,200
I'm staying in the Air Force
permanently.

1574
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,200
Oh, you don't...

1575
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,800
I know it's rough on you.

1576
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,200
I know how you feel.

1577
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,400
I took all that into consideration,

1578
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,000
but when I got rigth
down to rock bottom,

1579
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,200
this was the only thing I could do.

1580
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,800
But you've served your 21 months.

1581
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,200
There's no use arguing.
It's all settled.

1582
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,800
I've signed up.

1583
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:17,200
You just went ahead and made
this decision all by yourself?

1584
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,200
There are some decisions
you have to make alone.

1585
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,200
So this is going to be it?

1586
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,600
The Air Force...

1587
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,200
for the rest of your life
and mine.

1588
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,200
One station after another,
one mission after another.

1589
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:33,200
And you just walk in here
and calmly tell me this.

1590
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,600
Well, there are times

1591
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,200
when you are given
certain responsibilities.

1592
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,400
You can't ignore them.

1593
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,600
Well don't you have
any responsibilities

1594
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,200
to Hope and me?

1595
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,200
Is it always General Hawkes?

1596
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,200
General Hawkes didn't have
anything to do with it.

1597
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,200
Oh, he's been working
on you for months.

1598
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,600
Flattering you, promoting you.

1599
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,800
Sally, if there was a war on,

1600
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,400
you wouldn't question any of this.

1601
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,000
Well, that's just it. There isn't.

1602
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,200
But there is a kind of war.

1603
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,200
We've got to stay ready to figth

1604
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,800
without fighting.

1605
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,200
That's even tougher.

1606
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,000
That's why I made this decision.

1607
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,200
You made it. We didn't.

1608
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,800
All these months
I kept telling myself,

1609
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,200
"It isn't how much
you're together that counts.

1610
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,200
"It's that you are together.

1611
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,200
And... and now, suddenly,
we're not together at all.

1612
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,600
Oh, Dutch, what's happened to you?

1613
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,800
I just don't even know you anymore.

1614
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,800
I... I'm still the same.

1615
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,200
And here I am all alone
with a stranger.

1616
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,600
Colonel Holland.

1617
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,200
Ok, I'll be right over.

1618
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,000
Word just came through
from S.A.C. I have to go.

1619
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,000
Sally, I can't go this way.

1620
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,600
What difference does it make?

1621
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,800
We couldn't be any farther apart,

1622
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,200
even if you were in Tokyo.

1623
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,800
Hey, Dutch, let's go!

1624
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,600
Armadillo flying taxi runway 2-2,

1625
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,800
wind is south 1-0.

1626
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,600
Altimeter 3-0-1-1.

1627
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,000
Hello, Sergeant.
This is Mrs. Holland.

1628
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,000
Can you please tell me

1629
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,600
if Colonel Holland has left yet?

1630
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,600
You what?

1631
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,000
You don't...

1632
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,400
W... well, then where can
I find General Castle?

1633
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,600
The control tower.

1634
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,600
No, nevermind.

1635
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,800
Where can I find General Castle?

1636
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,200
Has Dutch left yet?

1637
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,600
Oh, I'm sorry, Sally,

1638
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,000
but Dutch took off
about 5 minutes ago.

1639
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,800
Oh, there's something I've got to
hell him. I can't let him go this way.

1640
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,600
I wish there was something
we could do, Mrs. Holland.

1641
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,800
Well, I'm affraid there isn't, General,
and I hope you're satisfied.

1642
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,600
Wasn't one war enough for
you without calling him back

1643
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,000
just when he was beginning to live?

1644
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,200
And you gonna let him go on and on?

1645
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,800
How much more do you want?

1646
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,000
Sally.

1647
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,800
I'm sorry you fell
that way, Mrs. Holland,

1648
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,600
but I want you
to understand one thing.

1649
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,400
This was Dutch's decision, not mine.

1650
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,600
His decision because
you maneuvered him into it.

1651
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,800
Promoting him, putting him
in important jobs.

1652
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,200
Now let's get one thing straight.

1653
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,600
If you think I promoted him
because he was Dutch Holland,

1654
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,400
you underestimate him.

1655
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,600
He's an exceptional commander.

1656
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,800
Dutch earned this the hard way.

1657
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,400
I just hope he can
get through this mission.

1658
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,600
There any reason.

1659
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,800
He shouldn't be on this mission?

1660
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:40,800
I think there's every reason.

1661
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,400
And someday, when he
cracks, it's gonna be

1662
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,000
because you didn't
give him any choice.

1663
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,400
Mrs. Holland...

1664
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,000
I, too, have no choice.

1665
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,600
45 aircraft now airbone, Dutch.

1666
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,400
OK, navigator, how we doing?

1667
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,200
On course.

1668
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,000
On time, Dutch.

1669
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,400
Roger.

1670
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,000
In 6 minutes the formation
will break up,

1671
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,200
and we'll proceed on
our individual flight plan.

1672
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,600
There's our fuel tanker.

1673
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,400
Right on schedule.

1674
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,400
Air Force 3-4-1-1,

1675
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,800
what'll you have, ethyl or regular?

1676
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,200
Ah, whatever you've got.
Just fill her up.

1677
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Your slipway doors are open.

1678
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,400
Receptacle clear.

1679
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,000
Everything looks normal.

1680
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,400
Tanker ready for contact.

1681
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,400
Receiver ready for contact.

1682
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,000
Forward 2.

1683
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,000
Stand by for contact.

1684
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,600
Roger.

1685
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,600
Contact.

1686
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,600
Contact.

1687
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,800
Roger.

1688
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:24,800
Up 3.

1689
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,000
Your position is good.

1690
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,800
Fuel pressure 35 pounds.

1691
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,200
Tranfer completed.

1692
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,600
Disconect when ready.

1693
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,000
Roger.

1694
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,000
Just caught a sports
broadcast, Dutch.

1695
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
You're front page news.

1696
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
All about your passing up baseball

1697
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,600
for an Air Force career.

1698
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,600
Call that news, huh?

1699
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:13,000
How about you, Ike?
Made up your mind yet?

1700
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,600
You staying in?

1701
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,400
Oh, I guess I might as well.

1702
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,200
Seems like quite a few of
the boys are staying in.

1703
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,600
You started quite a fashion, Dutch.

1704
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,800
We bumped into
a 129 headwind, Dutch.

1705
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,800
Jet stream.

1706
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,200
40 knots faster than briefed.

1707
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,600
We've lost 13 minutos already.

1708
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Well...

1709
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Well, we better do
something about that, Ike.

1710
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,400
Leo, what do you think?

1711
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,600
Think we better try
and get over it?

1712
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,800
If we stay under it,
we'll use too much fuel,

1713
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,800
that's for sure.

1714
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,800
How much higher do you think
we'll have to go, Ike,

1715
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,400
to get out of the jet stream?

1716
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:24,200
Oh, maybe 2 or 3.000 feet.

1717
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:27,000
Well, that altitude's
kinda critical for us

1718
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,600
at this weight.

1719
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:31,200
I think maybe we better try it, though.

1720
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,400
Here we go.

1721
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,400
Well, that's about
as high as she'll go.

1722
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,800
How much longer we got, Ike?

1723
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,800
5 hours, 11 minutes.

1724
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,800
Well, we're preactically there.

1725
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,800
I went crazy the first 10 hours.

1726
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,400
My hellmet's killing me,

1727
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,800
and I feel like I'm sitting
on a block of concrete.

1728
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,600
I'll trade you that block of concrete

1729
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,600
for this picket fence
I'm sitting on.

1730
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,800
You guys should've been navigators.

1731
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,600
At least you can get off this seat

1732
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,400
once in a while.

1733
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,400
Air Force 3-4-1-1,

1734
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,000
This is Yokota tower.

1735
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,600
Ceiling is still variable
from 1 to 400 feet.

1736
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,600
Fog.

1737
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,600
Visibility varying
from 1/4 mile to 2 miles.

1738
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,600
Occasionally zero.

1739
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,600
Uh, how about the other airplanes?

1740
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,600
They all land OK, Yokota?

1741
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:49,600
Affirmative.

1742
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,200
The last one barely made it.

1743
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,200
Conditions may improve
in 30 minutes.

1744
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,400
Can you hold?

1745
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,200
Well, I... not if I have
to go to an alternate.

1746
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,800
What's the forecast?

1747
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:05,000
3-4-1-1, Okinawa is reporting
broken and still V.F.R.

1748
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,000
Your other alternates
are still instrument

1749
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,400
and bellow minimums.

1750
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:12,200
Well, If I'm going to Okinawa,
I have to leave right now.

1751
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,000
My fuel reserve's low.

1752
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,000
Uh, stand by, Yokota.

1753
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,000
Roger.

1754
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,600
Yokota, this is 3-4-1-1.

1755
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,600
Proceeding to Kadena
Air Force base, Okinawa.

1756
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,800
Roger.

1757
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,600
Yokota tower out.

1758
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,600
Air Force jet 3-4-1-1.

1759
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,600
This is Kadena aproach control.

1760
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,000
You're now 68 miles out.

1761
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,400
Weather getting worse.

1762
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,000
Ceiling dropping rapidly.

1763
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
You've got 3 miles and 500 feet.

1764
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,600
Now you tell me.

1765
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,600
That's a fine how do you do, Kadena.

1766
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,000
I got 11 minutes fuel

1767
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,600
and 9 more minutes to go.

1768
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,000
It's gonna be a close one.

1769
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:24,000
Air Force jet 3-4-1-1,

1770
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,800
contact GCA on 1-18.2

1771
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,000
and stand by for immediate
jet penetration.

1772
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,000
Affirmative. Affirmative.

1773
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,000
Air Force jet 3-4-1-1,

1774
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,800
You're cleared for immediate
jet penetration.

1775
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,400
Dutch?

1776
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,200
Hey, Leo.

1777
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,400
Yeah, Dutch?

1778
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,400
There's...

1779
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,400
There's something wrong. I...

1780
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:39,400
Leo...

1781
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,800
I...

1782
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I can't move my right arm, Leo.

1783
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Leo, you take ahold of the throttles.

1784
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,600
Reduce your power 10%.

1785
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,600
Roger.

1786
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,600
A little more.

1787
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,600
Hup. There you are.

1788
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,600
All right, now...

1789
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,000
You handle the throttles,

1790
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,400
I'll handle the controls, OK?

1791
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,000
Roger.

1792
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:14,000
Wheater now reporting 100 feet.

1793
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,600
Visibility 1/4 of a mile.

1794
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,200
Advise you hold east
of the outer marker.

1795
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,400
Uh, negative.

1796
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,000
Negative, Kadena.

1797
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,800
I can't hold.

1798
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,400
I'm committed.

1799
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:29,000
I don't have enough fuel
to go around.

1800
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,400
Go on now. Bring me on in.

1801
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,600
Affirmative. Continue your penetration.

1802
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,400
Air Force jet 3-4-1-1,

1803
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,400
This is your final controller.

1804
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:45,400
You need not acknowledge
any further transmissions.

1805
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:48,000
You're 6 miles
from the end of the runway,

1806
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
40 feet above the glide path.

1807
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,400
Increase your rate of descent.

1808
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,400
You have now passed

1809
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,400
through the GCA minimums.

1810
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,600
I will hold your rate of descent.

1811
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
You're right at the center line.

1812
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,800
Steer to a heading of 1-7-5 degrees.

1813
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,600
All right. Back another 5%, Leo.

1814
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,000
Roger.

1815
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,600
A little more.

1816
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,000
Now forward.

1817
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,400
A little more.

1818
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,400
All right. Back a little.

1819
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,800
There you are. Hold it.

1820
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,800
Your course is good.

1821
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,000
Your rate of descent is good.

1822
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,400
Now steer to 1-8-0 degrees.

1823
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:36,400
You're on glide path.
You're on course.

1824
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,800
Your heading is 1-8-0 degrees.

1825
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
You're on glide path.
You're on course.

1826
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
You're 2 miles
from the end of the runway.

1827
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,800
Your heading is 1-8-0 degrees.

1828
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,800
Your rate of descent is good.

1829
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,200
You're on course.

1830
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:54,000
You're approaching the end
of the runway.

1831
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,400
You're now over
the end of the runway.

1832
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,600
Take over visually.

1833
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,400
We're breaking out, Dutch.
I can see the ground.

1834
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
All right, back a little more.

1835
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,400
I got the runway.

1836
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,600
Hold up. Hold up.

1837
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,000
All the way back.

1838
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:12,800
All the way back, Leo.

1839
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,200
All right, fine. Pop the chute.

1840
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,400
Thanks, GCA.

1841
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,800
Thanks for getting us down, fellas.

1842
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Surprised you can use
that arm at all.

1843
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Well, the inflammation's
gone down already, sir.

1844
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,200
In just 3 days.

1845
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,800
I ordered you back to
Omaha, Colonel Holland,

1846
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,800
because of this medical report.

1847
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,800
It indicates a chronic condition.

1848
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,600
Might happen again any time.

1849
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,000
Especially on long,
high altitude flights.

1850
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:09,800
I suppose that's true, General.

1851
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
You know, I ougth to throw
the book at you.

1852
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
For not following
existing instructions

1853
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,800
about reporting to a flight
surgeon after an accident.

1854
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,600
For concealing a condition
that could have grounded you.

1855
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,800
Yes, sir.

1856
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,600
What you did could have resulted

1857
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,600
in the loss of your
aircraft and your crew.

1858
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,000
Until this last mission, sir,

1859
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,600
It was nothing more than annoying.

1860
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,600
I wouldn't have taken such a risk.

1861
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,000
I'm inclined to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

1862
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,800
I suppose you know
you're all through flying.

1863
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,400
Yes, sir.

1864
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,800
You can't command
an operational unit.

1865
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,800
You can stay in,
of course, at a ground job.

1866
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,400
Would you like that?

1867
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,200
No, sir.

1868
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,400
I didn't think you would.

1869
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,000
I'm going to let you go.

1870
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
You're out of the
Air Force as of now.

1871
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,200
Is your wife here yet?

1872
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,600
No, sir.

1873
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,600
I haven't seen her
since we left MacDill.

1874
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:15,000
I don't suppose you can play
much ball with that shoulder.

1875
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:17,000
No, sir.

1876
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,800
Not this season, anyway, sir.

1877
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,000
What are to do?

1878
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,600
I'm sure Tom Doyle

1879
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,600
will have a spot
picked out for me, sir.

1880
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,800
Well, if he doesn't make a
manager out of you, he's crazy.

1881
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:29,400
Well, that's fine with me.

1882
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:30,800
Let's hope so.

1883
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,400
Good luck to you.

1884
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,200
I'm sorry it had to end
this way, sir.

1885
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:36,200
So am I, Holland. Damn sorry.

1886
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,600
I hate to lose you.

1887
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,000
Thank you, sir.

1888
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,000
Dutch...

1889
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:47,600
Dutch, I...

1890
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:51,400
I suppose that you know
better than anybody else...

1891
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:53,600
what an uphill battle it is
to keep S.A.C. going.

1892
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,400
The job is big

1893
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:58,000
and the pay is small.

1894
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,400
The things that I've fought for...

1895
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,000
better family housing,

1896
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,400
better breaks for the combat crews

1897
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,000
and the non-coms.

1898
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,200
The things that help us
to get the best people

1899
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,800
and keep the best people.

1900
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,000
and 80% of them,

1901
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,600
reserve officers
and citizen soldiers

1902
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,200
just like you.

1903
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,400
Dutch...

1904
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:23,200
None of these things
are easy to come by.

1905
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,800
We need all the help we can get.

1906
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,600
Yes, sir.

1907
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,600
I want you to know this:

1908
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,800
The job you did
while you were with us,

1909
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,800
and the decision you made
when you had an easy out,

1910
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:38,600
gave us more help
than you'll ever realize.

1911
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,000
We're grateful to you.

1912
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,600
I'm glad to hear that, sir.

1913
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,000
General Hawkes,

1914
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
will you please tell Colonel Holland

1915
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,600
that Mrs. Holland is here?

1916
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,600
She says to tell him
she'll be waiting for him

1917
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,400
in General Wheatley's office.

1918
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:57,000
Ask her to come in.

1919
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:03,600
Hello, Sally.

1920
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,600
Remember me? I'm that stranger.

1921
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,600
Well, sure.

1922
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,400
I'd know you anywhere.

1923
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,200
You couldn't fool me.

1924
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,600
I don't care what uniform
you're wearing.

1925
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:14,400
You're still my husband.

1926
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
I'm very proud of you.

1927
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:19,600
I'm ashamed of me.

1928
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
We, uh...

1929
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
We had a medical report
on that arm, Mrs. Holland.

1930
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I've got to let him go.

1931
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
He's all yours.

1932
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,200
Is that it?

1933
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,800
That's it.

1934
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,600
That's our new B-47 wing

1935
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,600
Flying its first training mission.

1936
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,600
We'll have 4 full new wings

1937
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,000
by the end of the year.

1938
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,400
Ride the wind

1939
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,600
Follow a star

1940
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,400
Find the foe

1941
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,800
Strike where they are

1942
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,600
Round the world

1943
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,600
Isn't too far

1944
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:34,800
When the Air Force takes command
