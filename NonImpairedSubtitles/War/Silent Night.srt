I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT.

497
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:24,050
MY ELDEST SON PAUL
DIED AT STALINGRAD.

498
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:32,692
HE WAS SHOT AND BLED TO
DEATH BECAUSE THERE WAS
NO-ONE THERE TO HELP HIM.

499
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:36,363
NO-ONE SHOULD HAVE
TO DIE LIKE THAT.

500
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:38,965
I - I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

501

WOULD YOU BRING YOUR BOY
HERE AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:52,145
OUR TOWN IS UNDER
CONSTANT BOMBARDMENT.

RIGHT BY YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.

DAS IST GUT!

515
00:37:45,865 --> 00:37:51,504
ONE OF OUR UNITS WILL BE HERE
SHORTLY AND THEN HE WILL RECEIVE
EXCELLENT MEDICAL ATTENTION.

516
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:55,208
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON YOUR
BOYS GETTING HERE FIRST.

517

BUT YOU ARE ALREADY
BEHIND OUR LINES.

BUT WE SHALL SOON RESUME
THE OFFENSIVE AND HAVE YOU

FRENCH AND BRITISH AT DUNKIRK.

WE WON'T MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE, I ASSURE YOU.

YOUR LAST GASP.

OVER AND YOU KNOW IT.

DO FORGIVE ME FRAU.

532
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:52,098
I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT

HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.

535

HOLIEST OF NIGHTS WE TRY
INSTEAD TO DISCOVER

WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON.

00:54:12,485 --> 00:54:14,521
AS THEY SAY,
EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE.

800
00:54:14,688 --> 00:54:16,389
WELL RELATIVELY SPEAKING,
THIS MEAL WAS DELICIOUS.

801
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:17,991
RIGHT GUYS?

802
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:19,426
(ALL) YEAH!

803
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,561
THANKS ELISABETH,
IT TASTED GREAT.

804
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,464
HOW ABOUT YOU, LIEUTENANT?
DON'T AGREE?

805
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:25,865
WHAT?

806
00:54:25,899 --> 00:54:31,504
AH YES, OF COURSE
THANK YOU FRAU VINCKEN.

807
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:35,775
IT'S UH, IT'S VERY GOOD.

808
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:38,244
YOU'VE BEEN VERY QUIET
DOWN THERE HERR LEUTNANT.

809
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:41,014
IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

810
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:42,382
NO!

811
00:54:42,515 --> 00:54:44,984
THINKING.

812
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,320
THAT IS ALL.

813
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:49,723
WELL, THERE'S NO LAW
AGAINST THAT IN THE
THIRD REICH I SUPPOSE.

814
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:51,157
NOT YET !

815
00:54:53,526 --> 00:54:54,794
[LAUGHTER]

816
00:54:55,862 --> 00:54:57,364
AND WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

817
00:54:57,497 --> 00:54:58,998
YOUR FAMILY?

818
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:02,302
ACTUALLY I WAS.

819
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:05,739
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
THAT YOU WERE HOME?

820
00:55:05,905 --> 00:55:07,707
DECEMBER OF 1942.

821
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:11,611
AH, FOR CHRISTMAS?

822
00:55:11,711 --> 00:55:14,681
FOR MY OLDER
BROTHER'S FUNERAL.

823
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:19,753
HE WAS A PANZER COMPANY
COMMANDER KILLED IN RUSSIA.

824
00:55:19,853 --> 00:55:22,455
WE WERE ALL VERY
PROUD OF GUNTER.

825
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:26,159
HE BROUGHT GREAT
HONOR TO OUR FAMILY.

826
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:29,362
ONLY TWO MONTHS BEFORE HE
HAD WON THE IRON CROSS.

827
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:32,732
LIKE MY FATHER AND
UNCLE IN THE GREAT WAR.

828
00:55:32,899 --> 00:55:37,671
AND NOW I AM THE ONLY SON.

829
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:43,076
SO, I MUST CONTINUE
THE FAMILY TRADITION.

830
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:44,811
THAT'S QUITE A
RESPONSIBILITY TO BEAR.

831
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:48,948
MAKES ME KIND OF GLAD MY OLD
MAN WAS JUST A STONE MASON.

832
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,386
MY FATHER WAS ALSO
IN THE GREAT WAR.

833
00:55:53,553 --> 00:56:00,393
OH, HE WAS A HANDSOME MAN,
UNTIL HE MARCHED OFF TO THE
SOMME AND HAD HALF OF HIS

834
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,896
FACE BLOWN OFF.

835
00:56:02,996 --> 00:56:07,133
WHAT WAS LEFT WAS
A HORRIFYING SIGHT.

836
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,670
FROM THAT POINT ON MY MOTHER
WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY MIRRORS
OR ANY SHINY SURFACES

837
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:12,405
INTO OUR HOME.

838
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:16,142
BUT OUR PAIN WAS
NOTHING COMPARED TO HIS.

839
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:21,247
HE WOULD
DRINK CONSTANTLY, UNTIL HE
DRANK HIMSELF UNCONSCIOUS.

840
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:27,987
AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE
NIGHTMARES AND SCREAM
AS IF BEING TORTURED.

841
00:56:28,154 --> 00:56:32,092
HE FINALLY SHOT
HIMSELF IN OUR PARLOR.

842
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:36,963
I WAS TWELVE, AND IT WAS
HIS THIRTY-SECOND BIRTHDAY.

843
00:56:37,097 --> 00:56:45,472
DO NOT TALK TO ME
ABOUT THE HONOR OF WAR.

844
00:56:52,545 --> 00:56:53,546
(CLEARS THROAT)

845
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,450
WELL, UH LET'S SEE WHAT
WE HAVE FOR DESSERT HUH.

846
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:01,187
LET'S SEE, WE GOT,
WE GOT EIGHT COOKIES,
COURTESY OF FRAU MUELLER,

847
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:07,694
AND PINEAPPLE PUDDING, EH?

848
00:57:09,963 --> 00:57:10,997
PRIVATE HEINRICH.

849
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:13,967
SOME PINEAPPLE PUDDING?

850
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:15,468
JA, FUR SIE !

851
00:57:15,635 --> 00:57:17,003
DANKE!

852
00:57:17,971 --> 00:57:21,508
PRIVATE CITIZEN VINCKEN ?

853
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:22,942
DANKE.

854
00:57:25,945 --> 00:57:27,247
ELISABETH, WOULD
YOU LIKE A COOKIE?

855
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,949
NOT YET, THANK YOU.

856
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:31,284
ANYBODY ELSE?

857
00:57:31,418 --> 00:57:31,885
WHAT?

858
00:57:31,918 --> 00:57:32,185
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

859
00:57:32,352 --> 00:57:33,453
COME ON.

860
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:33,987
HERE.

861
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:34,521
YEAH.

862
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:35,355
ME TOO.

863
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:37,791
BELIEVE ME THEY
ARE DELICIOUS.

864
00:57:37,924 --> 00:57:40,160
UMM - UMM - SANTA?

865
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:46,866
WELL, I THINK
WE SHOULD HELP GIVE
ELISABETH A HAND -

866
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,534
NO. NO.NO.NO.

867
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:48,268
EVERYONE RELAX.

868
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,002
NO, NO REALLY.

869
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:49,803
NO, NO, NO.

870
00:57:49,836 --> 00:57:52,372
I WILL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

871
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:53,573
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

872
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:54,607
OKAY.

873
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:56,343
SARGE, I'LL TAKE THAT.

874
00:57:56,509 --> 00:57:57,444
OH OKAY.

875
00:57:59,112 --> 00:58:02,148
WELL, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

876
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:08,321
GOINQ SOMEWHERE, SERGEANT?

877
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:15,028
YOU GUYS MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HOLD IT IN ALL NIGHT, BUT
I GOTTA GO TO THE LATRINE.

878
00:58:15,195 --> 00:58:15,795
JA!

879
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:18,198
I TOO MUST RELIEVE MYSELF.

880
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:20,467
FRITZ, DARLING!

881
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,769
WHEN YOU ARE DONE
YOU AND PETER CAN
BRING IN THE DISHES.

882
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:49,996
I SUSPECT I KNOW YOUR
SECRET, FRAU VINCKEN.

883
00:58:50,096 --> 00:58:53,400
I HAVE NO SECRETS LIEUTENANT.

884
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:56,536
ARE YOU SURE?

885
00:58:58,772 --> 00:59:07,280
THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION,
BUT TEMPORARY, I ASSURE YOU.

886
00:59:07,414 --> 00:59:13,019
TOMORROW WE SOLDIERS
MUST GO BACK TO WAR.

887
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:18,024
BACK TO OUR OPPOSING SIDES.

888
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:22,062
WHOSE SIDE WILL YOU
BE ON, FRAU VINCKEN?

889
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:29,102
OR MORE PRECISELY WHOSE SIDE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ON?

890
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:32,405
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

891
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:38,144
JUST THAT I KNOW
WHY YOU ARE HERE.

892
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:42,415
IT BOTHERED ME WHY A MOTHER
WOULD BRING HER SON UP
THROUGH OUR LINES WHILST A

893
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,250
GREAT BATTLE IS RAGING.

894
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:47,654
USUALLY CIVILIANS
GO THE OTHER WAY.

895
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,823
BUT NOT YOU.

896
00:59:49,956 --> 00:59:51,891
WHY?

897
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:57,831
BECAUSE YOU HOPE TO
GET THROUGH OUR LINES
TO THE AMERICAN SIDE.

898
00:59:57,964 --> 01:00:02,702
AND WHY WOULD I
DO SUCH A THING?

899
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,705
FOR FRITZ!

900
01:00:05,872 --> 01:00:13,313
YOU SEE IT OCCURRED TO ME
THAT THROUGH EVERY TOWN
WE WENT THROUGH BOYS MUCH

901
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:17,217
YOUNGER THAN HE WERE
ALREADY BEARING ARMS.

902
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,018
BUT NOT HE.

903
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:22,355
WHY NOT?

904
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:25,558
HOW IS IT THAT HE IS THE
ONLY BOY HIS AGE WHO HAS
NOT RECEIVED HIS

905
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:29,829
CALL-UP PAPERS YET?

906
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:34,000
OR HAS HE?

907
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:41,608
I MAKE NO EXCUSES.

908
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:45,211
I HAVE ALREADY LOST ONE
SON AND POSSIBLY A HUSBAND.

909
01:00:45,345 --> 01:00:53,520
I WILL NOT SEE MY ONLY
REMAINING SON GIVE HIS LIFE
FOR A CAUSE I NO LONGER

910
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:57,657
BELIEVE IN.

911
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:01,695
WELL I THINK THIS
IS THE LAST OF IT.

912
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:04,297
EXCUSE ME, LIEUTENANT.

913
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:11,838
SO GUYS, WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO ABOUT DRESSING UP THAT
NAKED CHRISTMAS TREE HUH?

914
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:13,606
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY DECORATIONS?

915
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:14,708
NOT YET!

916
01:01:14,874 --> 01:01:19,112
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN FIND.

917
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:19,679
WELL, COME ON.

918
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:20,814
LET'S GO.

919
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:21,481
COME ON.

920
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:22,449
LET'S GET TO THE TREE.

921
01:01:22,582 --> 01:01:23,850
COME ON PETER.

922
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:32,392
DANKE.

923
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,062
CIGARS AND PINEAPPLE PUDDING.

924
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:40,000
A FEW KILOMETERS FROM
HOME AND YET WE BARELY
HAVE ENOUGH RATIONS,

925
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:46,172
AND AMERICA IS AN OCEAN AWAY
AND YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

926
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:50,577
WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
BREATHING HEAVY YET.

927
01:01:55,415 --> 01:01:57,884
THAT KID THERE, HEINRICH.

928
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:02,122
HOW OLD IS HE?

929
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:08,995
TURNS FIFTEEN NEXT SPRING
IF HE SURVIVES THAT LONG.

930
01:02:09,362 --> 01:02:13,400
WE NOW FEED CHILDREN
TO THE MEAT GRINDER.

931
01:02:16,002 --> 01:02:18,171
WHAT ABOUT THE ONES
THAT DO SURVIVE?

932
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:23,176
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE THEM KIDS AGAIN
WHEN ALL THIS IS OVER?

933
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,615
I DON'T KNOW.

934
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:30,116
AND YOUR BOY IN THERE.

935
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,887
THE WOUNDED ONE.

936
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:34,988
HOW OLD IS HE?

937
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:37,090
TWENTY ONE.

938
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,426
HE'S AN OLD MAN IN THIS GAME.

939
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:45,231
HE MAY EVEN GET
TO BE A LITTLE BIT
OLDER, THANKS TO YOU.

940
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:53,840
IT IS DIFFICULT HUH, NOT TO
GET CLOSE TO THE GOOD ONES.

941
01:02:53,973 --> 01:02:56,242
HERBIE?

942
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:58,378
WORST SOLDIER I'VE EVER SEEN.

943
01:02:58,511 --> 01:03:01,448
CAN'T CLEAR HIS
WEAPON - BUNCHES UP
WITH THE OTHER GUYS.

944
01:03:01,581 --> 01:03:05,785
CAN'T PUT HIM ON THE
POINT 'CAUSE HE'S
ALWAYS DAY DREAMING.

945
01:03:05,885 --> 01:03:09,322
AH, YOU NEVER DAY
DREAM, SERGEANT?

946
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:14,427
SOMETIMES IT IS
WHAT KEEPS ME ALIVE.

947
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:18,698
OH HERBIE DAY DREAMS
ALL THE TIME, AND THAT
CAN GET YOU KILLED

948
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:20,300
(SIGHS)

949
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:24,004
BEEN WITH ME SINCE DAY ONE.

950
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:29,476
HIM, MEATBALL PRESTIANNI,
WINKIE KAHLER, JOHNNY SIMONE.

951
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:31,044
A GREAT BUNCH OF GUYS.

952
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:33,813
CAME OVER TOGETHER IN
'42, OFF A TROOPSHIP,
ONTO A LANDING CRAFT,

953
01:03:33,947 --> 01:03:42,822
INTO NORTH AFRICA,
ITALY, NOW HERE.

954
01:03:42,956 --> 01:03:50,096
ALONG THE WAY I LOST EVERY
ONE OF THEM EXCEPT HERBIE.

955
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:52,866
WORST DAMN SOLDIER
