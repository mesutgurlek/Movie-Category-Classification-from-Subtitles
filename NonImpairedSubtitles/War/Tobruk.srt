1
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:05,236
North Africa, September 1942

2
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:07,489
A darkest hour...

3
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,196
The world watches as Adolf Hitler
high stepping Africa Corps sweeps

4
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,031
onwards to Egypt and the
Suez Canal while

5
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:18,693
the British, our strength
dissipated by defeat

6
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:22,276
make a desperate regroup at
El Alamein.

7
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:25,149
Two years had passed since the
fall of France.

8
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:27,894
France now officially neutral

9
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,227
lives under Nazi domination

10
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:33,568
and the French city of Algiers
is a port of embarkation

11
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,185
for British, Italian and
German soldiers caught

12
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:39,317
and interned by the French.

13
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:58,022
Prisoners for deportation.

14
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,151
Forward.

15
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:44,605
Captain.

16
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,057
Well, Leftenan... bring them aboard.

17
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:33,587
Faster.

18
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,841
- A Canadian, 5 Italians.
- Come quickly.

19
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:41,214
Faster, come on.

20
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:52,253
- All in order, Captain.
- Very good, Lieutenant.

21
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,551
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

22
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,948
- Beware!
- Fire!

23
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,817
Extinguishers!

24
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:07,826
Stop!

25
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,615
Back or be shot.

26
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,740
- That one.
- Join us, Commander.

27
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,231
Ain't you forgetting
this is neutral territory.

28
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:22,969
Sorry, we have no tea.

29
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:26,212
Perhaps you will settle for chocolate?

30
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:36,256
Not even name,
rank and serial number?

31
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,052
Very well.

32
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,835
Name: Donald Craig.

33
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,498
Rank: Major, long range desert group.

34
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:51,332
Serial numbers 762513.

35
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,548
Born... Montreal.

36
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,127
Studied topography... Quebec, London.

37
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,500
Graduated work... School of Mines
Kensington.

38
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,129
Worked three years for Standard Oil.

39
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:09,917
Shall I continue... Major?

40
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:14,037
- What's my mother name?
- Elizabeth.

41
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:19,874
Father, John Foster Craig,
retired and lives in Vancouver.

42
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:24,120
Your reluctants to talk is
understandable.

43
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:28,622
If I have been force to escape across
300 miles of enemy held desert,

44
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,039
and if after all of that...

45
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,083
I've been captured by
French authorities,

46
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,251
I too would be embarassed.

47
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,075
Captian Bergman.

48
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,326
Very British of you, Major.

49
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:56,330
Before you go any further,
take a look at your escort.

50
00:12:57,127 --> 00:13:00,041
I'm sure you can recognised
an English fighter when you see one.

51
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,292
Who are you?

52
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,867
Special Identification group.

53
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,874
The G. E. I.

54
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:24,240
- I thought they were all...
- Jews, Major.

55
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:26,282
Yes, we are.

56
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,368
German Jews serving with the British.

57
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:33,289
However as German's,
we still have our uses.

58
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,860
French will think this is a Nazi raid.

59
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,657
Have more respect for
the enemy, Major.

60
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:34,316
What's all these? Haven't you
seen a bloody airplane before?

61
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:35,569
Go away!

62
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,981
Lieutenant Boyden, signals.

63
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,105
Welcome to Kufra, Major...
such as it is.

64
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:52,098
- Colonel Harker is expecting you.
- I would hope so, Lieutenant...

65
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,734
I would certainly hope so.

66
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:55,899
Yes but of course.

67
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:57,695
Come along... man.
The Colonel's waiting.

68
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,522
Colonel Harker, sir!

69
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,650
Major Craig and Captain Bergman
reporting.

70
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,981
Oh... thank you, Boyden.

71
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:20,897
Captain Bergman. Hello Craig!
Glad you could come.

72
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,396
I'll get right to it.

73
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:26,766
Sometimes ago you submitted
a plan to staff...

74
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:31,434
hardlining a proposed raid on the
German fuel bunkers at Tobruk.

75
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:36,144
In his infinite wisdom,
staff turned my plan down.

76
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,764
Things do have a way of changing,
don't they... Major?

77
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,106
Rommel is 90 miles from Suez.

78
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,242
Every shell, every gallon of
petrol he gets

79
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:45,455
has to come 300 miles from Tobruk.

80
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:49,562
The RAF is doing its best but
still too much is getting through.

81
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,429
So we're gonna have a go
at Rommel source of supplies.

82
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,521
Didn't I said something to...

83
00:15:57,982 --> 00:15:59,179
provoke humour?

84
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:03,430
Staff has a genius for sitting on
it's brain and coming

85
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:06,059
up with perfect hindsight.

86
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:09,098
Would you cared to expand on that?

87
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,806
When I submitted the plan
we could have

88
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,551
blown up their fuel bunkers
with a handful of men.

89
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:18,552
How in the hell are we supposed
to get through their defences now?

90
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:20,477
Drive through, Major.

91
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,507
Disguised as prisoner of war
guarded by

92
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,435
Captain Bergman personal
African Corps.

93
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:28,561
The plan is still basically yours

94
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:33,510
but now it will be maximum effort
land, sea and earth.

95
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,175
Colonel, could you direct me
to the nearest bus stop?

96
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,643
We are here...

97
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,768
Tobruk, here.

98
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:57,175
Your primarily responsibilities is to

99
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,823
route our convoy through 800 miles of

100
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:02,406
the west desert
the Sahara has to offer

101
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,135
right into the back door of Tobruk.

102
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,135
That's why we went to so much
trouble and it was no

103
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:10,586
lark, you know... Major,

104
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:12,681
to bring you halfway across
North Africa.

105
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:14,805
I didn't ask for the trip, Colonel.

106
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,259
- I've been here before.
- Precisely.

107
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:20,969
Staff believed that your practical
knowledge of the terrain is

108
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,259
essential on the success
of our mission.

109
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,424
That is your job, Major.

110
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:27,970
Ours begin when we get there.

111
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,301
After we've knocked out their
harbour guns installation,

112
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:33,436
we linked up with naval
assault troops, destroyed the fuel

113
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,155
bunkers and evacuate by sea.

114
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:38,050
Their heavy guns are here,
Mersa Cove...

115
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:41,378
- It's suicide.
- It's orders.

116
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:45,959
- How many days do we have?
- Eight.

117
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,403
Impossible.

118
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:50,004
Impossible or not,

119
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,916
it will be done and on schedule.

120
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,925
Do I make myself clear, Craig?

121
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:56,837
Welcome aboard, Major Craig.

122
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:00,375
We don't get many volunteers.

123
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,146
Keep your eyes and ears
open around the Jews,

124
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,579
little trust all right,
there's no point in overdoing it.

125
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,124
Six years in Palestine taught me that.

126
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,715
And for your information,

127
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:19,418
I'm the genius with perfect hindsight.

128
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:21,965
Never doubted it, Colonel.

129
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,415
We leave in 1 hour, Lieutenant Boyden
will see to your needs.

130
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:28,542
Major Craig...

131
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,877
don't let personal differences
of opinion

132
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:34,335
interfered with our operation.

133
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:36,463
I understand, Colonel.

134
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:40,830
I liked you to bear one thing in
mind when and if we reached Tobruk,

135
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,830
my mother didn't raise any heroes.

136
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,495
A bloody work of art, matey
but I do say so meself.

137
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,791
Save the Jerry the trouble of
repainting if we are taken.

138
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,287
Now, that's a cheery thought.

139
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:01,504
Handsome.

140
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:03,453
Come on, get cracking.

141
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:05,997
Never get the Victoria Cross
for admiring yourself.

142
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,367
It's chai cross we're after, sir.

143
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:11,033
I think Dolan is a feeling a touch
of the sand and sun, Major.

144
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:13,414
You'll be feeling a touch of
my boots if you don't hop to.

145
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,493
This is Libya, not London.

146
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,454
Well, damn bloody hell!

147
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,988
Soldiers, get off the vehicle!

148
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,989
Line up, hurry!

149
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,537
Attention, stand still!

150
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,697
Lieutenant, troops in formation.

151
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:59,447
Ooh... got a cold feeling down the
back of me neck just looking at 'em.

152
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:02,240
What kind of bleeding mission
are we going on anyway, sir?

153
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,443
You know when you're
supposed to and not before.

154
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,074
Maybe you don't know either,
Sergeant Major.

155
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:09,822
All right... all right, what is this

156
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:11,821
going on with the lot of you?
Come on now.

157
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:13,782
Sergeant Major!

158
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,036
Sir!

159
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:20,819
Do you have your orders
regarding my men?

160
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:22,322
We'll have no dealings with you

161
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:25,575
as soldiers unless otherwise
instructed, sir.

162
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:28,819
See to those orders are complied with,
Sergeant Major.

163
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:30,785
Sir!

164
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:36,859
Attention, break ranks!

165
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:42,066
Taking orders from a ruddy Kraut!

166
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,571
What's this bleeding war coming to?

167
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,866
If my father in Tel Aviv could
see me here now,

168
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:53,564
fighting for the British, he would
take back my Bar Mitzvah.

169
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,153
War and politics, Mohnfeld.
They're always mix.

170
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,984
There are just the same if he ever
finds out. He'll give me an a bris.

171
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:07,108
Well, now we know how the Italians
must feel with their German allies.

172
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:10,029
And the English will throw us
to the wolves just as quick...

173
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:12,685
If we let them.

174
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:14,987
Get the men ready, Sergeant.

175
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:56,149
You got bullets in that thing, mate?

176
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,249
- Talking to the blighty enemy.
- We're supposed to be prisoner...

177
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:03,685
...Alfie. You know the orders,
no fraternizing.

178
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,312
No fraternizing, I just asked him if
he's got bullets in that chopper.

179
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,600
I don't want him to take his
play acting too much to heart.

180
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:14,811
An opportunity, he says.

181
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:16,439
- Who says?
- The judge.

182
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:20,388
I'm giving you the chance
to serve your country

183
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,811
and to come back to society
as a respectable citizen.

184
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:24,503
God bless him.

185
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:26,541
You wouldn't want to be
back in London, Alfie...

186
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,164
not with all them bombs
the Jerry are dropping.

187
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:29,754
Do us a favour, all they ever did.

188
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:31,531
It's always been hospitals
and churches.

189
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:34,387
They couldn't hit Brixton prison
in a 100 years.

190
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,593
God, it ain't half hot.

191
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:19,016
Just like being on a roller coaster.

192
00:24:26,193 --> 00:24:27,234
Bruckner!

193
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,538
- Yes!
- Come here.

194
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,797
Enemy column, tanks!

195
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:44,757
Italian's, sir.

196
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,166
No flanking scouts.

197
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,259
If we were an attack force,
they'd have little chance.

198
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:57,294
They should cleared us by 1000 yards.

199
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,419
Unless they altered directions,

200
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:01,212
- Lieutenant Boyden.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,252
- I want every man armed and ready.
- Sir!

202
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,493
You know when you come to think of it,
Brixton prison's really a nice place.

203
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,329
You're getting soft in the
konk, Alfie.

204
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,829
All 8 feet thick of regular
bleeding bomb shelter.

205
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,746
If I could get my hands on
that judge...

206
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,490
- Sending innocent to the slaughter.
- Innocent?

207
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:04,824
I will give something.

208
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:58,193
The whole damn Sahara
and they have to stop here.

209
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:28,019
- So, Major?
- More company, sir.

210
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:29,932
Over there... on the other side.

211
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:34,638
They must be Germans.

212
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,689
The Italians are too fond of
comfort to travel this late.

213
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:45,221
Their sentry hasn't seen them yet.

214
00:28:45,397 --> 00:28:47,802
Take what man you need Bergman
and make sure they don't.

215
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:50,228
Bruckner, come with me.

216
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,686
What do you estimate the range?

217
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,388
2.000 yards, maybe even less.

218
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:59,709
Twice the reached
range of our mortars.

219
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:01,208
I'll get the range finder.

220
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:03,179
And prepared mortars.

221
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:18,894
You all right?

222
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:20,600
You, okay?

223
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,118
Lieutenant Boyden, sir.
You don't mind me asking...

224
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:24,508
What's the old man up to now?

225
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,456
A lovely scheme, Alfie.
A lovely scheme.

226
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:29,172
He's going to start a bit of fighting
between the Italians and the Germans.

227
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,373
How's he going to do that, sir?

228
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:34,348
First we open fire on the Germans,
then our mortars hit the Italians.

229
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,928
Now the Italians see the German's
column and vice-versa.

230
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,808
So both of them got to
thinking it's the British army on the

231
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,572
other side that's doing
all the firing, you see.

232
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,203
And you got themselves
a bloody battle going.

233
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:42,953
Right.

234
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:46,174
- Blimey, you think we'll make it sir?
- Know any good prayer, Alfie?

235
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:42,384
Range?

236
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,759
Eight hundreds.

237
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,336
- Sergeant Major....
- Sir.

238
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,749
- Tell Mr Boyden to open fire.
- Sir.

239
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,005
Gentlemen,

240
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,081
it's time we're moving.

241
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,991
It's like a bloody furnace.

242
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,747
Cheer up, it could get worse.

243
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,826
What's the devil are you doing?

244
00:32:57,994 --> 00:33:01,075
We're making excellent time on
the flats, why head into this area?

245
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:04,777
We leave our calling card back
there in the wadi, Colonel,

246
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:06,018
the Germans bound to find.

247
00:33:06,022 --> 00:33:08,591
Exactly why speed is
our best advantage.

248
00:33:08,743 --> 00:33:10,022
They know that too.

249
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:12,338
That's why they'll spending
the major part of their times

250
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:14,635
guarding Kalafsho Flats
while we cut through here.

251
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,189
Do you realised what you're
suggesting, Major?

252
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,592
Yes, sir!

253
00:33:19,617 --> 00:33:22,188
- That's a German minefield.
- That's right.

254
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,441
Where they're not likely to
looks for us.

255
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:27,707
I don't like it.
We're turning around.

256
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:28,723
Do that Colonel and you'll

257
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:30,773
reached Tobruk as a real prisoner.

258
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:48,815
It's out of the question.

259
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:51,577
Colonel Harker you went
to an awful lot of trouble to

260
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:54,049
shanghai me in on this mission.

261
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:57,770
If you're not going to follow my
advise, what the hell am I doing here?

262
00:33:57,946 --> 00:34:00,777
You can't take heavy transport
through that without mine detector.

263
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,482
Why are you telling me?
You brought me along to tell you.

264
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:07,226
All right... Major, tell me.

265
00:34:09,195 --> 00:34:10,273
Thank you, sir.

266
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:15,149
Bring up the half-track.

267
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,772
This time of the year,
the wind is from the south.

268
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:23,015
It blows for months
at a time forming a

269
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,009
sand cushion at the base of the slope.

270
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:28,630
By keeping to the slope
the deep sand will act as

271
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:30,550
a pillow dispersing our weight.

272
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:33,891
Our heaviest pieces of half-track

273
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,001
can make it, the others can.

274
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:37,043
I know the lorries wheel will bogged
down but the half-track

275
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:38,732
with it's track can maneuver.

276
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,517
But how do you propose to
get the lorries through?

277
00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:43,898
This is an old mine field, Colonel.

278
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,602
The sand covering the mines
had plenty of times to settle.

279
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:48,394
By keeping to the slopes,
I will be able to see

280
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,880
the depression over the mines.

281
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:53,147
So you intend to clear the way
and pied piper us through?

282
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:55,107
That's right.

283
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:58,104
- Sergeant Major Tyne!
- Sir!

284
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,938
Bring a drum from the lorries with
branches and camouflage

285
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:05,013
- to wipe out our tracks.
- Sir.

286
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,430
It may not be so simple.

287
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:11,515
The Germans often set their
mines at tandem.

288
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:13,892
Tried to move one and
you could take out a dozen.

289
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,559
It's very effective. That's why the
rest of you will wait behind me.

290
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:19,305
Behind us, Major.

291
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:22,472
You can't drive and watch
those depression of yours.

292
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:26,434
Suit yourself.
You're the one who volunteer.

293
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:57,761
Go to the left.

294
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:00,303
Stay to the left. It's digging in.

295
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:03,385
Goes any deeper we're going to
blow up your whole theory.

296
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:05,592
To the high side.

297
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:41,553
Stop!

298
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:46,003
- Wait here.
- My pleasure!

299
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:53,372
He looks so calm,
you think he was planting daisies.

300
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:54,889
You know one wrong
tickle with that bayonet

301
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:56,652
and we will be pushing up the daisies.

302
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:25,070
Does he expect to dig up the whole
damn Sahara on his own?

303
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:27,983
- Sergeant Major Tyne.
- Sir.

304
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,219
Get some men with bayonets
and follow me, will you?

305
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:31,841
Sir.

306
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:51,695
What have you got your fingers
in your ears for?

307
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:52,779
What have you got your

308
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:56,465
- fingers in your ears for?
- I can't stand the sight of blood.

309
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,730
Then why don't you put your
hands over your eyes?

310
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,401
Well, I want to see what's
going on, don't I?

311
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,395
- I've got some men coming up.
- That won't be necessary.

312
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:11,946
Give that first one a burst, Bergman.

313
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:26,153
Down!

314
00:40:36,027 --> 00:40:37,686
It's just our luck to strike oil.

315
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:40,777
Next one.

316
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,936
- We can move on down, Colonel.
- Let me drive.

317
00:40:55,942 --> 00:40:57,648
We can move on then.

318
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:01,306
They didn't teach us that
at Sandhurst, sir.

319
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:04,790
Look out the
Bungalore torpedo, Boyden.

320
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:05,911
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

321
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:08,126
Get cracking, there's a
schedule to keep.

322
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,560
All right, Boyle?

323
00:42:04,142 --> 00:42:04,865
Any complaints?

324
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:07,479
How about some more sugar for
the cocoa, Sergeant Major?

325
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:09,640
You've had your rations that you need.

326
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:12,927
- Grub all right?
- It's wonderful.

327
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,298
- Any complaints?
- No, sir.

328
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,097
- Grub all right?
- Lovely.

329
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,047
- How's your arm?
- Oh, fine.

330
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:32,177
- Make good use of it, boy.
- All right.

331
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:34,639
Sir.

332
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:43,930
- Trouble?
- Carburation's off.

333
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:48,759
I'll say one thing for the Germans,

334
00:42:48,785 --> 00:42:50,703
they certainly know how
to build an engine.

335
00:42:52,596 --> 00:42:55,677
It doesn't cost much, either,
when they use slave labor.

336
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:00,468
Two hundred Jew power, Major.

337
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:02,757
We all know what's going on in Europe.

338
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:05,506
Well, if you do,

339
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:07,509
if you really do,

340
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,174
there must be a little of
the Jew in you.

341
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:13,792
They say there's a little of
the Jew in everyone.

342
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:15,884
Jah,

343
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:17,919
a little of the Nazi, too.

344
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,835
Your war's going to last a lot longer
than mine, Captain.

345
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,456
It's 2000 years old now.

346
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:31,832
For the first time since Jesus,

347
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,414
you begin to think and feel
as a people.

348
00:43:35,632 --> 00:43:38,500
Days of the wandering Jew
are coming to an end.

349
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:40,424
We're going home.

350
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:43,584
- Palestine?
- Israel, Major.

351
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,048
Israel.

352
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:47,380
It's where we begin.

353
00:43:48,631 --> 00:43:50,752
Anyone looking for trouble
in the future,

354
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,455
will know where to find us.

355
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,042
Good evening, Major.

356
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:03,873
Take cover!

357
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:21,702
- You bleedy fool!
- We're British!

358
00:45:30,412 --> 00:45:31,738
Open fire!

359
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:25,359
- Sergeant Major Tyne.
- Sir!

360
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:31,018
Formed burial party and
see to the wounded.

361
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:32,238
Sir!

362
00:46:33,697 --> 00:46:35,900
You four, over here... on the double!
Come on, move!

363
00:46:36,446 --> 00:46:38,934
We be moving since the
burial parties is finished.

364
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:42,063
Why waste the time? A few bit of
sand won't make any difference.

365
00:46:42,237 --> 00:46:45,021
- You heard the order.
- That smoke can be seen for miles.

366
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,689
Look Bergman, if you have any
complaints take them to the Colonel.

367
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:49,188
Or find yourself a rabbi.

368
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:19,189
It's no use, sir. It's had it.

369
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:23,637
- The emergency transmitter?
- It's dead, it was in lorry 3.

370
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:27,986
Our orders were not to break
silence except in an emergency.

371
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:30,389
Cairo will assumed we're proceeding
as schedule.

372
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:32,017
Let's see that we do.

373
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:40,580
Tuareg.

374
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:41,932
Hold your fire.

375
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:43,741
There's one there's more.

376
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:44,601
Wouldn't be the first time

377
00:47:44,604 --> 00:47:46,104
- they attack a column.
- English column.

378
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,524
This column is currently
listed as German.

379
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:49,501
Craig.

380
00:47:50,063 --> 00:47:51,390
I'll find out what he wants.

381
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,561
Sergeant... your tunic and cap.

382
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,006
They have 2 prisoners. They want guns.

383
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,641
Blast!

384
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:39,301
We've to go along.
It wouldn't look right otherwise.

385
00:48:39,474 --> 00:48:41,216
German's prisoners.. it's all we need.

386
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:43,557
Craig.

387
00:48:44,432 --> 00:48:45,473
Agreed!

388
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:48,885
Cover me.

389
00:48:49,432 --> 00:48:50,473
Krug.

390
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:04,168
Look at them.

391
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:06,344
Wish I had me rifle.

392
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:08,761
Cor, I wish I had me camera.

393
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,255
Trust an Arab to argue.

394
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,251
And if you are not interested,
we will take your heads.

395
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:27,879
Peace be to you.

396
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,864
Well, what was that little
display all about?

397
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,668
A bargaining point, Colonel.

398
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:51,157
He'll settled for 10 rifles and
some ammunitions.

399
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:52,870
The prisoners?

400
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:54,584
British?

401
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:56,079
Father and daughter.

402
00:50:56,293 --> 00:50:58,578
They wanted to be taken to
the Germans.

403
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:04,867
It's absolutely essential we reached
Cairo as quickly as possible.

404
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:06,935
If we don't this campaign
as well as the war

405
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,556
itself would be vitally affected.

406
00:51:09,957 --> 00:51:11,394
You expect me to believe
this from someone

407
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,980
found wandering in the desert?

408
00:51:13,332 --> 00:51:15,633
Father and I left
Von Hellstern's headquarter

409
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:17,302
in Benghazi three nights ago.

410
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:20,663
We would to be dropped outside
Cairo and met by a resident agent's.

411
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:23,569
Our plane had to make a force landing.
The pilot was killed.

412
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,968
Poor chap broke his neck when we hit.

413
00:51:25,994 --> 00:51:27,896
The tribemen found us the
following day.

414
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,654
Well, if you are to say who you are,

415
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:35,325
certainly you agent's had
some means of identification.

416
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:47,887
There! Signed by

417
00:51:47,912 --> 00:51:50,863
Field Marshall Kesselring acting
for the Führer himself.

418
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,869
That paper is an agreement
between the Reich and

419
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:57,764
a group of important Egyptian
army officers.

420
00:51:57,911 --> 00:51:59,783
For certain considerations

421
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:03,524
they will arise against the
British in a holy war... Jihad.

422
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:08,444
The signature and seal beared all
the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.

423
00:52:08,618 --> 00:52:11,236
One of the most powerful men
in the Muslim's world.

424
00:52:11,492 --> 00:52:13,068
With Egypt on our side, we have

425
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:16,020
every reasons to believe the rest of
the Muslim's world would follow.

426
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:18,010
Captain, the Turks alone could put

427
00:52:18,036 --> 00:52:20,344
4 millions men into the
war against Russia.

428
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:23,062
Exactly, and once Rommel takes Cairo,

429
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:26,192
the army of the Grand Mufti
will moved against the British.

430
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:28,342
If you'll only contact Benghazi,
Captain...

431
00:52:28,368 --> 00:52:30,176
they can have a plane
here within hours.

432
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,606
Regrettably our radio was destroyed.

433
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,400
- By a British fighter.
- Then you must provide a vehicle.

434
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:38,019
And escort us immediately to
the nearest base.

435
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,941
Are you presuming Herr Portman to
give orders to a German officer?

436
00:52:41,156 --> 00:52:43,905
- But I explained.
- That you did.

437
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:49,229
And now, you will leave the
rest to me.

438
00:52:51,363 --> 00:52:52,772
Our destination is Tobruk.

439
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:55,695
And that's our nearest base.

440
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,966
Make our guests comfortable, Mohnfeld.

441
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:06,926
Of course, Captain.

442
00:53:08,028 --> 00:53:09,189
Mohnfeld.

443
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,893
Odd name for a German officer?

444
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:15,568
We can't all be named Schmidt,
Fraulein Portman.

445
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:24,375
We've been awared
of an anti-royalist faction

446
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,915
in the Egpytian military but this...

447
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:28,815
I'll do the honours, gentlemen.

448
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:31,141
That uniform is a disguise, Bergman,

449
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,899
don't carry it too far.

450
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,223
Shooting the girl wouldn't trouble
the Nazi's.

451
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,474
If that's what bother you, Colonel.

452
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:40,033
What bothers me is
going into action with

453
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:42,456
officers who make rash
and thoughtless move.

454
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:45,033
Portman's think this
is a German column

455
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,037
transporting British prisoners.
I want him

456
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,897
to continue in that believe.

457
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:50,936
When we reached Tobruk,
Colonel, what then?

458
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:54,682
This paper and the Portman's
guarantee our entry.

459
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,135
Is that all, Colonel?

460
00:53:56,981 --> 00:53:59,648
No, Captain Bergman, that is not all.

461
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:01,979
While you served under
me I'll expect you

462
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,709
to conduct youself as
a British officer.

463
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:06,684
You'll at all times obey
my orders no matter

464
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:09,058
how disagreeable it may seem to you.

465
00:54:10,062 --> 00:54:11,176
That is all, Captain.

466
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,560
I can understand his feelings.

467
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,351
You flattered yourself, Major.

468
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,888
Their only emotions are based
on percentages.

469
00:54:30,185 --> 00:54:32,970
Eight men were killed today.
Five of them were Bergman's.

470
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,885
How does that fit into your
percentages?

471
00:54:35,935 --> 00:54:36,976
Craig!

472
00:54:43,726 --> 00:54:44,804
Dismissed!

473
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:47,432
May I tell you something, Colonel?

474
00:54:48,558 --> 00:54:49,600
You may.

475
00:54:50,183 --> 00:54:51,842
You're a real joy!

476
00:55:52,885 --> 00:55:54,164
Come on then sit-up.

477
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:32,506
Four.

478
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:33,922
Three.

479
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:35,755
One.

480
00:56:57,711 --> 00:56:59,168
Good evening, Corporal.

481
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,160
I think I'll take a short walk.

482
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:43,325
- Goodnight, Corporal.
- Goodnight.

483
00:57:48,913 --> 00:57:52,279
At 13:00 tomorrow we move on Tobruk.

484
00:57:52,455 --> 00:57:53,638
If all goes well,

485
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:58,155
we should be in position to take the
harbour defense guns by 20:00 hours.

486
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:02,735
Our attack coincides with the
massive raid by the RAF.

487
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:06,651
At 21:30, naval units will
shell the harbour,

488
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:09,612
while assault troops come ashore
to link with us.

489
00:58:10,328 --> 00:58:12,235
Our primary objectives,

490
00:58:12,953 --> 00:58:16,234
- are the fuel bunkers here.
- Colonel...

491
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,858
If we can't reached the guns,
how do we warn off the navy?

492
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,572
Jerry has a large transmitter here
in the central of the city.

493
00:58:23,784 --> 00:58:25,522
Let's hope it won't be necessary.

494
00:58:25,525 --> 00:58:27,740
And if it's necessary,
where does that leave us?

495
00:58:28,118 --> 00:58:30,404
We revert to your original
plan, Major.

496
00:58:30,743 --> 00:58:34,605
Do what damage we can to Rommel's
fuel supply, make a run for it.

497
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:37,361
Well, I don't mind running
but to where?

498
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:39,240
If we're not rescue by sea,
we don't get out.

499
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,273
I'm aware of that possibility, Major.

500
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:46,395
That's why we have an alternative
pick-up down the coast at Sollum.

501
00:58:47,116 --> 00:58:49,272
It's a long way to go with the
Germans on our back.

502
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:52,255
If we're capture it means a POW camp.

503
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:55,732
What about Bergman's men? They
can't let themselves be taken alive.

504
00:58:55,948 --> 00:59:00,272
I'm quite sure that Captain Bergman
and his SIG gave that

505
00:59:00,447 --> 00:59:02,438
a very careful consideration

506
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:05,195
before they volunteer.

507
00:59:06,114 --> 00:59:07,155
Thank you, gentlemen.

508
00:59:16,154 --> 00:59:17,196
Bergman.

509
00:59:21,112 --> 00:59:23,822
I thought you Jews were
supposed to be smart.

510
00:59:23,848 --> 00:59:24,911
Enemy propaganda, mate.

511
00:59:24,914 --> 00:59:27,543
Why in the hell you
didn't speak up in there?

512
00:59:27,569 --> 00:59:28,425
What reason?

513
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:30,892
There's no Geneva Convention for us.

514
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,189
Begin thinking of death and
you're no longer sure of your life.

515
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:38,140
- It's a Hebrew proverb.
- A dead martyr's just another corpse!

516
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:41,597
What in God's name drive you people.

517
00:59:43,943 --> 00:59:45,020
Perhaps his name is enough.

518
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:47,935
God and Colonel Harker.

519
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:52,439
Colonel is a soldier of the old school
and has old school attitudes.

520
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:54,398
He doesn't care much for us.

521
00:59:55,316 --> 00:59:56,595
We don't care much for him.

522
00:59:57,149 --> 00:59:59,104
But he'll be there when we need him.

523
01:00:00,566 --> 01:00:01,975
Let's hope they both will.

524
01:00:02,649 --> 01:00:03,690
Good night, Major.

525
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:44,386
Don't turn your head.

526
01:00:45,436 --> 01:00:46,549
Who are you?

527
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,965
A friend.

528
01:00:50,018 --> 01:00:51,428
Then why hide?

529
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:53,893
Listen carefully,

530
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:57,805
my life as well as yours are
at stake if we are discovered.

531
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,427
This column is not what
you think, Herr Portman.

532
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:05,974
You mean Captain Bergman and
the others are not German?

533
01:01:06,184 --> 01:01:08,754
Jews... SIG.

534
01:01:08,975 --> 01:01:11,380
Their prisoners are commando's.

535
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:13,430
Member of the long range desert group.

536
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:16,932
Tobacco.

537
01:01:18,099 --> 01:01:20,504
The tobacco of that sentry
was smoking.

538
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:24,760
Our troops haven't had anything to
light since the beginning of the war.

539
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:29,297
- Who the devil are you?
- That is not important.

540
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:33,800
Your mission is and
these men know about it.

541
01:01:34,305 --> 01:01:37,089
- You must get word to Tobruk.
- But how?

542
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:39,628
Two kilometres from here due west,

543
01:01:39,805 --> 01:01:42,210
you'll will find a myriad of
stones in the sand.

544
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:46,056
Buried in the sand 6 metres north
of that marker is a

545
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:48,798
telephone cable connecting
Jalo with Tobruk.

546
01:01:50,346 --> 01:01:51,387
Now...

547
01:01:52,303 --> 01:01:53,630
Turn carefully...

548
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,511
and look!

549
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,710
In the cistern you will find
the field phone.

550
01:02:05,885 --> 01:02:09,132
A pair of camouflage capes
and a weapon.

551
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:11,176
Very well...

552
01:02:12,759 --> 01:02:16,421
If all this has been arranged,
why haven't you send for help?

553
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:19,082
I cannot miss leaving the camp.

554
01:02:19,258 --> 01:02:22,790
Once you contact Tobruk, they can have
an armour column here within hours.

555
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:26,211
And if I refuse?

556
01:02:27,842 --> 01:02:29,997
The Iron Cross will still be yours.

557
01:02:31,299 --> 01:02:33,373
Posthumously, Herr Portman.

558
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:36,001
Turn back to the wall.

559
01:02:37,715 --> 01:02:39,705
Do not move for 30 seconds.

560
01:03:27,376 --> 01:03:28,418
At ease!

561
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:43,455
Bruckner,

562
01:05:13,906 --> 01:05:15,529
A military phone.

563
01:05:17,864 --> 01:05:19,238
An English revolver.

564
01:05:23,613 --> 01:05:25,770
- Take her to the car.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

565
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:27,108
Wait!

566
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:55,860
Come forth!

567
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:08,250
Come on.

568
01:06:08,275 --> 01:06:10,561
- How did they get that telephone?
- It's very simple.

569
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,392
One among us is the enemy.

570
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:23,888
- Lieutenant.
- Sergeant.

571
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,892
Attention, stand still!

572
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,178
Order your men to unload
their weapons.

573
01:06:44,938 --> 01:06:47,142
I must refused to give
that order, Colonel.

574
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:56,425
Sergeant Major Tyne.

575
01:06:57,603 --> 01:06:58,645
Sir!

576
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,723
- Disarmed these men!
- Sir.

577
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:06,309
You, you and you, come with me.

578
01:07:12,393 --> 01:07:15,225
That's more like it.
I never did trust 'em.

579
01:07:15,393 --> 01:07:16,886
Once a Jerry, always a Jerry.

580
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,867
Once a thief, always a thief.
That right Alfie?

581
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,414
Come off it now.

582
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,129
Who else you think let
that damn spy escape?

583
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:32,890
Captain Bergman,

584
01:07:34,224 --> 01:07:37,174
you have 2 hours to deliver
your traitor.

585
01:08:13,428 --> 01:08:14,707
Try not to move, miss.

586
01:08:15,636 --> 01:08:17,177
There's a plasma tube in your arm.

587
01:08:22,635 --> 01:08:24,590
- Britwaite...
- Sergeant Major.

588
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,383
Get the Colonel. On the double!

589
01:08:41,091 --> 01:08:42,418
I'll get the M.O!

590
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,626
The message... did you get through?

591
01:09:07,173 --> 01:09:08,213
Answer me!

592
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:12,999
- You left her alone?
- Sir!

593
01:09:17,379 --> 01:09:19,204
- It's bolted, sir!
- Break it.

594
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,961
No one inside it seem.

595
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,259
Sergeant Major!

596
01:09:30,262 --> 01:09:31,769
- Sir.
- Assistance!

597
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:34,457
Cyanide, I've seen it often enough.

598
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:51,823
You'll find your spy right down
the shaft, Colonel.

599
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:53,292
Who is it?

600
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:57,534
I don't know.
It's very dark down there.

601
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:00,655
I found the sentry at the
cistern... stabbed!

602
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:03,197
But the traitor was still
in the tunnel.

603
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:05,082
He's dead!

604
01:10:17,415 --> 01:10:18,456
Bruckner.

605
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,859
Impossible, I have known
him for 10 years.

606
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:25,110
You said yourself,
the girl died from cyanide.

607
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,570
His suicide tablet gone.

608
01:10:42,162 --> 01:10:43,738
Here... Sergeant Major, look at this!

609
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:46,993
Cor, what a mess.
It's a diabolical liberty.

610
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,992
You know what they say, Britwaite...

611
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,447
Lightning never struck in the
same place twice.

612
01:10:52,036 --> 01:10:53,637
That tunic could be your lucky charm!

613
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:55,841
That guy can sure bleed,
I can tell you that.

614
01:10:56,077 --> 01:10:58,032
Well, Boyden...
what do you think of that?

615
01:10:58,201 --> 01:10:59,860
- Pretty convincing, sir.
- Thank you.

616
01:11:05,118 --> 01:11:06,693
I'd like a word with you, Colonel.

617
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:09,241
- Excuse us please.
- Sir!

618
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:20,942
All right Major. Get it off your
chest and you'll feel better.

619
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:26,228
Do you realised what will happen if
your men are taken in those uniforms?

620
01:11:28,115 --> 01:11:29,157
They'll be executed.

621
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:30,733
And that doesn't bother you at all?

622
01:11:31,282 --> 01:11:34,113
It's a calculated and most
necessary risks.

623
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:37,939
I've given orders to return
ammunitions to the SIG.

624
01:11:38,114 --> 01:11:39,939
I'm also assigning armed
British troops

625
01:11:40,114 --> 01:11:42,483
in German uniform to cover each lorry.

626
01:11:42,655 --> 01:11:44,029
How does Bergman feel about that?

627
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:46,145
This is not a popularity contest.

628
01:11:46,738 --> 01:11:48,883
I don't give a damn what
anybody thinks of my actions,

629
01:11:48,909 --> 01:11:51,052
least of all a dozen odd Jews.

630
01:11:51,237 --> 01:11:52,952
No Bruckner, when the chips are down.

631
01:11:52,956 --> 01:11:54,919
You passed judgement on
people quickly, don't you?

632
01:11:54,945 --> 01:11:56,753
Just like that and head's
are supposed to roll.

633
01:11:56,945 --> 01:12:00,191
Well, I 've never considered dying
for a cause no matter how noble.

634
01:12:00,569 --> 01:12:03,022
- And I'm not about to begin now.
- Frightened, Major?

635
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,183
You may have ice water running
through your veins, Colonel...

636
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:09,848
but I have blood and
I need every drop of it.

637
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:12,267
The way I see it, we have
2 chances of coming out of this.

638
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:15,518
- A poor one and a slim one.
- Yes, Craig.

639
01:12:15,693 --> 01:12:18,809
From the beginning your boundless
enthusiam has been an inspiration.

640
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:23,015
But I'm getting rather weary of
being the cross that you've to bear.

641
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:24,982
Don't flatter yourself, Colonel.

642
01:12:25,276 --> 01:12:27,728
I've trunks full of crosses to bear.

643
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,024
Feeling better, Major?

644
01:12:36,357 --> 01:12:38,015
We leave in 10 minutes.

645
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:15,103
Head hunters!

646
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,894
Field police.

647
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:37,130
Is that necessary, Lieutenant?

648
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:38,760
I hope not, Herr Oberleutnant.

649
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:44,720
Sorry mate... orders!

650
01:14:55,384 --> 01:14:57,670
Keep pace with them... 50 yards back.

651
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:23,912
Colonel, this road takes us through
Tobruk and then it branches.

652
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:28,241
To the right is the prison compound,
to the left is Mersa Cove.

653
01:17:27,533 --> 01:17:28,575
Well...

654
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:31,320
You're an officer, clear the way.

655
01:17:32,867 --> 01:17:33,908
Move away!

656
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:35,367
Move away!

657
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:45,395
Congratulation!

658
01:17:58,864 --> 01:18:01,020
Their radio towers behind us.

659
01:18:42,442 --> 01:18:45,854
Colonel, I think I'd like to put
in for a transfer.

660
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,931
Half the Africa Corps.

661
01:19:01,107 --> 01:19:04,270
- The foxes done it again.
- While the British lion slept.

662
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,166
Gentlemen, the importance
of our mission is

663
01:19:06,192 --> 01:19:07,664
even graver than staff realised.

664
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:09,639
That's doesn't solved the
problem, Colonel.

665
01:19:09,814 --> 01:19:11,970
Our men are going to land
expecting light opposition

666
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:14,636
and they're gonna run into
Rommel's total reserve strength.

667
01:19:15,314 --> 01:19:17,636
They must be stopped.
We've to take that transmitter.

668
01:19:17,813 --> 01:19:20,728
And alert Jerry, for all we know staff
may have scrubbed the mission already.

669
01:19:20,896 --> 01:19:22,519
- So, we just sit back and wait.
- Exactly!

670
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:25,431
If it has been cancel,
we won't have given ourselves away.

671
01:19:26,062 --> 01:19:28,729
What can a handful of men do
against 2 full divisions?

672
01:19:28,937 --> 01:19:30,430
We can try, Major.

673
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:34,635
If those tanks reach El Alamein,
the Germans have Egypt.

674
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:37,471
They may have the lock,
but we have the key.

675
01:19:37,644 --> 01:19:39,303
Without fuel, Jerry goes nowhere!

676
01:19:42,519 --> 01:19:44,390
You don't look too well, Major.

677
01:19:46,685 --> 01:19:48,391
Not surprised to hear it.

678
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,928
We'll have to have a word
with the admiralty about this.

679
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:17,672
I thought Tobruk
was the name of a blockade.

680
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:19,922
Someone forgot to tell the Germans.

681
01:20:28,472 --> 01:20:29,964
There's our objective.

682
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:33,049
Rommel's underground fuel dumps.

683
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,847
Easy to see why aircraft
had such little effect.

684
01:22:48,498 --> 01:22:50,369
We've located the
communications cable.

685
01:22:50,395 --> 01:22:52,351
The bunker can be cut off
from the city anytime.

686
01:23:04,163 --> 01:23:05,572
While we go for the guns,

687
01:23:05,788 --> 01:23:08,572
two detachments
will take out those pillboxes.

688
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:20,785
Right on schedule.

689
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:23,827
Right into a meat grinder.

690
01:23:30,077 --> 01:23:31,948
- Boyden, the air raid's your cover.
- Sir.

691
01:23:32,202 --> 01:23:34,571
Take what men you need
and go for the Jerry's transmitter.

692
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:38,358
Send an open signal to Cairo. Cancel
landing, repeat... cancel landing.

693
01:23:38,535 --> 01:23:40,046
And advise staff of the
Kesselring paper.

694
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:40,596
Yes, sir.

695
01:23:40,742 --> 01:23:42,021
Colonel Harker.

696
01:23:42,409 --> 01:23:45,111
If Lieutenant Boyden should be
stopped, he doesn't speak German.

697
01:23:45,326 --> 01:23:48,109
- Volunteering, Mohnfeld?
- It would improve his chances, sir.

698
01:24:11,073 --> 01:24:14,438
To the air raid shelter.
Stretchers. Make room.

699
01:24:15,113 --> 01:24:16,736
Make way!

700
01:24:18,363 --> 01:24:20,603
Come on, move... come!

701
01:24:54,018 --> 01:24:55,359
Well done.

702
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:07,727
Harry, are you all right?

703
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,103
Oh yeah, I'm lovely.
Let's do it again.

704
01:25:10,274 --> 01:25:11,932
That's more like it, my boy. Come on!

705
01:25:17,816 --> 01:25:18,856
Sir...

706
01:25:21,398 --> 01:25:22,440
Sir...

707
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:25,893
He's dead.

708
01:25:30,855 --> 01:25:34,387
Hurry up, it will be all over
us in a minute. Lift him up.

709
01:25:34,855 --> 01:25:36,052
Pry open the door.

710
01:25:41,396 --> 01:25:42,805
- Got him?
- Yes.

711
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:46,811
Quick, in here!

712
01:25:47,062 --> 01:25:50,806
Quick. Take cover.

713
01:25:50,978 --> 01:25:53,052
Everyone, come on, quickly!

714
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:57,061
Leave him.

715
01:25:57,186 --> 01:25:58,180
They have succesfully hit
headquarters.

716
01:25:58,352 --> 01:26:01,552
Stretchers.

717
01:26:02,394 --> 01:26:04,099
Cor, that was a whisker away.

718
01:26:04,268 --> 01:26:06,757
- What do we do now, Alfie?
- Good question, mate.

719
01:26:06,935 --> 01:26:09,055
First of all,
unload these Jerry uniforms.

720
01:26:09,226 --> 01:26:11,975
My mama didnt bring me up
to be shot as a bloody spy.

721
01:26:13,184 --> 01:26:14,225
Dear God!

722
01:26:15,017 --> 01:26:16,059
What's the matter, you hurt?

723
01:26:16,225 --> 01:26:19,093
I'm dead and gone to heaven,
tell her. Look in there!

724
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:25,849
Here look, English pound notes.
Millions of them!

725
01:26:26,016 --> 01:26:27,971
British paymaster wrappers, Alfie.

726
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,381
The Jerries must've grabbed it
when they took Tobruk from our boys.

727
01:26:30,558 --> 01:26:32,263
Well, we better grab it back then.

728
01:26:37,682 --> 01:26:39,940
Here now, wait a minute.
You've got it wrong.

729
01:26:39,966 --> 01:26:41,830
We weren't going to nick this money--

730
01:26:52,263 --> 01:26:54,005
We're up next, Major.

731
01:27:11,303 --> 01:27:14,052
It's 21:30.
Do you think Boyden got through?

732
01:27:25,884 --> 01:27:27,163
We're under attack!

733
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,546
Quickly, to your posts!

734
01:27:30,342 --> 01:27:33,175
Landing is still on,
the buzzers are coming in.

735
01:27:33,342 --> 01:27:35,000
- Sergeant Tyne.
- Sir!

736
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:37,082
Take the half-track and four men
up the approach road.

737
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,623
Use the oil's lamp
to turn those barges back.

738
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,127
Keep flashing as long as
you can, Jack.

739
01:27:41,341 --> 01:27:43,747
- It's our last chance.
- Sir.

740
01:29:25,954 --> 01:29:27,826
- Come in, come in?
- What's happening?

741
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:30,236
- The line is dead.
- Try again.

742
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:31,496
It's not working.

743
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:45,952
Satchel charge.

744
01:29:50,494 --> 01:29:52,697
- What's happening here?
- Outside!

745
01:30:26,698 --> 01:30:27,739
- Flare pistol.
- Sir.

746
01:30:55,736 --> 01:30:57,015
Good try, sir.

747
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:01,401
- Seems to lost the old magic wand.
- Regroup now.

748
01:31:13,442 --> 01:31:14,721
Heil Hitler!

749
01:31:29,566 --> 01:31:31,272
- Colonel Harker.
- Craig.

750
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,308
- They're coming in.
- Get down to the beach!

751
01:31:34,482 --> 01:31:36,302
They're gonna need all
the help they can get.

752
01:31:36,328 --> 01:31:36,960
Take cover!

753
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:01,521
Jerries!

754
01:32:07,311 --> 01:32:09,219
Half-track! Open fire!

755
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:30,010
Get the bastards.

756
01:32:44,307 --> 01:32:45,421
They're turning back.

757
01:32:45,849 --> 01:32:48,800
- The Sergeant Major got through.
- Thank God.

758
01:32:55,806 --> 01:32:57,050
Take cover under the cliffs!

759
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:17,339
Bloody tanks!

760
01:33:18,179 --> 01:33:20,418
They would have
chopped our barges to pieces.

761
01:33:28,387 --> 01:33:30,258
Take a look!

762
01:33:46,676 --> 01:33:49,424
We're just not going anywhere
with those damn tanks out there.

763
01:33:49,925 --> 01:33:52,592
They've pinned us here
until their infantry moves in.

764
01:34:10,882 --> 01:34:12,422
I think I can get up there, Colonel.

765
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:22,044
Still determined to be a martyr,
aren't you?

766
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:24,245
I never did believe
we'd get through this so long.

767
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:29,540
Besides, German hospitality
does not appeal to me.

768
01:34:31,296 --> 01:34:32,435
You pull those tanks...

769
01:34:32,438 --> 01:34:34,686
and I'll give you the fuel bunkers
as a going-away present.

770
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:36,959
Best job I've had all day.

771
01:34:37,837 --> 01:34:38,879
Krug.

772
01:34:39,379 --> 01:34:40,575
I'll take three men.

773
01:34:40,754 --> 01:34:42,743
The rest of you stay here
with Major Craig.

774
01:34:46,211 --> 01:34:47,253
Shalom!

775
01:34:49,169 --> 01:34:50,413
Shalom, Captain.

776
01:34:54,085 --> 01:34:55,791
I wish you luck, Bergman.

777
01:34:56,585 --> 01:34:57,627
I mean it.

778
01:34:59,168 --> 01:35:01,158
We're both going to need it, Colonel.

779
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:04,494
But don't steal any from mine.

780
01:35:06,751 --> 01:35:07,994
I'm going back up!

781
01:35:10,083 --> 01:35:11,161
Mazeltov.

782
01:35:46,037 --> 01:35:47,079
Look!

783
01:35:48,662 --> 01:35:49,704
They're coming down!

784
01:37:09,362 --> 01:37:11,234
Watch out. Cover the rear!

785
01:37:45,024 --> 01:37:47,098
All right lads, at the double!

786
01:39:13,432 --> 01:39:15,836
- We gotta take that tank.
- My pleasure.

787
01:39:16,056 --> 01:39:18,260
No, let me have that.

788
01:39:22,514 --> 01:39:24,670
Need that tank operational.

789
01:39:25,055 --> 01:39:26,097
Field knife.

790
01:40:12,633 --> 01:40:14,790
- Grenade!
- Get out, get out!

791
01:40:46,088 --> 01:40:47,249
Dig in!

792
01:41:23,417 --> 01:41:25,952
Hard left, Sergeant! Take her through!

793
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:45,447
- 88 on the left.
- Lieutenant.

794
01:41:45,665 --> 01:41:46,707
Ready.

795
01:41:52,997 --> 01:41:54,039
Ready.

796
01:42:20,119 --> 01:42:21,861
Hub station, off to the right.

797
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,944
They're at an impasse.

798
01:43:25,779 --> 01:43:28,562
We'll hit the top level first.
Then work our way down.

799
01:44:37,063 --> 01:44:40,428
Get us out of here, Sergeant,
before we blow up with it!

800
01:45:29,848 --> 01:45:31,471
Good lord!

801
01:45:34,765 --> 01:45:36,422
They have blown the reserve.

802
01:45:37,306 --> 01:45:38,680
With any luck...

803
01:45:39,139 --> 01:45:42,007
We've seen the end of
Rommel's push to the Suez.

804
01:45:43,389 --> 01:45:44,715
Colonel Harker.

805
01:45:45,263 --> 01:45:49,091
Your continued resistance will
only result in a futile loss of lives.

806
01:45:49,805 --> 01:45:51,345
I ask you to surrender.

807
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,468
He knows your name, sir.

808
01:45:55,804 --> 01:45:57,427
And our situation.

809
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:02,007
We've done what we set out to do.

810
01:46:28,884 --> 01:46:29,996
Hands up.

811
01:46:30,425 --> 01:46:32,083
Come on, quick.

812
01:46:35,425 --> 01:46:38,292
Nobody move.

813
01:46:38,466 --> 01:46:41,416
Whoever moves, dies.

814
01:47:01,963 --> 01:47:03,421
My compliments, Colonel.

815
01:47:04,255 --> 01:47:06,167
I have your assurance
that our wounded..

816
01:47:06,193 --> 01:47:07,810
...will receive prompt medical care?

817
01:47:08,587 --> 01:47:10,210
The best we can provide.

818
01:47:11,754 --> 01:47:14,752
As soon as you surrender the
Kesselring document, Colonel Harker.

819
01:47:20,128 --> 01:47:21,170
Mohnfeld.

820
01:47:21,586 --> 01:47:23,293
The name is Von Kroeger.

821
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:24,710
Von Kroeger,

822
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:27,248
need I remind you of protocol?

823
01:47:28,252 --> 01:47:30,077
This is an intelligence matter.

824
01:47:30,835 --> 01:47:32,114
And it wasn't Bruckner.

825
01:47:32,377 --> 01:47:36,073
What I told you was the truth,
with one slight alteration.

826
01:47:36,501 --> 01:47:38,575
That you found me in the tunnel.

827
01:47:39,626 --> 01:47:40,704
The paper please.

828
01:47:41,543 --> 01:47:45,203
As soldiers,
we have few saving graces.

829
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:50,498
Perhaps our willingness
to die for what we believe...

830
01:47:51,166 --> 01:47:52,409
is all that matters.
