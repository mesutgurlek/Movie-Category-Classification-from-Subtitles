00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,878
<i>To each of them
Russia has probably allocated</i>

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,748
<i>a certain number of her
intermediate-range nuclear missiles,</i>

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,159
<i>which are at this moment</i>

5
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,677
<i>pointing at military objectives
in Western Europe.</i>

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,637
<i>And to each of these locations,</i>

7
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,676
<i>being those 25 key cities</i>

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,276
<i>in which reside almost one third
of the entire population of Britain,</i>

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,112
<i>Russia has probably allocated</i>

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,751
<i>a further unknown quantity
of thermo-nuclear missiles.</i>

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,637
<i>Each of these cities
and each of these airfields</i>

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,756
<i>combine to crowd into Britain</i>

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,628
<i>more potential nuclear targets
per acre of land mass</i>

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,473
<i>than in any other country
in the world.</i>

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,192
<i>London,
Friday the 16th of September.</i>

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,033
<i>It's just been confirmed
that late last night,</i>

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,156
<i>to show collective Communist support</i>

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,754
<i>for the Chinese invasion
of South Vietnam,</i>

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,717
<i>the Russian and East German
authorities</i>

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,837
<i>have sealed off all access
to the city of Berlin</i>

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,069
<i>and have stated their intention</i>

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,233
<i>of occupying the western half
of the city within 48 hours</i>

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,676
<i>unless the Americans in Vietnam
withdraw yesterday's decision</i>

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,958
<i>to use tactical nuclear weapons
against invading Chinese forces.</i>

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,393
<i>Here in Britain,</i>

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,950
<i>Her Majesty's Government has declared
a state of national emergency</i>

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,112
<i>to last the duration
of the present crisis.</i>

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,830
<i>As from 12 noon today, the central
government will cease to function</i>

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,672
<i>and the administration of the country</i>

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,116
<i>will be handled
by 15 regional commissioners.</i>

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,478
<i>A network of emergency committees
consisting of local councillors</i>

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,111
<i>is being set up in every major town
and county borough in the country.</i>

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,351
<i>In view of the seriousness
of the international situation,</i>

34
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,078
<i>Her Majesty's Government has decided</i>

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,833
<i>that the first task
of these emergency committees</i>

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,959
<i>will be to implement the evacuation
of a certain proportion of civilians</i>

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,555
<i>to safer areas in Wales,
the Lake District,</i>

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,756
<i>parts of Northumberland,

<i>southwest England, Dorset,</i>

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,030
<i>East Sussex and Kent.</i>

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,954
<i>In accordance with the 1962
Government plan for evacuation,</i>

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,473
<i>this dispersal is to apply</i>

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,394
<i>only to certain
specified classes of civilians.</i>

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,311
As from 0900 tomorrow,

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,075
we are to receive a total quota
of 60,000 evacuees

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,594
in five priority classes.

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,468
Class one: Children under 15
travelling with mothers.

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,711
Class two: Schoolchildren
under the age of 18.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,997
Class three: Adolescents
under the age of 18.

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,310
Class four: Expectant mothers.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,393
Class five: People who are blind,
crippled, aged or infirm. We...

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,711
- Are there any fathers?
- No. No fathers.

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,629
<i>This woman is arriving
from Bermondsey into Kent.</i>

54
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,678
<i>She and the other women
on this evacuation bus</i>

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>have had to leave their husbands
and elder sons behind in London.</i>

56
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,713
<i>According to the last published
government plan,</i>

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,315
<i>there is no provision made for
granting the facilities of evacuation</i>

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,439
<i>to able-bodied men
over the age of 18.</i>

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,432
<i>It is, therefore,
even at this early point</i>

60
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,513
<i>that an attempt at mass evacuation
might fail,</i>

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,716
<i>because it's not known
how many women</i>

62
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,395
<i>would refuse to leave
their husband and their home,:</i>

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,155
<i>To journey with restricted
possessions to an unknown town,</i>

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,279
<i>there to be compulsorily billeted
with an unknown family.</i>

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,517
Prepare yourself to receive...
Five rooms, that's ten evacuees,

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,670
arriving from the London area
tomorrow morning.

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,320
- What am I gonna feed them on?
- It's up to you, madam.

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,355
Are they coloured?

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,238
More haste, less speed.

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,552
<i>Within a country where there is still
racial and social prejudice,</i>

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,394
<i>where there is still a shortage
of housing and living space,</i>

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,552
<i>a number of measures
would almost certainly be necessary</i>

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,350
<i>in attempting the evacuation
of an estimated 10 million people.</i>

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,839
Er, right, eight evacuees...

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,196
<i>For this woman, the compulsory
sheltering and feeding</i>

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,430
<i>of an extra eight people.</i>

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,192
Quickly. All in, quickly.

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,908
<i>For the family
who have fled this house,</i>

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,639
<i>the immediate requisition
of their home.</i>

80
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,192
<i>For this man, perhaps imprisonment
if he refuses to billet.</i>

81
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,748
- Eight evacuees for you.
- Eight? I'm not havin' eight.

82
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,114
Sorry, sir, you've got to take eight.

83
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,760
I don't mind two. I haven't got
enough food in there for eight.

84
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,114
Don't argue. Don't argue.

85
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,158
May I remind you that,
under the emergency regulations,

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,596
with four rooms and a kitchen you can
be forced to take eight people.

87
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,511
Bloody hell.

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,238
<i>Should Britain ever thus attempt</i>

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,552
<i>the evacuation of nearly 20 per cent
of her entire population,</i>

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,599
<i>such scenes as these
would be almost inevitable.</i>

91
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,631
<i>All citizens
resident within this area</i>

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,793
<i>are requested to proceed immediately
to the municipal offices</i>

93
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,953
<i>to collect emergency identification
papers and ration cards.</i>

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,995
Name?

95
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,958
Sue Wilkinson, 159 Thornton Avenue.

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,589
Er, widow...
children aged 19 and 21.

97
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,238
Non-supplementary ration card.

98
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,073
This entitles you to a basic ration
per week of two ounces of butter,

99
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,718
a half a pound of margarine,

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,597
two ounces of tea,
a quarter-pound of sugar,

101
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,035
two eggs,
a half a pint of milk when available,

102
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,156
a quarter-pound of meat,
two loaves of bread,

103
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,358
a pound of potatoes when available
and two ounces of bacon.

104
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,477
<i>It has been estimated that,
even if there were no war,</i>

105
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,156
<i>Britain would need from 11/2 to 4 years
to recover economically</i>

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,915
<i>from the effects of full-scale
civilian evacuation.</i>

107
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,675
<i>And, if there were a war,</i>

108
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,595
<i>at least 20 per cent of the areas
into which people had been evacuated</i>

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,831
<i>would themselves be rendered
totally uninhabitable</i>

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,275
<i>by the resulting radioactive fallout.</i>

111
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,278
Carbon-14 is among the most dangerous
elements of radioactive fallout.

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,794
Do you know what it does
to the human body?

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,599
Ooh... No, I'm sorry,
I haven't heard of it.

114
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,275
Afraid I don't know much
about atomic... radiation at all.

115
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,634
No, I don't.

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,631
No, I'm sorry, I don't know.

117
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,154
Do you know what strontium-90 is
and what it does?

118
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,958
Erm...

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,872
No. No, I'm afraid I don't.

120
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,234
No, I don't.

121
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,880
I've... no idea really. I...

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,192
I know it's some sort of... gunpowder
or something, that blows up.

123
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,393
<i>In Berlin,
with rioting West German civilians</i>

124
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,869
<i>and armed East German police,</i>

125
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,871
<i>there would probably be found</i>

126
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,235
<i>the necessary flash point.</i>

127
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,789
Berlin?

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,269
Nah, they've had all this before.

129
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,316
I think it'll die down.

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,951
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

131
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,637
No, there won't be a war.
I'm quite convinced of that.

We're issuing to as many householders

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,359
which tells them how to prepare their
houses against blast and fallout.

143
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,351
Have people not seen
this booklet before?

144
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,069
Well, a copy was prepared some years
ago but... it didn't sell very well.

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,391
- It wasn't... It wasn't free?
- Oh, no, no. It cost ninepence.

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,155
<i>And, should the attacking missiles
be launched from submarines</i>

153
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,993
<i>lying off the shores of Britain,</i>

154
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,152
<i>the warning time
could be less than 30 seconds.</i>

155
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,992
Move along, there.

156
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,072
Civil Defence have said
that we've... got to get, er...

157
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,957
stuff to...

158
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,635
shore up our windows and, er,
barricade ourselves in with.

159
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,597
They didn't tell us where to get it.

160
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,514
I've been around three places already
and they've... all the stuff's gone.

161
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,589
And the prices...

162
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,035
My prices at the moment
run as follows:

163
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,157
Hessian sacks for sandbags,
ten for one pound;

164
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,277
sand to put in them,
24 shillings per cubic yard;

165
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,670
soil, seven pounds ten
per five cubic yards;

166
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,718
deal planks,
eightpence to a shilling per foot.

167
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,430
How much money have you to...
spend on building your refuge?

168
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,988
Well...

169
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,108
Well, I can't afford more than...
17/6 to a pound at the very most.

170
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,474
<i>For this amount of money,</i>

171
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,394
<i>she may purchase
eight sandbags and six planks.</i>

172
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,391
Friend of mine's
a building contractor

173
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,199
and he's fixed me up with some stuff.

174
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,750
I've got this out here,
which should help a bit.

175
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,195
And inside I've...

176
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,317
I've built a... refuge like they say.

177
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,277
I reckon it should be pretty strong,

178
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,396
hold up quite well.

179
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,270
And I had a few sandbags left over
so... I built another in the garden.

180
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,432
<i>It is likely that many thousands
of families in Britain</i>

181
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,399
<i>would be unable to meet the cost
of even one substantial shelter</i>

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,950
<i>and a Government shelter programme
for every person in the country</i>

183
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,352
<i>would cost an estimated
two thousand million pounds.</i>

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,639
And I keep this... here.

185
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,750
And I certainly intend to use it

186
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,308
if anyone attempts
to break into the shelter with me.

187
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,713
A recent American religious journal
told its Christian readers

188
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,395
to think twice before they rashly
gave their family shelter space

189
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,914
to neighbours or passing strangers.

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,436
<i>September the 18th.</i>

191
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,195
<i>One hour ago, following
an armed entry into West Berlin</i>

192
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,872
<i>by Russian and East German troops,</i>

193
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,078
<i>two NATO armoured divisions attempted
to force an entry through to the city</i>

194
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,233
<i>and were themselves overrun
by outnumbering Communist forces.</i>

195
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,719
<i>Faced with this situation,</i>

196
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,315
<i>it is possible that the American
president would have no choice</i>

197
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,712
<i>but to threaten to release tactical
nuclear warheads to NATO forces</i>

198
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,075
<i>to show collective determination</i>

199
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,958
<i>in the event of
a possible Russian attack.</i>

200
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,473
<i>Faced with this situation,</i>

201
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,633
<i>the Soviet premier would possibly
be left with no alternative</i>

202
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,234
<i>but to call this bluff and attack.</i>

203
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,436
Local area commander

204
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,717
has authorised the release
of tactical nuclear weapons

205
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,678
to the British, French
and Bundeswehr.

206
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,435
Fifteen crew up
for a fast sequence of firing.

207
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,913
<i>This is a tactical nuclear missile.</i>

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,834
<i>It has a warhead
equivalent to one Hiroshima bomb.</i>

209
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,195
<i>It is called an Honest John.</i>

210
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,714
The Honest John,
the Mace, the Corporal,

211
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,358
the Pershing, the Sergeant,

212
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,793
and if things don't get better soon

213
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,156
all these weapons will be
slamming away nuclear warheads

214
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,719
and then God help us all!

215
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,635
<i>It is now planned to increase
NATO reliability on nuclear missiles,</i>

216
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,395
<i>even should the Russians attack
using ordinary weapons.</i>

217
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,995
<i>Thus it is possible for the Allies
to be the first to press the button</i>

218
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,036
<i>in a nuclear war.</i>

219
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,874
- Did you know this?
- No, I did not.

220
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,518
I was vaguely aware of it, yes.

221
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,795
Yes, and I think it's disgraceful.

222
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,552
No, I didn't know this at all.

223
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,232
No. I should think
it'd be a good thing.

224
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,557
<i>David Edward Thornley.</i>

225
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,631
<i>Age: 37.</i>

226
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,029
<i>General practitioner in medicine,</i>

227
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,079
<i>now on the staff of one of a series
of emergency medical-aid units</i>

228

<i>Time: 9:11 a.m.</i>

230

<i>September the 18th.</i>

231
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,150
<i>Doctor Thornley stops

232
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,754
<i>Berwick Street, Canterbury,</i>

233
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,913
<i>twelve miles from the airfield
at Manston on the Kent coast.</i>

234
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,553
- Oh, good morning, Doctor.
- Morning!

235
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,073
- Come in, please.
- What's the trouble today?

236
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,991
She's been running
a temperature all night.

237
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,278
<i>Of the 750 intermediate-range

<i>at present held by the Russians</i>

239
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,949
<i>and targeted on the European
countries of the NATO alliance,</i>

240
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,715
<i>it is believed that a considerable
number are liquid-fuelled</i>

<i>and are stored above ground.</i>

242
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,276
<i>Such missiles are therefore
themselves extremely vulnerable</i>

243
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,478
<i>and, rather than risk losing them
in a counter-bombardment,</i>

244
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,836
<i>it is likely that the Russians
would have no alternative</i>

245
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,869
<i>but to fire all of them at a very
early stage in such a crisis.</i>

246
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,069
<i>Time: 9:13 a.m.</i>

- Quick, let's get back!
- There's no time!

248
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,556
Hurry up! Inside the house! Quickly!

<i>At this distance,</i>

Pulled his jacket...
right over his head!

304
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,150
I believe that we live in a system
of necessary law and order.

305
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,356
And I still believe
in the war of the just.

306
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,757
<i>Within this car,
a family is burning alive.</i>

307
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,873
Get them out of that car!

308
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,997
<i>Charles Brooks,
chief fire officer of Chatham.</i>

309
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,674
<i>Already three of his appliances
have been smashed,</i>

310
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,796
<i>gutted or overturned.</i>

311
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,193
<i>Already 17 of his 60 firemen have
been crushed, burnt or killed</i>

312
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,918
<i>by flying debris.</i>

313
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,148
<i>This is a firestorm.</i>

314
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,195
<i>Within its centre,</i>

315
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,876
<i>the oxygen is being consumed in every
cellar and every ground-floor room,</i>

316
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,750
<i>to be replaced by the gases of carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane.</i>

317
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,753
<i>Within its centre, the temperature
is rising to 800 degrees centigrade.</i>

318
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,354
<i>These men are dying,</i>

319
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,034
<i>both of heatstroke and of gassing.</i>

320
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,279
In the next world war,
I believe that both sides could stop

321
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,476
before the ultimate destruction
of cities

322
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,357
so that both sides could retire

323
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,433
for a period of ten years or so
of post-attack recuperation,

324
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,910
in which world wars four to eight
could be prepared.

325
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,349
<i>When the carbon-dioxide content
of inhaled air</i>

326
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,749
<i>is greater than 30 per cent,</i>

327
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,799
<i>it will cause diminished respiration,</i>

328
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,110
<i>fall of blood pressure,</i>

329
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,633
<i>coma,</i>

330
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,359
<i>loss of reflexes</i>

331
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,351
<i>and anaesthesia.</i>

332
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:20,233
<i>When the carbon-monoxide content
of inhaled air exceeds 1.28 per cent,</i>

333
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,073
<i>it will be followed by death</i>

334
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,993
<i>within three minutes.</i>

335
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,435
<i>This is nuclear war.</i>

336
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,791
<i>10:47.</i>

337
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,351
<i>Aircraft of the British V-bomber
force near the Russian border.</i>

338
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,193
<i>Their purpose: Retaliation.</i>

339
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,955
<i>Their target: People like this.</i>

340
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,195
If the Russians or anyone else
attacked Britain with nuclear weapons

341
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,679
would you want us to retaliate

342
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,309
by destroying an equal number
of Russian cities?

343
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,516
Yes. Yes, I would. Yes.

344
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,309
It's just a vicious circle. But I
suppose we should have to retaliate.

345
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,916
People think the British are always
sort of... forgiving and forgetting

346
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,195
and... I think
we'd have to retaliate.

347
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,870
I wouldn't want... want us
to stand back and do nothing about it

348
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,313
but...

349
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,992
Yes, I... I think perhaps, er...
perhaps I would.

350
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,036
Oh, yes, I think so, definitely.

351
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,838
Yes, I suppose I would.

352
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,873
Technically and intellectually,

353
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,111
we are living in an atomic age.

354
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,876
Emotionally, we are still living
in the Stone Age.

355
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,353
The Aztecs on their feast days would
sacrifice 20,000 men to their gods

356
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,592
in the belief that this would keep
the universe on its proper course.

357
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,240
We feel superior to them.

358
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,029
<i>These are the inhabitants
of what was once</i>

359
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,113
<i>a housing estate
near Rochester in Kent.</i>

360
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,749
<i>Following the explosion
of three single-megaton missiles</i>

361
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,354
<i>within this one county boundary,</i>

362
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,716
<i>it's been estimated
that each surviving doctor</i>

363
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,510
<i>would be faced by
at least 350 casualties,</i>

364
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,912
<i>many suffering from severe
second- and third-degree burns.</i>

365
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,275
I had a little boy with me.

366
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,035
He had his legs burned off.

367
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,873
Some...

368
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,592
Some of the...

369
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,916
Some of these people
are just falling apart.

370
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,793
<i>As far as is known, it is at present
planned by the Civil Defence</i>

371
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,429
<i>that each doctor, working
in a forward medical-aid unit,</i>

372
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,389
<i>place every casualty into one
of three carefully defined categories</i>

373
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,032
<i>to determine whether or not that
casualty is worth hospital treatment.</i>

374
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,395
It's the third category
that are worst.

375
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,550
For these...

376
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,552
...it's just hopeless.

377
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,200
So we put them into
what we call the holding section.

378
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,558
<i>These are people with...
50 per cent or more body burns.</i>

379
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,432
<i>He knows that each patient
he places in the holding section</i>

380
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,956
<i>will be left to die in pain
without drugs.</i>

381
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,831
I know what'll be happening
in a few days.

382
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,076
They'll be...

383
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,915
They'll be asking me to kill them.

384
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,431
<i>What you are seeing now is
another possible part of nuclear war.</i>

385
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,115
<i>An armed police squad
helping the overburdened doctors</i>

386
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,988
<i>to relieve the misery
of those in category three.</i>

387
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,757
If I decide to hit,
and perhaps kill, another man myself,

388
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,311
then I must be prepared to accept
the moral responsibility.

389
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,351
If I give the Government
the right or the means

390
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,396
on my behalf

391
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,790
to kill people of another country,

392
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,235
then the situation is no different.

393
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,791
<i>I must again myself accept
the moral responsibility.</i>

394
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,318
<i>It's been estimated
that a nuclear attack on Britain,</i>

395
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,359
<i>using approximately 160
single-megaton missiles,</i>

396
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,749
<i>would immediately kill
or seriously wound</i>

397
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,072
<i>between one third and one half
of her entire population.</i>

398
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,799
<i>It would destroy
from 50 to 80 per cent</i>

399
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,236
<i>of all her main food production
and storage facilities</i>

400
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,996
<i>and from 50 to 80 per cent of
the power plants needed to run them.</i>

401
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,277
<i>Such an attack,
using weapons of one megaton,</i>

402
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,032
<i>could be described as minimal</i>

403
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,111
<i>because it's now more than possible</i>

404
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,192
<i>that missile warheads
or free-falling bombs</i>

405
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,831
<i>of between five to ten times
that power would be used instead.</i>

406
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,678
I think extra numbers would have made
no difference at all to all this.

407
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,793
15 or 20 times the number
of Civil Defence

408
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,316
wouldn't have stopped the initial
attack from killing or maiming

409
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,675
exactly the same number of people.

410
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,115
It was the title they had all wrong.

411
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,553
Call this defence?

412
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,669
<i>These will be the other casualties
of a nuclear war.</i>

413
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,557
<i>Physically unmarked,</i>

414
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,234
<i>there will almost inevitably be
thousands of people</i>

415
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,711
<i>suffering from many complex states
of fear and shock,</i>

416
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,109
<i>due to the things they've seen</i>

417
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,636
<i>and the things that have
happened to them.</i>

418
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,631
<i>Many of these people</i>

419
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,077
<i>will probably lapse into
a state of permanent neurosis</i>

420
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,754
<i>because they will totally outnumber</i>

421
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,799
<i>the psychiatric services
needed to cure them.</i>

422
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,908
<i>This, too, will be the legacy
of thermo-nuclear war.</i>

423
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,319
I've already had... a dozen or so
of my men go under.

424
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,749
Just... with the strain.

425
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,359
Overwork.

426
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,274
People tend to forget that...
a policeman...

427
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,874
a Civil Defence worker...

428
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,315
anybody... like this...

429
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,869
is just a... normal human being,

430
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,193
with... normal human reactions
and... emotions.

431
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,279
<i>This policeman has spent
the entire rescue period</i>

432
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,715
<i>searching for his missing family.</i>

433
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,508
No-one's allowed in here.

434
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,030
Go on. Clear off.

435
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,988
<i>Even in the lightly hit
county of Kent,</i>

436
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,638
<i>there would be immediately</i>

437
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,349
<i>an estimated 50,000 corpses
to dispose of.</i>

438
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,076
Will you tell us what... Will you
tell us what's going on in there?

439
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,912
They're not allowing
any photographers in there.

440
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,560
Yes, yes, I know,
but, er, just a minute...

441
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,235
Er, will you tell us what
they're doing in there, please?

442
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,153
They're simply burning the bodies.

443
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,835
The buildings are full of them.
There's just too many to bury.

444
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,795
The buildings are...

445
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,829
The buildings are full so all we can
do is put 'em on raised steel girders

446
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,229
and put a fire underneath.

447
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,276
It's just like making a grill.

448
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,832
<i>Two days after the attack,</i>

449
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,754
<i>the military authorities, to stop
the possible spreading of disease,</i>

450
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,675
<i>seal off two square miles of the
damaged area that had been Rochester</i>

451
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,875
<i>and arm the surviving police,</i>

452
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,430
<i>determined to prevent
by force if necessary</i>

453
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,513
<i>relatives of the dead removing bodies
before the process of burning.</i>

454
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,677
We were doing the, er, job,

455
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,069
burning the... bodies,

456
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,278
when two of the soldiers said
they weren't gonna do it any more.

457
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,716
One of their officers came up
and told them to get on with it

458
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,109
and they said no again

459
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,270
so he shot them both on the spot.

460
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,074
<i>Everything that you are now seeing</i>

461
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,711
<i>happened in Germany after
the heavy bombing in the last war.</i>

462
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,917
<i>It would almost certainly
have to happen in Britain</i>

463
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,560
<i>after a nuclear war.</i>

464
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,674
Another thing the Germans did
after the bombing on Dresden

465
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,880
was they... took the wedding rings
from the bodies.

466
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,877
They were trying to identify them
from the inscription inside the ring.

467
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,838
Er, we also are doing this.

468
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,869
We are keeping the rings
in this bucket here.

469
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,991
<i>This is a possible part
of nuclear war.</i>

470
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,356
<i>For the following 48 hours,</i>

471
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,513
<i>an estimated one third of
the entire land surface of Britain</i>

472
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,194
<i>would be covered
by a total dose of radiation</i>

473
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,990
<i>exceeding ten times the amount needed
to kill a man in the open.</i>

474
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,832
<i>For many of those within this area</i>

475
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,754
<i>who had remained even inside
the shelter of their homes,</i>

476
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,230
<i>there would be death
within five weeks.</i>

477
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,836
I... I know a thing or two about...
leu... leukaemia and... and suchlike.

478
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,670
I deliberately haven't spoken to my
wife about this in the last few days.

479
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,830
But, you know, I'm...

480
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,275
I... I'm so scared.

481
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,191
I... I just want my kids
to... to grow up, that's all.

482
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,872
I don't know what's gonna be
left of anything, or...

483
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,599
I... I can't change that now.

484
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,390
It's... Well, I...
I suppose I'm just being... selfish.

485
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,070
I just want my kids to be straight

486
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,436
and... and not to have this... poison
working in their bones.

487
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,950
The main effect of exposure
to severe radiation

488
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:55,639
is to stop the renewal of the, er,
cellular lining of your intestine,

489
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,793
with the result that your body fluids
flow straight out

490
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,270
from the raw inside of your intestine

491
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,636
and you literally... dry out.

492
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,473
This is the menu of a meal

493
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,711
prepared by the welfare section
of the Civil Defence Corps

494
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,079
during an exercise supposed to take
place after a thermo-nuclear attack.

495
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,628
"Braised steak, carrots, sprouts,

496
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,472
roast and mashed potatoes,

497
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,030
steamed pudding,
apple pie and custard."

498
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,670
After a nuclear attack
on the United States,

499
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,558
would Americans live
as they're accustomed to,

500
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,952
with automobiles, ranch houses,
television, freezers and so on?

501
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,871
No-one can say.

502
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,114
We've got a bathful of water that
hasn't been changed for five days.

503
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,794
It's all the water we've got.

504
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,235
We have to drink from it

505
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,629
and have to cook with it

506
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,233
and wash with it.

507
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,438
<i>At Hiroshima and Nagasaki,</i>

508
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,317
<i>the population three months later</i>

509
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,349
<i>was found to be apathetic
and profoundly lethargic,</i>

510
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,476
<i>people living often
in their own filth,</i>

511
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,074
<i>in total dejection and inertia.</i>

512
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,279
<i>This baby boy has been
bitten on the arm by a rat.</i>

513
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,193
<i>There are now no medicines available</i>

514
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,989
<i>to prevent the disease
which may well follow.</i>

515
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,236
I was carrying
a loaf of bread home today

516
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,548
from my mother,

517
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,473
who'd given it to me,

518
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,155
when a guy comes up
and offers me a pound for it.

519
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,236
Well, what could I say?

520
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,196
You can't eat a pound note.

521
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,837
<i>In the face of growing hunger riots,
it is very possible</i>

522
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,835
<i>that dwindling supplies of food would
finally be kept as a form of bonus,</i>

523
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,391
<i>for those who perform the precarious
maintenance of law and order.</i>

524
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,038
<i>The result of such partial feeding</i>

525
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,475
<i>would in itself be almost inevitable.</i>

526
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,873
Get off me!

527
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,395
<i>On this day, the first food rioter
is killed by the police in Kent.</i>

528
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,909
Tell them to go back.

529
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,274
One in the air.

530
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,159
<i>Two days later,</i>

531
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,071
<i>as a direct result of this incident,</i>

532
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,948
<i>a police ammunition truck
and its contents are seized</i>

533
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,634
<i>and its volunteer drivers murdered.</i>

534
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,150
String him up!

535
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,517
Get 'im!

536
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,551
In Germany during the last war,
it was noticed that,

537
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,996
with people who'd suffered
personal loss or deprivation,

538
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,356
even amongst the so-called
decent middle class,

539
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,513
there was a tendency to develop
indifference towards the law

540
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,558
and to indulge in looting,
black market and petty theft.

541
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,630
<i>This is a Government
Food Control Centre,</i>

542
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,111
<i>seized and pilfered
by armed anti-authority elements.</i>

543
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,909
<i>This is Mrs Joyce Fisher
from Gravesend.</i>

544
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,831
<i>She was a housewife.</i>

545
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,797
<i>Three yards from her,</i>

546
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,235
<i>the bodies of the military guard.</i>

547
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,957
When morale falls,
ideals fall and may go

548
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,079
and behaviour becomes more primitive,
more a thing of instinct.

549
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,631
<i>Three days later, the first policemen
in Kent are killed.</i>

550
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,069
<i>Within the next 15 years,</i>

551
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,553
<i>possibly another 12 countries will
have acquired thermo-nuclear weapons.</i>

552
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,959
<i>For this reason,</i>

553
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,795
<i>if not through accident
or the impulses of man himself...</i>

554
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,394
<i>- Hold it.
...it is now more than possible</i>

555
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,233
<i>that what you have seen happen
in this film</i>

556
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,677
<i>will have taken place
before the year 1980.</i>

557
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,312
On the authority
of the regional commissioner,

558
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,676
under article 17,
dealing with civil disturbances

559
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,673
and the prevention of Crown-appointed
officers from carrying out duties,

560
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,752
John Edward Jarrett
and William Michael Eades

561
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,479
are hereby sentenced to death
by firing squad.

562
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,596
May God have mercy on their souls.

563
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,511
Kneel,

564
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,592
and we will say
the Lord's Prayer together.

565
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,278
Our Father which art in heaven,

566
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,669
Hallowed be thy name.

567
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,352
Thy kingdom come.

568
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,476
Thy will be done on earth,

569
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,676
as it is in heaven.

570
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,991
Give us this day our daily bread.

571
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,469
And forgive us our trespasses,

572
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,711
as we forgive them
that trespass against us.

573
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,870
And lead us not into temptation,

574
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,916
but deliver us from evil.

575
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,353
Amen.

576
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,278
Father, have mercy on their souls,

577
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,794
for they know not what they do.

578
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,952
Take aim.

579
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,398
Fire.

580
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:58,311
For those who haven't had access
to orange juice, fresh vegetables,

581
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,393
vitamin C in general,
and that'll be most people,

582
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,793
haemorrhages around the gums will
set in at about the four-month stage

583
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,111
and then you're into
the initial stages of scurvy,

584
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,270
with swelling of the ankles

585
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,113
and bleeding into
the joints of your body.

586
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,115
<i>Stille Nacht</i>

587
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,113
<i>Heilige Nacht!</i>

588
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,509
<i>December the 25th.</i>

589
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,910
<i>A refugee compound in Dover, Kent,</i>

590
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,878
<i>four months after the attack.</i>

591
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:44,037
<i>Lieb' aus deinem gttlichen Mund</i>

592
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,470
<i>Due to radiation,
this little boy has only half</i>

593
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,632
<i>the requisite number
of red blood corpuscles.</i>

594
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,154
<i>He will be bedridden for seven years,</i>

595
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,958
<i>then he will die.</i>

596
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,838
<i>This happened at Hiroshima.</i>

597
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,556
<i>This girl is pregnant.</i>

598
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,632
<i>Because of her constant exposure
to radiation,</i>

599
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,077
<i>she has no idea whether or not
her baby will be born alive.</i>

600
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,878
The thing that terrifies me most
is the little ones.

601
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,071
If they've suffered badly
from the effects of...

602
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,029
of the sight of this horror
and... destruction...

603
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,635
it is probable that as a consequence

604
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,239
some of them may... suffer...
terrible character disorders.

605
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,876
One just doesn't know.

606
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,159
I saw one of the little boys
in the compound here yesterday.

607
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,153
He was bouncing around,

608
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,152
playing hopscotch I think,

609
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,913
and suddenly he sat down...

610
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,554
as though he were very tired...

611
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,276
and his face went listless...

612
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,518
like that of an old man.

613
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,509
<i>These children
are orphans of the attack.</i>

614
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,116
<i>They were each asked what they
now wanted to grow up to be.</i>

615
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,509
I don't want to be nothing.

616
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,431
Neither do I.

617
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,590
I don't want to be nothing.

618
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,513
Neither do I want to be nothing.

619
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,396
<i>On almost the entire subject
of thermo-nuclear weapons,</i>

620
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,914
<i>on the problems of their possession,</i>

621
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,639
<i>on the effects of their use,</i>

622
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,271
<i>there is now practically
a total silence in the press,</i>

623
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,590
<i>in official publications</i>

624
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,636
<i>and on television.</i>

625
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,032
<i>There is hope in any unresolved
and unpredictable situation.</i>

626
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,714
<i>But is there a real hope
to be found in this silence?</i>

627
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,396
<i>The world's stockpile
of thermo-nuclear weapons</i>

628
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,632
<i>has doubled
within the last five years</i>

629
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,748
<i>and now is the equivalent of almost
20 tons of high explosive</i>

630
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,755
<i>to every man, woman and child
on the planet.</i>

631
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,596
<i>This stockpile
is still steadily growing.</i>

632
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,636
<i>Heilige Nacht!</i>

633
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:04,152
<i>Gottes Sohn, o wie lacht</i>

634
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:13,070
<i>Lieb aus deinem gttlichen Mund</i>

635
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:22,749
<i>Da uns schlgt
die rettende Stund'</i>

636
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:32,192
<i>Christ in deiner Geburt</i>

637
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,718
<i>Christ in deiner Geburt!</i>

638
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,077
