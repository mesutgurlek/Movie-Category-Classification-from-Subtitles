1
00:02:04,744 --> 00:02:07,269
<i>on 10th July 1943,</i>

2
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:12,401
<i>The allied fleet bombarded Sicily</i>

3
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,127
<i>12 hours later</i>

4
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:24,410
<i>the allied landing in Europe had begun
under cover of the night</i>

5
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:40,216
<i>the first allied patrols began
to advance on Italian Territory</i>

6
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:16,762
Nicuzzo! Nicuzzo!

7
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:30,102
Your Comrades left this morning

8
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:38,970
Welcome, comrades! They didn’t
land, did they?

9
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,213
They're Americans.

10
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:46,650
If Americans land here, they'll
end up horizontal.

11
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:17,932
My son was at Licata He's a soldier.

12
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:22,638
You haven’t hurt him have you?

13
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:34,806
We won't hurt you, but tell us...

14
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,228
what's happened here?

15
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,369
Are you Italian Like us?

16
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,350
My father is Sicilian, born in Gela.

17
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,660
Gela? I'm from Gela too.

18
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:55,263
It's been awful,
so much bombing.

19
00:05:55,263 --> 00:06:00,186
The Germans left this morning,
-We're here because of the wake.

20
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,346
We can't even lay my daughter in law,

21
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,567
to rest in peace.

22
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:14,468
How many Germans were here?

23
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:16,464
Your name?

24
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:17,546
- Tony Mascali.

25
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:20,973
My father left Gela
and went to America.

26
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:22,512
He's lying.

27
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:26,410
There aren't any Mascalis in Gela.

28
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,589
When did the Germans go?

29
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,608
How many were there?

30
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,953
Many three thousand.

31
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,641
- 30,000!
- 30 million!

32
00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:03,497
They went north, towards Scopins maybe.

33
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:13,881
Mines on the coast. The only
safe way is over the lava.

34
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:19,620
Carmella’s been that way,
looking for her folks.

35
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:36,320
Carmela, these Americans want to
talk to you.

36
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:39,341
You know the way over the lava?

37
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:41,653
I often go that way.

38
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:43,680
Is it a path or a road?

39
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,661
It's lava.

40
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:47,614
Can someone in your family lead us?

41
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:53,172
No. My brother and my father
have been away four days.

42
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:55,618
I wanted to rejoin them

43
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,031
I know the way, I'll lead you.

44
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,462
You can't go with these strangers.

45
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:16,597
You really want to come with us?

46
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,483
Why did you try to escape??

47
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:21,310
I didn’t come here for you.

48
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,504
I'm going to look for my
brother and father.

49
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:13,113
Well done Carmela, don't worry
about your folks.

50
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:17,500
If we find them, we'll
bring them back.

51
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,139
You stay here.
Handsome Joe will keep you company

52
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,484
Can't I go back to the church?

53
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:28,972
We'll all go back there later.

54
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:29,939
No light!

55
00:13:56,685 --> 00:14:01,133
The sea, my father and brother went out to sea.

56
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:09,343
The sea's calm, maybe they're held up
by the fighting.

57
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:10,890
I'll look for them...

58
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:25,591
You're all alike. You. Germans
Fascists, men with guns.

59
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:57,834
You said come?

60
00:16:59,068 --> 00:16:59,938
Come?

61
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,388
The same in American?

62
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:28,227
Milk. Uncle Luca had cows.

63
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:30,758
He put 7 children on one.

64
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:31,207
- Why Shoot?
- I saw a light.

65
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:35,413
People are so scared,
they're imagining things.

66
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:38,621
I did see a light.

67
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:51,897
It must have been over there.

68
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:17,454
What a romantic spot.

69
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:30,366
Just the place we need.

70
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:32,561
There's even straw to lie on.

71
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,672
Let’s set up HQ here.

72
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:43,462
Just the place to break your neck.

73
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:01,311
Who are you?

74
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:02,897
Why leave the village?

75
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,468
I was afraid.

76
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,911
We've found a girl.

77
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:09,768
-Afraid?
-Of the Americans.

78
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:13,449
Even here you find people.

79
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:16,787
-We're friends.
Did you make the light?

80
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:22,812
She has lost her Tongue.
Bad sign in a girl

81
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:27,591
If she did make a light,
there might be others.

82
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,631
She's well upholstered.

83
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:36,762
She'll be more than enough for us three.

84
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:39,974
What have you picked up this time?

85
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,119
Why are you here?

86
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,621
Have you come to
meet your boyfriend?

87
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,919
Don't touch.

88
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,702
Pretty stupid of him
not to turn up?

89
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,382
You fancy her.

90
00:20:56,382 --> 00:21:00,139
No I'm completely clapped out

91
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,232
too much rushing around.

92
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:05,428
You would have rather.

93
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:07,601
found wine

94
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:12,455
I’m so thirsty,
I'd settle for water.

95
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:16,352
Any water here?

96
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,967
Is it far?

97
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:19,539
I'll fetch some.

98
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,409
We're in for a good time tonight.

99
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,197
Fritz, do you think they'll
advance any further?

100
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:22,805
will we retreat to Palermo?

101
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:25,924
We'll never retreat.

102
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:28,912
Tomorrow we'll counter attack

103
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:32,277
and they'll run back to Egypt
just like rabbits.

104
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,916
<i>The advance through southern
Italy was rapid.</i>

105
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,490
<i>On 8 September Italy Capitulated.
An allied fleet menaced Naples</i>

106
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:44,678
<i>When German resistance
was broken at Salerno...</i>

107
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:51,358
<i>..Naples was liberated within
a few weeks.</i>

108
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,451
<i> Naples became the most important..</i>

109
00:24:55,451 --> 00:24:58,581
<i>...supply depot to the Allies.</i>

110
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,473
Egyptian fakir defies death
with his lungs of steel!

111
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,497
Watch him leap!

112
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:24,252
Ladies and gentlemen...

113
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,456
...he could break his neck!!

114
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:40,314
- Where are you going?
- It's no good here.

115
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,977
I'm going down to the port.

116
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:45,776
Leaving us?

117
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:50,850
Learn to eat fire!
Fire eating's profitable.

118
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,739
Want to earn 50 lire?

119
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:12,051
Make it 200 .

120
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,520
100?

121
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,076
I said 200.

122
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,701
Settle for 150.

123
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,369
What do I do?

124
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,697
Keep a lookout for Military Police .
We're doing a job.

125
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,422
Nice teeth..

126
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,173
Look at his jacket .

127
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,491
Why not take his boots?.

128
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:41,366
3000 lire

129
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:45,054
3000 and 2 packets of cigarettes.

130
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:50,271
-3000
-I've outbid that!

131
00:27:02,698 --> 00:27:05,081
MPs run for it!

132
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,998
Christians! fight the Sarazin!

133
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,021
God calls us.

134
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:51,208
- We seek not riches!
- Justice and civilization!

135
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,682
Death to the Moors!

136
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:14,754
I, the white Orlando, against you,
the black Moor

137
00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:56,781
You're blowing the wrong way.

138
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:36,340
Here's a key, but it's useless.
The door was blown in.

139
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:39,401
I didn't like your song.

140
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:18,258
Joe, I'll steal your boots
If you sleep.

141
00:36:35,554 --> 00:36:37,681
-Where's your home?
-I haven't got one.

142
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,518
Where's mama and papa?

143
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:45,941
Mama and Papa are dead. Bombs.

144
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,586
<i>There was a long, tragic halt
at Monte Cassino.</i>

145
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:28,366
<i>On 22nd February, 1944, the Allies
landed at Anzio.</i>

146
00:39:30,424 --> 00:39:32,520
<i>Rome waited.</i>

147
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:39,588
<i>After a series of arduous battles,
the German defence was broken.</i>

148
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:42,762
<i>Through Rome...</i>

149
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:46,277
<i>...Kesselring's troops retreated
northward.</i>

150
00:40:28,597 --> 00:40:34,809
<i>Miraculously preserved, the city
welcomed its liberators.</i>

151
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:26,702
SIX MONTHS LATER

152
00:41:27,757 --> 00:41:32,506
American cigarettes. Singles or packs.

153
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:31,884
What's she gawping at? That hag's
been staring all night.

154
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:38,341
That yokel.

155
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:45,022
You slag! You'll have had it
when these guys go.

156
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:48,903
You'll be back in rags,
like you were before.

157
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,572
The cops are here.

158
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:26,123
My papers are in order.
Wait, I'll show you.

159
00:43:39,377 --> 00:43:42,024
Ticket, please.

160
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:50,418
Did a girl in a fur coat go in?

161
00:43:58,588 --> 00:44:01,052
It was nothing.

162
00:45:28,764 --> 00:45:30,971
May I bring him in ?

163
00:45:31,006 --> 00:45:34,643
-He's drunk.
-He'll soon fall asleep.

164
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:37,262
Let's hope he keeps quiet.

165
00:45:54,243 --> 00:46:01,801
They tore my dress. Why did you have
to bring your MPs to Rome?

166
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,573
Is it this cold in America?

167
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:52,603
Won't you get undressed?

168
00:46:54,642 --> 00:46:59,107
What lovely manners!
Still, you're very sweet.

169
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,835
Warm me up.

170
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:09,501
If you don't like my type, you should
have thought of it sooner.

171
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:15,760
You must have been in bars all day.
Isn't a girl better?

172
00:47:20,586 --> 00:47:23,879
Sure, Rome's full of girls like me.

173
00:48:26,499 --> 00:48:31,235
Water, please. Water for washing.

174
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,491
I'm afraid the pipes are broken.

175
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:07,384
It's not very cool. We've been
without water for two weeks.

176
00:49:07,384 --> 00:49:10,799
No, a lot of water, to wash my face.

177
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:23,069
Here's the soap. It's not very good.

178
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:36,902
No need to hurry.

179
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:09,007
I like Italian girls...

180
00:50:09,703 --> 00:50:12,672
...their language, their eyes...

181
00:50:13,275 --> 00:50:16,374
...their hair, their bodies.

182
00:50:30,252 --> 00:50:34,086
When the thief saw the policeman...

183
00:50:34,086 --> 00:50:36,816
...he ran around the corner.

184
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:42,401
I've no food or drink to offer you.

185
00:51:11,566 --> 00:51:12,664
Happy?

186
00:51:16,237 --> 00:51:20,531
We waited so long. Why couldn’t
you get here earlier?

187
00:51:21,172 --> 00:51:22,368
I don't understand.

188
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:24,518
Why did you take so long
to get to Rome?

189
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:29,994
It was very difficult.

190
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:38,411
Yes you are here.

191
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:40,502
Afraid?

192
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:46,986
Not afraid. Very happy.
It hardly seems true.

193
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,243
It's been so awful.

194
00:51:53,204 --> 00:52:00,232
No, It's lovely. Rome's lovely,
everything's lovely, you're lovely.

195
00:52:49,306 --> 00:52:50,961
Come back.

196
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:13,935
Why didn't you look at me?

197
00:53:16,346 --> 00:53:20,507
Don't you remember the fountain
in the square?

198
00:53:27,293 --> 00:53:32,774
Francesca's house was red, with
the biggest doorway in the square

199
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:44,427
She's become like you.

200
00:53:45,332 --> 00:53:49,017
She hasn't. There are lots of
good girls who work.

201
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:55,153
They've been able to stave
off hunger by working.

202
00:53:55,988 --> 00:53:57,790
She's one of those.

203
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:07,022
The tree is still there, but
it hasn’t flowered since that day.

204
00:54:07,781 --> 00:54:10,395
I know Francesca's house.

205
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:15,035
Piazza dei Quiriti, number 8.

206
00:54:19,808 --> 00:54:22,645
Go to her tomorrow,
she's waiting for you.

207
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:08,343
Going already?

208
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:11,921
When he wakes up tomorrow,
give him this address.

209
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,891
Tell him he must go there.

210
00:55:47,946 --> 00:55:51,564
Antonio, what is the time?
-Ten thirty.

211
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:53,056
Has anyone called for me?

212
00:56:26,546 --> 00:56:28,297
Pursued by the allies...

213
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:32,164
...the Germans retreated north
to Tuscany.

214
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:38,154
There was fighting on the hills
around Florence.

215
00:56:40,198 --> 00:56:44,516
In early August, the suburbs South
of the Arno were liberated.

216
00:56:46,308 --> 00:56:49,533
North of the river,
in the centre of Florence...

217
00:56:50,192 --> 00:56:53,122
...partisans fought German troops,
and Fascist snipers.

218
00:57:42,068 --> 00:57:43,231
We're wounded.

219
00:57:55,418 --> 00:57:59,935
Tonio, look at those girls. I'd have
got wounded earlier, if I’d known

220
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,083
Does that hurt?
let me look at it.

221
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:41,413
You speak Italian.
- I lived in Florence

222
00:58:41,413 --> 00:58:43,375
The Germans Ambushed us.

223
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:46,382
We'd been resisting, after all
the fighting...

224
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:50,914
...on the Arno embankment in Florence.

225
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:56,955
We waited a long time for the British.

226
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:01,446
-The British are in the city?
-Didn't you know?

227
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:05,550
But they stopped this side of the Arno.

228
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:08,852
All we could do was
cross over and join them.

229
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:13,269
- When did you leave Florence?
-Two days ago.

230
00:59:13,772 --> 00:59:16,018
It'll all be liberated now.

231
00:59:16,466 --> 00:59:19,781
No, all bridges are blown,
except the Ponte Vecchio.

232
00:59:23,056 --> 00:59:27,691
-Do you live in Florence?
No, I'm from Lucca.

233
00:59:27,691 --> 00:59:31,772
I joined the Arno brigade because
it was undermanned.

234
00:59:31,772 --> 00:59:35,152
Don't you know anyone in Florence?

235
00:59:35,152 --> 00:59:37,095
Do you know someone?

236
00:59:37,095 --> 00:59:39,378
I had many friends there.

237
00:59:40,173 --> 00:59:45,419
Did you know Guido Lombardi,
the painter?

238
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:47,368
Everyone knows him.

239
00:59:47,368 --> 00:59:50,191
Would it be hard to find him?

240
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:53,248
Impossible, he's our leader.

241
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:58,305
But no one ever knows where the
famous Wolf is.

242
01:00:25,795 --> 01:00:28,295
Look at these American girls.

243
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:33,126
Cheer up, you'll see your wife again.

244
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:34,449
Any news of Wolf?

245
01:00:35,392 --> 01:00:39,087
Some say he's wounded,
some say he isn't

246
01:00:39,486 --> 01:00:42,103
Anyway, he did a great job in Florence.

247
01:00:42,991 --> 01:00:47,291
With my help of course,
I had it beautifully organised.

248
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:51,183
Before the Germans took over,
we moved in broad daylight.

249
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,583
Any news of Wolf?

250
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:40,760
Nothing sure, he's in there fighting

251
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,003
I heard he was wounded, but who knows
what's going on over there.

252
01:02:07,878 --> 01:02:09,462
The British trucks have arrived.

253
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:23,547
Don't you recognise me? I live
across the street from you.

254
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,566
It's the end of the world
for we have sinned.

255
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:32,315
Can you tell me about my wife and child?

256
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,710
Can't you see how she is?

257
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:39,326
Aren't you her son? You've come
from the other side haven't you?

258
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:43,125
We've had our own troubles to
worry about.

259
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:53,853
Harriet, when did you get back to Italy?

260
01:02:54,324 --> 01:02:56,384
Can you tell me where Guido is?

261
01:02:56,419 --> 01:03:00,401
Don't you know he's now the legendary
Partisan leader, Wolf?

262
01:03:00,855 --> 01:03:03,115
He's on the other side of the river.

263
01:03:03,127 --> 01:03:04,582
I must see him.

264
01:03:04,582 --> 01:03:08,681
My family's over there. Let's try to
get across together.

265
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:14,269
The first newspaper. Wolf wounded!

266
01:03:22,919 --> 01:03:26,448
It's true, Wolf's been wounded.

267
01:03:26,448 --> 01:03:28,450
He was a great lad.

268
01:03:28,788 --> 01:03:30,669
-Do you know him?
-We're friends.

269
01:03:31,069 --> 01:03:33,271
He did a big portrait of me.

270
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:36,062
He was a good painter too.

271
01:03:44,985 --> 01:03:46,817
Watch out for the machine gun.

272
01:03:46,817 --> 01:03:49,281
A grenade just exploded over there.

273
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:07,398
My house is just beyond that boulevard.

274
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,892
The committee of National Liberation
may have news of him.

275
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:24,511
I'd like to go over myself,
and chase out those snipers.

276
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,058
Are there any Partisans for
them to shoot at?

277
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,305
In some areas, but the Fascists
are shooting out of spite.

278
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:39,569
They shoot housewives, while these
guys are admiring the view.

279
01:05:39,994 --> 01:05:41,784
How do you get news?

280
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:47,000
By telephone. I shouldn't tell you,
but there's a line.

281
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,624
Can't you help me reach my family ?

282
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:54,165
If I took you, they
wouldn't let you through.

283
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:56,081
Where?

284
01:05:56,487 --> 01:05:58,397
I shouldn't tell you.

285
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:02,046
The river can be crossed, they do say.

286
01:06:02,364 --> 01:06:04,131
Yes but where?

287
01:06:04,588 --> 01:06:06,819
Use your imagination.

288
01:06:07,216 --> 01:06:08,910
The Uffizi passageway?

289
01:06:10,337 --> 01:06:12,612
You never said a word, Thanks.

290
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:16,851
Don't start from Palazzo Pitti,
the passageway's broken there.

291
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,564
Look who's here

292
01:06:47,564 --> 01:06:49,295
Gigi, I'm in luck.

293
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,940
I must cross over.

294
01:06:56,335 --> 01:06:57,837
Off you go.

295
01:06:57,837 --> 01:07:01,470
I know the passageway's still open;
some people have gone that way.

296
01:07:04,273 --> 01:07:07,061
No one's crossed, that's nonsense.

297
01:07:07,533 --> 01:07:13,644
The passage to Uffizi has existed
for centuries, I’m going to use it.

298
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,664
You'll do no such thing.

299
01:07:17,357 --> 01:07:18,709
I'm a free man.

300
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:21,398
You're not free to endanger others.

301
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:26,971
People are crossing, but
what if the Germans find out?

302
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:29,069
It's a miracle they haven't spotted it.

303
01:07:29,496 --> 01:07:32,628
And how will you leave the Uffizi?

304
01:07:33,063 --> 01:07:36,884
The Germans are in the
Piazza della Signora

305
01:07:37,328 --> 01:07:40,872
No one's allowed in the streets,
you'll be picked up.

306
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:43,772
Even medical services have difficulty...

307
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:45,812
and they're authorised

308
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:53,696
You don't know the way.
-I'll find it

309
01:07:53,696 --> 01:07:57,805
Be careful, wear a red cross
armband if you can.

310
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:01,241
The Partisans control Jacopino only.

311
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:38,877
The Ponte Vecchio.

312
01:08:49,414 --> 01:08:52,072
They've blown all the other bridges.

313
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,440
Look the Germans.

314
01:09:46,629 --> 01:09:50,162
Let us in, the Germans are coming.

315
01:10:31,814 --> 01:10:35,510
Uncle, some people want to cross the roof

316
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:38,000
Go on, but keep your heads down.

317
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,290
Listen to that big gun.

318
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:44,915
For three days they've
been shelling that district.

319
01:10:45,177 --> 01:10:47,601
Which way for Sant Jacopino?

320
01:10:47,945 --> 01:10:51,916
There's Borgo Ognissanti:
Go down that way.

321
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:54,832
Are the Germans in the streets?

322
01:10:54,763 --> 01:11:00,770
No, two days ago the Partisans
began an assault in the area.

323
01:11:02,244 --> 01:11:05,720
Maybe they know about Wolf? How long
have they been fighting?

324
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:11,099
Two days: They attacked on the night before last.

325
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:14,535
Major, your wife wants you to
come down.

326
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:19,288
I can't go now, tell her
to send up my helmet.

327
01:11:19,288 --> 01:11:24,902
For the sun, you know. I know how
to avoid bullets.

328
01:11:24,902 --> 01:11:28,611
I went right through the Great War
- the real one.

329
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:29,471
Here's another map.

330
01:11:33,008 --> 01:11:36,453
They're at Galluzzo. Send word
right away.

331
01:11:36,453 --> 01:11:39,701
What's the best route ?

332
01:11:39,736 --> 01:11:44,051
Try over the rooftops, but watch
out for broken tiles.

333
01:11:44,051 --> 01:11:47,246
There's the big gun again

334
01:12:16,195 --> 01:12:20,761
They say the British have brought
flour, on the other side.

335
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:25,400
Will there be enough for everybody?

336
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,277
Yes, I saw the sacks myself.

337
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:29,998
Why aren't they crossing the river?

338
01:12:29,998 --> 01:12:32,784
Because the Germans blew the bridges.

339
01:12:35,848 --> 01:12:41,013
My Aunt lives near Santa Trinita:
were houses destroyed?

340
01:12:41,013 --> 01:12:42,995
Only those near the Ponte Vecchio

341
01:12:42,995 --> 01:12:48,652
What are the British waiting for, Partisans
control Sant' Jacopino.

342
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:53,099
That woman says people can
go out on the streets there.

343
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:55,004
Tell me how to get there.

344
01:12:56,011 --> 01:12:58,049
It's just a few minutes from the courtyard.

345
01:12:58,049 --> 01:13:01,950
But be careful, Fascists are sniping
from the rooftops.

346
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,830
Careful ! Don't let it bump
against the kerb

347
01:14:19,152 --> 01:14:22,031
Keep back ! Where have you come from?

348
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:25,151
I must get to my family, over there.

349
01:14:25,644 --> 01:14:30,150
I want to go there too, but they're
not letting anyone over.

350
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,834
Fascists and Germans are there.

351
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,490
Have they demolished buildings?

352
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:36,749
Have buildings been destroyed?

353
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,192
There was a lot of smoke over there
this morning.

354
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:58,499
Carlo do you recognise me?

355
01:14:58,499 --> 01:15:04,857
I can't let you through. Fascists
are shooting from the roofs.

356
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:09,007
All right, we'll ask the chief.

357
01:15:18,694 --> 01:15:20,572
They want to cross.

358
01:15:20,572 --> 01:15:22,799
All right, let them come.

359
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:28,584
Get ready, they're moving out.

360
01:15:29,995 --> 01:15:32,191
Marco, I know this guy.

361
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:39,134
-Where are you going?
-A few doors away.

362
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,004
You can't cross now.

363
01:15:41,512 --> 01:15:45,275
My wife and child are in that building
over there.

364
01:17:04,109 --> 01:17:12,531
Marco, tell my family what happened
to me...

365
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:17,002
... so they won't worry.

366
01:17:22,421 --> 01:17:26,232
Everything's gone wrong today,
since Wolf died.

367
01:17:29,996 --> 01:17:36,812
You won't yell at me any more, Wolf.
We're in the same boat.

368
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,178
The German's "Gothic Line"

369
01:17:53,554 --> 01:17:58,423
Bitterly defending every hamlet,
the enemy retreated slowly.

370
01:19:05,419 --> 01:19:09,059
Let us thank the Lord, who has
delivered us from all danger.

371
01:19:34,866 --> 01:19:40,076
If we'd brought the pigs here too,
the Germans wouldn't have got them.

372
01:19:40,497 --> 01:19:42,255
Take your chickens.

373
01:19:57,034 --> 01:20:00,207
Very Reverend Provincial Father

374
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:05,850
Thanks to divine providence,
we are safe and sound.

375
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:09,837
Our monastery has suffered very little.

376
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,100
The Americans are here!
In little cars!

377
01:20:40,972 --> 01:20:43,225
Fra' Pacifico won't be a moment.

378
01:21:20,004 --> 01:21:22,914
Father Superior is waiting for you.

379
01:21:44,626 --> 01:21:47,976
Peace be with you, brothers,
May Saint Francis bless you.

380
01:21:52,836 --> 01:21:56,666
We are American chaplains.

381
01:22:03,602 --> 01:22:07,830
Could we spend the night here?

382
01:22:07,865 --> 01:22:11,214
Our doors are open to all.
Fra' Pacifico will prepare rooms.

383
01:22:11,214 --> 01:22:18,516
Our brothers: the Vicar,
the organist...

384
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:57,420
I'd like to ask about my town,
San Leo.

385
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:22,368
Have you any news of San Leo?

386
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:28,295
Badly damaged?

387
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:29,852
Not too badly.

388
01:23:38,173 --> 01:23:42,763
I'll say a special prayer to the
Holy Mother for you...

389
01:23:42,763 --> 01:23:47,694
...for spiritual and temporal aid,
throughout...

390
01:23:58,104 --> 01:24:03,349
We make this liqueur from
our own apples, Fathers.

391
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:30,620
The rooms are ready.

392
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:58,191
One forgot this.
-Take it to them.

393
01:25:00,722 --> 01:25:04,569
Will they stay here tonight?
Will they have dinner?

394
01:25:04,922 --> 01:25:08,431
Certainly, we'll share what we have.

395
01:25:12,786 --> 01:25:15,842
-What's for supper?
-Broccoli.

396
01:25:17,014 --> 01:25:19,283
Enough for three guests too?

397
01:25:20,034 --> 01:25:21,318
There's too little.

398
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:22,975
Some potatoes?

399
01:25:23,517 --> 01:25:24,891
Too few.

400
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:30,319
What about pears on the tree,
in the garden?

401
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:34,201
They are wild pears, and they are
not ripe anyway.

402
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:38,620
Try to do your best. I know
I can count on you.

403
01:25:39,924 --> 01:25:42,627
Divine providence will help us.

404
01:25:53,053 --> 01:25:55,799
Open the door.

405
01:26:10,595 --> 01:26:12,929
An offering...for saving our animals.

406
01:26:45,096 --> 01:26:49,249
Meat and vegetables, all very good

407
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:53,654
Cocoa, butter, more meat...

408
01:27:16,024 --> 01:27:20,513
Look what they gave me.
Eggs, and butter, even.

409
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:23,268
Eggs in tins?

410
01:27:27,592 --> 01:27:31,696
Those Americans, they think
of everything.

411
01:27:33,049 --> 01:27:38,059
I'll do it, you might cut
your fingers.

412
01:27:51,705 --> 01:27:53,127
It's milk.

413
01:28:02,072 --> 01:28:07,053
Nothing ever grew here.
Now it's the most fertile part

414
01:28:07,053 --> 01:28:09,349
A miracle of Fra' Raffaele's.

415
01:28:11,637 --> 01:28:16,582
What a good smell.

416
01:28:15,222 --> 01:28:16,835
It's mint.

417
01:28:21,364 --> 01:28:24,150
Such a beautiful garden.

418
01:28:30,214 --> 01:28:32,596
He's very bad.

419
01:28:32,596 --> 01:28:34,284
No he's good.

420
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:46,416
I must go now.

421
01:29:31,473 --> 01:29:32,773
Why did they pray?

422
01:29:32,773 --> 01:29:39,565
Those two are very bad.
He's a Protestant, and he's a Jew.

423
01:29:45,517 --> 01:29:49,057
Fra' Salvatore, one chaplain is a Jew.

424
01:30:29,892 --> 01:30:32,321
One chaplain is a Jew.

425
01:30:35,883 --> 01:30:38,313
A Jew in our monastery?

426
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:39,799
And one's a Protestant.

427
01:30:40,832 --> 01:30:45,762
The heresy of Luther,
the worst protestant.

428
01:30:46,037 --> 01:30:48,209
What is the trouble my sons?

429
01:30:48,308 --> 01:30:52,599
One chaplain is a Jew.
The other is a Protestant.

430
01:30:53,088 --> 01:30:55,699
Two lost souls, Father Superior.

431
01:30:55,699 --> 01:31:00,420
No soul is lost if it lives
and craves redemption.

432
01:31:00,944 --> 01:31:06,510
We can give opportunities for
redemption, brothers.

433
01:31:12,478 --> 01:31:15,147
Forgive me, but may I ask you something?

434
01:31:16,802 --> 01:31:21,188
Have you been with the other
chaplains for long?

435
01:31:21,188 --> 01:31:27,645
We've been trough the Italian campaign
together; twenty-one months.

436
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:32,337
Sicily, Salerno, Rome, Florence.

437
01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:37,576
They're my dear friends;
I admire them greatly

438
01:31:38,683 --> 01:31:41,199
You've never tried to lead
them to the true faith?

439
01:31:45,999 --> 01:31:53,530
Father, the Protestant, and the Jew
are equally convinced of their faith.

440
01:31:54,465 --> 01:31:57,545
But we know that they err.

441
01:31:58,197 --> 01:31:59,651
Yes of course.

442
01:32:00,853 --> 01:32:06,554
We must use every means to try
to save these lost souls.

443
01:32:07,367 --> 01:32:13,888
I'm a priest, and I humbly believe
I'm a good Catholic.

444
01:32:13,888 --> 01:32:17,462
Forgive me, I didn't mean to remind
you of your duties.

445
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,957
But you are a military chaplain.

446
01:32:21,623 --> 01:32:26,818
In your mission, you accompany
the soldiers into battle

447
01:32:27,155 --> 01:32:32,113
Haven't you thought that your
companions might perish?

448
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:33,663
Saint Paul says:

449
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:37,674
omnes quidem resurgemus sed non
omnes mutabimus in gloria.

450
01:32:37,674 --> 01:32:40,139
But for those in good faith:

451
01:32:40,533 --> 01:32:43,884
in novissima tuba surget in gloria.

452
01:32:44,635 --> 01:32:48,066
True, but have you examined
their consciences?

453
01:32:48,066 --> 01:32:50,192
Are you sure they are in good faith?

454
01:32:50,192 --> 01:32:52,458
Have you discussed things?

455
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:56,265
No, I have never examined
their consciences.

456
01:32:56,582 --> 01:33:00,325
I've never discussed  it, and
I've never  raised the subject...

457
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:04,389
... because I never thought
I could judge them

458
01:33:04,389 --> 01:33:07,481
They're very good friends.

459
01:33:07,516 --> 01:33:14,992
In this peace, this atmosphere
of serene contemplation...

460
01:33:14,992 --> 01:33:19,592
...perhaps you may consider me guilty.

461
01:33:20,025 --> 01:33:24,542
I don't feel guilty,
my conscience is clear.

462
01:34:40,984 --> 01:34:44,913
We have an unbreakable rule
of silence during meals

463
01:35:49,859 --> 01:35:54,028
On this day, the following brothers
passed on to a better life

464
01:35:54,372 --> 01:35:56,829
In 1722, Father Salvatore of San Leo

465
01:35:56,829 --> 01:36:00,273
In 1743, Father Giambattista of Rimini

466
01:36:01,169 --> 01:36:04,088
In 1744, Father Theodore of San Marino.

467
01:36:19,659 --> 01:36:21,412
Please begin.

468
01:36:21,741 --> 01:36:23,560
We'll wait for you.

469
01:36:25,622 --> 01:36:27,490
We're fasting.

470
01:36:30,032 --> 01:36:34,539
Because divine providence sent to
our refuge two souls...

471
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:37,878
... on whom the light of
truth must descend

472
01:36:38,908 --> 01:36:41,934
Our human presumption makes us hope...

473
01:36:42,292 --> 01:36:45,946
... we may obtain a great gift from heaven

474
01:36:56,366 --> 01:37:02,669
Forgive me if I do
not observe your rule.

475
01:37:04,953 --> 01:37:09,366
But I must talk to you.

476
01:37:12,732 --> 01:37:13,903
To say...

477
01:37:13,903 --> 01:37:19,181
...that what you have given me
is such a great gift...

478
01:37:19,181 --> 01:37:24,459
... i feel I shall always be
indebted to you

479
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:30,076
I have found here the peace of mind
I had lost...

480
01:37:31,539 --> 01:37:34,558
... in the trials of war

481
01:37:37,254 --> 01:37:42,841
A beautiful, moving lesson of
humility, simplicity...

482
01:37:43,965 --> 01:37:45,723
... and pure faith.

483
01:37:57,525 --> 01:38:01,431
In the delta of the river Po,
south of Venice.

484
01:38:01,829 --> 01:38:05,818
Partisans and American OSS
joined forces...

485
01:38:05,818 --> 01:38:08,993
...in a desperate struggle
with the Germans.

486
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:34,550
Partisan! Bandit!

487
01:38:49,838 --> 01:38:51,772
I'll get him.

488
01:44:45,504 --> 01:44:50,031
"San Marco" where's the radio set?

489
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:21,185
You two come with me.

490
01:46:26,229 --> 01:46:27,788
That's Casel Madalena.

491
01:46:52,774 --> 01:46:54,920
We'll get food there.

492
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,475
Here's Cigolani.

493
01:47:10,016 --> 01:47:11,457
Germans were here.

494
01:47:11,457 --> 01:47:15,788
Let them search. You know
I've got Americans hidden.

495
01:47:17,142 --> 01:47:19,837
We haven't lit a fire for three days.

496
01:47:20,273 --> 01:47:22,323
German lookouts are everywhere.

497
01:47:22,323 --> 01:47:26,336
They're hunting us hard.
Anything to eat?

498
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:28,002
Some polenta

499
01:47:28,452 --> 01:47:29,887
And eels.

500
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:32,751
Can I bring an American in?

501
01:48:15,586 --> 01:48:16,918
Hide it away.

502
01:48:26,309 --> 01:48:28,654
Take as many as you like.

503
01:49:03,855 --> 01:49:05,987
I've got details of the drop.

504
01:49:19,339 --> 01:49:21,469
Cigolani, the signal fires.

505
01:49:30,657 --> 01:49:32,816
Put them out

506
01:50:11,139 --> 01:50:13,526
Shooting at Casel Madalena.

507
01:50:19,521 --> 01:50:23,259
Cigolani, take your men to Pancirli
and wait there.

508
01:51:17,196 --> 01:51:19,887
British planes attacking Scardovari.

509
01:52:43,233 --> 01:52:44,804
Just those two?

510
01:51:19,887 --> 01:52:48,272
They're British not American.

511
01:52:48,569 --> 01:52:50,134
Better than nothing.

512
01:53:05,783 --> 01:53:09,823
You couldn't get anything off
the plane before it sank?

513
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:13,587
Quick or the Germans will get us.

514
01:54:39,274 --> 01:54:47,039
Gunboats are coming.
Scatter out to sea.

515
01:58:59,418 --> 01:59:03,541
What will they do to us?

516
01:59:05,784 --> 01:59:11,119
Do you think they'd kill
Cigolani and not us?

517
01:59:12,385 --> 01:59:15,302
They'll kill us too.

518
01:59:25,426 --> 01:59:30,218
My family will never know
what happened to me.

519
01:59:33,894 --> 01:59:36,779
He pissed on me like a whore.

520
02:00:07,116 --> 02:00:09,457
<i>That was the winter of 1944</i>

521
02:00:09,942 --> 02:00:12,710
<i> In the spring of 1945,
the was over.</i>
