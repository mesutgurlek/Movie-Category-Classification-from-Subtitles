ANNE FRANK: I want to be
a champion skater and a writer.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,211
I want my picture
in all the magazines.

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,782
Maybe I'll be a movie star.

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I want to be different
from all the othergirls.

I want to be a modern woman.
I want to travel.

Oh, that bratty Leo Koopmann.
He thinks he's in love with me.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,782

and Mr. Van Pels.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you, Miep.

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,013
May I say how nie
you look today?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The problem is
you're using too muh sugar.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,749
VAN PELS: Too much nutmeg.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,584
Not enough coriander.

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Your mother telephoned.
She was quite worried.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,013
You should've gone
straight home.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you doing?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,277
Mr. Kugler is trying out
some new reipes.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your mixing stilI needs work,
but you may have something.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's high praise
indeed, Mr. Kugler.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,541
As you know, Mr. Van Pels
has an infallible nose.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,584
Anne, a joke for you.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,244
What is blak and white
and red all over?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What?

52

MARGOT: Thank you, Grandma.

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
ANNE: Was it exciting coming
all the way from Germany...

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,980
by yourself?
Tell me everything.

62

OTTO: Youu see? She's
still as curious as ever.

63

Let me see your book.
Let me see.

64

OTTO: Wait.
Grandma has another surprise.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,881
And here's your present, Anne.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,386
A fountain pen.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Look, Margot.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,386
It's beautiful.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,683
I'll treasure it always.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
-Thank you, Grandma.
-You're welome.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,848
I'm so glad you ame to visit.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Grandma will be living with us
from now on, girls.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,947
-Would you like that?
-Oh, yes.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
AE: Very muh.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,122
Anne...

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
why don't you try out
your new fountain pen?

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,716
Yes, I must--immediately.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,914
-Exuse me.
-Don't be too long.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,815
The Goslars are expeting us.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,716
Make sure she gets ready.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
OTTO: Let her have
her fun, Edith.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You spoil her terribly, Otto.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,980
She should've ome
straight home.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,584
AE: Oh, I'm starving.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And please mind
your manners, Anne.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,551
I know--like Margot.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,947
I thought you liked the Goslars.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Of ourse I do.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,640
I just wish Hannah Lee's family
wasn't so religious.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,815
I'd rather be at the movies.

Hitler's only a fever, Hans.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Germany will reover.
Mark my words.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,739
And what's to keep that madman
from annexing Holland...

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and liberating
his Germani brothers?

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,650
The Duth are different.

[Hans laughs]

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,838
Sometimes, Otto, I think you
have too muh faith in people.

EDITH: Poor mother.
She's used to better.

MRS. GOSLAR:
God willing, Edith.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
One day, we'll allgo home.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,617
Until then, we get by.

104

Be thankful you've got
entral heating.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let me help you with those,
Mrs. Goslar.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,815
Oh, that's very kind of you.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,452

You're luky.

109

Hannah's got two left hands.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Sometimes I miss
a full-time servant...

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,475
EDITH: but we don't have
money to pay servants.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The Dutch ones
are hopeless anyway--

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,749
simply annot be relied on.

114

HANNAH: Anne says you shouldn't
call them servants.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,353
Say, "maid."

knows everything better.

to spoil yourself

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Youu like it even better
when otherpeople spoil you.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,914
Does that make me a bad person?

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Good people and bad people
have one thing in ommon.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,683
They both make mistakes.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,122
Only...

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000

their mistakes...

126

OTTO: The Paulas
live here with us.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,551
You an't see them...

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,409
but sometimes if you
keep absolutely still...

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,551
and really listen...

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,046
you can tell
where they're hiding.

136

Beause you never know
whih Paula you might find.

OTTO: Good Paula...

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,310
or bad Paula who's
always causing trouble.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
ANNE: I don't mean
to be bad Paula...

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,419
but sometimes...

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,749
sometimes she just esapes.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,386
Doesn't matter.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,640
As long as you always keep
good Paula in your heart.

Daddy, ouldn't they
be the same person...

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,089
Why...

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,914
Yes. I suppose that's possible.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Maybe good Paula's afraid...

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,046
of what people
may think of her...

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,079
and that's why
she's bad sometimes.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,848
At least that's what I think.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,409
You always told me l
should think for myself.

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,188
So I did.

about where we've gone.

806
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,376
Ifyou do, it could be
very dangerous for us.

807
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,178
Since you've never
had to disappear...

808
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I'll try to give you an idea
ofour life.

809
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,475
I call our hiding place
"the secret annexe. "

810
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,838
And strange as it may seem,
it's actually quite cozy here.

811
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Youu'd be surprised
to find out...

812
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,112
that we'rejust above
Daddy's office.

813
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,442
Up the back staircase
and behind a small door.

814
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Open the door,
take one giant step...

815
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,221
and voila.

816
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,673
Daddy and Mommy's room
is right behind the staircase.

817
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,881
Margot and I reside next door.

818
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,749
We've even got a bathroom.

819
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,475
Upstairs, there's a larger room
with a kitchen.

820
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
The Van Pels
sleep there at night...

821
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,343
but during the day,
it's a big living room.

822
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
We have to stay upstairs...

823
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,541
as long as the workers
are still in the building.

824
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,343
Peter Van Pels
has a room offto the side...

825
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,650
much smaller than mine.

826
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,013
And there's an attic
for storage.

827
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
There are warehouses
on both sides of us...

828
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,716
and neighbors all around.

829
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,178
We have to be invisible
day and night.

830
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
ANNE: At first,
it was only Daddy and me...

831
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
doing most ofthe work.

832
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,607
Mummy and Margot eventually
got over their shock...

833
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,551
and started to help.

834
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Shirts.

835
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It was amazing to see
how many ofour things...

836
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,980
Daddy had managed
to sneak away.

837
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,706
I wasn't the only one who
brought my memories with me.

838
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,079
Daddy kept
his old soldier's trunk.

839
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It was hard for all of us...

840
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,475
not to think about the life
we had left behind.

841
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,584
I miss my old room...

842
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,706
but at least I have my movie
stars to keep me company.

843
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
With a little luck...

844
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,475
we can all be happy here
until we go back home.

845
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,112
And now our annexe
really is secret.

846
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Mr. Kugler and Mr. Kleiman
had a bookcase built...

847
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,947
in front of
our little doorway.

848
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Youu have to be careful
when you go downstairs...

849
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,475
to bend down low
and try not to bump your head.

850
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Everything was ready...

851
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,442
by the time the Van Pels
arrived on July 13th.

852
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,343
-They're here.
-Well done. Come in, ome in.

853
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,353
I need oxygen.

854
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,815
Well, I told Mr. Van Pels...

855
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,640
that I'm not going anywhere
without my little potty.

856
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
ANNE: Peter Van Pels...

857
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,079
dope that he is,
brought his cat...

858
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
even though Daddy
told him not to.

859
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,640
Mrs. Van Pels asked me
to love Peter like a brother.

860
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That's impossible.

861
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,640
Mommy says he's shy,
but I think he's rather boring.

862
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,947
Now we're to have
anotherguest.

863
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
The other day,
Daddy announced...

864
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,739
we have an opportunity to save
one ofour acquaintances.

865
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,409
Mr. Pfeffer has asked me
about a hiding plae.

866
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,541
ow, we know this will
only add to your worries...

867
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,112
so the final deision
rests with you.

868
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,640
It's just as dangerous
for seven as it is for eight.

869
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,419
So we're agreed.

870
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
ANNE:
From what we can tell...

871
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,013
Mr. Pfeffer
is quite congenial...

872
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,584
for a dentist anyway.

873
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,178
That's all I had better
write for now.

874
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm sure we'lI see each other
again, Jacqueline...

875
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,211
but probably not before
the war's over.

876
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,706
Until then, a little kiss
from your best friend, Anne.

Good morning, Miep.

I've been having...

883
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,211
the most frightful
dizzy spells lately.

884
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Things are harder and harder
to ome by.

will be fine, for all of us.

ANNE:
So, Miep, what's the news?

887
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Have you seen Jaque?
I have a letter for her...

888
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
but Daddy won't let me
give it to you.

889
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,673
When I finish with the shopping,
we'lI have our talk.

And what of our friend
Mr. Pfeffer?

-What nerve.
-Tomorrow's Friday.

895
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Tell Mr. Pfeffer
we will expet him Monday.

896
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That'll give him time
to settle his affairs...

897
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
but not a day later.

898

I'lI see to it.
