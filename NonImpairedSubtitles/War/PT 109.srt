00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>On August 7th 1942, elements
of the 1st Marine Division</i>

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,340
<i>landed on Guadalcanal.</i>

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,230
<i>The American Navy was assigned the job
of sea support in the Solomon islands.</i>

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,730
<i>There were few capital
ships available</i>

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,970
<i>and they were ill suited for
narrow channel warfare.</i>

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,190
<i>The PT boats were, they were
fast shallow draught withers</i>

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,140
<i>carrying maximum torpedo power.</i>

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,610
<i>Their assignment:
harass the enemy</i>

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,560
<i>and buy time for a Navy that
was still on the drawing boards.</i>

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,260
<i>This narrative concerns one
of those boats and its crew</i>

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,750
<i>commanded by lieutenant
(J.G.) John F. Kennedy, PT109</i>

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,570
Rogers!

13
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,100
Yes sir!

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,280
Please notify these three officers
they'll be disemarking in an hour.

15
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,510
Yes sir!

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,830
End of the line Mr. Taubot.
It's loggin about an hour.

17
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,630
Thanks Rogers.

18
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,870
- Mr. Claybon, won't be long now.
- Much obliged.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,900
Mr. Kennedy, war is ready.

20
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,290
Oh, thanks Rogers.

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,790
Mr. Kennedy, can I be frank 
with you for a minute?

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,090
Sure, come on in Rogers.

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,010
I've always had good luck being
frank with lieutenants.

24
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,520
It's ensigns and admirals 
you can't talk to.

25
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,300
Right after this trip, I'm 
shipping on to the beach of Pearl.

26
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,690
So far so good, now hear this.

27
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,310
Right away get yourself transfered back
to the States. Zingo, you sent for me.

28
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,130
Zingo?

29
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,310
We'd make a great team.
Maybe running a nice wave barracks

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,280
or Jacksonville or some town where they
got a few sensible after hour joints.

31
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,600
Rogers, I just got here!

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,410
Oh, you don't want this Mr. Kennedy.
Believe me, I've been in this Navy.

33
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,410
The worst thing you could do is 
let them trick you onto an ocean.

34
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,780
PT boat, nothing but a plywood coffin.

35
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,320
Well, I can't ask for a transfer.

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,390
Of course you can. I've got 
a... little background on you.

37
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,120
The word, you've got the juice, you've 
got pliers down there in Washington.

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,120
The juice?

39
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,460
Juice, muscle, glicerine!
Don't they teach you any

41
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,060
It's an elective.

42
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,220
Tell the old men to drop the 
word into somebodies head.

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,240
Tell them to holla lady. You 
can get out of here in a no time.

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,410
I'm sorry Rogers, I'm affraid I used 
all that glicerine to get down here.

45
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,310
You mean you negotiated 
your way out here?

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,340
That's right!

47
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,680
You put in a fix 
to go the wrong way?

48
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,650
Right.

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,310
Mr. Kennedy, they are 
fighting out here!

50
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,090
Wait, hold it, maybe it's not to late.

51
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,590
Tell them you went psycho, you... you 
ate some poison meat, you woke up dizzy!

52
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,860
It's too late Rogers and I'm
surprised at you. Where is your spirit?

53
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,000
Spirit?
What's that?

54
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,530
A willingness to fight 
for what you believe in!

55
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,300
Oh, that spirit Mr. Kennedy, 
I got it, I believe in a transfer!

56
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,010
You know I wouldn't snow you.

57
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,690
Thinking like this, 
you just not gonna make out.

58
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,820
<i>General quarters! General quarters!
All men, man your battle stations.</i>

59
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,510
Hey you! Hey you fella! Give 
that sailor a hand with the ammo.

60
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,790
Mr. Kennedy!

61
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,160
Welcome to the South Pacific.

62
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,780
Best of luck Jack.

63
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,870
Same to you captain.

64
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,870
- See you around Jack.
- Right Pete!

65
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,950
Ladie!

66
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,730
Yes, sir!

67
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,710
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

68
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,500
I don't want this crane in the pier
area when we're loading ammunition!

69
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,050
Yes sir!

70
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,190
And I don't permit oil drumms in the area
when we're loading ammunition either.

71
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,390
Yes sir!

72
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,560
Afternoon sir.

73
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,620
Good afternoon. Even if I should permit it
you should know better than to permit it.

74
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,710
Yes sir!

75
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,030
What's your problem?

76
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,520
I was looking for the 
Squadron Commander, sir!

77
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,490
Ladie! I saw your friend Nesbitt
ditch that cigarette butt!

78
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,090
You can tell him for me that he's
in trouble, he's in real trouble.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,640
Yes sir!

80
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,390
Look at them.
Skippers, they call them selves.

81
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,340
They're not Naval officers, they're nothing
but a bunch of civilians dressed up in costume.

82
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,100
What...what was bothering you?

83
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,530
I was lookin' for the 
Squadron Commander, sir.

84
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,550
Which Squadron?

85
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,470
PT Squadron 2.

86
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,030
That'll be Lieutenant Cluster.

87
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,340
Right straight down the main street

88
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,380
past this side of the post office.

89
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,930
Last tent.
Thank you, sir!

90
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,600
You're very welcome.

91
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,210
- Ladie!
- Yes, sir!

92
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,340
I'm putting you on report for 
not putting Nesbitt on report.

93
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,370
Yes sir!

94
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,170
Fender head.

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,440
THROUGH THESE PORTALS PASS THE
BEST MTB MEN IN THE WORLD.

96
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,460
O.K. BARBER SHOP OF TULAGI.
CLOSED DURING AIR RAIDS.

97
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,720
DURING THE DAY LET'S REPOSE.
WE SWING ALL NITE WITH TOKIO ROSE.

98
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,850
RUM - RYE - SCOTCH - GIN

99
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,490
Lieutenant Cluster?

100
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,730
Lieutenant!

101
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,400
Here. What is it?

102
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,420
Lieutenant Kennedy,
reporting for duty, sir.

103
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,610
Kennedy?

104
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,290
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,590
Come in, sit down.

106
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,680
What time is it?

107
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,430
It's a...quarter of a 2, sir.

108
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,400
A quarter of 2?

109
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,150
Mister, you just woke me up
in the middle of the night.

110
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,340
Oh, I'm sorry sir, 
I didn't know your schedule.

111
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,530
That's all right lieutenant.
I'm Al Cluster.

112
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,770
Jack Kennedy.
Nice to meet you.

113
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,430
Nice to meet you, Jack.
Help yourself to a cigarette.

114
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh, thanks, no.

115
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,340
What can I do for you?

116
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,550
Well, I'm reporting for duty, sir.

117
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,920
What's your specialty?

118
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,940
PT skipper.

119
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,160
Oh, that's too bad.
I need an engeneering officer.

120
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,840
Wanna take a crack at it?

121
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,130
Well, aren't there any boats?

122
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,870
No, not right now, but 
I can put you on staff.

123
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,370
Or, as I said engeneering 
officer, I really need one.

124
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,950
Well, if it's all same to you sir,
I had counted on a boat.

125
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,290
You did, ha?

126
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,190
Well, there's a 109.

127
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,060
I suppose you can call that a boat.

128
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,360
Now that you mentioned it, but the
engeneering job... it wouldn't last

129
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,570
Oh, the 109 would be fine sir.

130
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,130
Hmm, well, will go and take a look 
at her, cause it's all up to Ritchie,

131
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,580
he's our boat maintenance officer.

132
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,280
Sweet soul.
You'll meet him soon enough.

133
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,250
I think I already have.

134
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,220
Lieutenant, can you tell me more
about... hmm, Commander Ritchie?

135
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,660
Retread, he was on destroyers 
in the First war, retired,

136
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,710
then called back again 
couple of years ago.

137
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,500
Strictly regulation.

138
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,530
Does an honest job.

139
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,940
Only trouble he doesn't like this hooligan
Navy much better than he does the Japanese.

140
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,380
Now, there's our happy crew.

141
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,790
Hey you Bing Crosbies, paint, slap it 
on, this ain't no movie stars bedroom.

142
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,700
Let's get this boat out of here.

143
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,780
There was a happy ship.

144
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,770
Is it always like this hot?

145
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,130
No, Mr. Kennedy, it gets hotter.

146
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,240
Any... any questions?

147
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,610
Yeah, is it one of ours?

148
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,970
Yap, officialy listed, 109.

149
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,850
A lot of wear and tear, isn't it?

150
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,730
Oh no, it just needs woman's touch.

151
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,720
Least.

152
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,420
Wanna take a look at the engines?

153
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,400
What kind of shape are they in?

154
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,690
Not quite as good as the rest of the boat.

155
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,170
Let's save the worst 
for last, alright!?

156
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,830
Alright!

157
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,110
Well, it's gonna take a lot of work,

158
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,470
I don't quite know where to begin.

159
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,770
You ought a start laying the keel!
Still want her?

160
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,280
I'd like to give it a try.

161
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,920
Mr. Kennedy, you try this
you'll try anything.

162
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,410
This way!

163
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,680
Good afternoon sir.

164
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,330
Good afternoon lieutenant.

165
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,740
Commander Ritchie, this is lieutenant
Kennedy. He just checked in.

166
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,920
Oh, yes, yes...we met.
Welcome aboard lieutenant.

167
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,460
Thank you sir.

168
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,080
He thinks he'd like a crack at a 109.

169
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,250
Don't be a damn fool.
Show him the boat.

170
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,230
I've seen it sir.

171
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,490
You think that boat would 
ever pass inspection?

172
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,320
Yes sir.

173
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,380
Another hot rod.
Alright, Mr. Kennedy,

174
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,460
you have one week to put it 
in shape, that means one week,

175
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,340
that means in shape!

176
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,480
We'll have to get him 
a good crew to help.

177
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,040
He'll get a crew alright, whether they're 
any good or not, will be up to Mr. Kennedy.

178
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,540
Yes, sir.

179
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,770
Well, I'll see what can I round up.

180
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,790
You do that.

181
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,910
Oh, I'm sorry sir, I didn't 
get a chance to clean up.

182
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,370
It's all right lieutenant.

183
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,850
You know, this entire generation's 
gonna wind up dying flat on its belly.

184
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,560
Nothing personal, lieutenant.

185
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,300
Snyby!

186
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,280
This thing is full 
of strikeovers again.

187
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,700
I could chain up a monkey in the 
basement to get better results!

188
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,870
Try using your elbows!

189
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,390
Come in, come in, sit down.

190
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,100
Nah, it's not like the old Navy.

191
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,790
In old days you could eat off the deck.
Imagine, you can eat off the thing.

192
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,850
Yes sir, they told us out of Melwill.

193
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
Now days these kids, these hotentots

194
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,280
take those boats out, they 
bounced them around like yo-yos.

195
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,380
Where?

196
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,170
Melwill, sir.

197
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,950
Mr. Kennedy, I don't 
care where you've been,

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,270
I don't wanna know 
anything about you,

199
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,870
I don't care whether you've got a mother, a
father, an orphan child... you understand?

200
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,530
You just run a toward ship 
hang on to Navy regulations.

201
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,010
You do, you'll find me a friendly man.

202
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,440
Damn friendly man,
if you don't, you...

203
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,080
Snyby, where is that memo?
I'm gonna chain up that monkey.

204
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,420
Oh, that's all, Mr. Kennedy.

205
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,430
Yes sir.

206
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,000
A movie for the night...

207
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,570
Well, you can be replaced
by a wave, you know?

208
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,630
That's all Snyby.

209
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,050
Welcome to the South Pacific.

210
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,870
Mr. Kennedy.

211
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,830
Ensign Leonard Thom, your exec.

212
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,080
Oh, hi! Glad to meet you Leonard.
Welcome aboard.

213
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,990
How long did they give you
to put it in shape?

214
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,410
Well, we've used about half the 
time just talking right here.

215
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,210
What about the crew?

216
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,110
So far I got a...

217
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,870
one land crab.

218
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,440
Come on Leonard, 
I'll show you around.

219
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,090
Are they kiddin'?
Look at this thing.

220
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,970
Is that our mother ship?

221
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,220
Holly Toledo!

222
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,210
Shouldn't we store our gear aboard?

223
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,490
Better wait for an officer to report to.

224
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,530
Who do we drew?

225
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,670
- I don't know.
- I gotta run down upon to the yeoman.

226
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,180
The exec, is ensign named Leonard Thom.

227
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,450
Served some sea duty.

228
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,720
Use to ba a taccle on the 
Ohio State football team.

229
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,180
That rules out mutiny.
How about the old man?

230
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,470
J.G., named Kennedy.

231
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,230
What the hell are you doin'?

232
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,190
- I'm killin' elephants...
- Will you stop it.

233
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,010
- Why?
- Makes me nervous.

234
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,370
Suffer!

235
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,140
Seems all he ever did was go
to school, he's had no sea duty.

236
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,170
Says here he wrote a book.

237
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,660
Sounds like he ought to be 
in charge of the library.

238
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,200
What's the name of the book?

239
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,160
"Why England Slept".

240
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,820
Any pictures in it?

241
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,990
Picdures?

242
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,210
Pictures, idiot.

243
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,050
He's lookin' for pictures
and I'm an idiot.

244
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,510
I'm servin' under a guy like this,
we've rate the Purple Heart.

245
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,250
Well keep it in mind.

246
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,360
I don't think you've met our new
executive officer, ensign Thom.

247
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,370
I'm lieutenent Kennedy.

248
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,240
Drewitch, sir.
Motor machinist, 2nd.

249
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,060
Drewitch.

250
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,910
I'm Harris, sir.
Gunners mate, 2nd.

251
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,600
Harris.

252
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,630
We were just sayin' sir, 
she's a very seaworthy craft.

253
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,290
Lot of potential anyway.

254
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,210
Any relation to Bucky?

255
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,320
No sir, they call me that 
though sometimes.

256
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,710
Drawdy is my name sir,
motor machinist 2nd.

257
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,900
Alright, you may stow your 
gear in the engeneering shaq,

258
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,720
we're staying there till 
we get squared away.

259
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,450
Ah, Mr. Kennedy.

260
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,310
Yes, Drewitch?

261
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,330
There's only three of us 
to clean up this whole boat!

262
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,440
There is five of us.

263
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,900
This is the whole crew?

264
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,320
Well, it's all we have for now.
Why?

265
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,340
We'll spend the rest of the war
just gettin' the boat in shape.

266
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,570
Then we better get started.

267
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,310
Ai ai, sir.

268
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,570
Alright, you're home men, 
get your gear.

269
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,320
Six new hands, selected 
with the upmost of care

270
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,220
to meet the requirements of the 109.

271
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,820
Only six available.

272
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,220
I'm Kirksey sir,
torpedoman 2nd.

273
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,020
Kirksey.

274
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,330
Maguire, sir.
Radioman 2nd.

275
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,150
Maguire.

276
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
Marney, sir,
motormech 2nd.

277
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,830
Marney.

278
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,750
Kowal, sir,
Gunner's mate 3rd.

279
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,320
Kowal.

280
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,500
Albert, sir,
seaman 2nd class.

281
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,320
Albert.

282
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,770
Mauer, sir, seaman 1st.

283
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,290
Mauer. Where is your gear Mauer?

284
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,060
I was on the "Niagara" sir, my... 
my gear went down with the ship.

285
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,830
We'll see if we can 
scare up some stuff for you.

286
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,470
Thank you.

287
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,080
Right.

288
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,910
Any of you men know how to cook?

289
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,300
Cook?

290
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,770
Yeah, yeah, I used to fix some 
stuff for my kid brother, sir.

291
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,600
Good, you are our new cook.
What kind of stuff?

292
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,060
Peanut butter sandwiches, sir.

293
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,380
Nothing else?

294
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,230
Oh, sometimes I'd stick 
some jelly on them, sir.

295
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,410
Well, ah... maybe you could
cook up a third specialty, ha?

296
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,610
Maybe.

297
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,820
Drewitch, you wanna show the 
men where to stow their gear.

298
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,080
Sir.

299
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,820
Drawdy.

300
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,080
Show this men where 
to stow their gear.

301
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,070
Come on.

302
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,130
What do you think Jack, think 
they'll do a good job for us?

303
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,010
Sure!
We do one for them.

304
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,020
If we did get it ready in a week,
it wouldn't pass Ritchie's master.

305
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,360
I wouldn't worry about that, Andrew,
my boy. We're still one engine short.

306
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,160
Here you are. One box, 
24 chocolate bars.

307
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,490
Thanks.

308
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,390
See what you can do by getting
terra for that sick torpedo.

309
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,190
We'll do.

310
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,190
Sam.

311
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,420
Thanks!

312
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,490
How you fellas going?

313
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,850
Well sir, we've got more cosmoline 
in disolvings than on the gun.

314
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,100
Oh, here, hand it to me, 
I'll get some clean stuff.

315
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,620
Thank you.

316
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,060
Alright! Alright!
Send down the bum that done this!

317
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,010
Sorry chief, I guess I am your man.

318
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,990
You know what you got 
for a brain buddy?

319
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,750
A seed pearl. You know 
how big a seed pearl is?

320
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,030
It's the damn smallest 
pearl in the world!

321
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,060
Now I'm coming up there to 
tell you the rest of it.

322
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,190
Let's go sailor!

323
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,440
Permission to come aboard, sir.

324
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,970
Permission granted.
Chief, I'm sorry about that.

325
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,210
It's not you sir, it's that cotton
picking enlisted man over there.

326
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,970
I'm gonna get that son of a gun
that dumped the oil on my head.

327
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,090
I'm affraid I'm your man chief.

328
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,870
I'm a chief petty officer in this Navy
and I'm not gonna take that sort of things.

329
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,560
I'm your man.

330
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,800
What sir?

331
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,670
I...I didn't realise anybody was on 
the other side. I'm sorry about that.

332
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,990
Well sir, I think them seed pearls 
is about the best I can do for you!

333
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,110
Say chief, with your permission,
I'd like to replace that shirt.

334
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,510
Permission granted.

335
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,070
Wanna try?

336
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,980
Why not?

337
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,840
Commander, do you really think
they can pass this inspection?

338
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,150
The moment of truth.

339
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,770
He'll say no.
Two to one?

340
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,810
Alright, two chocolate bars to one.

341
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,390
You're on!

342
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,110
Alright, all hands, man your 
cleaning stations for inspection!

343
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,860
Request permission 
to come aboard.

344
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,400
Permission granted.
Ready for inspection, Commander.

345
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,860
Now isn't that something that floats.

346
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,980
Sir?

347
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,440
Oh, how many primer coats?

348
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,030
Two.

349
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,990
Two primer coats.
Let's take a look at your engines.

350
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,540
Right.

351
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,770
With your permission, Commander.

352
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,170
Good afternoon, sir.
Engine room, ready for inspection.

353
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,130
Drawdy, motormech 2nd, standing by.

354
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,130
At ease Drawdy.

355
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,940
All three of them work?

356
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,520
Yes, sir.

357
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,050
Show him, Drawdy.

358
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,790
No, no, that won't be necessary, 
Mr. Kennedy. I take a man's word.

359
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,980
Good afternoon, sir. Crew's 
compartment ready for inspection.

360
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,530
Harris, Gunner's Mate 2nd, 
standing by.

361
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,500
Good afternoon!

362
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,630
Somebody's kid sister?

363
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,670
Sorry, sir.

364
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,480
He's very sorry, sir.

365
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:33,110
Oh, no, no. Don't apologize... the most
seaworthy thing I've seen on this boat.

366
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,410
Good afternoon, sir.
Galley ready for inspection.

367
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,190
Mauer, seaman 1st, 
standing by, sir.

368
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,220
Mauer.
Galley, clean, well ordered.

369
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,680
Is there any hot food?
Yes, sir.

370
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,130
Good.

371
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,910
Hot food?

372
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,770
Peanut butter on toast!

373
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,590
Commander!

374
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,420
Yes, lieutenant.

375
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,580
I just wondered how you felt
about the inspection, sir?

376
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,580
How am I suppose to feel?

377
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,270
Well, the men worked hard to 
get the boat in shape, sir,

378
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,170
I thought the word of 
encouragement would be in order.

379
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,200
I don't hand out pats on the back
for a job I expect a man to do

380
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,160
in the normal performance 
of his duty.

381
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,430
I thought that was clear.

382
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,800
My men aren't looking for 
pats on the back, Commander,

383
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,800
they are just lookin' for a 
little credit for a job well done.

384
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,720
I'm not a book keeper Mr. Kennedy,
I don't dabble in debits or credits.

385
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,650
I'm a Naval officer and I run a torp 
ship, I expect you do the same.

386
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,380
Your boat is ready for test run.
Carry on. That's all lieutenent.

387
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,830
Wanna thank you men for
doing a good job.

388
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,080
Damn good job!

389
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,130
Engines check out, okay here, Drawdy.

390
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,960
Thank you, sir!

391
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,160
Everything all right with you, Len?

392
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,990
No complaints. 
She runs like the Queen Mary.

393
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,290
Okay, prepare for shakedown drill.
General quarters.

394
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,950
Alright, general quarters! Man your 
battle stations! - General quarters!

395
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,470
Come on!
Come on!

396
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,900
Come on!
Come on!

397
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,030
Number one, .50 mag, 
manned and ready, sir!

398
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,530
Very well!

399
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,220
Go!

400
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,330
Aft .50, manned and ready, sir!

401
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,360
Right! Very well!

402
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,850
Twenty millimeter, 
manned and ready, sir!

403
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,170
Very well!
What's your time?

404
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,850
Minute, 10 seconds.

405
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,450
They're 10 seconds 
faster we were last time!

406
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,340
Secure general quarters.

407
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,270
Secure general quarters.

408
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,270
Well, what do you think?

409
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,760
Yeah, let's take a 
practice running that.

410
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,890
Full speed ahead.

411
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,380
Sylicillars good.
We're about 1500 out.

412
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,550
We'll close to a thousand.

413
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,050
Hey, watch it!

414
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,400
Stand by to fire.

415
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,110
Thousand.

416
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,300
All right!
Fire one.

417
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,150
Fire two.

418
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,260
Right on it.

419
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,980
What's their hurry?

420
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,950
I don't know.

421
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,490
Let's find out.

422
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,970
Alright, make her fast, Harris.

423
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,730
Mr. Kennedy.

424
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,430
Yes, sir.

425
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,820
Today they teach you to manouver 
like that at Melwill or...

426
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,070
is that something 
you picked up at Cape Cod?

427
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,680
Lieutenat, we like these boats 
pretty much just the way they are.

428
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,570
So don't you take it 
upon yourself to

429
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,700
change the design of them 
by playing billiards

430
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,300
with those other boats out there.

431
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,430
Yes, sir.

432
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,430
Man sure rides your back.

433
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,520
Too bad he doesn't directs some of
that tension towards the enemy.

434
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,810
War would be over sooner.

435
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,560
Well, I guess, I did 
come in a little fast.

436
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,450
Drawdy.

437
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,680
Those engines still check out okay?

438
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,380
Yes sir, but there is one thing.

439
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,740
What's that?

440
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,490
Those engines are pretty tired, reverse
them at high speed, they could stall.

441
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,460
You'd wind up on the beach.

442
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,060
Alright, thanks Drawdy.
I'll keep it in mind.

443
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,650
Yes, sir.

444
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,780
How are you, Jack?

445
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,650
How did it go?

446
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,850
Fine, real fine.

447
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,300
Your boat looks good, Jack.

448
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,480
Well ,I got a good crew.

449
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,520
Oh, don't be modest, we got a 
briefing session in 15 minutes.

450
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,850
Fifteen minutes? That hardly 
gives me time to refuel.

451
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,670
You won't finish refueling
'til after dark.

452
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,380
It's only two o'clock.

453
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,390
You're last in line.
First come, first served.

454
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,080
Oh, yes.

455
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,310
You sure you don't want 
that engeneering job?

456
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,430
Yes, I'm sure.

457
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,480
I'm sure.

458
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,630
Hi John.

459
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,230
Jack.

460
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,210
Oh, John. You get those 
chocolate bars I asked for?

461
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,800
Yeah, full box of 24. I'll 
send them down the boat, okay?

462
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,630
Yeah, thanks.

463
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,400
Hey Jack!

464
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,430
Oh yeah.

465
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,990
- Leonard? 
That's three dollars you owe me.

466
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,810
With that sweet of the yours Jack, I'm 
affraid you'll never make ends meet.

467
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,650
Well, I guess we are all here.

468
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,450
This briefing is mainly 
for the new skippers.

469
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,340
I'm sure you know them by now

470
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,260
Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Libnow,
Mr. Edwards, Mr. Fallow.

471
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,440
Thank you!

472
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,450
To begin with I don't know how long 
we'll be operating out of here.

473
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,270
Task Force 31 has made 
landings on Rendova.

474
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,610
Here. As soon as the island's
secured, we'll move up.

475
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,050
Until that time, the new skippers 
will conduct test runs only.

476
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,800
Unless, of course one of the 
coastwatchers turns up something.

477
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,840
For the benefit of the new officers,
that's our local spy setup.

478
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,130
There are Australian volunteers
mainly and they do a great job.

479
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,530
They are located in a
lot of these islands

480
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,540
reporting to us on Japanese 
troop movements, shipping,

481
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,990
anything that'll do us any good.

482
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,370
Yeoman!
Pass out those orders.

483
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,900
Read them carefully gentlemen,
then I'll answer your questions.

484
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,250
Welcome to the South Pacific, Rogers.

485
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,950
I didn't know you're in 
any of this sort of thing.

486
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,900
Oh, believe me, Mr. Kennedy, I 
had it all set up. Locked in.

487
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,000
Recruiting duty in Columbus, Ohio, with
sea pay. Somebody blew the whistle.

488
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,500
I tell you, it must been Roosevelt 
or somebody way up. Really!

489
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,460
I had it all locked in.

490
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,880
You know, one of these days,

491
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,430
he's gonna talk himself right 
into the Japanese Imperial staff.

492
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,570
Prairie Dog, Prairie Dog, this 
is GSE, I have your message

493
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,990
and you're related to Tulagi. 
GSE out!

494
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:42,370
Hello KEN. KEN this is GSE. From Prairie 
Dog I have a relay of message to Tulagi.

495
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,720
Priority urgent, message follows:

496
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,260
Prairie Dog . Urgent request.
At least two.

497
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:52,140
I repeat, two PT's. Cover force, 
withdrawal his force by two LCVP's

498
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,760
at Baker 91, I repeat, Baker 91.

499
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:01,150
This is KEN. This is KEN.
Baker 91 will comply. Over.

500
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,630
Thank you KEN, GSE out.

501
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,590
Emergency rescue, sir.
What can we put in the water?

502
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,850
I can give you a note in the bottle.

503
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,950
I got five boats, two on dry dock,
two for night patrol and the 109.

504
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,600
Thank you, sir!

505
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,830
Oh why, what happened?
Somebody hit the fan? Cluster!

506
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,190
Rescue mission.
Can you get underway?

507
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,540
For a few feet. We've only got enough
gas for a test run. Why, what's up?

508
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,230
It'll have to do.

509
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,230
Marine paratroop battalion 
hitch was

510
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,570
filter cover for a real 
thing at Buganville.

511
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,270
To make it look big, they were
ordered to split into patrols

512
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,640
and raise scatter hell.

513
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,440
Alright Lenny, wind them up.

514
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,660
Alright.

515
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,640
One of those patrols is trapped
in the North end of the island.

516
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,920
We'll have to get them of
the beach. Here is your position.

517
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,540
What do you want me to do?
Beach it?

518
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,120
No, we have two LCVP's for that. Your 
job is to rendezvous and provide cover.

519
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,790
I suppose you know, with that 
little of gas we'll never get back.

520
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,980
I'll send you a tow.
That's all I can promise.

521
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,940
That's your best offer,
I'll take it.

522
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,420
- Good luck, Jack!
- Thanks!

523
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,830
Alright! Stand by, hand line.

524
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,360
What are you reading now, Lenny?

525
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,800
About 1800.

526
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,600
You got how many forts, skipper.
We're down to 300 gallons.

527
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,560
Yeah.
Thanks, Drewitch.

528
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,380
VP1. VP1. This is PT109.
Requests your instructions, over.

529
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,990
We're pinned down on the beach!
Need your gun, so we can run for it!

530
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,890
Give me your cover fire, while 
you are load and clear, over.

531
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,890
Alright Lenny, I'll take over.

532
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,770
All stations, stand by.
We're moving in.

533
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,100
Commence firing.
Commence firing.

534
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,450
Alright, stand by, Drewitch.
We are isling down.

535
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
That's some on the port side!
Right!

536
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,150
That's some on the port side!
That's some on the port side!

537
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,210
Give them a hand with 
that cargo net there!

538
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,570
Lean over.
Alright, let's go!

539
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,190
Skipper! Our fuel gages 
are bouncing on zero.

540
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,380
Get those men out of the water!

541
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,440
Get that water man aboard.
Get him down below!

542
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,760
All right. Get him around 
the other side! Come on!

543
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,220
Water man, help me!

544
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,530
Star, get on that gun!
Mack, over here!

545
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,380
Get those nets up!

546
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,120
Let's get out of here!

547
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,650
We don't stand a chance a hell to
get back to Tulagi unless you find

548
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,530
a gas station out here someplace.

549
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,640
We've had it skipper.
You better read the scales.

550
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,330
At least we are out of range, ha?

551
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,980
Yeah, but the tide is coming in.

552
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,560
Come in PT. Any PT.
This is Hangnail, come in please.

553
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,670
Come in PT. Any PT.
Come in please.

554
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,300
Any PT. Come in. This is Hangnail. 
Come in please, come in.

555
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,840
PT, this is Geronimo.
What's your pleasure?

556
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,780
Geronimo, we're dry up the beach.
Can you give us a tow?

557
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,450
That's what we're here for.

558
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,950
Well ,make it fast. 
Another two minutes,

559
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,850
those zeroes will be 
climbing down our backs.

560
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,890
Where the hell is he?

561
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,950
Hey, Jack!
Up from port bow.

562
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,680
Alright, Lenny, give them 
a hand with the bowline.

563
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:09,410
Right.

564
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,410
Okay, haul away.

565
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,410
Lenny.

566
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,010
Yeah.

567
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,680
Keep the crew in 
general quarters,

568
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,310
and let Tulagi know 
what's going on.

569
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:00,870
Okay.

570
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,300
How you doin'?

571
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,260
Fine, all I need are couple of
aspirines and a band-aid.

572
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,080
How you doin' Drawdy?

573
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,550
Not to good, sir.

574
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,560
Drewitch.

575
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:43,930
We're gonna be replaced Mr. Kennedy?

576
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,570
Yeah.

577
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,740
Don't do that to us.

578
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,740
I mean, just sittin' in the hospital 
with them bombs comin' down...

579
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,930
Wanna trade places?

580
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,090
That's a good idea, 
let him sit in a hospital.

581
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,660
No chance, ha?
I'm affraid not Drewitch.

582
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,440
We'll come and visit you.

583
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,680
I'll bring you over a snack 
every now and then.

584
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,160
Don't do us any favours.

585
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,230
Help you guys?

586
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,980
Yeah, we're replacements.
Is the XO aboard?

587
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,680
Be back in couple of minutes.
Come on aboard.

588
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,700
I'm Maguire.

589
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,150
Starkey, Johnston, Zinser. 
Hi, I'm McMahon.

590
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,580
Who we replacing?
Couple of guys in Arlington.

591
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,630
A little trouble at Schwartzsell,
nothing serious.

592
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,900
It's just the cook fishin'.

593
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,060
With the hand grenade?

594
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,500
In a war, you don't have time to 
sit around like Huckleberry Finn.

595
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,950
Come on, I'll take you down below.

596
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:35,990
<i>Well, today ain't gonna rain no more,
no more. It ain't gonna rain no more...</i>

597
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,170
<i>How in the world does Harris know 
it ain't gonna rain no more?<i>

598
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,070
Wanna hear some news?

599
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:41,590
The war is over.

600
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,220
No, that happens on Tuesday, or 
next week on Tuesday. We're going to

601
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,870
Rendova and Ritchie stays here.

602
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,390
You sure?

603
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,720
I just got the word 
from the yeoman upfront.

604
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,110
The way that Japanese flowers 
cover that Rendova frozen

605
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,790
you'd think that whole
war was taking place there.

606
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:58,240
Kirksey my boy, you got 
nothing to worry about.

607
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,440
All we get is a Japs, they got Ritchie. 
We're gettin' a better deal, believe me.

608
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,070
Is captain...?

609
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:13,650
Yes, sir.

610
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:17,630
Come in.

611
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:19,890
Captain.

612
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,290
Go ahead Commander.

613
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:28,350
Some of these yeoman can really foul 
things up. These orders are, all wrong.

614
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,500
The orders are correct.
You're staying behind.

615
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,430
Look captain, in three weeks,
this'll all be backwash.

616
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,690
You're doing a job here.

617
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,180
Oh, yeah...yeah, That's what 
they told me in the last war.

618
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,180
I was in destroyers, you know, 
greyhounds of the fleet...

619
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:48,670
sure, tied up to a pier in Bayonne,
New Jersey for the duration.

620
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,860
I know, I read your service record.

621
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,670
Oh, than you also know, I've been 
passed over twice already.

622
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:58,420
You're leaving behind 
a... could have began.

623
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,220
Look Commander, this 
is a different war.

624
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,820
Different breed of fighting men,
like these PT boys.

625
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,160
The trouble is, you've never made 
an effort to understand them,

626
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,660
I know they don't follow Navy regs.

627
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,570
Why should they? Fighting destroyers
from a piece of plywood.

628
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:16,330
Yes, yes, I suppose that's
what's eating me. Them in combat!

629
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,700
I've been in this Navy 25 years, I've
never been close enough to the enemy

630
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,410
to shake a fist at him!

631
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:31,810
Captain, I'm no hero, for all
I know, I may even be a coward.

632
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:35,600
If I am, I think I could 
live with it...but

633
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,960
at least I'd like a 
chance to find out.

634
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,030
Booish Pappy?

635
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,210
Wish sombody invent 
a middle age war.

636
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,540
You know, I don't get it.

637
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,540
All she asked of you, how'd 
you get trapped into this thing?

638
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:19,780
I have a stepson. He joined up.
Where does that leave me?

639
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,600
Well, I see your point,
but... it's coming with fog.

640
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,680
Can't very well climb up on my son's 
knee and ask him about the war.

641
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:29,840
It wouldn't be dignified.

642
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,630
Skipper, topside!

643
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,530
Snyby.

644
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,070
Yes, sir.

645
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,990
What's the serial number of that Jeep?

646
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:55,110
I don't know sir.

647
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,100
Find out, write it down.
I want the same Jeep.

648
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:57,810
Yes, sir.

649
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,480
Rogers.

650
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,210
Yes, sir.

651
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,370
About that mosquito netting,
I want it to arrive intact.

652
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,510
So pack it very carefully.

653
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:03,880
I'll try sir.

654
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:08,150
Don't try it. Do it! Because if I get
a bite, somebody's gonna get stung.

655
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,620
Request permission to come aboard.

656
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,590
Permission granted.

657
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,780
Thank you. I'm riding 
with you to Rendova.

658
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,700
Oh, are you in charge of the boat, sir?

659
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,400
Naturally.

660
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,420
Welcome aboard, sir.

661
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:22,830
Thank you!

644
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,460
Is this the way to... Columbus, Ohio?

662
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,800
I can't figure it out Mr. Kennedy,
I wind up in Tulagi,

663
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,570
so I make the best of it by trying 
to get to the maintenance officer.

664
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,500
Scuttled, but hazard, he stays behind.

665
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,350
Maybe you're not using
the right kind of juice.

666
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,690
Exactly, maybe I should of
gone to Harvard.

667
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,000
Hahvard.

668
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:46,470
Yes, sir.

669
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,640
Wind them up!

670
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,280
Stand by to cast off!

671
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,510
Alright, cast off your bowline!

672
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:15,090
Snyby!
Let's get the hell out of here.

673
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,370
Zero at 5 o'clock, sir!

674
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,630
General quarters, 
man your battle stations!

675
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,830
General quarters, 
man your battle stations!

676
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,150
Request permission to 
stand by to 20 millimeter.

677
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:11,770
Permission granted.
Thank you.

678
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,480
Engine room.
Stand by! General quarters.

679
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,240
-Two o'clock, sir! -Aft .50, manned and 
ready, sir! -2 o'clock, sir! -Very well!

680
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,980
Request permission to 
take over your gun.

681
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,010
Come on son, come on,
let me have a crack at him.

682
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,550
Go ahead sir!

683
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,040
Thanks.

684
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:27,040
You got him, sir!

685
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,280
Yeah.

686
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,180
Good shootin' Commander.

687
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,130
Ah, beginers luck.

688
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:06,530
Thanks son.
Thanks very much.

689
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:07,280
Yes, sir!

690
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:24,440
That was nice shootin' Commander,
let that plane just right.

691
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,910
Oh, thanks Marney.

692
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,610
Oh, I don't know, he just kind of... you
know, slit right into my line of fire.

693
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,670
You must have a lot of gunnery 
during the First war, right, sir?

694
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,350
Oh, nah, we can let it go...that!

695
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:36,960
Yes, sir!

696
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:05,830
Skipper!

697
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,800
Tryin' to beat us in.

698
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,410
There goes our sack time.

699
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,470
Not again.

700
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,970
Stand by your bowline.

701
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,760
Remember what Drawdy said 
about those engines, skipper.

702
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,500
Skipper! Skipper!
Can't reverse!

703
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,440
Clear the decks!

704
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,330
Jack, there is a boat coming out!

705
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,220
I see it, I see it.

706
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,600
Get a line over to those 
men in the water!

707
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,020
Get your spring lines over!

708
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,570
Marney, get the forward spring line!
Harris, get the aft spring line!

709
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,860
Starkey, fend her!

710
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,970
Ah, that tears it.

711
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,820
Harris, throw up the spring line!

712
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,120
Grab a line chief.

713
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:16,150
Gang way.

714
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,830
Alright, throw a jiggen fly, get 
those men out of the water!

715
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:19,730
Mauer, give them a hand.

716
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,860
Call in your bowline!

717
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,430
Mr. Kennedy.

718
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:30,920
Yes, sir!

719
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:33,130
Did you arrange this landing
for my benefit

720
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,180
or do you always
entering the port like this?

721
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,460
No sir, I tried to reverse my engines,
they're too fast to speed.

722
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,310
I'll put it on my report.

723
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,660
Just make sure it jabs with
my report Mr. Kennedy!

724
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,320
Yes, sir!

725
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,360
Free, Jack, take her home.

726
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,230
Well, I don't imagine I'm very 
popular with the seabee's right now.

727
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,250
Hello Jack.

728
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:14,790
- How are you?
Hey!

729
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:15,620
When did you come in?

730
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,840
Couple a days ago. Lenny,
welcome to your new home.

731
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,320
Thank you, sir!

732
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,610
That was a very impressive landing.

733
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,060
It didn't impress Ritchie.

734
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:25,920
He's a... a very sentimental man,
where's his boats are concerned.

735
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,540
Well, it's a job.
I can understand that.

736
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm glad you do.

737
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,660
You both are wanted up at the
operations right away. Come on.

738
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:33,980
What's up?

739
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:36,280
Briefing, something big,
I think.

740
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:39,470
You'll be assigned to Branninghan's 
group for the time being.

741
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,540
Squadron Commander?

742
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,140
Yeah, and a damn good one.

743
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,270
Hey, how come they call this
place, Todd city?

744
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:55,100
Leon Todd Jr., first PT man
killed at Rendova.

745
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,560
This way Jack.

746
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:22,960
This is it!

747
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,900
Jack, I'm leaving on a special
assignment for a few days,

748
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,980
I'll see you when I get back, ha?

749
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,770
Well, good luck, sir.
- You too.

750
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,460
And don't worry about 
wrecking that shed.

751
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:33,930
You're not the first one.

752
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,190
We have message from CTF31.

753
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:49,730
We gotta summarize.

754
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:52,960
The strong chance the Express
may run tonight.

755
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,130
That means the group of destroyers, 
plus heavy barge traffic.

756
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,760
Their mission is to land troops
and supplies at Vella.

757
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:01,130
My instructions are to 
use every available PT.

758
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:02,790
Four of our boats have radar.

759
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,190
The form of division are on 
each of those four boats.

760
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:08,480
Cookman, your group will patrol
south Ferguson Passage.

761
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,670
Scott, your area is east
of Makuti island.

762
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,610
Burnssen, your group will patrol
opposite Guattari village.

763
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:19,070
My group will be farthest up the strait,
opposite the village of Vanga Vanga.

764
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:22,800
This should be enough to stop any
move to Villa through Blackett strait.

765
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:23,720
We're on condition Red, sir.

766
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,410
Boat captains, man your boats.

767
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,930
Aah! Watch the kidneys, 
they only issue two.

768
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,600
Sorry, fella, I didn't see you.

769
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:48,560
Jack!

770
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,330
Hey, Barney, where did you come from?

771
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,430
Guadalcanal, I got my 
boat shot off under me.

772
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,240
What are you doing here?

773
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,500
Fighting the enemy.

774
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:00,720
I got to get to my boat,
I'll see you later.

775
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:03,940
Yeah, okay, Jack, Oh, wait, 
listen. Listen, Jack!

776
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,890
Stand by, engine room!

777
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,680
Where the hell is the skipper?

778
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,970
He's on his way.

779
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,650
Stand by that dock, right Mac!

780
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,160
Get ready to cast off!

781
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,980
Your engines all right down there?

782
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:03,250
What happened down there?

783
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:05,180
Harris, two o'clock!

784
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,770
Hey skipper, the water jackets are 
punctured, you can't run the engines.

785
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:14,070
Mauer, Maguire, forget those lines,
the engines are dead.

786
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,820
Harris, 9 o'clock.

787
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:28,750
Our position on Vanga Vanga
should be a very busy one.

788
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,500
If their destroyers try to cross 
Blackett strait,

789
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,440
be sure your fisher ready to fire.

790
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,790
If they try to go north 
around Kolembangara,

791
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:36,700
we have Burke's destroyers
and Kelly's PT's.

792
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,150
Lieutenant Branninghan.

793
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:39,750
What is it, Mr. Ross?

794
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,590
I'm without an assignment, if anybody
could use an extra hand, I'm available.

795
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,110
Well?

796
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:47,840
I'm putting on, a 37 mm, you 
can have a go work with them.

797
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,480
I'll take it.

798
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,690
Where did you get a 37 mm, lieutenent?

799
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,050
I find it laying around Tulagi,

800
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,200
I figured it'll give us a little 
added fire power.

801
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,340
Alright, Ross, you're on the 109.

802
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,820
That's it, monitor regular channels,
maintaine radio silence,

803
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,370
good luck, get going.

804
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,190
Didn't you had enough action
for one day, Barney?

805
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,930
Tend to stay safe on that island,
but bombs keep falling on it.

806
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,090
I'd rather had a boat under me.

807
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,240
You can operate a 37 mm?

808
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,940
Well, I'm pretty quick to learn.

809
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:24,940
Well, now we got a little class 
on this two by four.

810
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,670
What about the mounting, sir?

811
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,260
Lash it to the planks for now,
we'll bolt it on later.

812
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:30,230
Yes, skipper!

813
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:34,430
Will you tell me what we're
doing with an anti-tank gun

814
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,570
on the PT boat.

815
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:37,740
Skipper would mount a tank if 
he could find one.

816
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,410
All safe?

817
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,290
Take over Lenny.

818
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,540
I'm not too crazy about having
him around.

819
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,650
It's bad luck having a
stranger aboard.

820
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:06,740
Don't be silly, that's for a ships
like Moby Dick, not this one.

821
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,870
You'll have to show me how a 37 works.

822
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:16,040
I have a small confession Barney,
we'll learn together.

823
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:23,900
Hey, Mac.

824
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:26,310
Yeah, Andy.

825
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,440
Will you take care of my things?

826
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,670
What things?
What are you talking about?

827
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,370
My things, whatever belongs to me.

828
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,250
Look, when we get back,
you better sack in for a while.

829
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,400
I'm not coming back.

830
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,210
Bestow it!

831
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,590
Maguire, I'm gonna get killed!

832
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,850
Listen, last two boats I was on,

833
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,450
there was always a guy who thought 
is was gonna get his.

834
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,430
They knew too?

835
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,620
They knew nothing.
No one died in on those boats.

836
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:10,990
Hey, skipper.

837
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:12,900
Spare a minute?

838
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:14,070
Sure, what is it?

839
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,960
I think you better talk to Kirksey,

840
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,160
he's pretty they'll gonna 
mail him home.

841
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:21,950
Alright.

842
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:31,970
Hi, Kirksey.

843
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,040
Mr. Kennedy.

844
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,150
Jarvie?

845
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,090
No sir, thank you, sir!

846
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:47,940
Maybe I do need a cup, lieutenent.

847
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,690
I don't know what's the matter
with me Mr. Kennedy?

848
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:02,530
I got this awful feeling I'm
not coming back.

849
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,630
Andy, I don't think there is a 
man on this boat

850
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,030
who hasn't had that thought one 
time or the other.

851
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:10,660
You don't understand, Mr. Kennedy.
I don't think it, I know it.

852
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:15,590
Did you ever have a feeling, ahead 
of time, something's gonna happen'

853
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,470
right before dozer?

854
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,270
Yes.

855
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:22,580
It's like somebody put a cold hand
on my heart, I got chill.

856
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,060
I can't shake it off.

857
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:28,930
It could happen' Andy, you could die.
That's war,...

858
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,470
and ever I think about that, I try
to remember the odds are on our side.

859
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,480
Yes, sir. But the japs aren't.

860
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:43,350
You tellin' me I shouldn't worry, sir?

861
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:45,480
No, you'd be a fool if you did.

862
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:49,380
Than what can a man do, Mr. Kennedy?

863
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:51,360
Except pray.

864
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:52,660
You can do your job.

865
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:54,960
Like all of us.

866
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,210
See anything?

867
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:38,160
No, but the PT's should be on 
their station now.

868
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,690
They're gonna have a rough time 
finding anything out there tonight.

869
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:53,390
We're on station,
Vanga Vanga on a starboard beam.

870
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,460
Reduce speed to six knots.
Muffle all engines.

871
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:00,500
Inform the other boats by
blinker light.

872
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,770
Six knots.
Muffle.

873
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:22,420
Muffle down.

874
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:34,690
Message from Oak 11, sir!
Reduce speed to six knots.

875
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:35,680
Muffle all engine.

876
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:36,780
Thanks Mac.

877
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:37,590
Lenny.

878
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,940
Engine room, muffle your engines.

879
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:46,090
Can't see a thing tonight.

880
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,380
I hear we get radar next month.

881
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,420
Yap.

882
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,640
Sure is a lot of 
water out there.

883
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,930
That's just the top of it.

884
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:16,880
You spot the 159, Mauer?

885
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,630
No sir, not now.

886
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:23,470
She was off the port beam
about 10 minutes ago.

887
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,780
Radar contact.

888
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:47,910
Bearing 095.
Range 3500.

889
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,210
Must be barges close to the beach.

890
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,780
I just recieved orders from Oak Zero,
patrol south to a Wana Wana.

891
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,300
I don't know exactly where that is.

892
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,150
Lenny, check the chart.

893
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,860
Ship at two o'clock!

894
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:52,540
Somebody, somebody!

895
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,220
Help!

896
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,100
- Anybody below?
I don't know, sir!

897
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,430
Give Mauer a hand, 
look for survivors.

898
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,130
Yes, sir!

899
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,230
Mauer.
Haul away!

900
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:47,420
Pappy, Pappy!

901
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:51,940
Oh, my God!

902
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,770
Oh, God!

903
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:56,610
Hey somebody!

904
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,520
Pappy is all burned!

905
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:22,070
Somebody!
Maguire!

906
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,070
Johnston!

907
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,520
Marney!

908
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,630
Over here!

909
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:33,530
Johnston!

910
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:35,350
- Here!
- I'll get him! - Where?

911
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,900
Help me! It's Johnston!

912
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,320
I'm over here!

913
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,590
Help!

914
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:44,470
Can't feel my feet.

915
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,570
I got him, Buck.

916
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,120
Can you make it?

917
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:56,450
Johnston!

918
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:05,140
Can't feel my legs.

919
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:07,860
Come on Buck, we're almost there.

920
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,700
My leg go away.

921
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,520
Come on!

922
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:53,060
I'm going back for Bucky.

923
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:01,750
Mac, give me a hand!

924
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,580
Over here.

925
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,070
Take it easy.

926
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:28,950
How you doin' Bucky?

927
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,050
Leave me alone!

928
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:32,670
Come on!

929
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:34,210
Leave me alone!

930
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:35,970
Come on, Buck, it isn't far.

931
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:38,000
Come on!

932
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,280
Bad arm.

933
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:48,380
Easy.
- Mauer!

934
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:04,040
For a guy from Boston, you're putting 
up, hell of an exibit. Now, come on!

935
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,280
I don't need anybody... help.

936
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,390
Kick!

937
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:08,240
Kick!

938
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,740
Kick!

939
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:11,890
I can't...

940
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:12,810
Come on, kick!

941
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:14,950
Watch it, skipper!

942
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:15,760
Mac!

943
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:22,970
Come on, Buck!

944
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,250
We're here.

945
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:25,810
Okay, sir!

946
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:30,030
Watch his leg.

947
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:34,060
Everybody aboard?

948
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:36,770
Everybody but Marney and Kirksey.

949
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,060
Mac, take a look at the starboard side.

950
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:40,640
Yes, sir!

951
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:42,760
It's my legs, sir, they don't work.

952
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:46,970
Marney!

953
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:51,730
Kirksey!

954
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:54,600
Marney!

955
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:01,150
Marney!

956
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:02,680
Marney!

957
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,850
Kirksey!

958
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,340
Kirksey!

959
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,610
Marney!

960
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:10,340
Marney!

961
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,670
Kirksey!

962
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,120
Kirksey!

963
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:18,600
Marney!

964
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:22,520
Marney!

965
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,030
Marney!

966
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:26,800
Kirksey!

967
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,120
Marney!

968
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:30,460
Kirksey!

969
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:13,250
What happened to the 109?

970
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,140
There's been no radio contact since I
ordered them to patrol at Wana Wana.

971
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,910
Maybe operations know something.

972
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:25,780
Jim. Send this message to 
CO pack, Ron Baker on Guadal.

973
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:31,090
Belived PT 109, lost 
night action, 2, August.

974
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,800
Two miles, Northwest, Meressul.

975
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:34,910
Repeat, Meressul.

976
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:37,310
Crew of 13.

977
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:41,480
Request air search earliest possible.

978
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,580
Let captain Saunders release that.

979
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:46,370
Oh, Evans reported a barge of 
fire on oil slick

980
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:47,830
two miles Southwest of Meressul.

981
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:51,890
Well, that could be the PT109, maybe
the crew's in the water or the beach.

982
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:53,410
Let's hope so.

983
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,820
It's a hell of a time to
hitchhike Mr. Ross.

984
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:39,480
How's he doin' Lenny?

985
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,990
Third degree burns on both 
his arms.

986
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:44,200
Shoulders and his face aren't 
much better.

987
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,930
Zinser, how's Johnston?

988
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,640
He's better, sir,
he stopped throwing up.

989
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:55,670
If they come out here, what are
we gonna do? Fight or surrender?

990
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,670
What are you gonna use to 
fight with?

991
01:29:57,770 --> 01:30:01,790
We got 37mm, this tommygun and 
some 45's.

992
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:04,530
That ammo's been wet, suppose 
the guns don't fire.

993
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,180
Alright, than we'll throw bullets at 
them, but I'm not gonna surrender.

994
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,510
That's all right if they're a handfull,
but what if they send an army out here?

995
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,370
What's the difference who 
they send down?

996
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:12,150
Let's surrender.

997
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,590
We're not good to anybody dead!

998
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:14,250
I'm not gonna surrender!

999
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:17,270
Oh, that's okay for you guys,
I got a wife and three kids.

1000
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,650
Well, what makes you think you
gonna see them if you surrender?

1001
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:20,430
Knock it off!

1002
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:25,650
Lenny, give me that map.

1003
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,200
If this thing didn't go on,
we'll float right down to their laps.

1004
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:41,430
Question is: which island?

1005
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:50,900
You're not thinking swimming 
over there, are you?

1006
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:53,020
I'm open to suggestion Lenny.
You got any better ones?

1007
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,820
Most of those islands are held
by the enemy.

1008
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:58,820
You know Kolembangara is.

1009
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,160
We know Guizo is.

1010
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,950
Yeah, here's one.

1011
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,720
Plum pudding.

1012
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,160
About, three and a half miles.

1013
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:14,930
I think we can make it.

1014
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:16,960
Take us about four hours.

1015
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,020
It's our best bet.
- If it isn't?

1016
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,260
Sir, some of these men don't 
swimm to well.

1017
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:25,450
How far did you say 
that island was?

1018
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,810
Don't worry Bucky.

1019
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:29,580
We'll make it.

1020
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,310
You get 11 men in the water,
we'll be pretty spread out, sir.

1021
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,610
We'll lash the planks together.

1022
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:35,240
I don't think Pappy can make it.

1023
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:36,770
I'll take care of Pappy,
you stay with the other men.

1024
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:38,640
Come on, let's go.

1025
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:44,170
Maguire, take that bowliner,
lash'em to the plank.

1026
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:44,500
Yes, sir!

1027
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:51,320
You think we're gonna make it,
don't you sir?

1028
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:54,140
Take bets on it Bucky, either 
you're winner or don't pay off.

1029
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,790
That's it Pappy, put your feet
on here! Atta boy!

1030
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,510
Lift them up, up, Pappy.

1031
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:06,140
Okay, everybody get their shoes 
off and tie 'em to the plank.

1032
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:07,140
Put 'em later on.

1033
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:08,550
You got Pappy?

1034
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,450
Just easy, Johnston.
Watch your feet.

1035
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,100
You got 'em?

1036
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:15,240
Bring him on down here.

1037
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,270
Easy, easy on those burns.

1038
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:35,930
You all right Pappy?

1039
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,160
Four miles are long way.

1040
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,050
It's only three inches on the 
chart, Bucky.

1041
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:20,500
Skipper!

1042
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:22,000
There she rows.

1043
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:45,770
PWD, PWD, this is GSE.

1044
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,760
GSE, this is PWD.
Go ahead.

1045
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:53,130
Last night's fire seems to be small 
barge, it's afloat and still visible.

1046
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,110
Japanese island patrols are 
still active. Out!

1047
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,290
Albert, why the hell did you do
that for?

1048
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:23,420
They are heavy.
Who needs them.

1049
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,240
You'll find out when that coral
gets to you.

1050
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:38,190
Come on, Johnston.
Hang on there!

1051
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:43,890
We'll have you on that beach 
in no time.

1052
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:52,690
How you doin', Pappy?

1053
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,320
Okay, skipper.

1054
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:38,180
Hurry up!
Jap barge.

1055
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,380
Oh, my God!

1056
01:37:54,710 --> 01:37:56,550
Go further up the rush. 
Barney.

1057
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:13,970
You never introduced me to 
your friends?

1058
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:15,630
They'll be back.

1059
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:16,520
Wonderful.

1060
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:19,340
Our boat should be coming through
here tonight.

1061
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,580
Well, not neccessarily, he can
just woke up to Guizo strait.

1062
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,220
Well, then they have to go 
out this way.

1063
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:28,060
Well, if I can go out there with 
a lantern, we can flag 'em down.

1064
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:31,830
What, you went nuts. You'll have 
to check water all night long.

1065
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:34,270
There is a reef out there.
I can walk part of the way.

1066
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:39,240
Well, you'll never come back, buddy.

1067
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,760
Well, I can't send for room service!

1068
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:01,960
How you doin' Pappy?

1069
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,900
Fine, I just don't... look so good,
that's all.

1070
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:19,280
You know, maybe some oil from those 
coconuts might help those burns.

1071
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:20,320
Yeah.

1072
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:24,870
How about a signal fire, sir, 
just in case of the rescue party?

1073
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:27,370
Lit a fire, we'll be 
rescued in ten minutes...

1074
01:39:27,610 --> 01:39:28,800
...by the Japanese.

1075
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,740
They are all around us, Bucky.

1076
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,960
It's kind a like a bunch of burglars 
breaking into a police station,

1077
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,260
...it tends to be awkward.

1078
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:42,300
Some of the men are to hold down those 
coconuts. Try the oil on these burns!

1079
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:46,280
Oak leaf 1, this is Blue Jay.
We've spotted wreckage, mid channel.

1080
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:47,530
No survivors.

1081
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:52,210
Repeat, no survivors seen. 
Out.

1082
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,510
Lenny.

1083
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,720
Keep lookouts posted all night,
both ends of the island.

1084
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:17,400
Zinser, Mauer, take the first watch.

1085
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:24,570
Good luck!

1086
01:42:40,190 --> 01:42:42,420
Ain't that the biggest damn
fool you ever saw?

1087
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:44,280
Sir?

1088
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:00,630
Well, hope our boats come through
Ferguson Passage tonight.

1089
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,280
That's where he'll be.

1090
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:29,130
Oak Leaf, this is Tiger Tail Leader, 
over.

1091
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,700
Tiger Tail Leader, 
this is Oak Leaf, over.

1092
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:35,990
I've completed Vella Lavella sweep. 
I'm returning home!

1093
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,560
Your order, return Ferguson Passage...

1094
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:40,870
for channel is narrow, 
visibility low!.

1095
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,810
Request permission return 
Blackett strait, over.

1096
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:48,340
Permission granted, over.

1097
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:50,860
Roger, Oak Leaf, over and out.

1098
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:58,990
Let's go home, 
through Blackett strait.

1099
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:56,370
Making a record of how long 
we're stuck here. Notch a day.

1100
01:46:57,330 --> 01:46:58,730
Sure you got enough plank?

1101
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:09,070
All right, Starkey?

1102
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,750
What's gonna happen' to us,
Mr. Thom?

1103
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:13,830
We're just gonna sit out here and die?

1104
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:15,550
Skipper will turn up something.

1105
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,890
Skipper, he's been gone 10 hours!

1106
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:18,500
Where do they think we are?

1107
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,230
Down the ships store or AWOL?

1108
01:47:20,630 --> 01:47:22,580
We didn't get mislay, we're here!

1109
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:35,020
I wish I co... I wish I could do 
something to get their minds off this.

1110
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,130
Well, maybe they might enjoy, snooker
or tea dance or something like that.

1111
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,110
That's what we're really 
set out for, are we Lenny?

1112
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:50,990
Mr. Thom, Mr. Ross!
He's back!

1113
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:58,870
Hey, Thom, give me a hand!

1114
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:04,430
Move him off the beach.

1115
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:19,200
Take it easy!

1116
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:26,140
They didn't come.

1117
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:28,890
All I saw was a Jap barge.

1118
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:41,090
Barney, you go out tonight.

1119
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:56,630
Jack, I'm with you, you know that,
so is everybody else.

1120
01:48:57,790 --> 01:49:00,030
If something doesn't happen' 
pretty soon, we're gonna tap out.

1121
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:02,010
What do you mean?

1122
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:08,780
Well, a... there's a Japanese 
held island right over there.

1123
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:10,580
Yeah...?

1124
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:14,220
Some of the men feel it's better 
than nothing.

1125
01:49:14,270 --> 01:49:16,500
- It means giving up!
It means giving up, alive!

1126
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,850
- Nobody's giving up!
Nobody wants to give up, Jack.

1127
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,320
- Nobody's going to!
We're going to get out of here!

1128
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:25,720
Alright, we'll wait and see.
- Get some rest!

1129
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:28,220
You're going out!

1130
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,150
Tonight!

1131
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,070
Good morning, sir!

1132
01:49:59,120 --> 01:49:59,740
Good morning.

1133
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:00,650
Well?

1134
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,410
No sign of them, sir.
We patroled all night.

1135
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:04,060
Where?

1136
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:04,930
Blackett strait.

1137
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:07,530
Is that the only place they could be?

1138
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:10,720
You might as well face it, 
Commander, the 109 is gone.

1139
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:14,290
Just a minute, you! You think I worry
too much about those boats, don't you?

1140
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:16,390
No, but that's what you're thinking.

1141
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,940
So are lot of other people 
around here.

1142
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:21,390
Well, let me tell you 
something Mister...

1143
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,420
I worry about those boats, yes,
and for one reason.

1144
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:27,830
Those boats have a deck on 'em, 
and men stand on those decks.

1145
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,740
That's why I won't give up the 109.

1146
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,070
She had men on her deck.

1147
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:36,110
I don't want the deck back, I want 
the men that were standing on it.

1148
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:40,240
That's the only thing that matters 
in this whole big hairy world!

1149
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,260
And don't you ever give me any 
of your smart mouth again!

1150
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:16,710
You wanna put a high gloss 
on these please, porter?

1151
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:19,750
Wake my friend when he gets
to Hyenas port.

1152
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:41,300
Good luck, Mr. Ross.

1153
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,720
Well, there is nothing I got 
to be affraid off.

1154
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:47,440
Right Mac?

1155
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:49,750
Right, sir!

1156
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:52,180
Right.

1157
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:52,570
It looks is if they're checking 
island by island.

1158
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:54,480
Thanks Zinser.

1159
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,760
If they check this island, 
we'll have to take another swimm.

1160
01:53:00,310 --> 01:53:02,400
Either that, or we'll make a stand here.

1161
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:07,300
It's in the dozen men we 
kill 'em all, they send 500 more?

1162
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:12,270
Pappy.

1163
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:17,490
You put a little more that 
stuff on you.

1164
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,380
Skipper.

1165
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:20,570
Doesn't do any good!

1166
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:34,790
Skipper!
Skipper, he's here.

1167
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:53,580
Watch it, Mac.

1168
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,680
Get something.

1169
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:08,590
I'm sorry, Jack.

1170
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:10,870
I draw a blank.

1171
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:13,520
How do you feel?

1172
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:18,240
Okay, I reseted a while 
on that... little island.

1173
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:24,680
Alright, let's start lashing our gear
together, we're going to Olasana.

1174
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:29,060
Look, skipper, I can't walk on anymore 
reef, my feet are already cut to the bone.

1175
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:30,850
I won't be able to make Olasana.

1176
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:32,180
You're gonna have to make it.

1177
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:34,670
Why move at all? At least we know
there are no Japs here.

1178
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:37,290
We also know there is no food here.

1179
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:40,500
Well, we'll get food one 
this times, it'll be sukiyaki.

1180
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,920
At least out there we'll be 
close to our boats.

1181
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,850
They should be coming 
through tonight.

1182
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:47,590
The odds are on our side.

1183
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:51,280
Boy, you kill me.
You really do!

1184
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:55,010
Here we are, beat and burn
and given up for dead,

1185
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:59,340
living on green coconuts and no 
water in the middle of 1500

1186
01:54:59,390 --> 01:55:03,330
Japanese soldiers and you decide
the odds are with us!

1187
01:55:04,570 --> 01:55:05,880
It's a flaw in my character.

1188
01:55:10,890 --> 01:55:12,030
Almost there, Pappy.

1189
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:08,700
All right.

1190
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:11,450
We'll rest here a while.

1191
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:15,020
They almost got me iron 
for food and water.

1192
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:20,970
Lenny, you take Harris... Mauer,
to the north end.

1193
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,800
I'll take the others to the south.

1194
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:35,080
PWD, PWD, this is GSE.

1195
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,060
This is PWD, go ahead GSE.

1196
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:42,470
Further report on four deck of 109.
It is grounded on reef...

1197
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:47,550
at south Gross island. I'll repeat that.
Four deck 109, grounded on reef...

1198
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:50,620
at south Gross island.
Out.

1199
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:53,150
PWD acknowledges.
Out.

1200
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,840
Sir, how would you like
that coastwatchers job.

1201
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:04,200
Just sitting on the cliff with 
nothing to do but staring the space.

1202
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:11,310
Snyby, some men fight a war 
from the turret of the 16-inch gun.

1203
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:14,000
Other guys sweat it out 
at the office...or,

1204
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:18,320
or on top the the hill on some
God forsaken island.

1205
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,370
It doesn't mean their job is any easier.

1206
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:25,400
Evans is all alone on that island.
If an enemy patrol spots him...

1207
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:29,600
that's the way he's gonna die... alone!

1208
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:32,710
Remember that.

1209
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:34,850
Yes, sir!

1210
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:54,240
Mr. Thom!

1211
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:55,630
Yap?

1212
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:57,440
There's a canoe beach down there.

1213
01:57:57,550 --> 01:58:03,220
Hey, I think I found the owners. 
Take it easy.

1214
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,480
Hold it,
hold it.

1215
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:20,790
Put your guns down.

1216
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:23,160
We're Americans.

1217
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,070
They don't look too friendly.

1218
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,950
As long as they have those rifles!

1219
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:28,560
That's an open question.

1220
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:30,710
Tell you one thing:
those are Japanese rifles.

1221
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:35,100
Let's do something,
I don't trust them.

1222
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,140
Don't trust them or those rifles.

1223
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:43,430
Who are they, Lenny?

1224
01:58:43,490 --> 01:58:44,270
I don't know.

1225
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:49,270
Mr. Kennedy, those are 
Japanese rifles.

1226
01:58:50,370 --> 01:58:51,900
You speak English?

1227
01:58:53,450 --> 01:58:54,690
You know Rendova?

1228
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:58,380
There must be some way to get 
through to them.

1229
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,720
Try 'em at latin, Jack.

1230
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,600
You take a message to Rendova?

1231
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:10,730
What are you gonna use?

1232
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:14,020
I'll find something.

1233
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:33,690
Why don't we jump them, sir?
We can get the rifles and a canoe.

1234
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:36,250
Yeah... and deliver 
the message ourselves.

1235
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:37,290
No, wait!

1236
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:40,760
What about this, Jack?
It's smooth and everything.

1237
01:59:42,030 --> 01:59:42,760
Open it up!

1238
01:59:56,690 --> 02:00:00,300
I'm a friend of... Johnny Carrey.

1239
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:03,120
You know Johnny Carrey?

1240
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:05,790
Rendova.

1241
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:07,240
Johnny Carrey.

1242
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:11,300
This could backfire, you know?

1243
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:12,260
It could.

1244
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:15,840
Falls in a wrong hands,
it's like taking out an add.

1245
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:19,300
Time is running short on us, Barney.

1246
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:21,460
There, how's that?

1247
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:27,860
<i>NATIVE KNOWS POS'IT... HE CAN PILOT... 
11 ALIVE NEED SMALL BOAT... KENNEDY</i>

1248
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:30,810
Well, it might do it.

1249
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:43,500
You take to Rendova.

1250
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:49,100
Rendova.

1251
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:12,710
You think they'll deliver it?

1252
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:15,290
In my opinion, 
I think they'll eat it.

1253
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,650
Couple of guys like that 
you send to Rendova,

1254
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:22,500
they're level to show up in Seattle.

1255
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:27,820
That's all right. Last I heard,
Seattle was on our side, too.

1256
02:01:39,090 --> 02:01:39,580
Jack!

1257
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:42,280
Take a look at this.

1258
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:48,600
That's not even the way to Seattle.

1259
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:13,480
Any luck, skipper?

1260
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:15,680
No, no luck Zinser.

1261
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:22,620
Ain't no food, there ain't no 
water on any of these islands.

1262
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:28,740
I don't know about the brass,
but I made my last swimm.

1263
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,070
If I'm gonna die, 
I'll do it my way.

1264
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:39,890
Maybe we should of stayed on the 
four-deck. Somebody might of seen us.

1265
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:42,770
Don't start tellin' us 
what we should of done.

1266
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:45,390
You think we're better of here?

1267
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:49,490
I think somebody could of guess 
we got hit and had to abandon ship.

1268
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:52,160
We did abandon ship,
and abandoned us.

1269
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:55,030
Why do you have argue 
about every damn little detail?

1270
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:57,190
We wound up in the water.

1271
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:22,560
PWD this is GSE, calling.
PWD this is GSE, calling.

1272
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,190
This is PWD,
go ahead GSE.

1273
02:03:25,230 --> 02:03:27,070
I anticipate moving the 
station tomorrow...

1274
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:29,080
I can't get a good view 
of Ferguson Passage...

1275
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:30,880
or the west side of Blackett strait.

1276
02:03:30,930 --> 02:03:36,960
New position for station will be DOG34.
I repeat, DOG34. Final advise A.M.! Over.

1277
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:39,500
PWD acknowledges and out.

1278
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:41,510
Thank you PWD, GSE out.

1279
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:48,640
What good is it?
What good is it?

1280
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:49,590
Take it easy.

1281
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:53,080
What good is the damn thing? 
Who we gonna wave it at, ha?

1282
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:54,520
Nobody, that's who. Nobody.

1283
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:57,390
We struck out, Mac.
Admit it!

1284
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:59,740
Look, we still have something 
work aforce: there's two natives.

1285
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:00,840
Oh, they never got through.

1286
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:02,240
How do you know they didn't?

1287
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:04,110
Well, they didn't.
It's as simple as that.

1288
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:20,010
You don't have to pull rank 
on me Mr. Kennedy.

1289
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:22,350
We're not getting out of here
and I know it!

1290
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,520
Well, you don't believe it!
Neither does anybody else! Ask 'em!

1291
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:28,250
Mac.

1292
02:04:30,610 --> 02:04:31,500
I don't know, sir!

1293
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:33,990
Zinser.

1294
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:36,420
It's getting, so I really 
don't care, Mr. Kennedy.

1295
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:39,900
Well, you're gonna start right now!
All of us are.

1296
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,890
We're getting out of here, 
one way or the other.

1297
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:42,620
What about the natives?

1298
02:04:42,670 --> 02:04:44,090
If the natives don't do it,
we'll do it another way.

1299
02:04:44,150 --> 02:04:45,480
But we're getting out of here
if we have to get in the water

1300
02:04:45,490 --> 02:04:46,990
and drag this damned island 
back with us!

1301
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:22,590
Mr. Thom, Mr. Thom, there's a canoe 
full of natives off the beach.

1302
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:46,900
Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Kennedy.

1303
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:52,720
I am Kennedy.

1304
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:56,480
Mr. Kennedy. I'm Benjamin Kevu.
I have a letter for you.

1305
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:08,610
From an Australian coastwatcher 
named Evans, he got the coconut.

1306
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:16,670
In His Majesty's service,
senior officer, Olasana island.

1307
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:19,290
Friday, 11 P.M.!

1308
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:23,070
Just learned of your 
presence on Olasana.

1309
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:27,940
I strongly advise you return 
here in this canoe,

1310
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:32,280
by the time you arrive, I will 
be on radio communication...

1311
02:06:32,330 --> 02:06:34,550
with authorities at Rendova,

1312
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:39,000
where we can finalize plans to 
collect balance of your party.

1313
02:06:39,050 --> 02:06:40,340
A. R. Evans.

1314
02:06:43,950 --> 02:06:46,280
I suggest we leave as soon as 
possible. Enemy patrols erect.

1315
02:06:48,140 --> 02:06:51,030
Alright, keep the men posted 
undercover till I get back.

1316
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,840
If he just get pass those patrols.

1317
02:08:11,130 --> 02:08:11,940
what is it Kevu?

1318
02:08:11,990 --> 02:08:13,640
Japanese plane.
Please stay undercover.

1319
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:12,150
Hello, I'm Reg Evans, 
very glad you made it.

1320
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:13,500
Jack Kennedy, glad to be here.

1321
02:09:13,610 --> 02:09:16,590
Set a rendezvous for the
PT at Partpyren island.

1322
02:09:16,650 --> 02:09:18,830
In the meantime, we'll send you 
directly to Rendova.

1323
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:21,550
They'll never get pass those reefs,
unless I take them through.

1324
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:23,700
Yes, I totally agree.

1325
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:27,580
Alright, you make the rendezvous 
at Partpyren island at 0200 hours.

1326
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:30,160
PT will approach North by Northwest.

1327
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:32,200
Fire four identification shots.

1328
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:34,410
Well, I only have three rounds.

1329
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:35,240
Use this.

1330
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:36,020
Thank you.

1331
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:38,530
Like to give you a cup of tea,
but you don't have the time.

1332
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:39,620
I am very grateful.

1333
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:41,310
Glad to help Kennedy, good luck.

1334
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:00,140
Barney.

1335
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:01,680
Hey Lenny.

1336
02:12:05,370 --> 02:12:05,940
Barney.

1337
02:12:27,810 --> 02:12:28,920
Pappy, we're getting you home.

1338
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:43,200
Hello skipper.

1339
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:45,580
Hey skipper, you made it!

1340
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:02,350
Hey bartender, don't give 
my friend another drink,

1341
02:13:02,410 --> 02:13:03,850
you'll have to send him 
home in a cast.

1342
02:13:14,620 --> 02:13:18,260
Hey old buddy. We really won this 
poor game. We are on our way home.

1343
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:20,520
Home?

1344
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:23,910
That's right Jack, it's Navy custom.
You lose a boat...

1345
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,060
you rate a State side leave.

1346
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:27,460
That sounds great.

1347
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:29,260
I'd like that.

1348
02:13:32,570 --> 02:13:33,710
You're going, aren't you?

1349
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:39,520
Jack, you rated.
We all do.

1350
02:13:40,130 --> 02:13:40,650
I know.

1351
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:44,860
Then why not take it if you 
are entitled?

1352
02:13:46,270 --> 02:13:47,630
Nobody owns me anything, Barney.

1353
02:13:50,090 --> 02:13:55,690
The boats gone, two men, took me 
a long time to get out here

1354
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:57,240
I'd like to stick around a while.

1355
02:13:58,210 --> 02:13:59,540
Can you get me another one?

1356
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:03,160
Come.

1357
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:08,020
Well, Mr. Kennedy, could I talk
to you a minute?

1358
02:14:08,070 --> 02:14:09,600
Sure, come on in Albert.

1359
02:14:09,870 --> 02:14:11,220
Alone, sir.

1360
02:14:12,070 --> 02:14:12,720
Alright.

1361
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:14,540
Oh, stay here Jack.

1362
02:14:14,570 --> 02:14:15,140
Sir!

1363
02:14:15,690 --> 02:14:16,320
Give me a hand.

1364
02:14:16,370 --> 02:14:16,960
Sure, Barney.

1365
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:17,540
Take it easy.

1366
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:25,610
Come in Albert, wanna cup of coffee?

1367
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:26,910
No, thank you, sir.

1368
02:14:28,540 --> 02:14:29,350
Sit down.
- Thank you.

1369
02:14:33,730 --> 02:14:35,400
I just came in to say...

1370
02:14:37,570 --> 02:14:39,420
...well, I want to 
apologize Mr. Kennedy.

1371
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:40,620
For what?

1372
02:14:41,570 --> 02:14:45,740
Throwing that lantern around 
and poppin' of the way I did.

1373
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:47,930
There's nothing to apologize for.

1374
02:14:48,670 --> 02:14:49,630
Yes there is.

1375
02:14:52,850 --> 02:14:57,540
You are trying to get us out 
of this mess and a...

1376
02:14:57,600 --> 02:15:02,240
I start shouting about 
how... we won't be coming back.

1377
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:05,610
Havin' a fit all over the place.

1378
02:15:08,090 --> 02:15:12,160
I owe you an awful lot, sir and
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1379
02:15:17,350 --> 02:15:22,200
Albert, if I already get in a jam like 
this again, I hope I plunder a men

1380
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:23,290
like you aboard.

1381
02:15:24,770 --> 02:15:26,400
Men who aren't afraid to say 
what they believe,

1382
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:28,030
even though the odds are against them.

1383
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:31,720
So stay available.
Okay?

1384
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:32,810
Thank you, sir!

1385
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:53,020
Well?

1386
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:56,000
Ask me over to admiral.
Made me skipper of 61.

1387
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:58,970
Great. Watch out for Japanese destroyers.

1388
02:16:03,470 --> 02:16:04,360
Hey, skipper!

1389
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:06,500
Bucky.

1390
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:09,250
What boat you draw?

1391
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:09,920
59.

1392
02:16:12,230 --> 02:16:13,530
Another old one, ha?

1393
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:19,400
Well, well, what's old Bucky
gonna do with three weeks leave?

1394
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:21,700
Skipper.

1395
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:22,700
Hi, skipper.

1396
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:24,700
We're thinking of you.

1397
02:16:24,750 --> 02:16:26,040
Ship wrecked the top of the mog.

1398
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:27,340
Wage one for me.

1399
02:16:27,390 --> 02:16:28,450
Thank you, sir.

1400
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:29,860
Johnston.

1401
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,470
Thank you, sir.

1402
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:32,200
Bucky.

1403
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:34,210
See you again, Mr. Kennedy.

1404
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:38,080
Take me to the Golden Gate, James.

1405
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:46,760
Don't tell me.

1406
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:49,710
It's true. You're just 
lucky, Mr. Kennedy.

1407
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,930
Well, if you men hadn't had enough, 
you might as well stow your gear.

1408
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:57,000
Drewitch, Drawdy, you wanna help him 
fire up the engines and see what we got?

1409
02:16:57,050 --> 02:16:57,750
Yes, sir.

1410
02:17:04,310 --> 02:17:06,190
Maguire, sir.
Radioman, 2nd.

1411
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:08,070
Mauer, sir.
Seaman, First.

02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:09,490
What happened to your leaves?

1413

Stand by to cast off all lines.

1422
