...I will start by telling you
all about myself.

36
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,878
My name is Anne Frank.
I am 1 3 years old.

37
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,350
I was born in Germany,
but since my family is Jewish...

38
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,433
...we emigrated to Holland
when Hitler came to power.

39
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,151
Things went well for us until the war
came and the German occupation.

40
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,357
FRANK AND ANNE:
Then things got very bad for the Jews. "

ANNE: You could not do this
and you could not do that.

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,719
We had to wear yellow stars.

43
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,950
I had to turn in my bike.

44
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,714
I couldn 't go
to a Dutch school anymore.

45
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,997
I couldn 't go to the movies
or ride in an automobile...

46
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,991
... or even on a streetcar.

47
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,152
And a million other things.

48
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,393
But somehow, we children
still managed to have fun.

49
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,672
This morning,
Father woke me at 5:00...

50
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,877
...and told me to hurry
and get dressed.

51

We were going into hiding.

52

I was to put on
as many clothes as I could.

53
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,914
It would look too suspicious
if we walked along carrying suitcases.

54
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,509
We were going to disappear...

55

... that you 'll fly right up
to the ceiling. "

760
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:15,833
Why is it that every grownup thinks
he knows the way to bring up children?

761
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,468
Particularly the grownups
that haven 't any.

762
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:30,232
Monday, the 9th of November, 1942.

763
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,358
Wonderful news!
The Allies have landed in Africa!

764

MAN ON RADlO:
That measure of....

ANNE: Churchill spoke on the BBC
from London.

766
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,989
MAN ON RADlO: --which they have
so often meted out to others.

767
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,118
Ah, this is not the end.

768
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,438
It is not even the beginning
of the end.

769
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,036
No, but it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.

770
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,316
ANNE:
The air raids are getting worse.

771
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,871
The British planes come over, day
and night, on their way to Germany.

[EXPLOSlONS RUMBLlNG]

773
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:35,109
It's too much.
It's just too much.

774
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,752
Suppose they hit this house?

775
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,309
What will we do?
We can't go out in the street.

776
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,833
What will we do?

777
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,549
If they hit this house,
your worries will be over.

778
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,549
That big explosion,
an English plane fell right in this block!

779
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,278
Peter.

780
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,512
Peter!

781
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,759
FRANK: It's far away from here.
VAN DAAN: Please don't.

782
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,109
FRANK:
Just look at them.

783
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,840
Mrs. Van Daan,
this should be music to your ears.

784
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,069
-Music?
FRANK: Of course.

785
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,317
The more planes they send,
the sooner the war will be over.

786
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,359
-The sooner we'll be home again.
-I don't believe it'll ever be over.

787
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,593
Do you know what I'd like right now?
A cup of tea.

788
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,398
Oh, yes, please.

789
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,630
You can't have tea, then,
for breakfast.

790
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,268
If you have it now,
you won't have any tomorrow.

791
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,032
-I don't care.
-Neither do l.

792
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,229
Me too, please.

793
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,711
How about you, Mr. Dussel?
Tea now or tomorrow morning?

794
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,673
-Tomorrow morning.
-Sure?

795
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,319
Sure.

796
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,554
I'll take mine now.

797
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,832
The skylight!

798
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,077
FRANK:
Edith, come!

799
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,949
PETRONELLA:
Oh, Peter!

800
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,919
Peter! Peter!

801
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,958
Peter!

802
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,478
Peter!

803
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,912
FRANK: "Praised be thou, Lord,
ruler of the universe...

804
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,594
...who's sanctified us
with thy commandments...

805
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,752
...and bidden us kindle
the Hannukah lights.

806
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,629
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God,
ruler of the universe...

807
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:24,669
...who wrought wondrous deliverances
for our fathers in days of old.

808
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,877
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God,
ruler of the universe...

809
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,713
...that thou hast given us life
and sustenance...

810
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,838
...and brought us to this happy season. "
Amen.

811
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,792
-Amen.
-Amen.

812
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,669
ANNE:
Monday, the 7th of December, 1942.

813
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,400
The Hannukah holiday
came early this year.

814
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,312
"We kindle this Hannukah light...

815
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,756
...to celebrate the wonderful deeds
wrought through the zeal...

816
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,630
...with which God filled the hearts of
the heroic Maccabees 2000 years ago.

817
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,631
They fought against indifference...

818
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,873
...against tyranny and oppression,
and they restored our temple to us.

819
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,237
May these lights remind us
that we should ever look to God...

820
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,039
...whence cometh our help. "
Amen.

821
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,077
-Amen.
-Amen.

822
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:17,039
"l lift up mine eyes unto the mountains
from whence cometh my help.

823
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:20,510
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

824
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,989
He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

825
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,509
He that keepeth thee will not slumber.

826
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:29,719
He that keepeth lsrael doth
neither slumber nor sleep.

827
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,593
The Lord is thy keeper.

828
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,513
The Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.

829
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,590
The Lord shall keep thee from all evil.
He shall keep thy soul.

830
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,639
The Lord shall guard thy going out
and thy coming in...

831
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,469
...from this time forth and forevermore. "
Amen.

832
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,312
-Amen.
-Amen.

833
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,994
May I have the hats, please?
Thank you.

834
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,479
Very nice, very nice.

835
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,790
-That was very moving.
-lt isn't over yet.

836
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,030
-Sit down!
VAN DAAN: Where are you going?

837
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,668
There's lots more.
Songs and presents.

838
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,035
-Presents?
EDlTH: Not this year, unfortunately.

839
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,237
But always on Hannukah,
everyone gives presents. Everyone.

840
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,550
-That's right.
-Like our St. Nicholas Day.

841
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,709
St. Nicholas Day.

842
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,472
No, not like St. Nicholas Day.

843
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,790
What kind of Jew doesn't
know Hannukah?

844
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,235
EDlTH:
I remember particularly the candles.

845
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,318
First one, as we have tonight.
The second night, two.

846
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,995
The next night, three, and so on,
until eight candles are burning.

847
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:26,789
When there are eight candles,
it's truly beautiful.

848
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,999
What I remember best are the presents
we used to get, eight days of presents.

849
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,071
Each day, they got better and better.

850
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:36,755
We are all here, alive.
That's present enough.

851
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,276
No, it isn't.
I've got something.
