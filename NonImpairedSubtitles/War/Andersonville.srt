1
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:49,607
A skirmish has taken advance.
Commence firing!

2
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,027
Hold up!

3
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:09,202
Josie, go tell the captain
there's just a few of them left.

4
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:12,341
I think we can swing around and
drive them into his arms.

5
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,770
Yeah.

6
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,571
In five minutes,
unless he tells us no.

7
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,455
Ready.

8
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:31,291
Aim.

9
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,123
Fire.

10
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:35,025
Load.

11
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:42,466
- Fire by file. Commence firing.
- Sergeant says there's a few of them.

12
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,073
We can drive them into you,
unless you say not to.

13
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:47,004
I don't know there's such a few of them.

14
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:49,167
- Did you see any on your way?
- No, sir.

15
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:50,642
- Did you see cavalry?
- No.

16
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,075
Old Jimmy McSpadden.

17
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:54,443
He'll drive them, he'll drive them.

18
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:57,615
- You tell him to drive around.
- Sir.

19
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,721
As long as there's no cavalry.

20
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,596
Leave it there!

21
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,355
Hey, boys.

22
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,518
- Cousin Josie, are you hurt?
- No. Are you?

23
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,655
- How are you, sergeant?
- I'll live. Just a scratch.

24
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,297
Not such a few of them
as I thought, huh?

25
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:51,998
Sorry, lads, should have
known there were horses about.

26
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:55,235
This war has made me deaf and blind.

27
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,378
Is that James?

28
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,049
And Benjamin too.

29
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,227
My respects.
If you'll detail two of your men...

30
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,460
...I know you'll want
to bury your dead.

31
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,066
I thank you, sir.

32
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,645
You'll stay here
and move on in the morning.

33
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:37,252
- You got rations and blankets?
- Our haversacks are over there, sir.

34
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,184
- Have them brought over.
- Yes, sir. Jeremiah.

35
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,493
You all lie flat on the ground.

36
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:55,000
Nobody stands.
Nobody moves till morning.

37
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,100
Cousin.

38
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,711
Did you ever think?

39
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,143
No.

40
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:42,911
I never did.

41
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,157
What do we do?

42
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,033
Pick our time, make a run for it.

43
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,535
Now.

44
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,970
- They're all watching.
- But it's night.

45
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,974
Once you're in their prison camps, they
got you good. You heard the stories?

46
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,424
Here's what.

47
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:28,863
I'm gonna stand up real slow.

48
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,625
- You can't stand up.
- And I'm gonna say...

49
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,395
...I have to relieve myself.

50
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:38,836
They'll send a guard with me.

51
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,476
I got a knife in my pocket.

52
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:47,510
When they hear and they come after me,
you run for it. You run like the devil.

53
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:52,150
That farm with the smokehouse
we passed this morning...

54
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,619
...looks like Uncle John's?
- Yeah.

55
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,617
I'll meet you there soon.

56
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:05,390
- Who'll look after the sergeant?
- Don't worry.

57
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:09,665
Just give my love
to the ladies in Boston.

58
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,303
We will, sergeant.

59
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,777
Ready?

60
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,022
Yeah.

61
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:44,129
Listen, I gotta...

62
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,610
Billy!

63
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:57,776
Told you. Nobody stands,
nobody moves around.

64
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:04,960
Stay, Josie.

65
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,425
Nineteen Massachusetts?
Second Wisconsin.

66
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:49,036
You were on our left, second day
at Gettysburg.

67
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:54,302
- I remember. They couldn't move you.
- They tried hard, though.

68
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:59,108
They were on Cemetery Ridge.
Gave that place its rightful name.

69
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:05,579
- When'd they get you, boys?
- Yesterday, back there.

70
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,394
You know where they're taking us?
They won't tell us anything.

71
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:19,197
Well, I know they're not taking us
to Veracruz to fight Santa Anna.

72
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,192
Huh?

73
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,395
Your attention, gentlemen!

74
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,604
- Now, here's the situation.
- How you fairing, Billy?

75
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,712
You're gonna be here a spell, so...

76
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,212
...make yourself at home.
- Last night.

77
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,613
Stretch out on the ground,
but stay in this area.

78
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:40,313
We have some supplies coming,
but dispatch didn't say when...

79
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:43,458
...so it may not be until
after dark, even.

80
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,460
Some of your fellows tore up a tract
just north of here.

81
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,430
Until then, just rest easy.

82
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,626
I know some of you
haven't eaten today.

83
00:10:55,237 --> 00:11:01,574
And we're sorry, but we don't have
anything here. For you or for us.

84
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:05,143
- But, anyway...
- Come stay with me and the sergeant.

85
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:08,242
- Billy?
- Yes.

86
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:13,147
I'm gonna need your help with him.
Okay?

87
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,855
Okay.

88
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:19,461
Till then, just, please be patient.

89
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,586
All right?

90
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,601
You writing Bob's wife?

91
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,607
Yeah.

92
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,747
Right.

93
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:18,715
Well...

94
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,754
...when you finish with that one,
would you mind writing one for me?

95
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:29,159
- Sure.
- Afraid I never did learn my letters.

96
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:34,200
What's it like, being so educated?

97
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:39,136
I'm just an apprentice.

98
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:46,871
You just realize how much it is
you don't know.

99
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:52,213
Well, in that case,
I should be a writing fool.

100
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:56,347
Go on, write your letter.
I don't mean to be bothering you.

101
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,689
My father's a printer. He taught me.

102
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:06,061
My mother always read to me
while I was growing up.

103
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:15,241
My mother will have to go to
the priest to read what we send her.

104
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:18,346
I don't think she's ever got
a letter in her life.

105
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:22,974
Everybody up. Let's get a move on.

106
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:24,843
Get on your feet.

107
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:06,321
Officers. Over here, please.
This train's not for you.

108
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:10,659
On your feet now. I said, get up.

109
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:19,705
Let's go. Let's go,
Massachusetts, stay together.

110
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:25,340
- Sgt. McSpadden. Cpl. Day.
- Capt. Russell.

111
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:30,818
- How are you, sergeant? How's the...?
- Never better, sir.

112
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,620
You've always been good soldiers.
Always did what had to be done.

113
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:41,721
Bob's wife's address is on this. You
may have an easier time getting it sent.

114
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:46,857
- You take care of the boys, now.
- Yes, sir. Don't you worry, captain.

115
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:50,731
Just hate having to leave them.
We've been through a lot together.

116
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:55,866
You're in charge. You do what you can.
Something happens, you're in command.

117
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:59,242
- I'll do my best, sir.
- I know you will. God bless you, boys.

118
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,847
- Get in the car, now.
- Come on, guys.

119
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,314
I'll mail your letter.

120
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:07,888
We'll see you in Boston, captain.
You can bet it'll be a sunshiny day.

121
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,751
- Come on. Push them in back. Let's go.
- All right.

122
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,860
- Get going. Come on.
- We'll see you.

123
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,665
No, no, I don't think so.

124
00:15:58,073 --> 00:15:59,734
Come on, now.

125
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:38,710
Sir.

126
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:44,843
Let's get a blanket in here.

127
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:57,491
Left, company. March.

128
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,898
Forward march.

129
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,226
Come on. Pick up your feet.

130
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:12,966
- Come on, now, hurry it up.
- Whoa. Hold on there, Yankees.

131
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:20,504
- Caught us a couple of runaways.
- Sweet Jesus.

132
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,113
Come on, now.

133
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,320
Let's go, you Yankees.

134
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,716
Come on, now.

135
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,593
Now, halt.

136
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,995
Teach you to run.

137
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,632
All right. Come on.

138
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,041
Open the gate.

139
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:04,519
And what do you call this
little piece of heaven?

140
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:12,390
This? This is Andersonville.

141
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:23,335
- All right, now. Let's get a move on.
- Come on.

142
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:25,571
- Move, move.
- Get in there.

143
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,477
Let's go. Move it.

144
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,111
- The hell you waiting on, boy?
- Move it on, you dirty Yanks.

145
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:37,114
Come on. Move it. Move it.

146
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,386
Get in there.
I'm sick of looking at you.

147
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:55,775
- Hey, take a look at that.
- Anybody from the 5th New York?

148
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,710
- Where you from?
- Any word about the exchange?

149
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,504
Nice, fresh fish.

150
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:42,523
Fresh fish. Fresh fish.

151
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,257
Give it to me!

152
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:50,060
- Give it here.
- Move. Fresh fish. Move.

153
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:54,965
Hey, hey, fresh fish.
Welcome to Andersonville.

154
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:57,537
Fine-looking place, don't you think?

155
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,704
For a hog pen, maybe.

156
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:06,509
- Hey, where'd youse get catched at?
- Cold Harbor.

157
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:12,885
Well, that's good. Means Grant's going
forward, Bobby Lee's going back.

158
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,683
Let me show you around.
Get a good place to stay.

159
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,985
You want to be up by the wall,
away from the swamp.

160
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:25,498
It don't stink so bad there. There
ain't so many bugs. People neither.

161
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:29,467
You need to shave. Come on,
I'll show you where you can shave.

162
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:32,038
- Come on with me.
- Tyce, hold it. Hold it.

163
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,674
Munn, leave them alone.
Stay away from them.

164
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:37,141
Munn, you leave them alone! Get away!

165
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:41,380
I know what kind of man you are,
and you just stay away.

166
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,012
Let the fish go.

167
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:50,352
- We'll roast them another time.
- Don't waste your time with that bunch.

168
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:54,825
- Come back with your pards.
- And you know who they are, don't you?

169
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,329
We'll take care of you later.

170
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:09,501
Those are the Raiders. Hyenas is more
like it. And you stay away from them.

171
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:13,079
They steer the new boys over, whack
you on the head and kill you.

172
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,448
Try to take your stuff from you.

173
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:18,313
- Very much obliged, friend.
- Thank you.

174
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:19,977
Friend.

175
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:27,319
You don't know who I am?
Sarge? Josiah?

176
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:30,954
Now, old Dick. Now, I
signed up with you, young man.

177
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:35,695
I fought with all of you at Seven Pines
and the Chickamauga and Antietam.

178
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,634
- Dick Potter.
- Yes.

179
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:40,331
- Dick Potter. My God.
- Oh, my God, is that you?

180
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,136
Oh, my God!

181
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,677
- Dick Potter. Dickie!
- There's no food in here.

182
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:49,749
- Somebody stole my uniform off my back.
- You look fine there, Dick.

183
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:52,409
- Thank you, Tucker.
- We thought you were killed.

184
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:55,556
- We thought they got you at Antietam.
- I weren't killed.

185
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:58,520
They shot me in both my legs,
but I survived.

186
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:02,026
- I'll be damned!
- You're surprised to see me, huh, Josie?

187
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:04,563
- When are we going fishing again?
- We're going.

188
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:08,430
- The best fisherman in New Bedford.
- Yeah, yeah. That's saying a lot.

189
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,972
- God, I can't believe it.
- It's good to see you boys.

190
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,906
Listen, we gotta stay away from these
Raiders. Let's head up over here.

191
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:29,752
- Why doesn't somebody stop them?
- They run the place, sarge.

192
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:33,122
What do you mean, they run
the place? What about the Rebs?

193
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:37,026
- Why don't they stop them?
- Stop them? Hell, they trade with them.

194
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:40,896
Whiskey, food, rations.
Whatever they need, guards give them.

195
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:46,473
The 7th Vermont was in here. Took
their coats, shoes, blankets, rations.

196
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:49,132
- Jesus.
- Cold nights. Didn't have a chance.

197
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:52,405
- They didn't last a week.
- And they're on our side?

198
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:56,483
Bounty jumpers. Crawled out of the
sewers in New York for the money.

199
00:23:56,651 --> 00:24:00,417
Most of them thought they'd run
off before they'd see any fighting.

200
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,877
So I ask you again.

201
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:37,349
Where is my bridle and halter?

202
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,953
What? You don't care?

203
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:47,432
No rations today unless the goddamn
thief returns what he stole from me.

204
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,071
If you are digging tunnels...

205
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,874
...you will suffer the consequences.

206
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,313
Tunnels are useless!

207
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:10,049
Even if you are outside, I give any
two men a 12-hour start...

208
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,955
...and then track you with the dogs.

209
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:16,655
And you will suffer the consequences.

210
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:29,944
But why bother anyway?

211
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:35,475
I know absolutely
there are talks going on...

212
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,642
...this moment for exchange.

213
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,383
Any day now, all of you
will be paroled in quick order.

214
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:50,220
So we understand each other.

215
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:55,027
No bridle! No halter!

216
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,332
No rations!

217
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:06,845
You go on about your own business,
now, you know what's good for you.

218
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:12,053
They're gonna starve us to death
over his bridle!

219
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,248
Wirz is a goddamn liar!

220
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:20,986
- Give us anything.
- We've been through the mill already.

221
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:25,197
You boys didn't hear anything about
any prisoner exchange, did you?

222
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,335
- No.
- No?

223
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:32,303
Damn Wirz tells that to all the new
boys so they don't try and run off.

224
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:35,838
- Dick.
- Dick?

225
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:39,740
- Dick, you all right?
- You haven't eaten today?

226
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:44,077
No, I didn't eat yesterday either.

227
00:26:44,252 --> 00:26:49,053
Somebody stole a bridle,
and Wirz is punishing the whole camp.

228
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:50,555
Here.

229
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:53,287
- What is that, salt pork?
- Yeah.

230
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:56,259
Oh, my God. I ain't seen salt pork
since I been here.

231
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,127
Rebs gave it to us before
they put us on the train.

232
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:02,600
- I don't want it if the Rebs...
- Dick. Come on.

233
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,898
- Go ahead.
- Eat.

234
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:06,540
God bless you.

235
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:11,268
Wow.

236
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:17,346
- Have this here onion, Dick.
- An onion?

237
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,344
I forgot what an onion tastes like.

238
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:30,293
Anybody got anything else?

239
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,460
- Yeah.
- Good?

240
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:36,660
It's a meal fit for a king!

241
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,066
I feel much better, thanks.

242
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:44,640
God bless you. You boys wanna take
a walk around, see your new home?

243
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:46,440
- Yeah.
- Think so.

244
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:48,946
- Sure.
- All right. Help me up.

245
00:27:57,292 --> 00:28:00,022
Caught these boys trying to escape.

246
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,460
- How long they been in that thing?
- Since the day they caught them.

247
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:14,871
Is there a surgeon around here? The
sergeant took a bullet in the shoulder.

248
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,803
- I can take you down to sick hall.
- I'm fine, Dick.

249
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,811
It won't do you much good.

250
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,019
I'm gonna show you where
we ain't going fishing, Josiah.

251
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:36,562
They built this place downstream from
their tents, horses, dogs, everything...

252
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:41,131
...so they do whatever they do in the
water, even before it gets down to us.

253
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:46,002
You're seeing a tenth of what
we do to it, once it gets down here.

254
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:51,776
They do everything in there. That's
why this place has such a stink to it.

255
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,406
Don't worry. You won't notice
it after a couple months.

256
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,017
There's some boys digging a tunnel
to get out.

257
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:02,282
- Dick, they got kids watching us here?
- Yeah, the Rebs are running out of men.

258
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:05,824
They're robbing the cradle
and the grave to guard us.

259
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:09,525
Hey.

260
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:13,029
Ethan, don't do it.

261
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:17,367
It's a trick.
You know you can't trust the Reb.

262
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,006
- Hey, Johnny.
- Ethan.

263
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,041
- You got something to eat?
- Yeah, I got something to eat.

264
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,701
- What you got?
- I got two ears of corn.

265
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:28,713
I'll give you a dollar for them.
A Yankee greenback for both ears.

266
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,317
You come over here.

267
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:37,617
- Not me. I'm not coming over there.
- Why not?

268
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:40,761
Because it's the deadline.
You'll shoot me if I do.

269
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,898
- Who says he will?
- You want something or not?

270
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:46,898
- Ethan, come on.
- Yeah, I want two ears of corn.

271
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:49,935
Then step across.
Won't last long if you don't.

272
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:52,732
Don't trust him, he's a Reb.
Don't trust him.

273
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:56,709
- Is he playing a game with him?
- Do what you want, Yank.

274
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:01,315
This isn't a game. These kiddies,
they scare me worse than the soldiers.

275
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:04,316
They get a 30-day furlough
if they shoot one of us.

276
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:07,751
You better hurry. Going fast.

277
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,455
All right.

278
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,758
All right.

279
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:16,495
Here I come.

280
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:23,671
Hey, wait. Wait!

281
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,143
- He warned him. He warned him.
- I warned him.

282
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,451
You know the rules.

283
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:46,183
You all know the rules.

284
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:48,261
I warned him, lieutenant.

285
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:53,093
What do they do, Dick?
Shoot you for fun in here?

286
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,673
- Charge!
- Forward.

287
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:10,682
- Spread out.
- One, two, three.

288
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:13,013
Ready.

289
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,622
Hold the ranks.

290
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,125
About face.

291
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,492
Forward march!

292
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,534
- Captain? Capt. Wirz.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,265
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

294
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:37,468
I'm Col. Chandler. This is my aide,
Lt. Dahlgren.

295
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:41,638
The Department of War has detailed us
to inspect all our prison camps.

296
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:45,308
We'll try not to create a fuss,
so we may be here some time.

297
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,977
Of course. If there is anything
I can do for...

298
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,317
No, no, you just go on
about your duties.

299
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,483
Should I need to speak with you...

300
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,993
...l'll know where to find you.
Good morning.

301
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,995
Good morning to you, sir.

302
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:18,678
I feel like I gained 5 pounds of hair
and 10 pounds of bugs.

303
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,414
Well, you could use
a little bit more there, Dick.

304
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,354
Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel!

305
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,686
Where?

306
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,091
Over here.

307
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:35,932
You, come over here!
Yeah, you, get up! Get up, Yank!

308
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:38,197
Found the lowa tunnel. Headed this way.

309
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,102
Oh, well, then.

310
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:43,368
All right, move along, move along.
Come on, now.

311
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:47,947
- It's just a well. It's just a well!
- 184th Pennsylvania.

312
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,714
Gleason's men.

313
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,580
It's just a well, I tell you.
You gotta believe me.

314
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:54,722
- Shut up.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

315
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,221
- Hurry it up.
- No!

316
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:02,887
Dick, are those the fellas you say
are digging the tunnel?

317
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,398
You're my sarge...

318
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,593
...but there's some questions
in here that you just can't ask, sir.

319
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,476
Please go tell the sergeant I'd be
very grateful for a private word with him.

320
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:25,584
Tell him we mean no harm
and he can trust us. Go on, now.

321
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,584
Yes, sir.

322
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,775
Sgt. Gleason, I don't wanna do
anything against the grain here...

323
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:01,616
...but I've got some very good men
who'll do anything they can...

324
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,451
...to get out of this place.

325
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:16,995
So if there's any way we can help you...

326
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:19,639
...we'd be much obliged.

327
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,638
Call your men.

328
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,642
- Boys.
- Let's go.

329
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:32,553
- What's your name, sergeant?
- Jimmy McSpadden.

330
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:38,551
Bring him in.

331
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:49,227
All right, find a spot.
Benson, watch the door.

332
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:51,064
Yes, sergeant.

333
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:59,679
I told Sgt. Gleason we'd help with
the digging and be glad for the chance.

334
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:04,409
You men, you got any tools?

335
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,714
Got any tools for digging, men?

336
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,512
Knives, forks, spoons, pans, plates.

337
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,214
- Whatever.
- All that works.

338
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:14,452
- Dig them out, boys.
- That's perfect.

339
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:15,755
Cups.

340
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,024
What are the chances exactly
of getting outside the walls?

341
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,426
We know a thing or two about tunneling.

342
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:25,604
These gentlemen are from
West Pennsylvania. They're coal miners.

343
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:27,297
And when we get outside...

344
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:30,035
That's right. What happens
when we get outside?

345
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,270
They heard Wirz talking about the dogs.

346
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:34,274
We saw the dogs.

347
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:36,211
Who is this Wirz anyway?

348
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,876
Well, he's Prussian or Swiss or something.

349
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:44,218
He joined up with the Rebs.
He wants to be a general.

350
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,883
We shot his arm up pretty good
in some battle.

351
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,120
We got a surprise for him.
We got this...

352
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:51,231
Tobias.

353
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:57,168
Sir.

354
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:03,434
Sergeant, these men can be trusted.

355
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:13,078
All right, now. Olek, open it up.

356
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,821
- Jesus.
- What do you think of that, huh?

357
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:24,130
A slave working on the wall
brought us a map.

358
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:27,165
I mean, hell, we can go creek and river
the whole way.

359
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:32,170
Swim, float on logs, creeks to Flint River,
Flint to Apalachicola...

360
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,604
...Apalachicola down
to the Gulf of Mexico.

361
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,505
No dog alive can track us
if we never touch land.

362
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,938
- He's right.
- When can we start the digging?

363
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,449
- Soon as you eat in the morning.
- lf you eat.

364
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:51,352
It's hard work. You gotta keep
your strength up and your wits about you.

365
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:54,722
Things can get a bit squirrelly
down there after a time.

366
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:56,158
How long will it take?

367
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:00,323
I figure a month, maybe more,
maybe less. Now, listen here.

368
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:05,868
Pennsylvania boys know this, and you
Massachusetts men gotta learn it quick.

369
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,532
What goes on in here stays in here.

370
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,473
Good.

371
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,140
Well, all we have is some hardtack,
but you're welcome to it.

372
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,878
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Thank you.

373
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:22,044
- Thank you.
- Dick?

374
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:23,918
No, I had mine.

375
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:25,889
Thank you.

376
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,393
I gotta... I got some hard...

377
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:31,994
Sergeant.

378
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,158
All right, give him some air.
Massachusetts men, outside.

379
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,739
Yeah, Pennsylvania men too. Let's give
him some air. Martin, you stay here.

380
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:41,670
Sorry, I got a little addled.

381
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,400
That's all right, sergeant.

382
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:46,239
Took a bullet two days ago.
It's gotta come out.

383
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:48,177
All I got is this hunting knife.

384
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,079
You ever do anything like that before?

385
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:54,084
I don't see as we have a choice.

386
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:57,918
I guess not. See if we got some
rainwater out there and bring it in.

387
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:00,356
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,702
Look, I wish I had some whiskey
or something.

389
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:17,538
Me too. Of course, I always wish
I had some whiskey.

390
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,208
- All right.
- All right.

391
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,044
- Have at it.
- Okay.

392
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:37,230
I've got a new man who needs
some whiskey. I've got a shirt for trade.

393
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,958
Raiders got some whiskey.

394
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:45,127
Looking for some whiskey to trade.
Got a good shirt.

395
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:48,298
Looking to trade for some
whiskey. I got a sergeant.

396
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:50,967
They got whiskey up there.

397
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:57,139
Raiders got whiskey.

398
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:03,924
Go up there, you come back without
your shirt, without your whiskey...

399
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,992
...without one of your legs, if you're lucky.

400
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:08,492
We'll have our day.

401
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:10,823
When?

402
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:14,832
We'll have it.

403
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:21,271
I'm looking for some whiskey.
I got a good shirt to trade for whiskey.

404
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,171
Dickie, nice haircut.

405
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:26,074
Thank you, sir. I want you to meet Josiah.

406
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:27,578
- This is Patrick.
- Patrick.

407
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:30,148
- Drummer boy from New York.
- Nice to meet you.

408
00:39:30,317 --> 00:39:32,842
- They caught him in Culpeper, right?
- Yes, sir.

409
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,150
He's been here since they built this place.
We call him the oldest man in here.

410
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:39,087
- Give us a hand tonight?
- Sure.

411
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,923
- We're looking for whiskey.
- Got a good shirt. Need some whiskey.

412
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:44,462
We're looking for whiskey.

413
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,805
Sounds good, boys.

414
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:01,477
Louder, boys, louder.

415
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,812
A man needs all the music he can get.

416
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:09,316
Well, I seen
some nice, full haversacks, boys.

417
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,722
Hey, little Munn, any of them fresh fish
look wounded to you?

418
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:14,952
Not too many.

419
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:20,066
Oh, that's too bad.
Give me your cup, little rascal.

420
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:24,664
How the supplies doing, Curtis?

421
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,830
I ain't seen bacon in over a week.

422
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,840
- I'll see to it.
- You do that.

423
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,379
Delaney, I want a strict accounting
of our catch tonight.

424
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:36,516
You hear that, gentlemen?

425
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,744
We are doing business here,
and don't you forget it.

426
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,854
Gotta balance the books, huh?

427
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,856
That's right. Square the ledger.

428
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,860
Every day, boys, the population's
getting bigger here.

429
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,522
Each new fish brings something extra
to our table.

430
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,364
Stansfield, Sullivan...

431
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,336
...you keep them fires stoked.

432
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:03,099
We'll have a nice, long night of it.

433
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:56,423
Oh, you like music. I can tell.
You play anything?

434
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,691
No, I wish I did.

435
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,096
Why don't you sit up here? I'll teach you
a thing or two about the banjo.

436
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,206
- You will?
- Sure.

437
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:10,207
You stick your finger...
See this notch? Here it is.

438
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:13,673
Is there any way to get
a letter out of here, Dick?

439
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:18,614
Yeah. You give the guards $2.
You got $2?

440
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,119
- No.
- Well, I got $ 1 squirreled away...

441
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:26,692
...and I'd be glad to give it to you.
But they're gonna demand 2.

442
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,696
Josie, I gotta ask you.

443
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,628
You think my father knows
that I'm a prisoner?

444
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,293
If you all thought
that I was killed then...

445
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:42,208
I mean, I had written them this letter,
but them bastards, they...

446
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:46,039
They wouldn't send it.
They said $ 1 wasn't enough.

447
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:53,348
Just the idea that he thinks that I
might be dead, you know...

448
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:58,718
Well, just think, when you show up
alive and kicking...

449
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,891
I don't know about the kicking.

450
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,010
Hey, Dick.

451
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:33,916
Maybe tomorrow
we take them grayback racing.

452
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:36,586
What?

453
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:39,358
Graybacks? What's that?

454
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,434
In here, we call lice "graybacks."

455
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:46,937
We race them and bet on them.

456
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:50,201
We call Johnny Reb "grayback," right?

457
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:56,748
Well, in here, we call lice "grayback"
and Johnny Reb "lice."

458
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,748
Oh, that gets better every time I hear it.

459
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,721
The way you kill lice in here is...

460
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,453
...you hold your clothes up
as close as you can to the fire...

461
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:12,759
...without it catching, and you'll hear
them go... They'll pop right off.

462
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:15,697
As far as the gnats and the chiggers
and the flies...

463
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:20,135
...there's nothing you can do about them.
They get you even at the night.

464
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,974
Rain. You boys get a lot of rain here.

465
00:44:26,146 --> 00:44:29,206
Yeah, and when it rains,
you collect it in your clothes...

466
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:32,409
...and wring it out to drink.
Don't drink from that swamp.

467
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:37,990
I'm telling you, you'll get sick.
It'll kill you. I've seen it happen.

468
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:40,820
So, what do you do when it don't rain?

469
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:42,256
You do without.

470
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:46,857
You do? How?

471
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,932
Teach yourself.

472
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,938
You can get a swallow or two from one
of these wells every now and then...

473
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,771
...but, Josie, a lot of these boys
are not gonna be able to.

474
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:02,439
But you're gonna be able
to do it. Hear me?

475
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,949
Look, here. Patrick!

476
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,479
Hi.

477
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:12,454
This is for your sergeant.

478
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,993
Well, where'd you get this?

479
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,959
Well, wait a minute, the shirt.

480
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,126
Let me get that shirt. I had it,
but the sergeant...

481
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,203
The sergeant will taste this,
he'll think he's gone to heaven.

482
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:42,219
Will you show me
what else I need to do, Dick?

483
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:45,020
To stay alive in this place?

484
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:52,661
We're gonna go fishing again, Josiah,
just as soon as we get out of here.

485
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,904
I think about that more than anything else
since I been in here, casting a good line.

486
00:45:59,072 --> 00:46:01,836
You know, out of all my friends...

487
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,740
...my father, he always liked you
and your cousin the best.

488
00:46:05,913 --> 00:46:09,349
You know what? Me too.

489
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,409
Raiders! Raiders!

490
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:13,917
Everybody grab something.

491
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:17,352
Look out, there's more coming in
from over there. You...

492
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,754
- Go look after the sergeant.
- Right.

493
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:26,565
Take him!

494
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,574
That's him!

495
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:20,810
Get him!

496
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:44,504
Get everything they got, boys.

497
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:51,712
- Get everything!
- Get everything!

498
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:54,353
- Get all the shirts.
- There's two of them.

499
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:56,352
Give me that.

500
00:48:09,703 --> 00:48:13,139
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go.

501
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:22,305
- I got a banjo!
- Good for you, little Munn. Good for you.

502
00:48:23,216 --> 00:48:28,483
Stick with Collins, boys.
You'll live like kings.

503
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,907
- You all right?
- My shoes.

504
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,347
Good fight, men.
Massachusetts men, we all right?

505
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,419
My banjo! My banjo.

506
00:49:01,588 --> 00:49:04,682
- We'll get it. Martin, we'll get it back.
- Where's Josie?

507
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,349
Dick's dead!

508
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,759
Dick Potter. He's dead.

509
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:24,603
Dickie.

510
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,813
No!

511
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,552
Ninth Michigan.

512
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,156
Nineteenth Detachment Indiana.

513
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:26,662
Well, now, you been taking Dick
to the dead house?

514
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,339
Who's the Secesh?

515
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,681
Well, now, that is a very
important government colonel...

516
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:51,051
...the government sent down here
to inspect us.

517
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:56,927
Ain't it nice to know they care?

518
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,030
Got it coming from the dead house.

519
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,432
- Good to brace the tunnel with that.
- That's what I figured.

520
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,874
What are we doing here, boys?

521
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,883
Is that your banjo, Martin?

522
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,282
Was.

523
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,568
- Sarge, how's the arm?
- All right. How are you?

524
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,706
- How's the eye?
- Buggered my knee.

525
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:43,342
Billy, get some rainwater,
clean up the sarge.

526
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,978
- Trade for it if you have to.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:49,809
He's a good, good lad.

528
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,918
You know how many they got lying
in the dead house from today?

529
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,555
Forty-six.

530
00:52:56,723 --> 00:52:58,918
Sweet Jesus.

531
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:05,327
That's two by the Raiders, one shot at
the deadline. The rest of them... Starved?

532
00:53:05,498 --> 00:53:09,594
I don't know. They look water-bloated.

533
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,764
They're tying nametags around
the big toes of most of them.

534
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,105
So when they bury them,
there'll be some kind of record.

535
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,270
- You do that for Dickie?
- Yeah.

536
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,143
Good.

537
00:53:25,185 --> 00:53:28,120
He told me again about the water.

538
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,689
We can't drink from the swamp.
It'll kill you.

539
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:34,554
- We have to tell the men.
- Right.

540
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,292
Tuck! Thomas!

541
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:41,457
- Boys!
- Wisconsin, Ohio, over here.

542
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:48,807
How's your sergeant?

543
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,467
He don't look so good.
Took a crack in the eye.

544
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,708
I can still see good enough...

545
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:59,215
...to see you're no prettier
than you were yesterday, Tyce.

546
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:01,980
Now, listen. Go ahead, Josie.

547
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,352
Last night, Dick was telling me
about the water here.

548
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:09,556
You can't drink from the swamp.
It'll kill you.

549
00:54:24,744 --> 00:54:25,768
Tuck.

550
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:29,511
We need some shelter.
Sew us up something.

551
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:35,178
They got my kit last night,
my needles, thread, my shears.

552
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,518
Somebody'll have some.
Got some buttons?

553
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,286
Some brass buttons,
trade them to the Rebs.

554
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:44,191
Okay, Tuck, we'll get you
a needle and thread.

555
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,564
You call that music?

556
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:23,968
I've heard better noise come
out of dried chicken guts.

557
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:29,905
Here! Give us something
a man can dance to.

558
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:37,449
Dance, Collins!

559
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,412
Jig it up!

560
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,105
Anybody got $2?

561
00:56:12,752 --> 00:56:16,779
I need $2 to give to a guard
to send a letter to Dick's father.

562
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:38,204
God bless you.

563
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:46,115
All right. Now, Thomas.

564
00:56:46,286 --> 00:56:47,981
- We'll get it back.
- Don't do it.

565
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,519
- Thomas.
- That's foolish.

566
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:53,557
There's 10 of them for every one of...
I need you here!

567
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:12,143
Get these rations out of the road.

568
00:57:14,414 --> 00:57:16,507
Jesus.

569
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,081
That belongs to him.

570
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:06,663
And we want it back.

571
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:09,465
You do, do you?

572
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,232
Who's your best man?

573
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,397
He is.

574
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:22,644
That's the best you got? He's a baby.

575
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,145
Runt of the litter.

576
00:58:26,653 --> 00:58:30,987
All right, boys, make the ring.

577
00:58:31,157 --> 00:58:33,751
Draw the mark here.

578
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,750
Georgie!

579
00:58:41,568 --> 00:58:43,092
Three cheers for Georgie!

580
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:46,602
Hip, hip, hurrah! Hip, hip, hurrah!

581
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,765
Hip, hip, hurrah!

582
00:58:50,076 --> 00:58:53,910
Any of you wants to come in and get
a better look, you step right up.

583
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:58,779
- The bet is Georgie, under three minutes.
- I'll take some.

584
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:05,618
Thomas, you look out for this one.
He's a bad one.

585
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,692
He's killed men in here before.

586
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,623
Don't turn your back on him.

587
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,458
He don't fight fair.

588
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,059
All right. All right.

589
00:59:34,887 --> 00:59:37,048
Get up!

590
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:50,158
This time, we'll get you three of them.
We'll make it a fair fight.

591
00:59:52,438 --> 00:59:54,497
Come on!

592
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:21,700
Take his jacket off.

593
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,597
There you go, Thomas.

594
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:25,601
All right!

595
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:31,940
Hit him!

596
01:01:00,306 --> 01:01:02,137
Come on, Tommy!

597
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:18,554
Yeah!

598
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:16,305
You dirty coward, that's enough!

599
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,176
Okay, okay.

600
01:02:19,085 --> 01:02:20,882
That's enough.

601
01:02:22,455 --> 01:02:25,253
- He said, that's enough.
- All right, boys! All right.

602
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:28,889
We've had our fun for the day.

603
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,319
We want to leave something...

604
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:34,364
...for tomorrow, now, don't we?

605
01:02:36,903 --> 01:02:40,862
Next time, it'll be me and you, Limber Jim.

606
01:02:41,274 --> 01:02:44,038
Yes. One fine day.

607
01:02:51,584 --> 01:02:54,712
Easy, boys. Watch his head.

608
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:57,316
- Easy.
- Patrick.

609
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,822
Here's some water, Tom.

610
01:02:59,992 --> 01:03:01,516
Easy.

611
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:06,697
- Watch his bleeding.
- All right.

612
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:13,631
- We didn't get it back, did we?
- No, sir.

613
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,739
- I'm sorry, Martin.
- Next time.

614
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,709
There won't be a next time.

615
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:28,216
There will be no more fighting.

616
01:03:28,488 --> 01:03:32,515
There will be no more worrying
about the Raiders. You're wasting our time.

617
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:35,957
You're wasting our strength,
and that's the end of it.

618
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,696
You wanna live?

619
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,961
You wanna get out of here?

620
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:49,501
Then we gotta tunnel.

621
01:05:08,621 --> 01:05:12,682
"Tunnels are useless.

622
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,118
But why bother anyway?

623
01:05:17,363 --> 01:05:18,762
No."

624
01:05:22,468 --> 01:05:24,766
Oh, boy.

625
01:05:27,073 --> 01:05:29,906
Wait a minute, Massachusetts brother.
Wait a minute.

626
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:33,136
That's enough for you today.
You've been down three times.

627
01:05:33,312 --> 01:05:37,305
The quicker we get it dug,
the quicker we get out.

628
01:05:38,084 --> 01:05:40,882
All right, then. Go ahead.

629
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,555
Where's my shovel?

630
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:55,166
Hey.

631
01:05:56,268 --> 01:06:00,534
You have any troubles down there,
you just pull on this rope three times.

632
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:37,431
Martin?

633
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:43,743
How do you stay
under the ground digging without...

634
01:06:46,452 --> 01:06:49,785
A few minutes and I...

635
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:53,390
I just get...

636
01:06:55,895 --> 01:06:58,159
It's what I do.

637
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:06,001
- It doesn't scare you, being down there?
- No.

638
01:07:07,339 --> 01:07:09,569
Was it hard the first time?

639
01:07:09,742 --> 01:07:12,506
My father took me.

640
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:15,913
All his friends worked the mine.

641
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:20,351
Yeah, Sgt. Gleason's father
works the mine. Tobias' father.

642
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:23,249
Everybody worked the mines.

643
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:27,620
I look forward to it.

644
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:42,464
- How did you learn to play the banjo?
- My father taught me that too.

645
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:51,039
- You really think I can learn?
- Yes, sir.

646
01:07:51,517 --> 01:07:54,884
Yes, I do.
I could tell the other night.

647
01:07:55,054 --> 01:07:57,420
I could tell you were...

648
01:07:57,590 --> 01:07:59,956
You're gonna be good.

649
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:02,453
Real good.

650
01:08:10,569 --> 01:08:12,935
We'll keep watch with you.

651
01:08:14,807 --> 01:08:18,106
Long overdue, I say.

652
01:08:18,811 --> 01:08:20,676
Why just a watch?

653
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,406
Why not wade into them
and start breaking heads?

654
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:26,779
- That's what we should be talking about!
- Keep your voice down.

655
01:08:26,952 --> 01:08:31,013
You can't just wade into them.
There's too many of them.

656
01:08:31,323 --> 01:08:35,487
We'll get every man here.
Should have done it two months ago.

657
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:39,153
It's just that everyone thought
we was gonna be exchanged.

658
01:08:39,331 --> 01:08:42,630
Sure we will. Any year now.

659
01:08:42,802 --> 01:08:45,134
Did it when we should've,
my brother would be alive.

660
01:08:45,304 --> 01:08:49,638
- Maybe we ought to take them on, huh?
- Come on, what are we feared of?

661
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:52,710
We're not a bunch
of little girls, you know.

662
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,278
You can't keep a secret in a place like this.

663
01:08:55,447 --> 01:08:57,972
You try and get together 1000 men
to take them on...

664
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:00,482
...because that's what it'll take...

665
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:02,553
...and they'll get you first.

666
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,484
They will.

667
01:09:04,657 --> 01:09:07,455
There's a reason I don't want
to do anything just now.

668
01:09:07,626 --> 01:09:11,756
- Some of us are working on a tunnel.
- Yeah? well, so are we, but...

669
01:09:19,471 --> 01:09:21,996
Well, what do you think?

670
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:31,747
Well, for now we just keep a watch.
Not go after them.

671
01:09:32,351 --> 01:09:36,219
But any of the Raiders come fore,
the others will help out.

672
01:09:37,356 --> 01:09:40,189
We'll all stand up for each other.

673
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:42,122
All right?

674
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:47,666
Nobody say yes if you don't mean it.

675
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,222
You shouldn't have told
about us working on a tunnel.

676
01:10:15,394 --> 01:10:17,089
I know. As soon as I said it, l...

677
01:10:17,263 --> 01:10:19,663
Tunnel traitors turn you in
for half an apple.

678
01:10:19,832 --> 01:10:21,857
They were making all these excuses.

679
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:24,969
- We gotta tell Gleason.
- Yep.

680
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:29,196
Tunnel has to be rushed now,
whether we're tired or hungry or sick.

681
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,071
- We don't have a month anymore.
- Sergeant, I'm sorry.

682
01:10:32,244 --> 01:10:35,509
- I know I made a mistake...
- The three of you. Get outside.

683
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:37,478
Watch whoever heard you.

684
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,313
Any of them is a traitor, goes near a Reb,
you know what the hell to do.

685
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:19,015
Grundy.

686
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:23,687
There.

687
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,023
Tobias. I'll tell Gleason.

688
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,172
Sergeant.

689
01:11:35,808 --> 01:11:36,934
It's Grundy.

690
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:48,115
All right, boys. We've got a tunnel traitor.
Quickly, now. Quickly.

691
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,736
Lieutenant.

692
01:13:18,043 --> 01:13:19,908
Lieutenant.

693
01:13:21,246 --> 01:13:23,612
Hey, lieutenant.

694
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:26,316
I've got something for you.

695
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:30,847
- What do you got for me, Yankee?
- I'll meet you by the gate.

696
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:35,417
- Right now. All right?
- Tell me what you got now.

697
01:13:36,195 --> 01:13:39,323
- I've got informa...
- I've got a letter to be mailed, sir.

698
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,399
I'm told it takes 2 greenbacks.
Can you help me out?

699
01:13:42,568 --> 01:13:45,162
Is it unsealed?
I'm gonna read it, now.

700
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:47,202
- Yes, sir. It is.
- You're a dead man.

701
01:13:49,074 --> 01:13:50,063
Hey.

702
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,978
- Hey, now!
- What are you looking for, lieutenant?

703
01:13:54,146 --> 01:13:55,545
Lose something, did you?

704
01:13:55,714 --> 01:13:59,707
I'll tell you what he's looking for,
a 30-day furlough, the son of a bitch.

705
01:14:00,486 --> 01:14:03,512
By God, you bring him out here
on the double right now.

706
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:07,420
Let go of him! Pot-liquor bowl
full of you Yankee sons of bitches!

707
01:14:07,593 --> 01:14:11,996
You're gonna wish that you had crossed
that deadline and got your ass shot.

708
01:14:12,164 --> 01:14:16,760
Goddamn you, you Yankee sons of bitches!

709
01:14:59,878 --> 01:15:01,778
Thank you.

710
01:15:03,715 --> 01:15:05,580
It's a good tunnel.

711
01:15:06,151 --> 01:15:09,211
Good work, boys.
With the little time we had and the tools.

712
01:15:09,388 --> 01:15:12,755
It's not that good,
but it's good for all that we need.

713
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,051
Good job, boys.

714
01:15:14,226 --> 01:15:18,959
All right, the first thing we have to do
is figure out the order we go in.

715
01:15:19,131 --> 01:15:21,827
The first ones out have more
chance before the alarm.

716
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,468
More time to get away
from their damned dogs.

717
01:15:24,636 --> 01:15:27,605
Yeah. So we're gonna draw lots
to fix the order we go in.

718
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,001
No.

719
01:15:29,174 --> 01:15:31,369
Massachusetts men talked it over.

720
01:15:31,543 --> 01:15:32,805
It's your tunnel.

721
01:15:32,978 --> 01:15:34,502
You go first.

722
01:15:35,013 --> 01:15:37,004
He's right.

723
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:42,109
Well, you helped us dig it.

724
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:45,313
And you, you tunneling fool, Billy.

725
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:47,788
You get to Pennsylvania,
I got a job for you.

726
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,724
- Got a job for you.
- I'm never going underground again.

727
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:53,694
- No?
- I just want to get back to New Bedford...

728
01:15:53,865 --> 01:15:56,891
...and breathe some good salt air.
- You'll get that.

729
01:15:57,069 --> 01:16:00,698
Fair is fair. You first.

730
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:04,238
All right, all right. Agreed.

731
01:16:06,411 --> 01:16:07,969
Now...

732
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,011
...the second thing is, we need
one strong man to be last.

733
01:16:12,451 --> 01:16:16,080
To make sure everybody
gets through in case the support gives way.

734
01:16:16,555 --> 01:16:17,920
He's gotta be there...

735
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:20,684
...to drag everybody out
in case there's a cave-in.

736
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:22,658
I'll do that.

737
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,161
It's gotta be a mining man.
He's gotta see that cave-in coming.

738
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,895
I'll stay with him.

739
01:16:32,904 --> 01:16:35,839
- All right.
- John?

740
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:40,271
What do we do with him?

741
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:47,349
Leave him tied up there for a week.
It will do him good.

742
01:16:52,124 --> 01:16:53,887
Kill him!

743
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:58,594
Hold it, lads! Hold it!
He's not going anywhere.

744
01:16:58,764 --> 01:17:02,256
I'm keeping my eye on him
because I'm staying here.

745
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,197
I don't wanna slow you down.

746
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:12,002
Wait a minute. All we have to do
is get to the river, right?

747
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:14,907
- What is that? A mile?
- I can't tell from the map.

748
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,447
We'll leave him tied.
Someone will find him in the morning.

749
01:17:18,917 --> 01:17:20,782
- You're coming with us.
- Josie, I don't...

750
01:17:20,952 --> 01:17:22,078
How soon do we go?

751
01:17:22,587 --> 01:17:26,580
I figure there's only a couple
of feet left to dig. An hour or so, maybe.

752
01:17:26,758 --> 01:17:28,248
We should go first chance.

753
01:17:28,627 --> 01:17:31,221
Those bastard Raiders
may come after us anytime.

754
01:17:31,463 --> 01:17:35,194
Yeah, or sell us to the Rebs
for a crust of bread!

755
01:18:02,694 --> 01:18:04,059
We have to kill him, John.

756
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:07,892
We can't leave him to turn traitor
on someone else's tunnel.

757
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,797
- He's right.
- Should have killed him in the first place!

758
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,699
- No!
- Wait a minute.

759
01:18:13,872 --> 01:18:16,841
- Wait.
- Just do it.

760
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:20,801
Do it!

761
01:18:21,913 --> 01:18:23,437
Gleason.

762
01:18:24,082 --> 01:18:26,676
But, sergeant...

763
01:18:44,102 --> 01:18:47,629
So now all the boys will know
he's a tunnel traitor.

764
01:18:56,248 --> 01:18:57,977
Now nobody can take this map.

765
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,550
If you're caught,
it would lead them to the rest.

766
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,213
So you gotta study it now
so you can find your way.

767
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:08,120
I've already done my studying.

768
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:28,045
Give that man your old boots.

769
01:19:43,762 --> 01:19:45,127
Got anything to trade?

770
01:20:10,822 --> 01:20:12,255
Now, do like I say.

771
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:32,065
There's just one last thing.

772
01:20:35,814 --> 01:20:37,645
We're not all gonna make it...

773
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:40,216
...but whoever does is honor bound...

774
01:20:40,385 --> 01:20:44,151
...to get to Grant or Sherman
and tell them what it's like in here.

775
01:20:44,322 --> 01:20:49,453
Tell him how many of his men have died
and that he has got to exchange for us.

776
01:20:49,628 --> 01:20:50,993
That...

777
01:20:58,069 --> 01:21:02,665
We'll leave in two hours, and with
God's luck, we'll all meet at the river.

778
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:09,078
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant.

779
01:23:53,978 --> 01:23:55,411
Good luck.

780
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:58,606
You stay close. Follow me.

781
01:24:30,381 --> 01:24:31,939
Okay.

782
01:24:47,197 --> 01:24:48,926
All right?

783
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:24,930
Hey, Yank, stop!

784
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:28,896
- Yankees escaping!
- Yankees escaping. The east wall!

785
01:25:29,072 --> 01:25:31,370
Go! Go get them!

786
01:25:34,411 --> 01:25:35,435
Martin!

787
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:45,747
Yankees escaping! Get them dogs!
Open the gate!

788
01:25:46,356 --> 01:25:48,790
They're at the east wall!

789
01:25:50,427 --> 01:25:53,123
Saddle up them horses
on the double-quick now!

790
01:25:53,363 --> 01:25:56,594
Martin! Run! Run!

791
01:25:57,367 --> 01:25:59,494
They're about to the woods!

792
01:26:04,641 --> 01:26:06,768
Come on! Move it! Move it!

793
01:26:10,747 --> 01:26:13,807
Come on, you men! Come on, now!

794
01:26:13,983 --> 01:26:18,784
Soldiers, ride hard, now!
Ride hard, now!

795
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:21,150
Go! Get up there, now! Come on!

796
01:26:52,622 --> 01:26:54,089
Thomas!

797
01:26:54,257 --> 01:26:58,751
You hold there, now! Take this one back.
Put him in the stockade.

798
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:01,692
There's more game out there,
now, so let's go!

799
01:27:01,865 --> 01:27:04,231
Come on, get up.

800
01:28:22,312 --> 01:28:24,780
That tree. Tree.

801
01:28:25,748 --> 01:28:27,511
Come on.

802
01:28:33,456 --> 01:28:34,980
Come on.

803
01:29:12,228 --> 01:29:14,696
Look. Look.

804
01:31:09,612 --> 01:31:14,174
That's enough!
One, two. One, two...

805
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:24,125
No! No! No! No! No! Stop!

806
01:31:24,293 --> 01:31:25,954
Halt!

807
01:31:26,129 --> 01:31:27,824
Halt!

808
01:31:28,297 --> 01:31:31,630
These musicians,
they must be much, much better.

809
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:36,170
And this, what you call marching, you
will drill them until it's dark or after dark...

810
01:31:36,339 --> 01:31:39,103
...if necessary.
They must be perfect tomorrow!

811
01:31:39,275 --> 01:31:42,836
- Absolutely, sir. They will be.
- Oh, colonel.

812
01:31:43,946 --> 01:31:48,144
I hope you don't have to leave before
we can welcome Gen. Winder back.

813
01:31:48,317 --> 01:31:49,841
- Tomorrow morning.
- Oh, too bad...

814
01:31:50,019 --> 01:31:53,716
...because they will improve very much...
- lf you spent one hour a day...

815
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:57,656
...improving the stockade rather than
planning these ridiculous little ceremonies...

816
01:31:57,827 --> 01:32:00,796
Colonel, excuse me.
I'm in charge of the guard force...

817
01:32:00,997 --> 01:32:02,862
You're responsible for
operation of this prison.

818
01:32:03,066 --> 01:32:07,400
- Oh. Well, in part, but, colonel...
- May I ask you a personal question, captain?

819
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:10,232
- Something I need for my report.
- Oh, yes. Of course.

820
01:32:10,406 --> 01:32:14,172
I heard when you came here from
Switzerland you had medical training.

821
01:32:14,343 --> 01:32:19,474
- Absolutely true. I am fully qualified...
- To what? Allow this disgrace to civilization?

822
01:32:19,649 --> 01:32:22,584
Colonel, please. Don't speak like this
in front of my men.

823
01:32:22,752 --> 01:32:25,243
They'll hear soon enough.
I'm filing my report.

824
01:32:25,421 --> 01:32:29,619
There are things I must say to you,
but not in front of the men. We must talk.

825
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:33,728
Please. Colonel?

826
01:32:33,896 --> 01:32:35,557
Please.

827
01:32:36,966 --> 01:32:38,866
Thank you.

828
01:32:43,172 --> 01:32:46,266
Will you, please?

829
01:32:46,442 --> 01:32:49,707
Forward march!

830
01:32:50,113 --> 01:32:52,673
Will you please leave us alone?

831
01:32:52,849 --> 01:32:55,977
You must know, colonel,
Gen. Winder is in charge here.

832
01:32:56,152 --> 01:32:59,815
- Totally. Of food, medicine, supplies...
- I will report to the government...

833
01:32:59,989 --> 01:33:04,050
...what I think the general's responsibilities
are. If you would like to discuss...

834
01:33:04,227 --> 01:33:08,630
...your own responsibilities for the deaths
of more than 100 men in your care a day...

835
01:33:08,798 --> 01:33:11,790
- I only meant that...
- You, captain. You.

836
01:33:11,968 --> 01:33:15,529
In one week, you could've finished a dam
across the stream. Made floodgates...

837
01:33:15,705 --> 01:33:19,197
...to flush out the waste. Built
another camp to relieve crowding.

838
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:22,139
But you see, we have no tools.
I ask for sources...

839
01:33:22,311 --> 01:33:25,940
You have some tools, captain.
I took inventory.

840
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:29,516
You can parole prisoners to gather food
from nearby plantations.

841
01:33:29,685 --> 01:33:32,381
- I did, colonel, earlier, but they ran.
- Under guard!

842
01:33:32,555 --> 01:33:35,023
- And let the prisoners build shelters.
- We have no canvas!

843
01:33:35,224 --> 01:33:37,215
- Wood!
- I wanted them to have wood...

844
01:33:37,393 --> 01:33:40,760
...but Gen. Winder ordered all the trees...
- I have told you...

845
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:43,262
...I will not discuss
the general with you!

846
01:33:43,466 --> 01:33:47,197
Now, if you have anything else
to say on your own behalf...

847
01:33:54,877 --> 01:33:59,541
I most respectfully... Please...

848
01:33:59,882 --> 01:34:03,750
...you must tell them there is no one,
absolutely no one in this war...

849
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,980
...who has to deal with the
circumstances I have to deal with.

850
01:34:07,156 --> 01:34:11,058
You have seen. You know that.
But please tell them I do not complain.

851
01:34:11,227 --> 01:34:16,187
I am a soldier, colonel.
I know my duty and I fulfill it faithfully.

852
01:34:16,365 --> 01:34:20,301
Look at this arm of mine.
Shattered in the Battle of Seven Pines...

853
01:34:20,469 --> 01:34:23,233
Yes. You are a soldier, captain.

854
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:27,034
So when you personally ordered the stocks
to be built and the ball and chain...

855
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:29,872
- Only for escaped prisoners...
- You knew you were violating...

856
01:34:30,046 --> 01:34:34,779
...the Articles of War. As you knew you were
when you had food withheld from prisoners...

857
01:34:34,951 --> 01:34:36,976
...as punishment.

858
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:40,955
Now, was there anything else
you wanted to say?

859
01:34:44,827 --> 01:34:50,959
It's true, colonel. Of course it is.
It's all true.

860
01:34:51,133 --> 01:34:55,092
I know it will not surprise you that
I agree with everything that you say.

861
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:57,899
But I try, colonel. I try very hard.

862
01:34:58,074 --> 01:35:02,477
Look at those young boys in the
Fife and Drum Corps out there.

863
01:35:02,645 --> 01:35:06,775
I paroled them so they wouldn't
have to stay in that wretched stockade.

864
01:35:06,949 --> 01:35:11,181
I ordered the hospital moved out,
outside of the wall.

865
01:35:11,354 --> 01:35:13,515
Where the air is cleaner.

866
01:35:13,689 --> 01:35:20,026
I ordered the stockade made bigger,
but you know the problem.

867
01:35:20,196 --> 01:35:24,496
They just send us, all the time,
more and more prisoners...

868
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:29,570
...on Gen. Winder's orders, 33,000 now.

869
01:35:29,739 --> 01:35:32,731
When we were built for only 8000...

870
01:35:32,908 --> 01:35:37,345
...so of course I agree with you.

871
01:35:37,513 --> 01:35:41,882
With the proper help, we can do much more.

872
01:35:42,051 --> 01:35:44,645
Can you help us there, colonel?

873
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:49,382
The problem is, I need people.

874
01:35:49,558 --> 01:35:52,493
You know, perhaps...

875
01:35:52,662 --> 01:35:58,294
...if I was major instead of only captain...

876
01:35:58,467 --> 01:36:04,804
...then I would have more staff assigned
to me and we could start to solve...

877
01:36:04,974 --> 01:36:07,169
...those problems together.

878
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:12,244
They listen to you in Richmond, colonel.

879
01:36:12,415 --> 01:36:18,285
So I think if you put
that recommendation...

880
01:36:18,454 --> 01:36:20,319
...in your...

881
01:36:20,823 --> 01:36:22,586
In your report...

882
01:36:22,758 --> 01:36:27,286
...it would be most definitely helpful.

883
01:36:35,805 --> 01:36:38,069
Colonel.

884
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,640
Couple of these here are dead.

885
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:44,475
Looks like legs gave out.
They strangled.

886
01:36:44,647 --> 01:36:47,207
Think Capt. Wirz knows that?

887
01:36:47,383 --> 01:36:50,546
- I don't know if he does.
- Well, go tell him.

888
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,551
Yes, sir.

889
01:36:53,456 --> 01:36:55,788
Dear God Almighty!

890
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:05,264
Yes.

891
01:37:31,427 --> 01:37:34,453
This one's alive too, I think.

892
01:37:34,663 --> 01:37:37,029
These here ones are dead.

893
01:37:40,369 --> 01:37:43,338
Lieutenant, mind helping me
get these ones back inside?

894
01:37:44,673 --> 01:37:47,972
Help us with the gate, sir?
Eugene, get them to the dead house.

895
01:37:48,144 --> 01:37:49,873
- Let's go.
- I'll get another wagon.

896
01:38:12,301 --> 01:38:15,134
Those who are not shot...

897
01:38:15,304 --> 01:38:19,070
...are caught by the dogs without fail.

898
01:38:19,642 --> 01:38:23,976
And put in the stocks or ball and chain.

899
01:38:26,549 --> 01:38:31,316
But still, if you escape the dogs...

900
01:38:31,487 --> 01:38:36,720
...go hundreds of miles to your own army?

901
01:38:38,027 --> 01:38:39,494
Not possible!

902
01:38:50,906 --> 01:38:56,708
Everybody's saying you got real close.
Closer than anyone ever did.

903
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,838
Saw the river.

904
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:07,049
You think Sgt. Gleason got away?
I mean, really away?

905
01:39:09,191 --> 01:39:12,092
Maybe. Maybe.

906
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:14,556
Good chance.

907
01:39:19,268 --> 01:39:20,963
I don't want it.

908
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:25,868
I don't want it. No!

909
01:39:28,244 --> 01:39:29,768
You gotta eat, Billy.

910
01:39:32,248 --> 01:39:34,375
Gotta eat.

911
01:39:35,084 --> 01:39:37,609
I don't want to.

912
01:39:37,786 --> 01:39:38,946
I don't want to live.

913
01:39:40,155 --> 01:39:42,146
Not here.

914
01:39:43,058 --> 01:39:47,427
As soon as I can stand,
I'm gonna walk across the deadline.

915
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:54,693
Tunnels are useless!

916
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:57,168
Gonna die anyway.

917
01:39:57,339 --> 01:40:01,776
Come on, Billy boy! Come on!

918
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:11,247
You gonna leave the rest of us
alone here, Billy?

919
01:40:12,855 --> 01:40:14,755
Yeah.

920
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:18,593
I am.

921
01:40:19,828 --> 01:40:24,162
Goddamn it, Billy. We're gonna
make it through this together...

922
01:40:24,333 --> 01:40:28,235
...or we're not. Together!

923
01:40:30,472 --> 01:40:33,908
Don't make it easy for them.

924
01:40:38,247 --> 01:40:39,805
Now, eat.

925
01:40:42,718 --> 01:40:47,417
- Eat!
- Okay. Okay.

926
01:41:07,943 --> 01:41:12,039
- Hey, hey, hey! Fresh fish.
- Sergeant. Move them out.

927
01:41:13,115 --> 01:41:15,208
Hey.

928
01:41:16,352 --> 01:41:17,649
Fresh fish.

929
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:22,519
Welcome to Andersonville.
Fine-looking place, don't you think?

930
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:25,384
For a hog pen, maybe.

931
01:41:27,463 --> 01:41:30,864
- You some of Grant's men from Virginia?
- Yes, sir.

932
01:41:31,033 --> 01:41:33,467
- Yeah? Is that where youse get catched at?
- Yeah.

933
01:41:33,636 --> 01:41:38,699
Good, good. Let me show youse around,
get you a decent place to stay.

934
01:41:38,907 --> 01:41:42,707
You wanna be away from the swamp.
Come on. You hungry?

935
01:41:42,878 --> 01:41:46,473
Get you something to eat. Come on up here.
You'll like it up here.

936
01:41:46,649 --> 01:41:50,551
How long's it been since you ate?
We'll get you fixed up, me and my pards.

937
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,744
Just follow me.

938
01:42:02,865 --> 01:42:06,062
Clean the fish, boys. Come on.

939
01:42:09,505 --> 01:42:10,870
- Whose move?
- It's your turn.

940
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,667
- My move?
- Yes.

941
01:42:12,841 --> 01:42:16,436
All right. Son of a gun.

942
01:42:16,879 --> 01:42:20,645
- I don't know. Awfully sharp.
- How is the game?

943
01:42:20,816 --> 01:42:23,410
- Going pretty good.
- He's cheating me.

944
01:42:24,553 --> 01:42:26,384
All right.

945
01:42:26,555 --> 01:42:28,386
- One, two, three.
- No, no, no.

946
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:32,287
- Yeah, yeah.
- He did it again. Cheeky little bugger.

947
01:42:32,494 --> 01:42:37,989
Beats me every time. Olek, tell me.

948
01:42:38,167 --> 01:42:42,661
When you were coming
out of the tunnel with Gleason...

949
01:42:44,106 --> 01:42:47,564
Patrick, you finish the game later.

950
01:42:47,743 --> 01:42:50,303
Go ahead, Patrick.
I want to speak to the doctor.

951
01:42:50,779 --> 01:42:53,441
- Yes, sir.
- Finish in a minute.

952
01:42:53,982 --> 01:42:57,748
He's a good boy. Little cheater.

953
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:02,755
Now, when you were
coming out of the tunnel...

954
01:43:03,692 --> 01:43:09,187
...could you see Gleason?
Did you see what happened to him?

955
01:43:09,364 --> 01:43:14,427
The dogs. Dogs got him.

956
01:43:14,603 --> 01:43:19,302
I got up a tree. He wouldn't stop.

957
01:43:19,475 --> 01:43:24,606
He kept running for the river,
swinging a stick at those dogs...

958
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:28,181
...but, Jimmy, you can't outrun dogs.

959
01:43:32,488 --> 01:43:35,480
I heard it.

960
01:43:35,657 --> 01:43:38,285
Knew they got somebody.

961
01:43:39,762 --> 01:43:44,358
- Glad I didn't see it.
- I didn't either.

962
01:43:44,533 --> 01:43:47,161
Didn't want to.

963
01:43:47,336 --> 01:43:51,432
I'm not telling them. No point in it.

964
01:43:51,607 --> 01:43:54,337
He was like a father to them.

965
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:59,072
- He was a fighter.
- I just say I didn't really see.

966
01:44:36,552 --> 01:44:37,780
When I get out of here...

967
01:44:42,591 --> 01:44:45,458
...l'm never going south of New Bedford.

968
01:44:58,574 --> 01:45:00,439
Ever.

969
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:12,953
Those who are not shot
are caught by the dogs without fail...

970
01:45:13,121 --> 01:45:17,148
...and put in the stocks
or a ball-chain.

971
01:45:17,626 --> 01:45:23,929
But still, if you escape the dogs
to walk hundreds of miles...

972
01:45:24,099 --> 01:45:29,594
...to your own army... Not possible!

973
01:45:30,572 --> 01:45:33,564
Tunnels are useless!

974
01:45:35,043 --> 01:45:40,572
Even if you are outside,
I give any two men a 12-hour start...

975
01:45:40,749 --> 01:45:44,082
...and then track you with the dogs.

976
01:45:44,253 --> 01:45:47,313
And you will suffer the consequences.

977
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:51,855
But why bother anyway?

978
01:45:52,294 --> 01:45:58,130
I know absolutely there are talks
going on this moment for exchange.

979
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:01,133
You're a damn liar, Wirz.

980
01:46:02,137 --> 01:46:05,868
- Any day now, all of you will be...
- lf John Gleason gets to Uncle Billy...

981
01:46:06,041 --> 01:46:11,069
...or old Ulys, then we'll get exchanged.
You bet on it.

982
01:46:11,246 --> 01:46:15,546
So I suppose we understand each other.

983
01:46:26,428 --> 01:46:28,225
Move. Hey.

984
01:46:28,397 --> 01:46:32,731
Hey, fresh fish. Welcome to Andersonville.

985
01:46:33,835 --> 01:46:36,804
Fine-looking place, don't you think?

986
01:46:39,174 --> 01:46:41,836
For a hog pen, maybe.

987
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:44,638
- Where'd youse get catched at? Virginia?
- Yes, sir.

988
01:46:44,813 --> 01:46:49,216
That's good. Means Grant's going forward,
Bobby Lee's going back.

989
01:46:49,384 --> 01:46:51,716
Just the way we like it.

990
01:46:51,887 --> 01:46:54,651
Let me show you around,
get you a good place to stay.

991
01:46:54,823 --> 01:46:59,157
You wanna be up near the wall, away from
the swamp. Don't stink so bad there.

992
01:46:59,361 --> 01:47:01,693
Ain't so many bugs neither.
Come on. You hungry?

993
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:05,358
I'll get you something to eat.
What happened to you?

994
01:47:05,701 --> 01:47:08,192
Well, we'll take care of that. Come on.

995
01:47:08,403 --> 01:47:11,497
- You'll like these people up here.
- Look at these vultures.

996
01:47:11,707 --> 01:47:14,232
- my pards are up on high ground.
They'll fix you up.

997
01:47:14,409 --> 01:47:18,573
Just waiting to rob and murder the new boys.
Look at them!

998
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:22,409
- Thieving, stinking cowards!
- We'll get you fixed up. Me and my pards.

999
01:47:22,584 --> 01:47:26,452
Jim. Jim.

1000
01:47:26,621 --> 01:47:28,521
Jim, there's a thousand of them.

1001
01:47:28,857 --> 01:47:31,257
They have clubs and knives.
We have nothing.

1002
01:47:31,793 --> 01:47:37,993
Who's with me? Who? Who?

1003
01:47:38,633 --> 01:47:44,094
Who's with me? Who?! Who?!

1004
01:47:44,272 --> 01:47:46,103
Who?!

1005
01:47:46,274 --> 01:47:47,400
Who's with me?

1006
01:47:48,610 --> 01:47:52,205
I'm with you, Jim!
We're with you! We're with you!

1007
01:47:52,381 --> 01:47:58,047
- Who?!
- You want them? Then let's get them!

1008
01:48:02,457 --> 01:48:07,258
- Who?!
- I'm with you. By God, I'm with you.

1009
01:48:07,429 --> 01:48:09,488
What are you standing there for?

1010
01:48:09,965 --> 01:48:13,958
- We're with you.
- Form up! Form up!

1011
01:48:20,409 --> 01:48:22,502
Form up, boys! Form up!

1012
01:48:26,381 --> 01:48:28,372
Who?

1013
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,183
Who?!

1014
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:33,954
Form up!

1015
01:48:43,165 --> 01:48:44,427
Who?!

1016
01:48:53,809 --> 01:48:57,108
Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!

1017
01:51:03,572 --> 01:51:06,803
I waited for this day.

1018
01:51:08,777 --> 01:51:11,405
Come on. Come on!

1019
01:51:12,881 --> 01:51:16,078
- You slime-swilling pig.
- Come on!

1020
01:52:33,695 --> 01:52:38,860
Hey! Hey! Wait till everyone's here
before anybody gets anything.

1021
01:52:39,034 --> 01:52:43,733
- Let me see that.
- Look, my shirt!

1022
01:52:43,972 --> 01:52:48,534
Martin's banjo.
Hey, we found your banjo, Martin.

1023
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:53,972
- I say we hang them.
- Yeah!

1024
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:55,741
- I say we hang them all!
- Yeah!

1025
01:52:55,917 --> 01:52:59,512
- String them up! Murdering devils!
- I'm doing it with my own two hands!

1026
01:52:59,688 --> 01:53:03,988
Now, just hold your horses, Jim.
We're not murderers.

1027
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:08,255
- Murder? To hang them?
- What they did was murder!

1028
01:53:10,332 --> 01:53:12,027
We're not hangmen.

1029
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,260
Anybody who wants to help,
you come ahead.

1030
01:53:15,437 --> 01:53:20,272
But if nobody has the sand for it,
I'll do it myself.

1031
01:53:20,442 --> 01:53:21,875
And I'm going to start...

1032
01:53:22,744 --> 01:53:25,474
...with you.
- Now, wait a minute, Jim.

1033
01:53:25,647 --> 01:53:28,582
- What about them? Do we hang them too?
- It's not murder!

1034
01:53:28,750 --> 01:53:31,048
- It's justice!
- That's right.

1035
01:53:31,219 --> 01:53:37,385
I think the first thing we have to do,
before anything else...

1036
01:53:37,559 --> 01:53:39,026
...is give them a trial.
- A what?

1037
01:53:39,194 --> 01:53:40,661
A fair trial.

1038
01:53:40,829 --> 01:53:43,229
Show them the fairness
they showed my brother!

1039
01:53:43,398 --> 01:53:47,061
- They killed over 200 men in here!
- We must give them a trial.

1040
01:53:47,235 --> 01:53:52,263
A fair trial with a jury and witnesses
and a judge.

1041
01:53:52,474 --> 01:53:54,271
- What?
- Why?

1042
01:53:54,709 --> 01:53:57,507
Are we so much better?

1043
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:59,840
If we do to them what they did to us?

1044
01:54:01,683 --> 01:54:04,846
- I think he's right!
- No!

1045
01:54:05,086 --> 01:54:09,352
All right, all right. A trial. That's gonna
take time. What are we supposed to do...

1046
01:54:09,524 --> 01:54:14,484
...with them in the meantime? If we keep
them here with us, someone'll kill them.

1047
01:54:15,130 --> 01:54:17,724
- Yeah, they will.
- All right.

1048
01:54:19,267 --> 01:54:21,132
- We'll ask Wirz.
- Wirz!

1049
01:54:21,302 --> 01:54:25,568
We'll ask Wirz to keep them
under guard outside the walls...

1050
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:29,039
...and deliver them back to us
for trial when ready.

1051
01:54:36,851 --> 01:54:39,046
Bring them all in.

1052
01:55:07,982 --> 01:55:10,542
How would this trial be conducted?

1053
01:55:11,619 --> 01:55:15,055
According to the rule of law, captain.

1054
01:55:15,223 --> 01:55:19,455
Both sides would have lawyers
to speak for them.

1055
01:55:19,627 --> 01:55:22,687
The Raiders would be allowed to
speak for themselves...

1056
01:55:22,864 --> 01:55:27,096
...question the witnesses, provide...
- You would have a jury?

1057
01:55:27,836 --> 01:55:31,704
Yes, sir. New men who come in
after today...

1058
01:55:31,873 --> 01:55:35,331
...so they wouldn't be prejudiced
against the defendants.

1059
01:55:36,845 --> 01:55:41,873
I've never in my life
heard of anything like this.

1060
01:55:44,152 --> 01:55:49,454
These men, these Raiders,
they are as bad as they say?

1061
01:55:49,624 --> 01:55:52,252
Animals, captain.
Cutthroats and murderers.

1062
01:55:52,427 --> 01:55:56,090
Even as Yankees go,
these are the worst of the worst.

1063
01:56:06,908 --> 01:56:11,072
If I allow this, it will make your task easier...

1064
01:56:11,246 --> 01:56:13,510
...keeping order in the stockade?

1065
01:56:13,681 --> 01:56:17,674
Might just do that, sir.
They're real troublemakers.

1066
01:56:26,895 --> 01:56:30,558
I've seen you before, haven't I?

1067
01:56:30,732 --> 01:56:35,431
I was one of the men caught escaping.
You had me in the stocks for a week.

1068
01:56:37,872 --> 01:56:42,309
And you won't make
that mistake again, will you?

1069
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:51,450
- As a lawbreaker, you agree with this?
- Yes, I do, captain.

1070
01:56:59,661 --> 01:57:04,689
I will get you the law books.
Keep the proceedings in writing.

1071
01:57:04,899 --> 01:57:09,859
You will send the findings and the sentences
to me, and if everything is in order...

1072
01:57:10,405 --> 01:57:13,306
...the sentence will be ordered for execution.

1073
01:57:13,875 --> 01:57:18,312
Keep the ringleaders under lock and key
until they ask for them.

1074
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:20,310
Sir.

1075
01:57:21,115 --> 01:57:22,912
Well?

1076
01:57:23,618 --> 01:57:26,109
Have your trial.

1077
01:57:42,904 --> 01:57:47,034
Quiet down! Let's have order!

1078
01:57:56,250 --> 01:58:00,152
- Quiet down! Quiet!
- Quiet!

1079
01:58:00,321 --> 01:58:04,985
- Who's speaking first?
- I am, Your Honor.

1080
01:58:10,665 --> 01:58:15,602
Sgt. Horace Trimble,
9th Indiana Volunteers...

1081
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:18,898
...appearing for the prosecution.

1082
01:58:19,374 --> 01:58:25,279
And may I present to this court
the Honorable Jared Hopkins, Esquire.

1083
01:58:26,547 --> 01:58:27,707
I want order!

1084
01:58:27,882 --> 01:58:33,946
102nd New York Volunteers
appearing for the defense.

1085
01:58:37,792 --> 01:58:40,761
- All right!
- Order!

1086
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:47,031
It is my job to prove to these men...

1087
01:58:47,201 --> 01:58:50,227
...who arrived here but yesterday...

1088
01:58:50,405 --> 01:58:53,169
...that the men here on trial
behaved like savages...

1089
01:58:53,341 --> 01:58:55,332
Damn right!

1090
01:58:55,943 --> 01:59:00,175
...barbarians and worse in this camp...

1091
01:59:00,948 --> 01:59:04,907
...while the rest of you are soldiers
in the Federal Army...

1092
01:59:05,086 --> 01:59:09,955
...who conducted and
will conduct yourselves accordingly.

1093
01:59:11,592 --> 01:59:15,494
I trust there'll be no more such outbursts.

1094
01:59:17,265 --> 01:59:22,635
Mr. Hopkins, I beg your pardon.
Please say what you have to say, sir.

1095
01:59:33,981 --> 01:59:36,745
What could you have to say?

1096
01:59:38,119 --> 01:59:41,987
I do not envy you men at all.

1097
01:59:43,424 --> 01:59:48,452
Yesterday, you arrived in hell.

1098
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:52,497
I do not speak lightly.

1099
01:59:54,802 --> 01:59:59,796
Andersonville is not just
a place without food to eat...

1100
01:59:59,974 --> 02:00:02,636
...or water to drink...

1101
02:00:02,810 --> 02:00:07,713
...or a place to come in out of the rain from.
- Save your crap!

1102
02:00:15,289 --> 02:00:18,417
It is not just a place where guards...

1103
02:00:18,593 --> 02:00:22,120
...murder us for their sport.

1104
02:00:22,296 --> 02:00:24,457
Hang them! Kill them all!

1105
02:00:24,632 --> 02:00:29,126
It is a place without civilization.

1106
02:00:29,637 --> 02:00:32,470
It is a place without law!

1107
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,437
Stop this farce now!

1108
02:00:35,977 --> 02:00:37,501
Order!

1109
02:00:37,678 --> 02:00:41,136
- Let's have some order here!
- And you will hear how men...

1110
02:00:41,315 --> 02:00:42,407
...good Union men...

1111
02:00:42,583 --> 02:00:44,483
Traitor!

1112
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:47,313
Traitors!

1113
02:00:47,655 --> 02:00:49,816
Were driven mad!

1114
02:00:49,991 --> 02:00:54,655
- Now, I will not be silenced!
- You're gonna hang!

1115
02:00:54,829 --> 02:00:58,663
These men were driven
by these circumstances...

1116
02:00:59,167 --> 02:01:01,431
...not of their own making...

1117
02:01:03,004 --> 02:01:07,839
Not of their own making to commit,
understandably...

1118
02:01:08,009 --> 02:01:09,943
Liar! No! No!

1119
02:01:11,879 --> 02:01:16,578
...acts of desperation they never would
otherwise have committed!

1120
02:01:16,751 --> 02:01:17,877
We stood it!

1121
02:01:18,052 --> 02:01:20,577
This is hogwash! Hang the bastards!

1122
02:01:23,691 --> 02:01:26,091
I will be heard!

1123
02:01:26,694 --> 02:01:27,752
Order! Order! Order!

1124
02:01:27,929 --> 02:01:33,697
I will be heard!

1125
02:01:41,943 --> 02:01:48,348
That is the second reason
I do not envy you men.

1126
02:01:50,451 --> 02:01:55,445
You are being asked to sit in judgment...

1127
02:01:55,623 --> 02:01:58,888
...on soldiers in your own Federal Army.

1128
02:02:02,730 --> 02:02:05,893
These men are victims as well...

1129
02:02:06,067 --> 02:02:11,232
...and their conduct
must be understood...

1130
02:02:11,405 --> 02:02:15,569
...as being caused by the Rebels!

1131
02:02:17,578 --> 02:02:23,983
- The Rebels... The Rebels are the ones...
- I want justice!

1132
02:02:24,485 --> 02:02:28,353
...ought to be on trial before you...
- I followed the law!

1133
02:02:29,824 --> 02:02:35,262
...not the men of your own army.

1134
02:02:41,102 --> 02:02:42,865
Call your witnesses.

1135
02:02:52,947 --> 02:02:57,611
We charge these men here
with being thieves...

1136
02:02:57,852 --> 02:03:00,787
...who stole from their fellows...
- I'm no traitor!

1137
02:03:00,955 --> 02:03:04,789
...food, clothing,
possessions of every kind...

1138
02:03:04,959 --> 02:03:07,018
And more!

1139
02:03:07,194 --> 02:03:10,686
...always brutally and without mercy...

1140
02:03:10,865 --> 02:03:14,028
...frequently under cover of night.

1141
02:03:15,136 --> 02:03:19,197
You will have all the witnesses
to that you want.

1142
02:03:20,808 --> 02:03:23,971
Is there anyone here
who can say they did more...

1143
02:03:24,145 --> 02:03:25,134
Yeah!

1144
02:03:25,313 --> 02:03:29,545
...who saw one of these...?
I exempt the six ringleaders.

1145
02:03:29,717 --> 02:03:34,154
Who saw one of these commit
or order another to commit murder?

1146
02:03:34,322 --> 02:03:40,727
- Stealing food's just as bad as killing them!
- lf so, and he will swear to it...

1147
02:03:41,562 --> 02:03:43,427
...let him now come forward.

1148
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:04,014
Is there anyone here who saw one
of these six commit murder...

1149
02:04:04,185 --> 02:04:06,176
Yeah!

1150
02:04:06,354 --> 02:04:10,085
...or order another to commit murder
of another federal soldier...

1151
02:04:10,257 --> 02:04:11,918
Yeah!

1152
02:04:12,093 --> 02:04:18,362
...to steal his goods
or for any other reason?

1153
02:04:18,532 --> 02:04:23,595
If so, and he will swear to it...

1154
02:04:24,038 --> 02:04:25,938
...let him come forward now.

1155
02:04:26,107 --> 02:04:28,041
I'll swear.

1156
02:04:28,209 --> 02:04:29,540
I swear!

1157
02:04:30,277 --> 02:04:31,869
I swear!

1158
02:04:32,446 --> 02:04:34,209
- I swear!
- I'll swear!

1159
02:04:34,382 --> 02:04:36,782
I'll swear, by God!

1160
02:04:38,052 --> 02:04:39,041
I swear!

1161
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:40,551
Yeah, I'll swear!

1162
02:04:41,889 --> 02:04:45,950
- I'll swear!
- I'll swear. Collins will hang.

1163
02:05:11,419 --> 02:05:13,353
I swear.

1164
02:05:17,491 --> 02:05:20,824
Cpl. Day, take the stand.

1165
02:05:21,662 --> 02:05:24,256
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

1166
02:05:24,432 --> 02:05:26,923
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1167
02:05:27,101 --> 02:05:28,591
I do.

1168
02:05:28,769 --> 02:05:30,669
You can sit.

1169
02:05:31,772 --> 02:05:33,831
Cpl. Day...

1170
02:05:35,109 --> 02:05:38,840
...tell the jury what you've seen
with your own eyes, corporal.

1171
02:05:39,013 --> 02:05:41,106
Yes, sir.

1172
02:05:41,348 --> 02:05:43,339
l...

1173
02:05:45,953 --> 02:05:50,322
Before I do, sir, may I ask
Sgt. Hopkins a question?

1174
02:05:51,459 --> 02:05:53,450
Certainly.

1175
02:05:53,794 --> 02:05:56,024
Sgt. Hopkins...

1176
02:05:58,132 --> 02:06:01,693
...did I understand you to say
that no law applies in here?

1177
02:06:01,869 --> 02:06:04,565
You did indeed, corporal.

1178
02:06:04,972 --> 02:06:09,739
And that is the very point.

1179
02:06:10,044 --> 02:06:14,208
There is no law here.

1180
02:06:14,381 --> 02:06:16,645
There is starvation...

1181
02:06:16,817 --> 02:06:22,380
...roasting heat, freezing cold.

1182
02:06:23,157 --> 02:06:28,094
There is disease, acts of barbarism...

1183
02:06:28,262 --> 02:06:32,995
...and cruelty on all sides.

1184
02:06:33,167 --> 02:06:35,397
But what law?

1185
02:06:36,670 --> 02:06:38,729
Rebel law!

1186
02:06:38,906 --> 02:06:45,175
We do not obey Rebel law!

1187
02:06:46,347 --> 02:06:49,077
The fact is...

1188
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:53,744
...there is no law here...

1189
02:06:53,921 --> 02:06:57,186
...for my clients to have broken!

1190
02:06:57,358 --> 02:06:59,383
You shyster!

1191
02:07:01,095 --> 02:07:03,757
There is law!

1192
02:07:04,498 --> 02:07:08,662
Therefore, they cannot be guilty!

1193
02:07:08,836 --> 02:07:11,031
You're wrong!

1194
02:07:15,809 --> 02:07:18,141
You're wrong! You're wrong!

1195
02:07:18,312 --> 02:07:20,439
Order! Order!

1196
02:07:21,782 --> 02:07:23,579
And I thank you, sir.

1197
02:07:24,118 --> 02:07:26,109
You are wise beyond your years.

1198
02:07:26,287 --> 02:07:28,778
Josie, what are you doing?

1199
02:07:28,956 --> 02:07:31,789
But that cannot be, sir.

1200
02:07:31,959 --> 02:07:34,450
- We live by laws here.
- The law of survival.

1201
02:07:34,628 --> 02:07:38,291
We do not stop belonging
to the Federal Army because we're here.

1202
02:07:38,465 --> 02:07:40,729
That's right!

1203
02:07:41,735 --> 02:07:44,067
We have our sergeants.

1204
02:07:44,238 --> 02:07:49,574
We maintain order and discipline
as best we can!

1205
02:07:50,077 --> 02:07:52,875
We stand in line to get
what little food they give us.

1206
02:07:53,047 --> 02:07:56,312
We don't steal or betray each other
to the Rebels.

1207
02:07:56,483 --> 02:08:02,251
I am saying that men can be excused...

1208
02:08:02,423 --> 02:08:08,828
...if they do extreme things,
necessary things...

1209
02:08:09,063 --> 02:08:12,328
...in order to stay alive
in a place like this!

1210
02:08:12,499 --> 02:08:18,597
What they did, they knew to be wrong,
every man knows to be wrong.

1211
02:08:18,772 --> 02:08:23,072
They are against every man's law and
understanding. None of us did those things!

1212
02:08:23,244 --> 02:08:28,147
They did them to live, corporal! To live!

1213
02:08:28,315 --> 02:08:30,943
All men want to live, sergeant!

1214
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:33,848
But there are some things
men won't do just to live!

1215
02:08:34,021 --> 02:08:36,649
What things?
That's what we must hear here.

1216
02:08:36,824 --> 02:08:39,292
What has been done here?

1217
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:43,123
- Murder was done here.
- Murder!

1218
02:08:45,299 --> 02:08:48,200
Tell them about Dick Potter.

1219
02:08:57,144 --> 02:08:59,203
Dick Potter...

1220
02:09:04,652 --> 02:09:09,214
Dick Potter and his father were the best
fishermen in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

1221
02:09:10,891 --> 02:09:15,225
He joined up the first summer of the war
because he wanted to...

1222
02:09:16,397 --> 02:09:19,332
...because he thought he ought to.

1223
02:09:21,735 --> 02:09:24,499
He was a good soldier...

1224
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,900
...and was shot in both legs
and captured...

1225
02:09:30,077 --> 02:09:32,875
...at Antietam and brought here.

1226
02:09:34,415 --> 02:09:36,440
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

1227
02:09:36,617 --> 02:09:38,414
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1228
02:09:38,585 --> 02:09:40,075
I do.

1229
02:09:40,254 --> 02:09:42,347
You can sit.

1230
02:09:44,091 --> 02:09:45,683
What's your rank, soldier?

1231
02:09:45,859 --> 02:09:47,156
Private.

1232
02:09:47,328 --> 02:09:49,523
All right, private, tell us what you saw.

1233
02:09:50,097 --> 02:09:53,032
I've seen each of these six men.

1234
02:09:54,034 --> 02:09:56,264
They've murdered.

1235
02:09:56,937 --> 02:09:59,269
They've robbed.

1236
02:10:02,376 --> 02:10:05,607
- Tell them what happened, corporal.
- Sergeant...

1237
02:10:05,779 --> 02:10:07,770
...it was the first day
the 184th...

1238
02:10:07,948 --> 02:10:09,973
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

1239
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:11,777
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1240
02:10:11,952 --> 02:10:13,214
Yes, sir. I do.

1241
02:10:13,387 --> 02:10:15,378
You can sit.

1242
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:19,782
You tell us what you saw, young man.

1243
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,791
Sir, I saw that man, Collins...

1244
02:10:21,962 --> 02:10:25,398
That's the one that killed
my brother Richard.

1245
02:10:27,134 --> 02:10:32,401
And that little sailor down there cost me
my leg the first week I was in here.

1246
02:10:32,573 --> 02:10:35,804
And the fellow in the green has killed
a lot of men in here.

1247
02:10:35,976 --> 02:10:39,571
They're all murderers.
Every one of them. Every one of them!

1248
02:11:03,771 --> 02:11:06,103
We've heard enough!

1249
02:11:08,108 --> 02:11:12,943
Those are guilty of thievery...

1250
02:11:13,113 --> 02:11:16,708
...and low, cowardly assault
on their fellows.

1251
02:11:16,884 --> 02:11:19,944
Give them the ball and chain
or make them run the gauntlet.

1252
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:23,180
Every man who wishes gets a shot
at them with his fists...

1253
02:11:23,357 --> 02:11:25,689
...sticks, anything you can find.

1254
02:11:25,859 --> 02:11:28,123
Yeah!

1255
02:11:31,265 --> 02:11:33,631
These six...

1256
02:11:34,134 --> 02:11:36,364
...hang them.

1257
02:12:18,178 --> 02:12:20,578
Prisoners...

1258
02:12:20,914 --> 02:12:24,680
...I return these men to you
as good as I got them.

1259
02:12:26,353 --> 02:12:30,847
You have tried them yourselves
and found them guilty.

1260
02:12:31,191 --> 02:12:34,592
I have had nothing to do with it.

1261
02:12:36,029 --> 02:12:39,192
Do with them as you like...

1262
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:43,796
...and may God have mercy
on you and on them.

1263
02:12:45,205 --> 02:12:49,767
Company, about face!

1264
02:12:51,211 --> 02:12:55,375
Forward march!

1265
02:13:15,402 --> 02:13:18,269
My God, you don't mean
to really hang us up there?

1266
02:13:19,139 --> 02:13:20,629
That's about the size of it.

1267
02:13:42,129 --> 02:13:47,328
No! I just want to live! I just want to live!

1268
02:13:49,269 --> 02:13:52,102
This is nothing.
Keep your peckers up, boys.

1269
02:13:52,272 --> 02:13:54,433
We'll have no weakness here.

1270
02:13:54,608 --> 02:13:57,270
What? Did you think
you were gonna live forever?

1271
02:13:59,846 --> 02:14:01,746
No, don't do it!

1272
02:14:01,915 --> 02:14:06,352
Devils! Devils!

1273
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:23,631
I'm gonna go up! I wanna hang them!
Let me hang...

1274
02:14:30,978 --> 02:14:33,469
This is nothing, boys.

1275
02:14:33,647 --> 02:14:36,377
Doesn't matter a damn.

1276
02:14:36,550 --> 02:14:37,983
Doesn't matter at all.

1277
02:14:44,725 --> 02:14:49,219
Let's get this done right, Jim.

1278
02:14:50,230 --> 02:14:52,391
Don't you worry about that.

1279
02:15:20,193 --> 02:15:24,289
Hang them! Hang them! Hang them!
Hang them! Hang them! Hang them!

1280
02:15:27,234 --> 02:15:29,259
Hang them! Hang them! Hang them!

1281
02:15:29,436 --> 02:15:31,427
Hang them! Hang them! Hang them!

1282
02:15:35,709 --> 02:15:37,199
Okay, boys, on three.

1283
02:15:40,414 --> 02:15:41,403
One!

1284
02:15:43,216 --> 02:15:44,240
Two!

1285
02:15:45,886 --> 02:15:47,080
Three!

1286
02:16:33,333 --> 02:16:37,099
Fresh fish, lots of them.

1287
02:16:37,337 --> 02:16:40,670
Uncle Billy's army must be close.

1288
02:16:41,508 --> 02:16:43,601
Could be rescued soon.

1289
02:16:43,777 --> 02:16:48,180
No, Rebs gotta keep ferrying new boys in,
keep the population up.

1290
02:16:49,116 --> 02:16:54,452
Martin, drink some of this.
It's rainwater. It's good for you.

1291
02:17:08,301 --> 02:17:13,364
Scurvy. Gums all rotten.

1292
02:17:13,807 --> 02:17:16,537
Can't even eat the mush anymore.

1293
02:17:24,384 --> 02:17:27,547
I miss Thomas. Don't you?

1294
02:17:30,724 --> 02:17:34,160
Sergeant and I were just talking
about him this morning.

1295
02:17:34,327 --> 02:17:36,022
You know him before the army?

1296
02:17:36,196 --> 02:17:39,825
He didn't live but 10 miles from me, but...

1297
02:17:42,569 --> 02:17:48,007
You know, the sergeant was saying, for...
For a man so strong...

1298
02:17:48,175 --> 02:17:51,508
...he never once saw him use
his strength in anger.

1299
02:17:52,012 --> 02:17:54,378
Except to get my banjo back.

1300
02:18:01,688 --> 02:18:02,780
Old Sweet.

1301
02:18:05,592 --> 02:18:10,359
You know, he lived on a farm
with his brothers and sisters.

1302
02:18:11,031 --> 02:18:13,022
He had a big family.

1303
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,031
I have six children.

1304
02:18:15,202 --> 02:18:16,430
Six?

1305
02:18:16,603 --> 02:18:20,095
Had eight. Two died.

1306
02:18:26,713 --> 02:18:31,207
All right, let's see. She'll...

1307
02:18:31,451 --> 02:18:36,388
She starts us out with...
With some nice, plump chickens...

1308
02:18:36,556 --> 02:18:38,786
...from our own stock.

1309
02:18:39,459 --> 02:18:44,226
We breed them ourselves,
Rhode Island Reds.

1310
02:18:44,397 --> 02:18:47,628
- It's the tenderest meat you ever ate.
- Yeah?

1311
02:18:47,801 --> 02:18:53,467
She fries them, and we'll have them
with mashed potatoes and gravy.

1312
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:55,471
- Mashed potatoes?
- Yeah!

1313
02:18:55,642 --> 02:18:57,872
I like my mashed potatoes with butter.

1314
02:18:58,044 --> 02:18:59,033
Yeah.

1315
02:18:59,212 --> 02:19:01,544
You know, we make butter
in our springhouse.

1316
02:19:01,715 --> 02:19:03,615
You never had butter like we churn.

1317
02:19:03,783 --> 02:19:06,479
Sounds good. You bring the butter.

1318
02:19:06,653 --> 02:19:08,416
All right.

1319
02:19:08,588 --> 02:19:10,579
We could put it on the biscuits.

1320
02:19:10,757 --> 02:19:14,488
My mother, she makes
the best biscuits in the world.

1321
02:19:14,661 --> 02:19:17,824
Okay, you just open them up,
just lift the top right off.

1322
02:19:17,998 --> 02:19:21,695
Oh, my! You got any honey?

1323
02:19:22,602 --> 02:19:24,661
Yeah, of course we got honey.

1324
02:19:24,838 --> 02:19:27,830
All right, we'll have some honey, then.

1325
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:33,344
What'll we have next?

1326
02:19:34,948 --> 02:19:37,007
Pie.

1327
02:19:37,517 --> 02:19:39,109
Apple?

1328
02:19:39,286 --> 02:19:40,776
Apple.

1329
02:19:40,954 --> 02:19:42,945
Or cherry.

1330
02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:44,857
Apple and cherry.

1331
02:19:45,025 --> 02:19:50,520
Save me the leftovers. Good God, men,
you wanna drive us to the lunatic asylum?

1332
02:19:50,697 --> 02:19:54,189
Stuff a sock in it. Hey, friend!

1333
02:19:54,801 --> 02:19:58,828
What's the news, lads? Where were you,
and who were you with?

1334
02:20:00,807 --> 02:20:04,971
- We was with Uncle Billy Sherman.
- Grant in Virginia, all over Virginia.

1335
02:20:05,145 --> 02:20:07,204
Making it warm for old Johnny Reb?

1336
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:12,283
Warm? Warm? Let Atlanta burn
to the ground. That warm enough for you?

1337
02:20:12,452 --> 02:20:15,319
We're headed to Savannah,
and we'll give them the same.

1338
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:16,477
Yeah.

1339
02:20:16,656 --> 02:20:18,715
So this is Andersonville, huh?

1340
02:20:18,892 --> 02:20:20,325
Yeah, this is it.

1341
02:20:20,493 --> 02:20:21,983
Is it as bad as they say?

1342
02:20:22,162 --> 02:20:25,563
No, worse.

1343
02:20:25,732 --> 02:20:28,701
You boys want to stay with us?

1344
02:20:29,336 --> 02:20:31,429
- All right with you?
- Don't see why not.

1345
02:20:31,671 --> 02:20:35,698
Come on over here, lads. Come with us.

1346
02:20:36,176 --> 02:20:38,838
You boys hear anything
about the exchange?

1347
02:20:39,012 --> 02:20:41,913
There won't be any exchange,
and that's a fact.

1348
02:20:42,082 --> 02:20:43,344
You seem pretty sure.

1349
02:20:43,516 --> 02:20:46,883
I was at Sherman's headquarters
the day Grant issued the policy.

1350
02:20:47,354 --> 02:20:49,515
- What policy?
- Haven't heard about that.

1351
02:20:49,689 --> 02:20:53,250
We've been out of touch for a while.
What policy is that exactly?

1352
02:20:53,426 --> 02:20:56,918
Any Reb soldiers he lets go,
they just bust their paroles...

1353
02:20:57,097 --> 02:20:59,691
...and back on the line fighting us
the next week.

1354
02:20:59,866 --> 02:21:03,131
He's not gonna do it.
Says his only job's to win the war.

1355
02:21:03,436 --> 02:21:06,769
Rebs are saying they won't give back
our colored soldiers.

1356
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:11,377
Grant says they're a part of us,
and without them, no deal.

1357
02:21:11,544 --> 02:21:15,571
The niggers?
We're supposed to die here for niggers?

1358
02:21:16,616 --> 02:21:20,108
- Good for Ulysses S. Grant.
- Does he know what it's like in here?

1359
02:21:20,286 --> 02:21:22,948
He does for a fact.
Somebody got out and told him.

1360
02:21:23,123 --> 02:21:24,488
- Got out?
- Who got out?

1361
02:21:24,657 --> 02:21:27,649
I don't remember his name exactly.
Any of you remember?

1362
02:21:28,395 --> 02:21:30,226
You know what he looked like?

1363
02:21:30,563 --> 02:21:32,326
Sort of tall, thin.

1364
02:21:33,566 --> 02:21:36,228
The hair had some yellow in it.
He's older than me.

1365
02:21:36,403 --> 02:21:38,303
Could his name have been Gleason?

1366
02:21:38,471 --> 02:21:41,406
That's it! John Gleason.

1367
02:21:59,759 --> 02:22:02,159
We're gonna die in here, Josie.

1368
02:22:04,097 --> 02:22:06,998
Just because there's no exchange...

1369
02:22:08,935 --> 02:22:14,771
You heard how the army's doing.
First Atlanta, Savannah.

1370
02:22:15,608 --> 02:22:18,941
Maybe we'll... We'll be rescued.

1371
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:25,775
Savannah's toward the sea,
and we're inland.

1372
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:29,352
The army's headed the other way.

1373
02:22:36,129 --> 02:22:39,792
Would you write a letter
to my wife and children?

1374
02:22:46,306 --> 02:22:49,173
- Martin.
- She'd probably want that.

1375
02:22:51,811 --> 02:22:56,145
Oh, you put a toe tag on me, now.

1376
02:22:56,316 --> 02:22:58,978
You go to the dead house
without a toe tag...

1377
02:22:59,152 --> 02:23:02,121
...and they'll never know
where you're buried.

1378
02:23:02,288 --> 02:23:06,657
Martin? Martin, did you hear?
Did you hear? Josie, did you hear?

1379
02:23:06,826 --> 02:23:09,454
John made it. He made it, Martin.

1380
02:23:09,629 --> 02:23:13,827
He got to Sherman. He said he would.
Damn if he didn't do it! Oh, Gleason.

1381
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,490
Goddamn if he didn't!

1382
02:23:15,668 --> 02:23:19,764
Well, then, hand me the banjo there.
I'll play some dancing music.

1383
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:24,503
- Play something happy, Martin.
- Josie.

1384
02:26:05,838 --> 02:26:07,567
You Yankees!

1385
02:26:08,241 --> 02:26:11,176
Yankees, you listen up now!

1386
02:26:11,344 --> 02:26:14,245
Colonel's got something
real important to tell y'all!

1387
02:26:14,414 --> 02:26:19,511
So you sergeants, you bring them
down here on the double-quick now.

1388
02:26:20,687 --> 02:26:23,850
Come on. Come on, get up.

1389
02:26:24,424 --> 02:26:27,257
Come on. Come on, Billy.

1390
02:26:27,427 --> 02:26:28,416
Get up there.

1391
02:26:28,594 --> 02:26:30,084
Let's go.

1392
02:27:22,648 --> 02:27:24,741
The colonel...

1393
02:27:25,485 --> 02:27:31,082
...comes with an important message
for all of you.

1394
02:27:31,424 --> 02:27:35,485
Col. O'Neil.

1395
02:27:38,431 --> 02:27:43,596
You men, you prisoners...

1396
02:27:43,936 --> 02:27:48,669
...I want to talk to you about
your situation here.

1397
02:27:49,275 --> 02:27:54,110
It must be clear to you by now
that your government...

1398
02:27:54,280 --> 02:27:57,181
...has cruelly abandoned you.

1399
02:27:58,518 --> 02:28:01,851
As you know, they have turned down...

1400
02:28:02,021 --> 02:28:05,354
...all of our efforts to exchange you.

1401
02:28:05,525 --> 02:28:08,619
They know of your suffering...

1402
02:28:08,795 --> 02:28:14,665
...which though terrible, is no worse than
the suffering of our men in Northern prisons.

1403
02:28:14,967 --> 02:28:19,370
And they know, as we all do...

1404
02:28:19,705 --> 02:28:23,038
...that you have had to endure far more...

1405
02:28:23,643 --> 02:28:26,976
...than should be expected of you.

1406
02:28:27,146 --> 02:28:33,244
And now that your government
has no further use of you...

1407
02:28:33,419 --> 02:28:38,857
...you are being thrown aside
to starve and die.

1408
02:28:40,159 --> 02:28:41,751
That being so...

1409
02:28:42,662 --> 02:28:47,827
...and with the Southern Confederacy
certain to succeed...

1410
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,027
...and achieve its independence
in just a few more months...

1411
02:28:52,672 --> 02:28:55,664
...I make you all this offer.

1412
02:28:55,842 --> 02:29:01,781
If you will join our army
and serve it faithfully to the end...

1413
02:29:02,915 --> 02:29:05,941
...you will receive all the rewards...

1414
02:29:06,252 --> 02:29:09,585
...that the rest of our soldiers do.

1415
02:29:10,256 --> 02:29:14,192
You'll be taken out of this place
at once, today...

1416
02:29:15,528 --> 02:29:17,553
...this very minute.

1417
02:29:18,264 --> 02:29:21,597
You'll be clothed and fed.

1418
02:29:21,767 --> 02:29:25,396
You'll receive a nice cash bounty.

1419
02:29:26,272 --> 02:29:28,399
And at the conclusion of the war...

1420
02:29:29,709 --> 02:29:33,372
...you will have your very own farm.

1421
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:38,449
That is our offer, men.
What is your answer?

1422
02:30:01,574 --> 02:30:03,769
Colonel, sir.

1423
02:30:05,311 --> 02:30:11,181
Sgt. James Dudley McSpadden,
19th Massachusetts Volunteers, sir!

1424
02:30:12,418 --> 02:30:17,253
I have the honor to speak
for my detachment, sir!

1425
02:30:17,423 --> 02:30:21,917
First Detachment, form ranks!

1426
02:30:31,604 --> 02:30:34,334
Attention detachment!

1427
02:30:37,076 --> 02:30:40,944
About face!

1428
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:44,115
Forward march!

1429
02:30:44,283 --> 02:30:46,843
Right, two. Right, two.

1430
02:30:47,019 --> 02:30:49,487
Three cheers for Sgt. McSpadden!
Hip, hip!

1431
02:30:49,655 --> 02:30:51,122
Hurrah!

1432
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:53,019
- Hip, hip!
- Hurrah!

1433
02:30:53,192 --> 02:30:54,682
- Hip, hip!
- Hurrah!

1434
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:59,820
March! Right, two.

1435
02:30:59,999 --> 02:31:02,524
Second Detachment, form ranks!

1436
02:31:02,702 --> 02:31:05,296
Fifty-fourth Massachusetts, form ranks!

1437
02:31:05,471 --> 02:31:08,269
Seventh Detachment, form...

1438
02:31:08,441 --> 02:31:11,239
- Form ranks!
- Forward!

1439
02:31:11,410 --> 02:31:17,371
Forward march! Right, two. Right, two.

1440
02:31:17,550 --> 02:31:21,680
Attention, detachment! Forward face!

1441
02:31:21,854 --> 02:31:23,549
March!

1442
02:33:05,257 --> 02:33:08,988
Hey, hey, hey! Get away from him,
you lousy rag picker.

1443
02:34:02,148 --> 02:34:05,982
- that the winged seraphs of heaven...

1444
02:34:06,819 --> 02:34:11,483
...coveted thee.

1445
02:34:18,497 --> 02:34:20,829
Easy, son.

1446
02:34:40,452 --> 02:34:42,682
Got the fever.

1447
02:35:12,785 --> 02:35:15,310
So gather around.

1448
02:35:15,888 --> 02:35:18,118
Rise up, you Yankees!

1449
02:35:18,290 --> 02:35:21,259
Y'all are weak, naked demons
for sitting too long!

1450
02:35:21,427 --> 02:35:22,894
Move on up, now!
Move on up!

1451
02:35:23,062 --> 02:35:27,658
Everybody, please gather around.

1452
02:35:28,234 --> 02:35:34,070
I have some good news for you!
It will make you very happy.

1453
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:37,141
Go on, now, and listen
to what the captain has to say!

1454
02:35:37,309 --> 02:35:39,402
- Gather around.
- Move on up, now!

1455
02:35:39,578 --> 02:35:42,138
- Move on up.
- Gather around.

1456
02:35:42,748 --> 02:35:47,947
You are being exchanged, starting today.

1457
02:35:48,387 --> 02:35:54,792
Every one of you, starting right now,
this morning.

1458
02:35:55,261 --> 02:36:00,961
You see, all this time, I was right.

1459
02:36:01,133 --> 02:36:05,001
I was right, and you didn't believe me.

1460
02:36:05,604 --> 02:36:11,133
Go tell the rest! Everyone is exchanged!

1461
02:36:15,414 --> 02:36:19,612
The train leaves in two hours.

1462
02:36:20,185 --> 02:36:23,052
The gate is open!

1463
02:36:24,690 --> 02:36:28,956
The gate is open!

1464
02:36:37,036 --> 02:36:38,401
We're exchanged.

1465
02:36:46,211 --> 02:36:47,974
- Martin?
- Patrick.

1466
02:36:48,147 --> 02:36:51,480
Patrick, come on. Come on.

1467
02:36:51,650 --> 02:36:53,083
We can leave.

1468
02:36:53,452 --> 02:36:55,545
Billy.

1469
02:37:16,175 --> 02:37:19,576
Come on. Come on, lad, get up.
